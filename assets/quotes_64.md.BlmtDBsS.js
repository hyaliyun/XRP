The site to be built on starts from William Jolly Bridge and stretches to Goodwill Bridge at Gardens Point. There was minimal public support for the proposal. Project plan The proposed Multiplex design for North Bank (opposite Southbank) contained eight skyscrapers for office space and residential use, with the highest building being 46 stories. It also contained a pedestrian bridge, 'open spaces', riverfront promenade and an olympic-sized public swimming pool. The proposal entailed the government allowing Multiplex to build out as far as 90 metres into the Brisbane River. Opposition to the proposal There was minimal support outside of government and Multiplex offices for this development, and opposition has come from the public as well as Queensland's peak body of town planners, a major group of architects, and an award-winning University of Queensland Associate Professor Peter Skinner. Despite its initial approval by the Bligh Labor government there is currently much debate regarding the value of the project, given the extensive ecological, visual, physical and infrastructure consequence involved in building so far out over the river. There was much opposition to the proposal, with most parties concerned about the architectural, historical and ecological legacy of the development. The Brisbane City Council and the Queensland State Government are not the developers of the site, but are vested interested parties as North Bank is a private developer's proposal. There was a very limited and under-publicised public consultation period undertaken after the project was first announced. The National Trust Queensland has condemned the proposal as an inappropriate use of an historic precinct. Federal Environment Minister Peter Garret also spoke out against the project. The Sunday Mail on 20 October 2010 reported that commercial elements of the North Bank development had been scrapped and a much simpler project will go forward that improves public access for pedestrians and cyclists under the existing riverside expressway. On 30 May 2012, the new Queensland Premier Campbell Newman announced plans for a slightly downsized Northbank with some government offices and a boardwalk.

The ancient parish was part of Hundred of Brixton and County of Surrey. In 1855, it was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW). The act, establishing the MBW, also incorporated a new elected local authority for the parish known as The Vestry of the Parish of Bermondsey in the County of Surrey.18 & 19 Vict. c.120, S.42 The population of the parish in 1896 was 84,632, and it had adopted the Public Libraries Act 1850 in 1887. For electoral purposes, the parish was divided into four wards and had 120 elected vestrymen. In 1889, the area of the Metropolitan Board was reconstituted as the County of London, and Bermondsey was transferred to the new county. In 1900, the County of London was divided into twenty-eight metropolitan boroughs. The parish became the core part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey, which also covered the parish of Rotherhithe, and the area of the St Olave's District Board of Works (consisting of the two parishes of Southwark St John Horsleydown and Southwark St Olave and St Thomas). A borough council replaced the vestries and board, and in 1904, all four parishes in the borough were merged as the single civil parish of Bermondsey.F A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume I: Southern England, London, 1978  Ecclesiastical parish  The ancient parish, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene and centred on the church of St Mary Magdalen Bermondsey, was in the Diocese of Winchester until 1877, then the Diocese of Rochester until 1905, and then finally in the Diocese of Southwark.

It is the administrative seat of Gmina Lubniewice. History=Middle Ages The area formed part of Poland since the establishment of the state in the 10th century. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it became part of the Greater Poland province. The first mentioning of the fortress Lubnewiz (Old Polish version of the town's name) dates back to the Greater Polish duke, and future King of Poland, Przemys≈Ç II in 1287. Later on it was annexed by the Margraviate of Brandenburg. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the town came under Polish control again, as part of the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w. Duke Henry IV the Faithful visited the town in 1322.Edward Rymar, Rywalizacja o ziemiƒô lubuskƒÖ i kasztelaniƒô miƒôdzyrzeckƒÖ, \\"≈ölƒÖski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sob√≥tka\\", No. 4/1979, p. 489 (in Polish) A 1322 deed referred to a nearby settlement of German colonists named K√∂nigswalde, established in the course of the Ostsiedlung at the behest of the Brandenburgian margraves. Soon the town fell to Brandenburg again. It was located close to the Imperial border with the Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship of the Polish Crown in the east. In 1352 the Wittelsbach elector Louis II of Brandenburg enfeoffed his ministeriales of the Waldow noble family with the K√∂nigswalde estates. Between 1373 and 1415 it was under Bohemian (Czech) suzerainty. Modern era Lubniewice as K√∂nigswalde about 1900 From the late 17th century onwards the population increased by the immigration of Polish Brethren and Protestants from Silesia. In 1706 Samuel Crell-Spinowski became minister at the parish church. In the 18th century, clothmaking developed. Poles resisted Germanisation attempts, carried out by the Prussian authorities. After the discovery of the alum deposits in 1751, a mine was established here, which was plundered and destroyed by the Russian army in 1758 during the Seven Years' War. K√∂nigswalde received town privileges in 1808 and was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Brandenburg in 1815. From 1871 to 1945 the town was part of Germany. Despite Germanisation policies, in the late 19th century Poles still settled in the town. After World War II and the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line, the town became part of the Republic of Poland and the German population was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. The historic Polish name Lubniewice was restored. Notable people *Eduard Petzold (1815‚Äì1891), landscape gardener Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities See twin towns of Gmina Lubniewice.

(b. at Catania, Sicily, in 1386; d. at Palermo, 24 February 1445) was an Italian Benedictine canonist. Life In 1400 he entered the Order of St. Benedict; he was sent (1405-6) to the University of Bologna to study under Zabarella; in 1411 he became a doctor of canon law, and taught successively at Parma (1412‚Äì18), Siena (1419‚Äì30), and Bologna (1431‚Äì32). Meanwhile, in 1425, he was made abbot of the monastery of Maniace, near Messina, whence his name \\"Abbas\\", to which has been added \\"modernus\\" or \\"recentior\\" (in order to distinguish him from \\"Abbas antiquus\\", a thirteenth- century canonist who died about 1288); he is also known as \\"Abbas Siculus\\" on account of his Sicilian origin. In 1433 he went to Rome where he exercised the functions of auditor of the Rota and Apostolic referendary. The following year he relinquished these offices and placed himself at the service of Alfonso V of Aragon, King of Sicily, obtaining the See of Palermo, whence his Latin name \\"Panormitanus\\" (Palermo in Latin is Panormus). He was confirmed by Pope Eugene IV on 9 March 1435 and consecrated bishop on 4 July.Catholic-hierarchy.org: \\"Archbishop Niccol√≤ Tedeschi\\" retrieved February 11, 2020 During the troubles that marred the pontificate of Eugene IV, Nicol√≤ at first followed the party of this pontiff, whom he represented briefly at the Council of Basel; but subsequently he allied himself with the antipope Felix V who, in 1440, named him cardinal. Pius II, in an early work, depicts Panormitanus as lamenting that instructions from Alfonso made him oppose quick action to depose Eugene. Panormitanus represented the Council of Basel at imperial diets that discussed the fight between Eugene and the council. Works Disceptationes et allegationes, 1487 In his \\"Tractatus de concilio Basileensi\\" he upheld the doctrine of the superiority of a general council to the pope. This was written for the 1442 Diet of Frankfurt, at which he was opposed by Nicholas of Cusa. It was his canonical works, especially his \\"Lectura in Decretales\\" \\"In Sextum\\", and \\"In Clementinas\\", that won him the title of \\"lucerna juris\\" (lamp of the law) and insured him great authority; he also wrote \\"Consilia\\", \\"Quaestiones\\", \\"Repetitiones\\", \\"Disputationes, disceptationes et allegationes\\", and \\"Flores utriusque juris\\". A fine edition of his works appeared at Venice in 1477; among later, frequent editions, that published in 1617-18 (Venice) in 10 folio volumes is especially notable. There also is a Lyon 1521-1522 edition of the Decretals commentary.

Hamm, M.D. (May 31, 1776, in Kent Co., near Dover, Delaware - March 22, 1864, in Zanesville, Muskingum Co., Ohio) was an American US Army colonel, doctor and politician, diplomat, industrialist, and Marshall of the State of Ohio during the War of 1812. Early life His father and grandfather were both members of the Kent Co. Delaware Committee of Observation and Inspection during the American Revolution. He moved to Ohio in 1808, at the end of the 10 years required for his administration of his father's estate. Medical and military career John Hamm earned his medical degree from Medical College of Philadelphia (which, after being know under various names, eventually became part of the University of Pennsylvania). He went on to practice medicine in both Dover Delaware and Philadelphia. During the War of 1812, he held the rank of colonel and was in charge of the hospital that treated the wounded from the Battle of Lake Erie. He was in charge of the Army Hospital at Detroit. In 1813, he was appointed Regular Surgeon of 27th Regiment US Infantry under General William Henry Harrison. He was also at the Battle of the Thames. He practiced and taught medicine in Zanesville, Ohio and Chillicothe, Ohio, and operated a pharmacy in Zanesville. When the state capital was Zanesville, he became a member of the first Board for the Examination of Physicians and Surgeons in the State of Ohio. Democratic or Democratic-Republican politician Both his father (John Hamm Sr.), who was a political adherent of Caesar Rodney, and his maternal grandfather Immanuel Stout were involved in politics and government. His uncle Jacob Stout was a one-term governor of Delaware. He first became involved in Ohio politics when the state capital was at Chillicothe, and moved with it when the capital changed to Zanesville, then moved back to Chillicothe when the state capital returned there. In October 1812, he was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives. In 1815, he was the mayor of Zanesville. He was a member of the Ohio Senate from October 1827 until May 1831, when he resigned to become US Charg√© d'affaires to Chile. In 1836, he was the Jeffersonian candidate for Congress from the Zanesville area. He appears to have been a member of the Van Horne faction of the Democratic- Republican Party. He later was head of his own faction in Ohio politics. His grandson Peter Graham \\"Bud\\" Black was the head of a faction of the Ohio Republican Party until 1948. Marshall of Ohio Following his service in the War of 1812 (while the conflict was still ongoing), he was appointed Marshall of Ohio on December 30, 1813, under President Madison. His first task was to march the prisoners taken during the Battle of Lake Erie to Camp Bull (near Chillicothe, Ohio). As part of this job he was in charge of the taking of the US 1820 Census in Ohio. He served as Marshall of Ohio for eight years. Diplomatic career He was appointed Minister to Chile under President Andrew Jackson. He negotiated the first US trade treaty with Chile, under which the US representative to that country was elevated to the rank of ambassador. Pioneer Ohio industrialist In 1815, he and his father-in-law, General Isaac Van Horne, founded the White Glass Company of Zanesville, Ohio. This type of company was notoriously difficult to maintain as an enterprise, but White Glass Company survived well into (and in some form well beyond) the 1820s through several owners and under several names. The White Glass Company is perhaps best known for producing (now highly collectible) bottles. Sources *Y Bridge City \\"The Story of Zanesville and Muskingum County, Ohio\\". Norris F.

Czerwie≈Ñsk is a railroad junction, where the Wroc≈Çaw ‚Äì Zielona G√≥ra ‚Äì Szczecin connection meets the line to Pozna≈Ñ. History In the Middle Ages the area was settled by Slavs. It formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century and after the fragmentation of Poland it was part of various duchies ruled by the Polish Piast dynasty, the last being the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w until 1476. By 1538 the area was part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Until 1476 it was part of the historic region of Silesia. Around 1550 the von Rothenburg family from Nettkowe (Nietk√≥w) built a small hunting manor some 5 kilometres from their ancestral home.* Soon a small village arose around the manor, known as Neu Netkau - \\"New Netkau\\". The settlement was part of the region of Brandenburg's Neumark region and lay directly at the border with Silesia. While conveniently located at the crossing of important trading routes, the village's growth was halted by the devastating Thirty Years' War. In 1654 a Lutheran church was built there. It served both local residents and the Protestant inhabitants of the nearby city of Zielona G√≥ra, then part of the Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom ruled by the Roman Catholic House of Habsburg. The first priest of the new church was Christoph Reiche. On 24 January 1690 a new town of Rothenburg an der Oder (\\"Rothenburg on the Oder\\") was started right next to the village of Neu Netkau. The town received town rights from Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg and grew rapidly in the 17th century, thanks to numerous draper shops founded there, mostly by Protestant refugees from Silesia. In 1701 the town, as part of Brandenburg-Prussia, became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1707 priest Johannes Reiche, the descendant of Christoph Reiche, started the construction of a new, larger church. In 1736 Alexander Rudolf von Rothenburg was knighted by king Frederick William I of Prussia and received the title of a Count. His son, Friedrich Rudolf von Rothenburg, was among the closest friends of King Frederick the Great. In 1788 the town was bought by Peter von Biron, the last Duke of Courland, a vassal state of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, who owned also the nearby town of ≈ªaga≈Ñ. The town became the dowry of his daughter Pauline, who married into the Swabian line of the Hohenzollerns. The family retained control of large parts of the town and its surrounding even after the abolition of feudal ownership in Prussia. In 1811 the first city plan was prepared. The 1816 administration reform of Prussia officially detached the town from the Province of Brandenburg and attached it to the Province of Silesia, reuniting it with Silesia after 340 years. In mid-19th century another Protestant church was built not far from the city square by a Protestant dissenter Martin Gottfried Julius Sch√∂ne. In 1870 the town was connected to the Guben-ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ railway and a train station was constructed. From 1871 to 1945 the town was part of Germany. In 1877 the old Protestant church was demolished and replaced with a new one, built in then-popular Gothic Revival style. In 1900 the town had 632 inhabitants. By 1908 the village of \\"Polnisch Nettkow\\" was incorporated into Rothenburg. The number of inhabitants grew and by 1933 reached 1430 people. The city survived World War II relatively undamaged, but the manor was destroyed by the Red Army. In 1945, in the aftermath of the war, the town was granted to Poland in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. The German population of the area was expelled and the town was repopulated with Poles, mainly railwaymen from Greater Poland, refugees from eastern Polish areas annexed by the USSR (notably from Tarnopol and Monasterzyska), and repatriates from the Soviet Union. Renamed initially to Rozborg and then to its modern name, the town was stripped of the city rights, which it received again in 1969. In 1949 a public library was founded in Czerwie≈Ñsk. Currently the population of Czerwie≈Ñsk exceeds 4100 inhabitants.

The giant trevally is distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, with a range stretching from South Africa in the west to Hawaii in the east, including Japan in the north and Australia in the south. Two were documented in the eastern tropical Pacific in the 2010s (one captured off Panama and another sighted at the Gal√°pagos), but it remains to be seen if the species will become established there. The giant trevally is distinguished by its steep head profile, strong tail scutes, and a variety of other more detailed anatomical features. It is normally a silvery colour with occasional dark spots, but males may be black once they mature. It is the largest fish in the genus Caranx, growing to a maximum known size of 170 cm (67 in) and a weight of 80 kg (176 lbs). The giant trevally inhabits a wide range of marine environments, from estuaries, shallow bays and lagoons as a juvenile to deeper reefs, offshore atolls and large embayments as an adult. Juveniles of the species are known to live in waters of very low salinity such as coastal lakes and upper reaches of rivers, and tend to prefer turbid waters. The giant trevally is an apex predator in most of its habitats, and is known to hunt individually and in schools. The species predominantly takes various fish as prey, although crustaceans, cephalopods and molluscs make up a considerable part of their diets in some regions. The giant trevally employs novel hunting strategies, including shadowing monk seals to pick off escaping prey, as well as using sharks to ambush prey. Footage released in 2017 on Blue Planet II revealed a group of approximately 50 giant trevally hunting terns, specifically fledglings still learning to fly and which crash land in the water, as well as both fledglings and adults unfortunate enough to fly low enough for the fish to pounce on them, in Farquhar Atoll in the Seychelles. The giant trevally reproduces in the warmer months, with peaks differing by region. Spawning occurs at specific stages of the lunar cycle, when large schools congregate to spawn over reefs and bays, with reproductive behaviour observed in the wild. The fish grows relatively fast, reaching sexual maturity at a length of around 60 cm at three years of age. The giant trevally is both an important species to commercial fisheries and a recognised gamefish, with the species taken by nets and lines by professionals and by bait and lures by anglers. Catch statistics in the Asian region show hauls of 4,000‚Äì10,000 tonnes, while around 10,000 lbs of the species is taken in Hawaii each year. The species is considered poor to excellent table fare by different authors, although ciguatera poisoning is common from eating the fish. Dwindling numbers around the main Hawaiian Islands have also led to several proposals to reduce the catch of fish in this region. Taxonomy and phylogeny The giant trevally is classified within the genus Caranx, one of a number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies. Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, which in turn is part of the order Carangiformes. The giant trevally was first scientifically described by the Swedish naturalist Peter Forssk√•l in 1775 based on specimens taken from the Red Sea off both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, with one of these designated to be the holotype. He named the species Scomber ignobilis, with the specific epithet Latin for \\"unknown\\", \\"obscure\\" or \\"ignoble\\". It was assigned to the mackerel genus Scomber, where many carangids were placed before they were classified as a separate family. This later revision in classification saw the species moved to the genus Caranx, where it has remained. Even after its initial description, the giant trevally (and the bigeye trevally) were often confused with the Atlantic crevalle jack, Caranx hippos, due to their superficial similarity, which led to some authors claiming the crevalle jack had a circumtropical distribution. After Forssk√•l's initial description and naming, the species was independently renamed three times as Caranx lessonii, Caranx ekala and Carangus hippoides, all of which are now considered invalid junior synonyms. The latter of these names once again highlighted the similarity with the crevalle jack, with the epithet hippoides essentially meaning \\"like Carangus hippos\\", which was the crevalle jack's Latin name at that time. Despite the resemblance with the crevalle jack, the two species have never been phylogenetically compared, either morphologically or genetically, to determine their relationship. C. ignobilis is most commonly referred to as the giant trevally (or giant kingfish) due to its large maximum size, with this often abbreviated to simply GT by many anglers. Other names occasionally used include lowly trevally, barrier trevally, yellowfin jack (not to be confused with Hemicaranx leucurus), Forssk√•l's Indo-Pacific jack fish and Goyan fish. In Hawaii, the species is almost exclusively referred to as ulua, often in conjunction with the prefixes black, white, or giant. Due to its wide distribution, many other names for the species in different languages are also used. In the Philippines, the species is referred to as talakitok. Some success has been achieved in raising giant trevally commercially in small fish farms there, typically to an age of seven months. Description Profile of an adult giant trevallyThe giant trevally is the largest member of the genus Caranx, and the fifth-largest member of the family Carangidae (exceeded by the yellowtail amberjack, greater amberjack, leerfish and rainbow runner), with a recorded maximum length of 170 cm and a weight of 80 kg. Specimens this size are very rare, with the species only occasionally seen at lengths greater than 80 cm. It appears the Hawaiian Islands contain the largest fish, where individuals over 100 lbs are common. Elsewhere in the world, only three individuals over 100 lbs have been reported to the IGFA. The giant trevally is similar in shape to a number of other large jacks and trevallies, having an ovate, moderately compressed body with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of eight spines and the second of one spine followed by 18 to 21 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorly detached spines followed by one spine and 15 to 17 soft rays. The pelvic fins contain 1 spine and 19 to 21 soft rays. The caudal fin is strongly forked, and the pectoral fins are falcate, being longer than the length of the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the lobe of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains 58-64 scales, while the straight section contains none to four scales and 26 to 38 very strong scutes. The chest is devoid of scales with the exception of a small patch of scales in front of the pelvic fins. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of conical teeth. The species has 20 to 24 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae are present. The eye is covered by a moderately well-developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under or just past the posterior margin of the pupil. The eye of the giant trevally has a horizontal streak in which ganglion and photoreceptor cell densities are markedly greater than the rest of the eye. This is believed to allow the fish to gain a panoramic view of its surroundings, removing the need to constantly move the eye, which in turn will allow easier of detection of prey or predators in that field of view. At sizes less than 50 cm, the giant trevally is a silvery-grey fish, with the head and upper body slightly darker in both sexes. Fish greater than 50 cm show sexual dimorphism in their colouration, with males having dusky to jet-black bodies, while females are a much lighter coloured silvery-grey. Individuals with darker dorsal colouration often also display striking silvery striations and markings on the upper part of their bodies, particularly their backs. Black dots of a few millimetres in diameter may also be found scattered all over the body, although the coverage of these dots varies between widespread to none at all. All the fins are generally light grey to black, although fish taken from turbid waters often have yellowish fins, with the anal fin being the brightest. The leading edges and tips of the anal and dorsal fins are generally lighter in colour than the main part of the fins. There is no black spot on the operculum. Traces of broad cross-bands on the fish's sides are occasionally seen after death. The fishes have been known to prey and eat on the dead fish. Distribution A mature male giant trevally showing the black colouration common in these older fish The giant trevally is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Bay of Bengal, Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging along the coasts of three continents and many hundreds of smaller islands and archipelagos. In the Indian Ocean, the species' westernmost range is the coast of continental Africa, being distributed from the southern tip of South Africa north along the east African coastline to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Its range extends eastwards along the Asian coastline, including Pakistan, India and into Southeast Asia, the Indonesian Archipelago and northern Australia. The southernmost record from the west coast of Australia comes from Rottnest Island, not far offshore from Perth. Elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, the species has been recorded from hundreds of small island groups, including the Maldives, Seychelles, Madagascar and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The giant trevally is abundant in the central Indo-Pacific region, found throughout all the archipelagos and offshore islands including Indonesia, Philippines and Solomon Islands. Along continental Asia, the species has been recorded from Malaysia to Vietnam, but not China. Despite this, its offshore range does extend north to Hong Kong, Taiwan and southern Japan. In the south, the species reaches as far south as New South Wales in Australia and even to the northern tip of New Zealand in the southern Pacific. Its distribution continues throughout the western Pacific, including Tonga, Western Samoa and Polynesia, with its easternmost limits known to be the Pitcairn and Hawaiian Islands. Habitat A giant trevally patrolling a reef in Hawaii The giant trevally inhabits a very wide range of offshore and inshore marine environments, with the species also known to tolerate the low salinity waters of estuaries and rivers. It is a semipelagic fish known to spend time throughout the water column, but is mostly demersal in nature. The species is most common in shallow coastal waters in a number of environments, including coral and rocky reefs and shorefaces, lagoons, embayments, tidal flats and channels. They commonly move between reef patches, often over large expanses of deeper sand and mud bottoms between the reefs. Older individuals tend to move to deeper seaward reefs, bomboras and drop-offs away from the protection of fringing reefs, often to depths greater than 80 m. Large individuals, however, often return to these shallower waters as they patrol their ranges, often to hunt or reproduce. In Hawaii, the juvenile to subadult giant trevally is the most common large carangid in the protected inshore waters, with all other species apparently preferring the outer, less protected reefs. It is also easily attracted to artificial reefs, where studies have found it to be one of the predominant species around these structures in Taiwan. Juvenile to subadult giant trevally are known to enter and inhabit estuaries, the upper reaches of rivers and coastal lakes in several locations, including South Africa, Solomon Islands, Philippines, India, Taiwan, Thailand, northern Australia, and Hawaii. In some of these locations, such as Australia, it is a common and relatively abundant inhabitant, while in others, including South Africa and Hawaii, it is much rarer in estuaries. The species has a wide salinity tolerance, as evident from the ranges from which juvenile and subadult fish in South African estuaries have been recorded; 0.5 to 38 parts per thousand (ppt), with other studies also showing tolerance levels of less than 1 ppt. In these estuaries, the giant trevally is known from both highly turbid, dirty water to clean, high visibility waters, but in most cases, the species prefers the turbid waters. Younger fish apparently actively seek out these turbid waters, and when no estuaries are present, they live in the turbid inshore waters of bays and beaches. These young fish eventually move to inshore reefs as they mature, before again moving to deeper outer reefs. In the Philippines, a population of giant trevally inhabit (and were once common in) the landlocked fresh waters of the formerly saltwater Taal Lake, and are referred to as maliputo to distinguish them from the marine variant (locally named talakitok). Along with Taal Volcano and Taal Lake, the maliputo is prominently featured on the reverse side of the newly redesigned Philippine 50 peso bill. Biology and ecology The giant trevally is a solitary fish once it reaches sexual maturity, only schooling for the purposes of reproduction and more rarely for feeding. Juveniles and subadults commonly school, both in marine and estuarine environments. Observations from South African estuaries indicate the schools of smaller juveniles tend not to intermingle with schools of other species, but larger subadults are known to form mixed-species schools with the brassy trevally. Research has been conducted on the movements of larger fish around their habitats, as well as the movement between habitats as the species grows, to understand how marine reserves impact on the species. Adult giant trevally are known to range back and forth up to 9 km along a home range, with some evidence of diel and seasonal shifts in habitat use. In the Hawaiian Islands, giant trevally do not normally move between atolls, but have specific core areas where they spend most their time. Within these core areas, habitat shifts during different times of the day have been recorded, with the fish being most active at dawn and dusk, and usually shifting location near sunrise or sunset. Furthermore, large seasonal migrations appear to occur for the purpose of aggregating for spawning, with this also known from the Solomon Islands. Despite not moving between atolls, they do make periodic atoll-wide journeys of up to 29 km. Long-term studies show juveniles can move up to 70 km away from their protected habitats to outer reefs and atolls. The giant trevally is one of the most important apex predators in its habitats, both as adults on reefs and as juveniles in estuaries. Observations in relatively untouched waters of the northwestern Hawaiian Islands showed the giant trevally was of high ecological importance, constituting 71% of the apex predator biomass, and was the dominant apex predator. This number is considerably less in heavily fished Hawaiian waters. The species is prey to sharks, especially when small. Conversely, adult giant trevallies, either singles or pairs, have been recorded attacking sharks (like blacktip reef shark) by ramming them repeatedly with their head. The shark, sometimes even larger than the trevally, may die from the attack. The reason for this behavior is unclear, but the giant trevally does not attempt to eat the dead shark. Rarely, they have been recorded behaving in the same way towards humans: A spearfisher in Hawaii broke three ribs when rammed by a giant trevally. Large giant trevallies have been recorded as a host of the sharksucker, Echeneis naucrates, a fish which is normally seen attached to the undersides of sharks. Diet and feeding Frontal view of a giant trevally illustrating the compressed form of the species The giant trevally is a powerful predatory fish, from the estuaries it inhabits as a juvenile to the outer reefs and atolls it patrols as an adult. Hunting appears to occur at different times of the day in different areas of its range; off South Africa it is most active during the day, especially at dawn and dusk, while off Zanzibar and Hong Kong, it is nocturnal in its habits. The species' diets have been determined in several countries and habitats; their diets generally vary slightly by locations and age. In all but one study (which was of juveniles), the giant trevally dominantly takes other fishes, with various crustaceans, cephalopods and occasionally molluscs making the remainder of the diet. In Hawaii, the species has a predominantly fish-based diet consisting of Scaridae and Labridae, with crustaceans, including lobsters, and cephalopods (squid and octopus) making up the remaining portion. The large number of reef fishes suggests it spends much of its time foraging over shallow-water reef habitats, but the presence of squid and the schooling carangid Decapterus macarellus indicates exploitation of more open-water habitats, as well. Off Africa, the diet is similar, consisting mostly of fish including eels, with minor squid, octopus, mantis shrimp, lobsters and other crustaceans. Younger fish inside Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii showed the only instance where crustaceans were preferred over fish; stomatopods, shrimp and crabs were the most common prey taken at 89% of stomach content by volume, with fish, mostly of the family Blennidae, making up only 7% of the stomach contents. Estuarine fish in both Hawaii and Australia have mostly fish-based diets, with crustaceans such as prawns and amphipods also of importance, and they are known to take more novel prey, such as spiders and insects, in these habitats. Juvenile turtles and dolphins were reported being found within the stomach contents of larger giant trevally. Studies of different size classes of fish have found their diets change with age in some locations, with the changes relating to an increased volume of fish taken. Giant trevally also feed on fledgling sooty terns on Farquhar Atoll snatching them from the water surface and even jumping acrobatically to catch them in the air as seen on the BBC documentary Blue Planet II, episode 1. So far this behaviour has not been observed elsewhere. Studies in controlled environments on the giant trevally's feeding strategies have found hunting in schools increases their capture efficiency, but is not necessary for an individual's survival. When a school is formed during feeding, one individual will take a leading position, with others trailing behind it. Several individuals will attack the prey school, striking and stunning the prey, with the leading individual generally being more successful. Some individuals act individually and opportunistically within the school if one of the prey fish becomes isolated, with the main advantage of schooling appearing to be the ability to further break up and isolate prey schools. The only time hunting in schools is a disadvantage is when only isolated prey are present, such as close to a reef; here, an individual hunter has a greater probability of capturing it than if a group is present. Another hunting strategy of the giant trevally is to 'escort' monk seals, a behavior which has been observed near the Hawaiian Islands. The trevally swim close by the seal, and when the seal stops to forage, the trevally positions its mouth inches away from the seal. If a prey item is disturbed, the trevally will attempt to steal the prey from the seal, which routinely does occur. The seal does not appear to gain any benefit from this relationship, and it is thought juvenile seals being followed in this way may be outcompeted by the larger fish. A similar strategy has been employed by fish in the presence of large reef sharks, as they use the larger animal as a tool to ambush prey. The opportunistic nature of giant trevally has also been made evident by studies on the mortality rate of undersized or egg-bearing lobsters released from traps at the water's surface of the Hawaiian Islands. The fish are efficient predators of these crustaceans, with individuals often seizing a lobster before it could sink to the seafloor after being released, or attacking before the lobster moves into a defensive position. Some bolder, large individuals are even known to eat the lobster head first when it is in a defensive stance. Life history A school of subadult giant trevally in a sandy bay, Hawaii The giant trevally reaches sexual maturity at 54 to 61 cm in length and three to four years of age, although many authors narrow this down to 60 cm and three years of age. Sex ratio estimates from the Hawaiian Islands suggest the population is slightly skewed toward females, with the male:female ratio being 1:1.39. Spawning occurs during the warmer months in most locations, although the exact dates differ by location. In southern Africa, this occurs between July and March, with a peak between November and March; in the Philippines between December and January, with a lesser peak during June; and in Hawaii between April and November, with a major peak during May to August. Lunar cycles are also known to control the spawning events, with large schools forming in certain locations at specific phases of the moon in Hawaii and the Solomon Islands. Locations for spawning include reefs, the reef channels and offshore banks. Sampling of schools prior to spawning suggests the fish segregate into schools of only one sex, although the details are still unclear. Observations in the natural habitat found spawning occurred during the day immediately after and just before the change of tide when there were no currents. Giant trevally gathered in schools of over 100 individuals, although ripe individuals occurred slightly deeper; around 2‚Äì3 m above the seabed in groups of three or four, with one silver female being chased by several black males. Eventually, a pair would sink down to a sandy bottom, where eggs and sperm were released. The fish then diverged and swam away. Each individual appears to spawn more than once in each period, with only part of the gonads ripe in spawners. Fecundity is not known, although females are known to release several thousand eggs on capture during the spawning process. Eggs are described as pelagic and transparent in nature. The giant trevally's early larval stages and their behaviour have been extensively described, with all fins having formed by at least 8 mm in length, with larvae and subjuveniles being silver with six dark vertical bars. Laboratory populations of fish show a significant variability in the length at a certain age, with the average range being around 6.5 mm. Growth rates in larvae between 8.0 and 16.5 mm are on average 0.36 mm per day. The speed at which larvae swim increases with age from 12 cm/s at 8 mm in length to 40 cm/s at 16.5 mm, with size rather than age a better predictor of this parameter. Size is also a better predictor of endurance in larvae than age. These observations suggest the species becomes an effective swimmer (is able to swim against a current) around 7‚Äì14 mm. No obvious relationships with age and either swimming depth or trajectory have been found. Larvae appear to also opportunistically feed on small zooplankton while swimming. The larvae actively avoid other large fish, and jellyfish are occasionally used as temporary cover. Larvae have no association with reefs, and appear to prefer to live pelagically. Daily growth is estimated at between 3.82 and 20.87 g/day, with larger fish growing at a more rapid rate. Length at the age of one year is 18 cm, at two years is 35 cm and by three years, the fish is around 50 to 60 cm. The use of von Bertalanffy growth curves fitted to observed otolith data show an individual of around 1 m in length is about eight years old, while a 1.7 m fish would be around 24 years old. The maximum theoretical length of the species predicted by the growth curves is 1.84 m, but the largest reported individual was 1.7 m long. As previously mentioned, as the giant trevally grows, it shifts from turbid inshore waters or estuaries to reefs and lagoons in bays, moving finally to outer reefs and atolls. A hybrid of C. ignobilis and C. melampygus (bluefin trevally) has been recorded from Hawaii. The specimen was initially thought to be a bluefin trevally of world-record size, but was later rejected when it was discovered to be a hybrid. Initial evidence of hybridisation was morphological characteristics intermediate to the two species; later genetic tests confirmed it was indeed a hybrid. The two species are known to school together, including at spawning time, which was considered to be the reason for hybridisation. Relationship to humans A giant trevally taken by a soft plastic lure The giant trevally has been used by humans since prehistoric times, with the oldest known records of the capture of this species by Hawaiians, whose culture held the fish in high regard. The ulua, as the fish is known to Hawaiians, was likened to a fine man and strong warrior, which was the cause of a ban on women eating the species in antiquity. The species was often used in Hawaiian religious rites, and took place of a human sacrifice when none was available. Culturally, the fish was seen as a god, and treated as gamefish which commoners could not hunt. There are many mentions of ulua in Hawaiian proverbs, all generally relating to the strength and warrior-like qualities of the fish. The Hawaiians considered the fish to be of excellent quality, with white, firm flesh. Despite this, intrusions of giant trevally into modern-day fishponds used by Hawaiians for rearing fish are unwelcome; being a predator, it eats more than it is worth at market. The giant trevally is of high importance to modern fisheries throughout its range, although quantifying the amounts taken is very difficult due to the lack of fishery statistics kept in most of these countries. Hawaii has the best-kept statistics, where the 1998 catch consisted of 10,194 pounds of giant trevally worth around US$12,000. Historically, the species has been taken in far greater numbers, and has been an important food, market and game fish since the early 1900s. However, their exploitation has seen the landings of the species decrease by over 84% since the turn of the century, declining from 725,000 lb to 10,000 lb in recent catches. FAO statistics of the Asian region record catches between 4,000 and 10,000 tonnes between 1997 and 2007, although this excludes most fisheries which are not monitored or do not discriminate between trevally species. The giant trevally is commercially caught by a number of methods, including hook and line, handlines, gill nets and other types of artisanal traps. The species has also successfully been bred for aquaculture purposes in Taiwan. It is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil. The giant trevally is considered one of the top gamefish of the Indo-Pacific region, having outstanding strength, speed and endurance once hooked. It can be taken by many methods, including baits of cut or live fish and squid, as well as a wide array of lures. The species is commonly taken on bibbed plugs, minnows, spoons, jigs and poppers, soft plastic lures and saltwater flies. In recent years, the development of both jigging and surface-popping techniques has seen the giant trevally become an extremely popular candidate for catch and release fishing, with many charter operators based around this concept. The species is also popular with spearfishermen throughout its range. The species' edibility has been rated from poor to excellent by different authors, although numerous cases of ciguatera poisoning have been reported from the species. Detailed tests on a large (1 m) specimen taken from Palmyra Island showed the toxicity of the fish's flesh, liver and washed intestinal tract produced no or weakly positive symptoms to laboratory mice, but the digested contents of the intestine were lethal. The authors argued, based on this test, the flesh of giant trevally was safe to consume. However, analysis of case studies in which ciguatera poisoning was reported after eating the fish suggested an accumulative effect occurs with repeated consumption; and tests like the one outlined above are not reliable, as the toxin appears to be distributed haphazardly throughout each fish. Since 1990, giant trevally taken from the main Hawaiian islands have been blocked from sale by auction internationally due to concerns over liability from ciguatera poisoning. Conservation Scuba diver interacting with a giant trevally at Guam's Gab Gab II reef A decline in giant trevally numbers around inhabited regions has been well documented in Hawaii, with both catch data as presented above and ecological studies showing this decrease in numbers. A biomass study in the Hawaiian Islands indicates the main Hawaiian Islands are heavily depleted in the species, which in untouched ecosystems comprises 71% of the apex predator biomass. In contrast, it comprises less than 0.03% of the apex biomass in exploited habitats, with only a single fish observed during the course of this research study. Prior to this, a 1993 report suggested the population around the main Hawaiian islands were not stressed, though several biological indicators suggested to the contrary. This was due to the highly size- selective nature of the fishery, which theoretically should prevent a decrease in numbers. Despite this, populations have decreased, and in light of their continued falling abundance in Hawaii, several recommendations, including banning the commercial take of the species, increasing minimum lengths and decreasing bag limits for anglers, as well as reassessment of protected areas for the species, have been proposed by officials. The species (nor any other carangid) has not been assessed by the IUCN. Some recreational fishing groups are also promoting a catch and release practice for the giant trevally, with this becoming an increasingly popular option for charter boat operators, who have also begun to tag giant trevally for scientific purposes. At large sizes, the species is more likely to be ciguatoxic, so if the fish is kept, it must be disposed of or sent to a taxidermist if it is a trophy fish. A catch and release approach has also been adopted by operators outside Hawaii, with Australian operators who target the species by popping and jigging rarely keeping any fish. Careful fish handling techniques have also been implemented by anglers so as not to damage the fish; such techniques include supporting the fish's weight, using barbless single, rather than treble, hooks and restricting the time the fish spends out the water to a minimum.

Formally, exponential utility is given by: :u(c) = \\\\begin{cases} (1-e^{-a c})/a & a eq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & a = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} c is a variable that the economic decision-maker prefers more of, such as consumption, and a is a constant that represents the degree of risk preference (a>0 for risk aversion, a=0 for risk-neutrality, or a<0 for risk-seeking). In situations where only risk aversion is allowed, the formula is often simplified to u(c)=1-e^{-a c}. Note that the additive term 1 in the above function is mathematically irrelevant and is (sometimes) included only for the aesthetic feature that it keeps the range of the function between zero and one over the domain of non- negative values for c. The reason for its irrelevance is that maximizing the expected value of utility u(c)=(1-e^{-a c})/a gives the same result for the choice variable as does maximizing the expected value of u(c)=-e^{-a c}/a; since expected values of utility (as opposed to the utility function itself) are interpreted ordinally instead of cardinally, the range and sign of the expected utility values are of no significance. The exponential utility function is a special case of the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion utility functions. Risk aversion characteristic Exponential utility implies constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), with coefficient of absolute risk aversion equal to a constant: :\\\\frac{-u(c)}{u'(c)}=a. In the standard model of one risky asset and one risk-free asset, Reprinted in: Essays in the Theory of Risk Bearing, Markham Publ. Co., Chicago, 1971, 90‚Äì109. for example, this feature implies that the optimal holding of the risky asset is independent of the level of initial wealth; thus on the margin any additional wealth would be allocated totally to additional holdings of the risk-free asset. This feature explains why the exponential utility function is considered unrealistic. Mathematical tractability Though isoelastic utility, exhibiting constant relative risk aversion (CRRA), is considered more plausible (as are other utility functions exhibiting decreasing absolute risk aversion), exponential utility is particularly convenient for many calculations. Consumption example For example, suppose that consumption c is a function of labor supply x and a random term \\\\epsilon: c = c(x) + \\\\epsilon. Then under exponential utility, expected utility is given by: :\\\\text{E}(u(c))=\\\\text{E}[1-e^{-a (c(x)+ \\\\epsilon)}], where E is the expectation operator. With normally distributed noise, i.e., :\\\\varepsilon \\\\sim N(\\\\mu, \\\\sigma^2),\\\\\\\\! E(u(c)) can be calculated easily using the fact that :\\\\text{E}[e^{-a \\\\varepsilon}]=e^{-a \\\\mu + \\\\frac{a^2}{2}\\\\sigma^2}. Thus :\\\\text{E}(u(c))=\\\\text{E}[1-e^{-a (c(x)+ \\\\epsilon)}] = \\\\text{E}[1-e^{-a c(x)}e^{-a \\\\varepsilon}] = 1 - e^{-ac(x)}\\\\text{E}[e^{-a \\\\epsilon}] = 1 - e^{-ac(x)}e^{-a \\\\mu + \\\\frac{a^2}{2}\\\\sigma^2}. Multi-asset portfolio example Consider the portfolio allocation problem of maximizing expected exponential utility \\\\text{E}[-e^{-aW}] of final wealth W subject to :W = x'r + (W_0 - x'k) \\\\cdot r_f where the prime sign indicates a vector transpose and where W_0 is initial wealth, x is a column vector of quantities placed in the n risky assets, r is a random vector of stochastic returns on the n assets, k is a vector of ones (so W_0 - x'k is the quantity placed in the risk-free asset), and rf is the known scalar return on the risk-free asset. Suppose further that the stochastic vector r is jointly normally distributed. Then expected utility can be written as :\\\\text{E}[-e^{-aW}] = - \\\\text{E}[e^{-a [x'r + (W_0 - x'k) \\\\cdot r_f]}] = - e^{-a[(W_0 - x'k)r_f]}\\\\text{E}[e^{-a \\\\cdot x'r}] = - e^{-a[(W_0 - x'k)r_f]}e^{-a \\\\cdot x'\\\\mu + \\\\frac{a^2}{2}\\\\sigma^2} where \\\\mu is the mean vector of the vector r and \\\\sigma^2 is the variance of final wealth. Maximizing this is equivalent to minimizing :e^{ar_f (x'k)-a \\\\cdot x'\\\\mu + \\\\frac{a^2}{2}\\\\sigma^2}, which in turn is equivalent to maximizing :x'(\\\\mu - r_f \\\\cdot k) - \\\\frac{a}{2}\\\\sigma^2. Denoting the covariance matrix of r as V, the variance \\\\sigma ^2 of final wealth can be written as x'Vx. Thus we wish to maximize the following with respect to the choice vector x of quantities to be placed in the risky assets: :x'(\\\\mu - r_f \\\\cdot k) - \\\\frac{a}{2} \\\\cdot x'Vx. This is an easy problem in matrix calculus, and its solution is :x^* = \\\\frac{1}{a}V^{-1} (\\\\mu - r_f \\\\cdot k). From this it can be seen that (1) the holdings x* of the risky assets are unaffected by initial wealth W0, an unrealistic property, and (2) the holding of each risky asset is smaller the larger is the risk aversion parameter a (as would be intuitively expected). This portfolio example shows the two key features of exponential utility: tractability under joint normality, and lack of realism due to its feature of constant absolute risk aversion.

It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn and local tram lines. History On 27 July 1936 the station was opened as part of the new North-South Tunnel. On 25 April 1945 the S-Bahn ceased operation due to the Soviet invasion, which had reached Berlin on 21 April. Most likely on 2 May 1945 the SS exploded the tunnel ceiling under Landwehrkanal, which caused the subsequent flooding of the tunnel, including Oranienburger Stra√üe station. After drainage and repair the station reopened for traffic on 16 November 1947. During the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany and East Berlin the S-Bahn, operated by the eastern Deutsche Reichsbahn, interrupted traffic between 17 June until 9 July 1953. Platform view From 13 August 1961, the day the Berlin Wall went up, trains did not stop in the station, because it was located in East Berlin, with the operating line, however, connected northern and southern areas of West Berlin. So the Reichsbahn continued the operation of the line, but trains only stopped in those stations with entrances from West Berlin. So Oranienburger Stra√üe was one of East Berlin's ghost stations. After the eastern Reichsbahn handed over operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin to the latter's public transport operator BVG the S-Bahn line passing the station was abandoned on 9 January 1984. However, protests by West Berlin's users made the BVG reopen the line on 1 May with the trains however only passing.

Cooks Hill grew from coal mines in the area. Land sales developed from Brooks Street onto Darby Street to create the commercial centre there today. Darby Street was originally known as Lake Macquarie Road and was one of the few public access roads through AA Company Coal Mine land. It was named after Samuel Wellington Cook, father of Thomas Cook, who was a wealthy landowner at Nemingha in the Tamworth area for some 25 years, on the Cockburn River, well known as \\"one of the most progressive farmers and stock breeders of his time\\". Samuel Cook was originally from Warleggan, Cornwall, England, a short distance from Lampen Farm, St Neot, home of the Dangar family. Samuel married the sister of Henry Dangar, Elizabeth Cary Dangar, moving first to Canada, then to Australia in 1837 with their son Thomas Cook aged 3, at the request of brother-in-law William Dangar to manage the property \\"Turanville\\", Scone in the Upper Hunter. After this Samuel became a squatter in his own right firstly at Barwon, then Thalaba. He then exchanged the Thalaba property for 18,000 acres at the southern end of Henry Dangar's 25,000 acre Moonbi run, and called this holding Nemingha. The Cooks moved there in 1844 and their new home was called Nemingha House. Samuel Cook became especially well known in Nemingha, 5 miles from Tamworth, for breeding of horses, and were very prominent at the Tamworth Shows. Henry Dangar was Surveyor for the Australian Agricultural Company (AAC), and the original Tamworth settlement was wholly owned by the AAC. Samuel Cook remembered Tamworth as having \\"6 or 8 houses\\" when he arrived, and once the landlock controlled by the AAC was lifted by government legislation, he stayed long enough to help it develop into a thriving town. Cook owned shares in the Nemingha Gold Mining Company during the gold rush, and is recorded as having \\"over 400 horses, 180 breeding mares, 5 stallions and several stallion foals\\" described as \\"thoroughbred, crossbred and English roadsters comanding the best price\\" on the Nemingha property. Cook patronised local businesses and helped to develop the Tamworth area. His spendings were said to be twice that of the vast Goonoo Goonoo Station owned by the AAC. Their eldest son, Thomas Cook (born in 1834) moved to Nemingha with his parents and brother John (born at Turanville) as a child. He is reported to ride the 5 miles into Tamworth to meet the mail coach once a week. In 1854 Thomas became manager at age 20 of the same property that brought his family to Australia, \\"Turanville\\", Scone in the Upper Hunter, for his uncles William and Henry Dangar, and was soon placed in charge of all of William Dangar's grazing interests. Samuel and Elizabeth had two more children, William and Elizabeth, at Nemingha, but Willam died as a child in 1855 at Nemingha. Thomas Cook married Charlotte Bentley Sibley, whose father was also from the same area of Cornwall as the Dangar's, in 1867. The next year William Dangar died in England in 1868, and Thomas Cook inherited \\"Turanville\\" at age 34, as well as \\"Drildool\\" and \\"Cubbaroo\\"at Burren Junction, \\"Merrywinebone\\", \\"North Oreel\\" and \\"South Oreel\\" in the Barwon district. Samuel and Elizabeth sold Nemingha to John Gill, and after 32 years of success in NSW, and long association with the Dangars and the AAC, moved to Newcastle (Cooks Hill) in 1869 to retire to \\"Lucerna\\", in Lower Church Street, where Elizabeth died 9 years later on 18 November 1878, and Samuel followed her, dying after 14 years of retirement, on 2 March 1883. Thomas Cook later donated stained-glass windows in St John's Church, Newcastle in memory of his mother, Elizabeth Cary Cook. \\"Lucerna\\" had views to the Northeast over Newcastle Harbour, on land now occupied by the Newcastle Conservatorium, Laman St, opposite St Andrew's church [ see reference for photo ]. Two years after Samuel's death, Cooks Hill School opened in 1885 formalising the name of the suburb. Low-lying ground and swamp was found in abundance locally, the market gardens near Marketown on Parry St often flooded due to poor drainage into Cottage Creek, and so elevated land was of some value. Cooks Hill was badly damaged when at 10.27am on 28 December 1989, Newcastle experienced an earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale which killed 13 people, injured 162 and destroyed or severely damaged over 25,000 buildings, many of which had to be subsequently demolished. It was the first in Australian history known to claim human lives.

Giovanni Battista Maini (6 February 1690 ‚Äì 29 July 1752) was an Italian sculptor of the Late-Baroque period, active mainly in Rome. He was born in Cassano Magnago in Lombardy, and died in Rome. He may have had contacts with Foggini in Florence. By 1708, he had moved to Rome where he joined the large studio of Camillo Rusconi, where he worked for over twenty years. Among his first commission was the execution in bassorilievo (relief) of the Glory of San Francesco for a Jesuit church of Madrid; however, the bassorilievo in stucco, likely originally a design by Rusconi, was never sculpted in marble. Like Rusconi, Maini always modelled his projects in stucco first. Maini collaborated in the decoration of the spandrels of the cupola of the Santi Luca e Martina. He worked in Sant'Agnese in Agone, where he executed the papal funerary monument to Innocent X (1729), likely based on Rusconi‚Äôs designs. For St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, Maini carved large marble statues of St Francis of Paola (1732; designed by Pietro Bianchi) and St Philip Neri (c. 1735). This was part of a series of sculptures on the founders of orders and included Michelangelo Slodtz's St Bruno. He completed the Archangels Michael and Gabriel statues (c. 1737) for the basilica of Mafra, commissioned by king of Portugal. Maini's Saint Anne. Between 1732-1735, Maini was involved in the prominent commissions by Clement XII for his family chapel, the Corsini chapel in San Giovanni in Laterano. The benedictory bronze statue of Clemente XII, by Maini, is inspired by Bernini‚Äôs Urban VIII in St. Peter‚Äôs, and replaced an earlier statue by Carlo Monaldi. He also sculpted figures for his monument to cardinal Neri Corsini\\" (1733‚Äì34), who was the pope‚Äôs nephew. In 1741-43, he worked on the portico relief of Madonna of St Luke for Santa Maria Maggiore. Another contemporary relief of St John Preaching was placed in San Giovanni in Laterano. Starting in 1734 Maini was involved in the design work of Fontana di Trevi, but failed to obtain the choice commission from the main architect Nicola Salvi for the final sculpting of the statue of Neptune and Oceanus group, which instead was given to Pietro Bracci (1743‚Äì59). He also sent some reliefs to Siena, for the Chigi chapel in the Cathedral of Siena. In 1744 he was again working for the John V of Portugal, one of the greatest patrons of arts in the 18th century. He designed for the king a magnificent statue of the Immaculate Conception cast by Giuseppe Gagliardi. This huge silver-gilt image was nine palmi high. It was Blessed by Pope Benedict XIV himself in 1749 before being dispatched to Lisbon where it was destined to the Patriarchal Royal Chapel of the Ribeira Palace. It was for a few days the talk of Rome and was to be destroyed just a few years later by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

After the American defeat at the Battle of Brandywine, the British Army remained encamped near Chadds Ford. When British commander William Howe was informed that the weakened American force was less than ten miles (16 km) away, he decided to press for another decisive victory. George Washington learned of Howe's plans and prepared for battle. Before the two armies could fully engage, a torrential downpour ensued. Significantly outnumbered, and with tens of thousands of cartridges ruined by the rain, Washington opted to retreat. Bogged down by rain and mud, the British allowed Washington and his army to withdraw. Background After Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine, he was intent on accomplishing two tasks. He wanted to protect Philadelphia from British forces under the command of Howe, and he needed to replenish the rapidly dwindling supplies and munitions which were stored at the Van Leer Furnace in Reading, Pennsylvania. Washington withdrew across the Schuylkill River, marched through Philadelphia, and headed northwest. Since the Schuylkill was fordable only far upstream starting at Matson's Ford (present-day Conshohocken), Washington could protect both the capital and the vital supply areas to the west from behind the river barrier. Yet he reconsidered and recrossed the river to face the British, who had moved little since Brandywine, owing to a shortage of wagons to carry both their wounded and their baggage. Battle of Emery and Hunter General Howe was alerted that Washington had recrossed the Schuylkill on the afternoon of September 15, and by midnight, his troops were on the march toward the major road junction where the White Horse Tavern stood. The going was difficult because the weather had been rainy and windy, and the troops and wagons turned the roads into muddy quagmires. The next morning, Washington's 10,000 man army was moving west through the Great Valley, bound by the North and South Valley Hills on either side. He learned from his cavalry, led by General Pulaski, that the British were advancing on him from the south just a few miles away. Although moving to the North Valley Hills would have given Washington more time to deploy and possibly fortify, he ordered the army south directly toward the enemy to take up a defensive position on the South Valley Hills. Washington sent an advance force under General Anthony Wayne to slow the British progress. At about 2:00 pm, his men encountered the advance j√§ger units of the Hessian column on one road. These forces began skirmishing, and the Americans very nearly captured Colonel Carl von Donop when he became separated from his main column with a small company of j√§gers. The main British column, led by General Charles Cornwallis, met with Wayne's Pennsylvania militia on another road at around 3:00, who gave way in a panicked retreat, suffering 10 killed or wounded. While this went on, Washington, who was trying to organize the line of battle, had a change of heart about the position and ended up withdrawing the army north of the tavern. This withdrawal was just getting underway when it began pouring rain. Hessian j√§ger Captain Johann Ewald described it as \\"an extraordinary thunderstorm, [...] combined with the heaviest downpour in this world.\\" The British army halted its advance, although General Wilhelm von Knyphausen ordered the j√§gers to engage the enemy. Ewald and his men rushed forward, swords drawn since their muskets were inoperable because of the wet powder, and captured 34 men. Ewald reported losing 5 killed, 7 wounded, and 3 captured in this action. The storm, which historian Thomas McGuire describes as \\"a classic nor'easter\\", raged well into the next day The British were forced to construct a makeshift camp (having left their tents behind that day), and Washington managed to form a battle line, but a great deal of his ammunition had been spoiled by the rain and poorly constructed cartridge boxes.County of Chester, Pennsylvania, p. 8Catts, p. 36 Aftermath Washington once again withdrew beyond the Schuylkill on September 19 to cover both the capital and his supply area, but he left behind General Wayne's Pennsylvania division of 1,500 men and four guns with orders to harass the British rear. Washington temporarily based his headquarters at the Warwick Furnace.\\"General Washington retreated to Warwick to have the army's muskets repaired,\\" Warwick Furnace Historical Marker, May 12, 1948. Howe's army found it nearly impossible to follow Washington over the rutted, muddy roads. The decision was made to wait out the storm, then move toward their objective. Wayne was to be joined by militia, and together they were to strike at the enemy baggage train as the British advanced on Washington's main army. However his force was surprised at the Battle of Paoli, and the British were free to occupy Philadelphia.

Later works date from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. The first castle, a motte-and-bailey, was built in the bottom of the valley of the Mauldre River, at a time when castles were usually built on high ground. It had a defensive role at that time, with the river as a western defence line of the French Royal domain, defending against Normandy and other possible combatants. It was owned by the English during the Hundred Years' War. Later, the castle lost its defensive role after the extension of the Royal territories. Around 1450, Robert d'Estouteville transformed the castle into a more comfortable residence by dismantling the keep and adapting the fortifications to the incipient artillery. Other transformations were performed during the 15th century, particularly under Philibert de l'Orme. In 1536, the castle was given to Diane de Poitiers by Henri II. The castle was totally abandoned during the 18th century, fell into ruins, and was used as a stone quarry for the village constructions. Architecture A stone bridge between the west ch√¢telet and the barbican The castle has an oval shape surrounded by a moat; nine towers stand along the curtain walls. Since the transformations of the 15th century, a paved central courtyard crosses the castle. Two ch√¢telets (east and west) defend the two entries to the castle, and a barbican also protects the west access. Modern days The whole remains of the castle were listed as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture in November 1959. The castle was bought by the commune in 1967, and from 1995 to 1999 excavations and consolidation works have stopped its deterioration. Presently, an active association is restoring the castle.

The bluefin trevally is distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from Eastern Africa in the west to Central America in the east, including Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species grows to a maximum known length of 117 cm and a weight of 43.5 kg, however is rare above 80 cm. Bluefin trevally are easily recognised by their electric blue fins, tapered snout and numerous blue and black spots on their sides. Juveniles lack these obvious colours, and must be identified by more detailed anatomical features such as fin ray and scute counts. The bluefin trevally inhabits both inshore environments such as bays, lagoons and shallow reefs, as well as deeper offshore reefs, atolls and bomboras. Juveniles prefer shallower, protected waters, even entering estuaries for short periods in some locations. The bluefin trevally is a strong predatory fish, with a diet dominated by fish and supplemented by cephalopods and crustaceans as an adult. Juveniles consume a higher amount of small crustaceans, but transfer to a more fish based diet as they grow. The species displays a wide array of hunting techniques ranging from aggressive midwater attacks, reef ambushes and foraging interactions with other larger species, snapping up any prey items missed by the larger animal. The bluefin trevally reproduces at different periods throughout its range, and reaches sexual maturity at 30‚Äì40 cm in length and around 2 years of age. It is a multiple spawner, capable of reproducing up to 8 times per year, releasing up to 6 million eggs per year in captivity. Growth is well studied, with the fish reaching 194 mm in its first year, 340 mm in the second and 456 mm in the third year. The bluefin trevally is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fishermen. Commercial fisheries record up to 50 tonnes of the species taken per year in the west Indian Ocean, and around 700 lbs per year in Hawaii. The rapid decimation of the Hawaiian population due to overfishing has led to increased research in the aquaculture potential of the species, with spawning achieved in captivity. Despite its popularity as a table fish, many cases of ciguatera poisoning have been reported from the species. Taxonomy and phylogeny The bluefin trevally is classified within the genus Caranx, one of a number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies. Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, which in turn is part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described by the famed French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1833 based on specimens collected off Waigio, Indonesia; one of which was designated to be the holotype. He named the species Caranx melampygus, placing the species in the jack genus Caranx which had been established by Bernard Lac√©p√®de three decades previously. The name's specific epithet is derived from the Latin translation of \\"black spotted\\". This is still currently considered the correct placement, however later authors placed in other now defunct genera (Carangus and Carangichthys) which has since been deemed incorrect, and the original classification stands. The species was independently redescribed and named seven times after Cuvier's initial description, with all of these names assigned between 1836 and 1895. The names C. bixanthopterus and C. stellatus were often used in the literature, and were variably classed as synonyms of C. melampygus or valid individual species after their naming. This confusion culminated in Yojiro Wakiya concluding in 1924 they should be treated as separate species. The taxonomy of the species was finally revised by Frederick Berry in 1965, who resolved these two names as being synonymous with C. melampygus, and placed several other names in synonymy with C. melampygus. Under ICZN nomenclature rules, these later names are deemed junior synonyms of C. melampygus and rendered invalid. The species has not been included in any detailed phylogenetic studies of the Carangidae. The species is most commonly referred to as the 'bluefin trevally', with the species's distinctive blue fins contributing to most of its other common names. These include bluefin jack, bluefin kingfish, blue ulua, omilu, bluefinned crevalle and spotted trevally. The species has many other non-English names due to its wide distribution. Description The bluefin trevally is a large fish, growing to a maximum known length of 117 cm and a weight of 43.5 kg, however it is rare at lengths greater than 80 cm. It is similar in shape to a number of other large jacks and trevallies, having an oblong, compressed body with the dorsal profile slightly more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. This slight convexity leads to the species having a much more pointed snout than most other members of Caranx. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of 8 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 21 to 24 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 17 to 20 soft rays. The pelvic fins contain 1 spine and 20 soft rays. The caudal fin is strongly forked, and the pectoral fins are falcate, being longer than the length of the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the lobe of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains 55-70 scales while the straight section contains 0 to 10 scales followed by 27 to 42 strong scutes. The chest is completely covered in scales. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of widely spaced conical teeth. The species has 25 to 29 gill rakers in total and there are 24 vertebrae present. The eye is covered by a moderately weakly developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under or just past the anterior margin of the eye. Despite their wide range, the only geographical variation in the species is the depth of the body in smaller specimens. The upper body of the bluefin trevally is a silver-brassy colour, fading to silvery white on the underside of the fish, often with blue hues. After they reach lengths greater than 16 cm, blue-black spots appear on the upper flanks of the fish, with these becoming more prolific with age. There is no dark spot on the operculum. The species takes its name from the colour of its dorsal, anal and caudal fins, which are a diagnostic electric blue. The pelvic and pectoral fins are white, with the pectoral fin having a yellow tinge. Juvenile fish do not have the bright blue fins, instead have dark fins with the exception of a yellow pectoral fin. Some juvenile fish have also been recorded as having up to five dark vertical bars on their sides. Distribution A bluefin trevally photographed in the Maldives; this species is widely distributed The bluefin trevally is widely distributed, occupying the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging along the coasts of four continents and hundreds of smaller islands and archipelagos. In the Indian Ocean, the species easternmost range is the coast of continental Africa, being distributed from the southern tip of South Africa north along the east African coastline to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The species' range extends eastwards along the Asian coastline including Pakistan, India and into South East Asia, the Indonesian Archipelago and northern Australia. The southernmost record from the west coast of Australia comes from Exmouth Gulf. Elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, the species has been recorded from hundreds of small island groups including the Maldives, Seychelles, Madagascar and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The bluefin trevally is abundant in the central Indo-Pacific region, found throughout all the archipelagos and offshore islands including Indonesia, Philippines and Solomon Islands. Along continental Asia, the species has been recorded from Malaysia to Vietnam and mainland China. Its offshore range does extend north to Hong Kong, Taiwan and southern Japan in the north western Pacific. In the south, the species reaches as far south as Sydney in Australia. Its distribution continues throughout the western Pacific including Tonga, Western Samoa and Polynesia, and the Hawaiian Islands. The easternmost limit of the species distribution is the Mesoamerican coastline between Mexico and Ecuador in the central eastern Pacific, including islands such as the Gal√°pagos Islands. Habitat A lone bluefin trevally patrolling a coral reef, one of the species most common habitats The bluefin trevally occurs in a wide range of inshore and offshore marine settings throughout its range, including estuarine waters. The species is known to move throughout the water column; however is most often observed in a demersal setting, swimming not far from the seabed. In the inshore environment, the species is present in almost all settings including bays, harbours, coral and rocky reefs, lagoons, sand flats and seagrass meadows. Juveniles and subadults are more common in these settings, and prefer these more protected environments, where they live in water to a minimum of around 2 m depth. Adults tend to prefer more exposed, deeper settings such as outer reef slopes, outlying atolls and bomboras, often near drop offs, with the species reported from depths up to 183 m. Adults often enter shallower channels, reefs and lagoons to feed at certain periods during the day. The bluefin trevally displays some habitat partitioning with giant trevally, Caranx ignobilis, tending to be more common outside the major bays than their relatives. Juvenile and subadult bluefin trevally have been recorded in estuaries in several locations, and generally occupy large, open estuaries up to the middle reaches of the system. These estuaries are often lined by mudflats and mangroves, however the species rarely enters these shallow waters. Individuals of between 40 and 170 mm have been recorded in South African estuaries, where they are the least tolerant carangid to the brackish and freshwater conditions of these systems. Bluefin trevally can tolerate salinities of between 6.0 and 35 ‚Ä∞, and only occupy clear, low turbidity waters. There is evidence the species is only resident in these estuaries for short periods. The species is also absent from coastal lakes that many other carangids are known from. Biology and ecology The bluefin trevally is a schooling species as a juvenile, transitioning to a more solitary fish with well defined home ranges as an adult. Adults do school to form spawning aggregations or temporarily while hunting, with evidence from laboratory studies indicates bluefin trevally are able to coordinate these aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae and to a lesser extent corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. The number of fish present in an area is also influenced by tidal factors and possibly the abundance of prey and other environmental factors. Tracking studies in Hawaii have found bluefin trevally patrol back and forth along a home range of patch reef walls during the day, only stopping for variable periods where major depth changes or discontinuities in the reef were present. Several fish patrol the same reef patch, reversing direction where the others do. While most fish patrol the one reef, some have been observed to make excursions to nearby reefs, before returning to their home reef later. Night time movements are less extensive than daytime movements, with the trevally moving rapidly between several small reef sections, before slowing down and milling in one patch for around an hour. The fish living in a particular region congregate in one area at night, before returning to their individual daytime range during the day. The reason for this congregation is unclear, but may be important to the social structure of the species. Long term studies have found the fish may range up to 10.2 km over several months, however, is much less restricted in its movements than its relative, the giant trevally. A Hawaiian biomass study found the species to be one of the most abundant large predators in the islands, however it is less abundant in the heavily exploited Main Hawaiian Islands compared to the remote Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The main difference in these populations was the relative lack of large adult fish in the inhabited areas compared to the remote, unfished regions. A study on carangids caught during a fishing tournament in Hawaii found the bluefin trevally is the most common trevally species taken, accounting for over 80% of the carangid catch. The authors note that this may not only reflect its abundance, but also it vulnerability to specific fishing methods used in the tournament. Apart from the typical predator-prey relationship the species shows (described later), an individual of the species has been seen to rub itself against the skin of a Galapagos shark, apparently to rid itself of parasites. This behaviour is also observed in rainbow runner and is a rare example of a commensal cleaner relationship where the cleaner does not gain anything. Diet and feeding A school of bluefin trevally working a baitball of anchovies The bluefin trevally is a fast swimming, mainly piscivorous predator which shows a wide range in hunting techniques. Two studies of adult fish in Hawaii found fish to be the dominant food type in the species, making up over 95% volume of the stomach contents by weight. Here the main fish selected were small reef dwellers, with fish from the families Labridae, Mullidae, Scaridae and Priacanthidae being the most common. Despite the preference of several families, bluefin trevally do take a very wide variety of fish in small amounts, including various species of eel. The species appears to have a preference for fish of a specific size, which depends on its own length and age. Cephalopods (mainly octopus or squid) and a wide array of crustaceans are also taken in smaller quantities, with shrimps, stomatopods and crabs being the most common. The diet of juveniles in Hawaiian and South African estuaries has also been determined, with these younger fish having a more crustacean based diet than the adults. In Hawaii, crustaceans make up 96% of the gut contents numerically, with tanaids and isopods dominating the diet, while fish only make up 4% numerically. Juveniles less than 170 mm in South African estuaries feed predominantly on mysids and paenid prawns, before shifting to a more fish based diet at larger sizes. Small fish are able to effectively filter these small crustaceans from the water, while adults are not. In both cases, a transition to a more fish based diet with age was found to occur, although the length at which this transition occurred varied between location. The diet overlap with the similar C. ignobilis is low in the Hawaiian Islands, suggesting there is some separation of feeding niches. Calculations suggest each individual bluefin trevally consumes around 45 kg of fish per year on average, making it one of the most effective predators in this habitat. The bluefin trevally displays a remarkable array of hunting techniques, ranging from midwater attacks to ambush and taking advantage of larger forage fish. The species is reported to hunt during the day, particularly at dawn and dusk in most locations; however it is known to be a nocturnal feeder in South Africa. The bluefin trevally hunts both as a solitary individual and in groups of up to 20, with most fish preferring an individual approach. In groups, these fish will rush their prey, and disperse the school, allowing for isolated individuals to be picked out and eaten, much in the way the related species, giant trevally have been observed to do in captivity. In some cases, only one individual in a group will attack the prey school. Where the prey is schooling reef fishes, once the prey school has been attacked, the trevally chases down the prey as they scatter back to cover in the corals, often colliding with coral as they attempt to snatch a fish. While hunting in midwater, fish swim both against and with the tide, although significantly more fish hunt when swimming with the tide (i.e. 'downstream'), suggesting some mechanical advantage is gained when hunting in this mode. Another method of attack is ambush; in this mode the trevally change their colour to a dark pigmentation state and hide behind large coral lumps close to where the aggregations (often spawning reef fish) occur. Once the prey is close enough to the hiding spot, the fish ram the base of the school, before chasing down individual fish. These dark fish in ambush mode vigorously drive away any other bluefin trevally that stray too close to the aggregation. Ambushes have also been observed on small midwater planktivorous fishes are moving to or from the shelter of the reef. In many cases, the species uses changes in the depth of the reef such as ledges to conceal its ambush attacks. Bluefin trevally also enter lagoons as the tide rises to hunt small baitfish in the shallow confines, leaving as the tide falls. The species is also known to follow large rays, sharks and other foraging fish such as goatfish and wrasse around sandy substrates, waiting to pounce on any disturbed crustaceans or fish which are flushed out by the larger fish. Life history It takes 12 years for a bluefin trevally to reach 85 cm in length The bluefin trevally reaches sexual maturity at between 30 and 40 cm in length and around 2 years in age, with one study Hawaii suggesting maturation occurs at a length of around 35 cm on average. There is also a difference in the length at maturation between the two sexes, with females on average reaching maturity at 32.5 cm length, while males attain maturity at 35 cm on average. Sex ratios in the species vary by location with population off east Africa being skewed towards males (M:F = 1.68:1), while in Hawaii the opposite is true with the M:F ratio being 1:1.48. The period of the year over which spawning occurs is also variable by location, with African fish reproducing between September and March while in Hawaii this occurs between April and November, with a peak in May to July. Natural spawning behaviour in the species has never been observed, although large aggregations of bluefin trevally observed in Palau consisting of over 1000 fish are believed to be for the purpose of spawning. Extensive studies on the species in captivity has revealed the species to be a multiple spawner, capable of spawning at least 8 times a year, and up to twice in 5 days. Spawning events are often clustered in a few consecutive or alternate days, usually in the third or fourth lunar phases. Spawning apparently occurs at night to minimise predation on eggs. Fecundity in the natural environment has been reported to range from around 50 000 to 4 270 000, with larger individuals releasing more eggs. Studies in captive fish show females may produce over 6 000 000 eggs per year. These eggs are pelagic and spherical, with diameters between 0.72 and 0.79 mm. The development of the bluefin trevally larvae after hatching has been briefly described in a study of changes in the digestive enzymes of the species. The species has depleted its storage of energy from the egg at 3 days old, with a series of transformations including coiling of the gut and fin formation occurring before flexion at 26 days of age. Digestive enzymes active from hatching to 30 days old show an apparent shift from carbohydrate utilisation to protein and lipid utilisation as the larvae grows older. Measurements from juveniles in Hawaii indicate the fish is around 70 mm by 100 days and 130 mm by 200 days. Otolith data fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth curve shows the species grows to 194 mm in its first year, 340 mm in the second and 456 mm in the third year. It reaches 75 cm by 8 years of age and 85 cm by 12 years. This model also suggests a growth of 0.45 mm/day; while laboratory feeding studies found the fish grow at an average of 0.4 mm/day in these confined conditions. The maximum theoretical size indicated from the growth curves is 89.7 cm, much less than the 117 cm reported as the known maximum size. Juveniles often enter estuaries, however the species is not estuary dependent as breeding is known to occur where no estuaries are present, suggesting the use of these habitats is facultative. The fish move from these shallower inshore waters to deeper reefs as they grow. Two hybridisation events in the species are known from Hawaii; the first with the giant trevally, Caranx ignobilis and the second with the bigeye trevally, Caranx sexfasciatus. Both were initially identified as hybrids by intermediate physical characteristics, and were later confirmed by DNA sequencing. It has been suggested these hybrids resulted from mixed species schooling during spawning periods. It is thought that hybridisation is more likely if one or both parent species is rare in an area, which is the case in much of the Main Hawaiian Islands, where overfishing has severely depleted all trevally species populations. Relationship to humans Thai reef The bluefin trevally is an important species to both commercial fisheries and anglers, with the popularity of the fish leading to extensive aquaculture trials. The catch statistics for the bluefin trevally are poorly reported in most of its range, with only parts of the western Indian Ocean supplying information to the FAO. In this region, catch levels have fluctuated between 2 and 50 tonnes in the past decade. Hawaii also keeps catch records, with these showing the species is taken in far less numbers than the giant trevally, with only 704 pounds taken compared to 10 149 lbs of giant trevally in 1998. In Hawaii, the nearshore stocks of the species have been in decline since the early 1900s, with commercial landings dropping over 300% from 1990 to 1991, and have not recovered. Most bluefin trevally sold in Hawaii are now imported from other Indo-Pacific nations. The species is taken by a variety of netting and trapping methods, as well and by hook and line in commercial fisheries. It is usually sold fresh, as well as frozen or salted. The rapid decline in the population has seen a focus on breeding the bluefin trevally in captivity. The species' aquaculture potential was first investigated in a 1975 experiment in French Polynesia, where juveniles of the species were caught in the wild and transported back to a laboratory. The study found the fish grew to a commercial size of 300 g in 6 to 8 months and only suffered a 5% mortality rate. It was concluded that such a technique carried out on a larger scale in lagoons would be promising due to the growth rate and relatively high price commanded by the species at market. Further investigations into the potential for offshore aquaculture were conducted in Hawaii, where the species successfully spawned in captivity. The only barrier in these studies to successful production was problems with commercial food items. An in vitro cell culture has recently been established for the species, which will allow long term management of potential viral diseases that may arise during aquaculture of the fish. The bluefin trevally has been successfully kept in large saltwater aquaria, but require large water volumes to adapt well. The bluefin trevally is one of the premier gamefish of the Indo-Pacific region, although is often overshadowed by its larger cousin, the giant trevally. The fish makes long powerful runs on light tackle, and is a determined fighter. The species readily accepts both bait and lures, with live fish or squid often used as bait and a variety of lures also used on the species. Lures may include poppers, plugs, spoons, jigs, soft plastic lures and even saltwater flies. The species inshore habits make it a popular target for spearfishermen also. In Hawaii the species has bag and size limit restrictions in place to prevent further overexploitation. It is considered to be a good to excellent food fish, however many cases of ciguatera poisoning have been attributed to the bluefin trevally. Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of the toxin in the species flesh, with fish greater than 50 cm likely to be a carrier. The risk of poisoning has also affected the sales of the fish in the marketplace in recent years. Also of concern is one report of infection by a dracunculoid parasite while preparing the fish for eating. In this case, the parasite invaded the victim's body by entering an open wound while he was filleting the species, and is believed to be one of the first records for such cross contamination. The IGFA maintains full line and ripped class records for the bluefin trevally. The all tackle world record for the species stands at 13.24kg (29lb 3oz) taken off Clipperton Island in 2012.

Lawson's father, a carpenter, died when he was eight years old. Career At 12 years old, Lawson ran away from home to become a clerk in a Boston bank and soon began speculating in stocks. Lawson specialized in shares of copper-mining companies, which were then a staple of the Boston stock market, and became a multimillionaire during the copper boom of the late 1890s. He was a principal mover in the promotion of companies trying to establish the small town of Grand Rivers, Kentucky as a major steel- producing city. He built the lavish estate called DreamwoldDreamworld in Scituate, Massachusetts at a cost of $6,000,000. Boston financier Thomas Lawson's residence in Grand Rivers, Kentucky. He promoted the town as the next great steel-making center to rival Pittsburgh and Birmingham. In 1899, he joined Henry H. Rogers and William Rockefeller in forming Amalgamated Copper Mining Company, a company that combined several copper mining companies, mostly in Butte, Montana, and which tried to dominate the copper market. Amalgamated Copper was criticized for years afterward. It became Anaconda Copper Mining Company in 1915. Lawson broke with the financial backers of Amalgamated and became an advocate for financial reform. Lawson was an independent candidate for the United States Senate in 1918. He finished a distant third with 5.26% of the vote. Lawson died in poverty in February 1925. He was buried beside his wife.

Keith Michell, who plays Henry VIII in the TV series, also portrays the king in the film. His six wives are portrayed by different actresses, among them Frances Cuka as Catherine of Aragon, and Jane Asher as Jane Seymour. Donald Pleasence portrays Thomas Cromwell and Bernard Hepton portrays Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, a role he had also played in the miniseries and briefly in its follow-up Elizabeth R. Plot On his deathbed, Henry VIII reflects upon his long reign, and especially the crucial part his six marriages have played. The bulk of the film is depicted in flashback, while the dying Henry is surrounded by his family and courtiers. Henry's first queen is the Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon. The young pair are in the midst of celebrating the birth of their son, only to be told that he has died. Henry and Catherine mourn their child together, and hope for another soon. Many years pass, during which time Catherine only produces one living daughter, Mary. Henry confides to Thomas More that he fears the marriage is cursed by God, as Catherine was previously wed to Henry's late older brother, Arthur, although Catherine proclaimed the marriage was not consummated. Henry woos Anne Boleyn, a lady at court, who refuses to sleep with him unless she is his wife. Henry presses the Vatican to annul his marriage to Catherine. When that fails, he has Cardinal Wolsey removed from office and himself made head of the new Church of England. The marriage annulled, Catherine is sent away from court, and Anne is crowned the new queen. Anne also fails to produce a male heir, giving birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. Henry loses interest in Anne and starts courting Jane Seymour, another lady of the court. Thomas Cromwell, protege of Cardinal Wolsey, observes Henry's interest in Jane and assists him by presenting a false case of Anne's infidelity with various men of the court, including her own brother, George Boleyn. Anne is beheaded in the Tower of London. Henry marries Jane Seymour, who successfully returns Princess Mary to royal favour and has opinions on the matter of religion, asking for pardons for the participants of the Pilgrimage of Grace. Jane gives birth to Henry's long-sought male heir, Edward, but she dies soon after. Henry's courtiers advise him to marry again for diplomatic reasons, with Cromwell pushing for the German Anne of Cleves, of whose portrait Henry approves. However, when she arrives Henry is disappointed that her appearance does not match the image. After a reluctant wedding, he arranges an annulment. At court, Henry is drawn to Catherine Howard, young cousin of Anne Boleyn. Catherine is flattered by Henry's attention. Her uncle, Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, urges her to return his affections. Henry and Catherine marry, with Henry lavishing her with many gifts and jewels. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer discovers that Catherine has had liaisons before her marriage, and presents this knowledge to Henry, who initially disbelieves the charges. Cranmer secures a confession from Catherine, who also admits an affair with Thomas Culpeper during her marriage to Henry. Catherine is beheaded. Henry, now elderly, approaches Catherine Parr, a widow from two previous marriages. Catherine is reluctant, citing her religious views which differ from Henry's, but Henry admits his need for companionship in his old age. The pair marry, and Catherine becomes a loving stepmother to the royal children Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward. At the end of the flashbacks, Catherine Parr is shown waiting by Henry's beside with Princess Mary. Archbishop Cranmer is summoned for Henry's final confession, and Henry dies holding his hand.

History The reforms at Oxford University during the mid-19th century provided the impetus for the establishment of a chair in Celtic, with a major impetus provided by Matthew Arnold's Poetry lectures 'On the Study of Celtic Literature'. At the time that the Royal Commission was established in 1852, there were 19 fellowships and 18 scholarships at Jesus College. Seven of each were limited to those from north Wales, and seven of each to south Wales and Monmouthshire. There were also exhibitions for students from Wales, with the Meyricke bequest making the north Wales exhibitions particularly valuable, despite the lower numbers of residents in north Wales compared to south Wales. The restrictions were said to be \\"ruining the College as a place of education\\", since it took little effort for a Welsh boy to achieve a scholarship or exhibition despite the deficiencies in their education; and many then became Fellows of the college without obtaining anything more than a third or fourth class degree.Hardy, pp. 187-191 The Commissioners appointed in 1852 to consider reforms of the university were known to favour abolishing local restrictions on fellowships and scholarships, such as those requiring the holder to be from a particular school or area. The college therefore proposed to the Commissioners in 1854 that the divisions between north and south Wales fellowships and scholarships should be removed, and that the number of Fellows should be reduced by two in order to endow a Professorship of Welsh.Hardy, pp. 193‚Äì194 The Commissioners, however, proposed that a Fellowship should be devoted to the Laudian Professor of Arabic. The college objected, on the basis that a Celtic Professorship was more appropriate for the college given its Welsh connections, and the Commissioners conceded some ground, allowing the Fellowship to be applied to such purposes as might be decided upon later.Hardy, p. 196 The college's proposal was later adopted, with the first Jesus Professor of Celtic, the distinguished Welsh scholar Sir John Rhys, being elected in 1876. It is the oldest chair in the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages, University of Oxford and is still the only chair in Celtic at an English university. The Professor also controls access to the Celtic Library at Jesus College, a specialist collection for researchers.

He was appointed as the third holder of the Oxford chair in Celtic (originally held by Sir John Rhys) in 1947 and became a Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford at the same time. He was knighted in 1977 and retired the following year back to his birthplace, where he died in 1984. His most important work in the field of Celtic Studies was in Medieval Welsh and Irish, both poetry and prose. He made a particular contribution to the study of tale of Culhwch ac Olwen, and his edition of the tale was published in 1992, after his death, by the assistance of his friends Rachel Bromwich and D.

It is a useful marker in the laboratory diagnosis of heart attack. It occurs in different plasma concentration but the same circumstances as troponin T - either test can be performed for confirmation of cardiac muscle damage and laboratories usually offer one test or the other. Three paralogs with unique tissue-specific expression patterns are expressed in humans, listed below with their locations and OMIM accessions: * Slow- twitch skeletal muscle isoform troponin I, TNNI1 (1q31.3, ) * Fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform troponin I, TNNI2 (11p15.5, ) * Cardiac troponin I, TNNI3 (19q13.4, ) cTnI Cardiac troponin I, often denoted as cTnI, is presented in cardiac muscle tissue by a single isoform with a molecular weight of 23.9 kDa. It consists of 209 amino acid residues. The theoretical pI of cTnI is 9.05. cTnI differs from other troponins due to its N-terminal extension of 26 amino acids. This extension contains two serines, residues 23 and 24, which are phosphorylated by protein kinase A in response to beta- adrenergic stimulation and important in increasing the inotropic response. Phosphorylation of cTnI changes the conformation of the protein and modifies its interaction with other troponins as well as the interaction with anti-TnI antibodies. These changes alter the myofilament response to calcium, and are of interest in targeting heart failure. Multiple reaction monitoring of human cTnI has revealed that there are 14 phosphorylation sites and the pattern of phosphorylation observed these sites is changed in response to disease. cTnI has been shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, protein kinase G, and p21-activated kinase 3. A significant part of cTnI released into the patient's blood stream is phosphorylated. For more than 15 years cTnI has been known as a reliable marker of cardiac muscle tissue injury. It is considered to be more sensitive and significantly more specific in diagnosis of the myocardial infarction than the \\"golden marker\\" of last decades ‚Äì CK-MB, as well as total creatine kinase, myoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes. Troponin I is not entirely specific for myocardial damage secondary to infarction. Other causes of raised Troponin I include chronic kidney failure, heart failure, subarachnoid haemorrhage and pulmonary embolus.Mannu GS, The non-cardiac use and significance of cardiac troponins. Scott Med J, 2014. 59(3): p. 172-8.

Vue Pa Chay, the leader of the revolt, regularly climbed trees to receive military orders from heaven. The French granted the Hmong a special status in 1920, effectively ending the conflict.Fadiman, Anne. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down. The Noonday Press. 1997. 17. The stimulus for the rebellion was heavy taxation by the French and abuse of power by the ethnic Lao and Tai tax collectors. The Hmong people were divided into pro- and anti-French factions. The rebellion, called \\"Rog Paj Cai\\" by the Hmong nationalists and \\"Rog Phim Npab\\" by Hmong who sided with the French, was a self-initiated and self- sustaining movement; all the guns were Hmong-designed and manufactured flintlocks (a bit different from the traditional western flintlock gun). The gunpowder was also of a Hmong type (salt peter, charcoal, and guano was used similar to western black powder, but shavings from a type of tree were added to increase the explositivity). The Hmong won battle after battle for the majority of the rebellion; the French were surprised and did not know how to fight in the jungles nor did they know how to fight a near invisible army. France was also heavily involved in World War I in Europe, and resorted to using 50% French and 50% native Vietnamese, Lao, and Tai, and Hmong soldiers, who all had little desire to fight the rebel Hmong forces. One particular weapon that especially scared the French army was the Hmong cannon, made with the trunk of a tree, and packed with metal pieces from pots, and a lot of Hmong gunpowder. This cannon was designed by Kuab Chav, and is said to have weighed over 200 lbs, such that only one man named Lwv was able to carry it. As the French army came up the mountainous trails, the cannon would spray the metal shards at the French army, sending them into hiding while wounding and killing many of them. They never knew what it was because they assumed the Hmong did not have the technology to build such a weapon. The French morale was also weakened because of rumors that Pa Chay's army was protected by magic. As the French Army chased the Hmong army through the mountainous passes and ravines, they never saw any dead Hmong soldiers. The reason was that Pa Chay had commanded his men to never leave anyone behind, and to cover up the blood as quickly as possible. This gave the illusion to the French that Pa Chay's army was indeed invincible. Kao Mee, a sister of Pa Chay, also played an important role. She carried a white flag made of hemp, which she used to deflect bullets. She is said to have been a righteous virgin, which is why the Heavens allowed her to have such miraculous powers. She led the army into many successes in battle. At its height, the rebellion encompassed 40,000 square kilometres of Indochina, from ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß in Tonkin to Nam Ou in Luang Prabang, and from Muong Cha north of Vientiane to Sam Neua in Laos. As World War I came to an end, the French reinforcements began to outnumber the rebels, and their firepower overpowered the Hmong. They also learned from certain Hmong informants such as Lauj Kiab Toom that the Hmong gunpowder did not work well when wet, so they attacked especially during the monsoon season. The Hmong believed their defeats were temporary, caused by violations of the Oath to Heaven by some of the soldiers, and despite these defeats, there was still strong support from the populace.

This makes it the smallest of the 49 towns in the voivodeship. History The town was founded in the 14th century. A document from 1338 specifies the rules of judicial settlement of potential disputes between people of the town's three main ethnic groups: Poles, Old Prussians and Germans.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom VI, Warsaw, 1885, p. 539 (in Polish) In 1454 the town sided with the Prussian Confederation, at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to the Kingdom of Poland, an event that sparked the Thirteen Years‚Äô War (1454‚Äì1466). In 1455 the town was briefly captured by the Teutonic Knights and the town's mayor was drowned by them in retaliation. After the peace treaty signed in Toru≈Ñ in 1466, the town remained under Polish suzerainty as a fief. In 1628 the town was captured and occupied by the Swedes. In 1773, a year after the First Partition of Poland, the 52nd Fusilier Regiment of Prussia was located in the town. During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1807 French troops entered the town and stayed over a year. Between 1871 and 1945 the area was part of Germany (province of East Prussia). After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union or forced to settle in the area through Operation Vistula in 1947.

Initially, a high-pressure system moves poleward of a north- south mountain range. Once it sloshes over poleward and eastward of the range, the flow around the high banks up against the mountains, forming a barrier jet which funnels cool air down a stretch of land east of the mountains. The higher the mountain chain, the deeper the cold air mass becomes lodged to its east, and the greater impediment it is within the flow pattern and the more resistant it becomes to intrusions of milder air. As the equatorward portion of the system approaches the cold air wedge, persistent low cloudiness, such as stratus, and precipitation such as drizzle develop, which can linger for long periods of time; as long as ten days. The precipitation itself can create or enhance a damming signature, if the poleward high is relatively weak. If such events accelerate through mountain passes, dangerously accelerated mountain-gap winds can result, such as the Tehuantepecer and Santa Ana winds. These events are seen commonly in the northern Hemisphere across central and eastern North America, south of the Alps in Italy, and near Taiwan and Korea in Asia. Events in the southern Hemisphere have been noted in South America east of the Andes. Location This TRMM weather satellite shows the wind impact of a Tehuantepecer from December 16, 2000 at 1315 UTC. Cold air damming typically happens in the mid-latitudes as this region lies within the Westerlies, an area where frontal intrusions are common. When the Arctic oscillation is negative and pressures are higher over the poles, the flow is more meridional, blowing from the direction of the pole towards the equator, which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes.National Snow and Ice Data Center (2009). The Arctic Oscillation. Arctic Climatology and Meteorology. Retrieved on 2009-04-11. Cold air damming is observed in the southern hemisphere to the east of the Andes, with cool incursions seen as far equatorward as the 10th parallel south. In the northern hemisphere, common situations occur along the east side of ranges within the Rocky Mountains system over the western portions of the Great Plains, as well as various other mountain ranges (such as the Cascades) along the west coast of the United States. The initial is caused by the poleward portion of a split upper level trough, with the damming preceding the arrival of the more equatorward portion. Some of the cold air damming events which occur east of the Rockies continue southward to the east of the Sierra Madre Oriental through the coastal plain of Mexico through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Further funneling of cool air occurs within the Isthmus, which can lead to winds of gale and hurricane-force, referred to as a Tehuantepecer. Other common instances of cold air damming take place on the coastal plain of east-central North America, between the Appalachian Mountains and Atlantic Ocean. In Europe, areas south of the Alps can be prone to cold air damming. In Asia, cold air damming has been documented near Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula. The cold surges on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, Iceland, New Zealand, and eastern Asia differ from the cold air damming east of the Appalachians due to the wider mountain ranges, sloping terrain, and lack of an eastern body of warm water. Development The usual development of CAD is when a cool high-pressure area wedges in east of a north-south oriented mountain chain. As a system approaches from the west, a persistent cloud deck with associated precipitation forms and lingers across the region for prolonged periods of time. Temperature differences between the warmer coast and inland sections east of the terrain can exceed 36 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), with rain near the coast and frozen precipitation, such as snow, sleet, and freezing rain, falling inland during colder times of the year. In the Northern Hemisphere, two-thirds of such events occur between October and April, with summer events preceded by the passage of a backdoor cold front. In the Southern Hemisphere, they have been documented to occur between June and November. Cold air damming events which occur when the parent surface high-pressure system is relatively weak, with a central pressure below , or remaining a progressive feature (move consistently eastward), can be significantly enhanced by cloudiness and precipitation itself. Clouds and precipitation act to increase sea level pressure in the area by 1.5 to 2.0 mb ( 0.04 to 0.06 inHg). When the surface high moves offshore, the precipitation itself can cause the CAD event. Detection=Detection algorithm Map of the labeled weather stations in the Southeastern US that are suitable for use in the CAD detection algorithm :: abla ^2 x = \\\\frac{ \\\\frac{x_{3}-x_{2} }{d_{2-3}} - \\\\frac{x_2 - x_1}{d_{1-2}}} {\\\\frac{1}{2}(d_{2-3}+d_{1-2})} This algorithm is used to identify the specific type of CAD events based on the surface pressure ridge, its associated cold dome, and ageostrophic northeasterly flow which flows at a significant angle to the isobaric pattern. These values are calculated using hourly data from surface weather observations. The Laplacian of sea level pressure or potential temperature in the mountain-normal‚Äîperpendicular to the mountain chain‚Äîdirection provides a quantitative measure of the intensity of a pressure ridge or associated cold dome. The detection algorithm is based upon Laplacians ( abla ^2 x ) evaluated for three mountain-normal lines constructed from surface observations in and around the area affected by the cold air damming‚Äîthe damming region. The \\"x\\" denotes either sea level pressure or potential temperature (Œ∏) and the subscripts 1‚Äì3 denote stations running from west to east along the line, while the \\"d\\" represents the distance between two stations. Negative Laplacian values are typically associated with pressure maxima at the center station, while positive Laplacian values usually correspond to colder temperatures in the center of the section. Effects The sky during cold air damming events is dominated by stratus clouds during the cold season When cold air damming occurs, it allows for cold air to surge toward the equator in the affected area. In calm, non-stormy situations, the cold air will advance unhindered until the high-pressure area can no longer exert any influence because of a lack of size or its leaving the area. The effects of cold air damming become more prominent (and also more complicated) when a storm system interacts with the spreading cold air. The effects of cold air damming east of the Cascades in Washington are strengthened by the bowl or basin-like topography of Eastern Washington. Cold Arctic air flowing south from British Columbia through the Okanogan River valley fills the basin, blocked to the south by the Blue Mountains. Cold air damming causes the cold air to bank up along the eastern Cascade slopes, especially into the lower passes, such as Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens Pass. Milder, Pacific-influenced air moving east over the Cascades is often forced aloft by the cold air in the passes, held in place by cold air damming east of the Cascades. As a result, the passes often receive more snow than higher areas in the Cascades, which supports skiing at Snoqualmie and Stevens passes. A high-pressure area centered over the Great Basin gives rise to a Santa Ana wind event as the airmass flows through the passes and canyons of southern California, manifesting as a dry northeasterly wind. The situation during Tehuantepecers and Santa Ana wind events are more complicated, as they occur when air rushing southward due to cold air damming east of the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Nevada respectively, is accelerated when it moves through gaps in the terrain. The Santa Ana is further complicated by downsloped air, or foehn winds, drying out and warming up in the lee of the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges, leading to a dangerous wildfire situation. The wedge The effect known as \\"the wedge\\" is the most widely known example of cold air damming. In this scenario, the more equatorward storm system will bring warmer air with it above the surface (at around ). This warmer air will ride over the cooler air at the surface, which is being held in place by the poleward high-pressure system. This temperature profile, known as a temperature inversion, will lead to the development of drizzle, rain, freezing rain, sleet, or snow. When it is above freezing at the surface, drizzle or rain could result. Sleet, or Ice pellets, form when a layer of above-freezing air exists with sub-freezing air both above and below it. This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer. As they fall back into the sub- freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets. However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and freezing rain will be the result at the surface. A thicker or stronger cold layer, where the warm layer aloft does not significantly warm above the melting point, will lead to snow. Blocking Blocking occurs when a well-established poleward high-pressure system lies near or within the path of the advancing storm system. The thicker the cold air mass is, the more effectively it can block an invading milder air mass. The depth of the cold air mass is normally shallower than the mountain barrier which created the CAD. Some events across the Intermountain West can last for ten days. Pollutants and smoke can remain suspended within the stable air mass of a cold air dam. Erosion Smoke rising in Lochcarron, Scotland, is stopped by a temperature inversion and its related overlying layer of warmer air It is often more difficult to forecast the erosion of a CAD event than its development. Numerical models tend to underestimate the event's duration. The bulk Richardson number, Ri, calculates vertical wind shear to help forecast erosion. The numerator corresponds to the strength of the inversion layer separating the CAD cold dome and the immediate atmosphere above. The denominator expresses the square of the vertical wind shear across the inversion layer. Small values of the Richardson number result in turbulent mixing that can weaken the inversion layer and aid the deterioration of the cold dome, leading to the end of the CAD event. :: Ri = \\\\frac{g\\\\Delta \\\\theta _{v}/\\\\theta _{v}}{[(\\\\Delta U)^2 + (\\\\Delta V)^{2}]/\\\\Delta Z} Cold advection aloft One of the most effective erosion mechanisms is the import of colder air‚Äîalso known as cold air advection‚Äîaloft. With cold advection maximized above the inversion layer, cooling aloft can weaken in the inversion layer, which allows for mixing and the demise of CAD. The Richardson number is reduced by the weakening inversion layer. Cold advection favors subsidence and drying, which supports solar heating beneath the inversion. Solar heating Solar heating has the ability to erode a CAD event by heating the surface in the absence of a thick overcast. However, even a shallow stratus layer during the cold season can render solar heating ineffective. During breaks of overcast for the warm season, absorption of solar radiation at the surface warms the cold dome, once again lowering the Richardson number and promoting mixing. Near-surface divergence In the United States, as a high-pressure system moves eastward out to the Atlantic, northerly winds are reduced along the southeast coast. If northeasterly winds persist in the southern damming region, net divergence is implied. Near-surface divergence reduces the depth of the cold dome as well as aid the sinking of air, which can reduce cloud cover. The reduction of cloud cover permits solar heating to effectively warm the cold dome from the surface up. Shear-induced mixing The strong static stability of a CAD inversion layer usually inhibits turbulent mixing, even in the presence of vertical wind shear. However, if the shear strengthens in addition to a weakening of the inversion, the cold dome becomes vulnerable to shear-induced mixing. Unlike solar heating, this CAD event erosion happens from the top down. Mixing occurs when the depth of the northeasterly flow becomes increasingly shallow and strong southerly flow makes a downward progression resulting in high shear. Frontal advance Erosion of a cold dome will typically first occur near the fringes where the layer is relatively shallow. As mixing progresses and the cold dome erodes, the boundary of the cold air ‚Äì often indicated as a coastal or warm front ‚Äì will move inland, diminishing the width of the cold dome. Classifying Southeastern United States events This shows the CAD spectrum in terms of intensity and relative contribution of diabatic processes to synoptic-scale forcing. (a) is the original scheme and (b) is the revised scheme. An objective scheme has been developed to classify certain types of CAD events in the Southeastern United States. Each scheme is based on the strength and location of the parent high-pressure system. Classical Classical CAD events are characterized by dry synoptic forcing, partial diabatic contribution, and a strong parent anticyclone (high-pressure system) located to the north of the Appalachian damming region. A strong high-pressure system usually is defined as having a central pressure over . The northeastern United States is the most favorable location for the high-pressure system in classical CAD events. For diabatically enhanced classical events, at 24 hours prior to the onset of CAD, a prominent 250-mb jet extends from southwest to northeast across eastern North America. A general area of troughing is present at the 500- and 250-mb levels west of the jet. The parent high-pressure system is centered over the upper Midwest beneath the 250-mb jet entrance region, setting up conditions for CAD east of the Rocky Mountains. For dry onset classical events, the 250-mb jet is weaker and centered farther east relative to the diabatically enhanced classical events. The jet also does not extend as far southwest compared to diabatically enhanced classical CAD events. The center of the high-pressure system is farther east, so ridging extends southward into the south-central eastern United States. Although both types of classical events begin differently, their results are very similar. Hybrid When the parent anticyclone is weaker or not ideally located, the diabatic process must start to contribute in order to develop CAD. In scenarios where there is an equal contribution from dry synoptic forcing and diabatic processes, it is considered a hybrid damming event. The 250-mb jet is weaker and slightly farther south relative to a classical composite 24 hours prior to CAD onset. With the surface parent high farther west, it builds in eastward into the northern Great Plains and western Great Lakes region, located beneath a region of confluent flow from the 250-mb jet. In-situ In-situ events are the weakest and often most short lived out of CAD event types. These events occur during the absence of ideal synoptic conditions, when the anticyclone position is highly unfavorable located well offshore. In some in situ cases, the barrier pressure gradient is largely due to a cyclone to the southwest rather than the anticyclone to the northeast. Diabatic processes lead to the stabilization of an air mass approaching the Appalachians. Diabatic processes are essential for in-situ events. These events often lead to weak, narrow damming. Representation of typical geographical locations for the development of each type of CAD event. The areas are separated by where the parent anticyclone is located for CAD onset. Prediction=Overview Weather forecasts during CAD events are especially prone to inaccuracies. Precipitation type and daily high temperatures are especially difficult to predict. Numerical weather models tend to be more accurate in predicting the development of a CAD event, and less accurate in predicting their erosion. Manual forecasting can provide more accurate forecasts. An experienced human forecaster will use numerical models as a guide, but account for the model's inaccuracies and shortcomings. Example case The Appalachian CAD event of October 2002 illustrates some shortcomings of short-term weather models for predicting a CAD event. This event was characterized by a stable saturated layer of cold air from surface up to the 700mb pressure level over the states of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This mass of cold air was blocked by the Appalachians and did not dissipate even as a coastal cyclone to east strengthened. During this event, short term weather models predicted this cold mass clearing, leading to fairer weather conditions for the region such as warmer conditions and the absence of a layer of stratus clouds. However, the model performed poorly because they did not account for excessive solar radiation transmission through the cloud layers and shallow mixing promoted by the model's convective parameterization scheme. While these errors have been corrected in updated models, they resulted in an inaccurate forecast.

H√∂gvaktsterrassen (, \\"Main Guard Terrace\\") is a street in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden passing west of Yttre Borg√•rden, the outer court of the Stockholm Palace. The street stretches north from the Stockholm Cathedral at Storkyrkobrinken and ends in a terrace offering a panoramic view of the Riksdag Building, the square Mynttorget and the northern ramp of the palace, Lejonbacken. It is delimited to the east by the two curved western wings of the Royal Palace, and to the west by a state-owned annex composed by the Oxenstierna Palace and Beijer House and serving as offices and the workrooms of the court. History The area north of the cathedral and west of the Medieval palace Tre Kronor (\\"Three Crowns\\"), burnt down in 1697, was known as Helvetet (\\"Hell\\"). The background of this atrocious name have been subject for some scholarly disputes; some suggesting it reflexes the popular belief the area north of churches were the location of evil (and therefore suitable for suicides and criminals), while other found references in Norse folklore where the \\"Kingdom of the Dead\\" was believed to be located to the north, and, 'Hell' still not associated with the pejorative meaning of today, was simply used to indicate northern locations in general. Historical records from the 15th century describes the area as the location for the city's executioner during the years 1491‚Äì1528, and for the city's school building and the royal mint in the 1430s. Among the numerous alleys once found in the area were many craftsmen's workshops - shoemakers, saddlers, blacksmiths, bakers, etcetera. On a 16th-century map, the area is taken up by a slope leaning north with a block occupying the location for the present street, a block not present on a map dated 1626, instead suggesting the royal gardens were located here. In 1653, the Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna (1583‚Äì1654) started to build his palace still present on the south-western corner of the street, while both his old residence and that of Herman Wrangel (1587‚Äì1643) were demolished in the 1740s when the wings of the Main Guard were built. In 1921, it was suggested the street should be named Kristina Gyllenstiernas skans (\\"Sconce of. .\\") after Christina Gyllenstierna (1494‚Äì1559), wife of Sten Sture the Younger (1493‚Äì1520), whose statue, found nearby at the time, reminded of her bravely defence of the palace against the Danish army in 1520. However, some discussions concerning the city's right and need to name the location in the first place, eventually resulted in the present name suggested by the linguist Adolf Noreen (1854‚Äì1925). Oxenstierna Palace The Oxenstierna Palace Designed by Jean de la Vall√©e (1620‚Äì1696), the palace of the mighty chancellor Axel Oxenstierna was started in 1653 shortly before the death of the proprietor. The present building, merely a wing of the huge palace originally intended for the site, introduced the Roman palace architecture acting by means of elaborately decorated windows on a plain plastered wall. The interplay with the urban setting is underlined by the projecting parts of the southern fa√ßade being aligned to the street and thus not perpendicular to the fa√ßade. The building is unique for the well preserved exterior, including the various sandstone decorations, and the alternating mezzanines of the five storeys, and the interior, including decorative 17th century hinges. Notwithstanding the name, the Oxenstierna dynasty never actually lived in the building, instead serving as offices since its completion. The equivalent of the Bank of Sweden occupied the building in the end of the 17th century, and it has been the property of the Swedish State since. (.) Beijer House Named after Johan von Beijer (-1669), a man of German origin appointed postmaster in 1642, who bought two buildings on the site that same year to replace them with his own residence, accordingly the only post office in the capital until his death. The brick cellar vaults of the two Medieval buildings are still preserved, and the building is the only burgher residence with a preserved 17th century courtyard. Two storeys were added during the 18th and 19th centuries, and in 1918 it became the property of the state and was subsequently merged with the Oxenstierna Palace. The building was declared a historical monument in 1949 and is today occupied by the accountants of the Parliament, the unique interiors and courtyard thus not accessible to the public.

Early life and education Thomas Grissell was born in Shoreditch, Middlesex, the eldest son of Thomas de la Garde Grissell, who worked with the East India Company. He was educated at St. Paul's School, London and intended to train in medicine. In 1815 his family articled him to Henry Peto, his uncle, a leading public works contractor. Career Grissell took to the business and became Peto's partner in 1825. After Henry Peto died in 1830, Grissell took as partner his cousin Samuel Morton Peto, who had married his sister Mary. Port, M. H., \\"Grissell, Thomas (1801-1874)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2006, accessed 16 Feb 2007 The new partnership was called Grissell and Peto. Together Grissell and Peto built up a rapidly growing business, controlling all their operations from stone-quarrying to the manufacture of fittings for their buildings. Grissell claimed to have made innovations in building technique, including a form of braced and bolted timber scaffolding. They were awarded the contract for Birmingham Grammar School (with Charles Barry as architect). They next constructed a number of prestigious buildings in London, including Hungerford Market in the Strand; Nelson's Column; the Reform Club, Conservative Club, Oxford and Cambridge Club, Clerkenwell Prison, the Lyceum Theatre and St. James' Theatre. The firm became engaged in railway building, including parts of the Great Western Railway and the South Eastern Railway. Not liking the risks involved in these massive public works projects, Grissell dissolved the partnership in 1846. Grissell had numerous contracts for work building the Houses of Parliament, again with Charles Barry as architect. But, due to a dispute about the pricing of some of the refined craftwork, Grissell was not able to fully complete the building. Private life One of his sons was Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, the Catholic tractarian. Two of his brothers, Henry and Martin, founded the Regent's Canal Iron foundry and constructed major ironworks. As a result of the profits from his business, Thomas Grissell was able to live well. From about 1847 he lived at 19 Kensington Gardens, London in one of a pair of houses designed in Barry's offices and built by Grissell's firm. He used surplus stone selected for the project of the Houses of Parliament. There his family had a staff of 9 servants. In 1850 he bought Norbury Park in Mickleham, Surrey. There he was appointed a magistrate, and in 1853, high sheriff of the county. While at Norbury Park, he collected Italian and English paintings and sculptures. Thomas died there in 1874 and was buried in the churchyard at St. Michael's Church in Mickleham. He left an estate of under ¬£200,000.

It was released on June 19, 2007. The novel marks another thematic shift in the series; the first through seventh novels focus on Stephanie learning her trade as a bounty hunter, and the travails that come as she tries to apprehend a particular fugitive. The eighth through twelfth novels feature Stephanie coping with being stalked by criminals for various reasons; Lean Mean Thirteen, and several of the subsequent novels, focus on Stephanie getting caught up in the search for a missing person, in a manner related only peripherally, or not at all, to her work as a fugitive apprehension agent. Plot summary Stephanie's path crosses again with that of her despised ex-husband, Richard \\"Dickie\\" Orr, while doing a favour for Ranger. When Dickie is later discovered missing from his apartment under some rather violent circumstances, Stephanie becomes the prime suspect in his apparent murder.  Synopsis  On the pretext of seeking legal advice from Dickie, Stephanie drops by his office, hoping to plant a listening device on him. The meeting goes downhill when she notices a recent photo of him and her archenemy, Joyce Barnhardt (Stephanie divorced Dickie after catching him in flagrante with Joyce). Dickie makes the mistake of remembering his affair with Joyce as an amusing lark, and ends up on the floor of his office with Stephanie's hands around his throat, before her friends Connie and Lula pry her away. In a fit of indignation, Stephanie snatches a desk clock off Dickie's desk, declaring that it was a wedding present from her aunt. Later that evening, Stephanie's on-again/off-again boyfriend, detective Joe Morelli, is told that Dickie has disappeared, and there are signs that he has been abducted or murdered from his house. Because of her earlier altercation with Dickie, Morelli tells Stephanie that she might be a suspect in his disappearance. Joyce Barnhardt has no trouble believing it, and reports Stephanie to both the Trenton police and the press. When she is questioned by the police, Stephanie is stunned to learn that Dickie never changed his will after their divorce, which means she will inherit everything. Morelli tells Stephanie that he has to go underground on an assignment, and reluctantly suggests that she enlist Ranger's help with protection and in tracking Dickie down. Stephanie confronts Ranger, wanting to know why he wanted the bug planted. He explains that the brother of one of his employees, Ziggy Zabar, an accountant, prepared the taxes for Dickie's law firm, but disappeared. A few days later, Ziggy's dead body washes ashore, shot through the head. While snooping through Joyce's house, Stephanie finds handwritten notes that lead her to an account in Dickie's name with Smith Barney that was recently emptied of $40 million. Following his trail around Trenton, Stephanie stumbles onto the bodies of two of Dickie's three partners, both of whom have been killed with a flamethrower. Both of the buildings in which the bodies are found have been rigged with bombs, forcing Stephanie and Ranger to make a hasty exit before they explode. Joyce, convinced that Stephanie knows where Dickie or the $40 million is, follows her around, inveigling herself into a family dinner at the Plum home, and even saves her from a musclebound thug trying to kidnap her. When she drops by Morelli's house to borrow some DVDs for Lula, Stephanie finds Dickie, alive and well, living there under protective custody. Morelli admits that Dickie turned himself in to the police a few days after his disappearance, and offered to testify against his partners, but that he only trusted Morelli to protect him. Dickie explains that he was recruited by the other three partners of the law firm - Roland Petiak, Victor Gorvich, and Peter Smullen - to be the \\"token real lawyer\\" in the firm, which was being used as a front for a sort of modern triangle trade: Petiak's men stole guns from military depots and Smullen traded the guns to several South American drug cartels, in exchange for drugs being sold on the streets of Trenton. Except for Dickie, all the partners' income came from illegal gun and drug sales, reported as attorney's fees on the firm's tax reports. Dickie swears that he didn't know about any of this until Ziggy Zabar disappeared, and the next day he overheard Petiak saying he had been eliminated. Dickie emptied the firm's Smith Barney account and was preparing to leave the country when Stephanie visited his office and unknowingly stole the key card to the account (hidden in the desk clock). When the partners came looking for their money, they sent thugs to Dickie's house, and he fled. Morelli shrewdly guesses that Dickie has little to no interest in testifying against his partners; his sole motive is to get the key back from Stephanie, which is why he is trying to stay close to Morelli. Stephanie also guesses that Petiak has eliminated his two other partners and now knows that she has the key, after interrogating Dickie. Surprised, Stephanie remembers that she left the desk clock in her rundown Crown Victoria after it broke down, and Ranger had it towed to a salvage yard. After visiting her parents, Stephanie is ambushed by Petiak and two thugs, who demand the key. Stephanie guides them to the salvage yard, where she manages to slip free, run into the foreman's office and lock the door. Petiak tries to use his flamethrower on the door, but the flames ricochet and set him on fire, and he topples to his death into an activated garbage crusher. Stephanie finds a phone and calls Morelli, who arrives followed by Ranger, Dickie and Joyce. Joyce is infuriated to hear that Dickie has lost the $40 million, calls him a waste of her time, and storms away. After the investigation is completed, Stephanie and Morelli return to his house. Morelli regretfully reports that, since there is no evidence of criminal activity in the firm's records, and Dickie appears to be guilty of nothing more than \\"being stupid and devious\\", he will likely end up as sole owner of the office property and the $40 million. Stephanie is galled, but Morelli tells her that \\"justice has a way of prevailing\\", and something may yet still happen to prevent Dickie from claiming the money. He also reminds her that, thanks to her tantrum, Joyce is no longer involved with Dickie and won't be getting any share of the money.

Early years Haney starred in basketball in Pennsylvania at Mt. Lebanon High School southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated in 1967. After considering Cornell and Rutgers, he played college basketball under head coach Dick Harter in the Ivy League at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he majored in chemical engineering. He sat out his freshman season after two surgeries for a dislocated kneecap, then played three seasons for the Quakers. He was voted the team's \\"most inspirational\\" player as a senior, as Penn won its first 28 games before falling in the Elite Eight to Philly neighbor Villanova. Haney earned a B.S.Ch.E. degree from Penn in 1971. Coaching When Harter was hired at Oregon 1971, Haney chose coaching over engineering and became a graduate assistant on the Ducks' staff, and was elevated to assistant coach the next year.

He had one year remaining on his contract, at just under $36,700 annually. Haney was succeeded in Eugene by Don Monson, who had posted a 100‚Äì41 () record in five years at Idaho in Moscow, with significant success against the northwest Pac-10 schools (3‚Äì0 against Haney's Ducks).

Crazy Dips comes in two flavours: Strawberry and Cola, though the Strawberry is by far the most common variant. This product was developed by a Korean company named Jeongwoo Confectionery. Jeongwoo was a producer of popping candy (pop rocks) for Asian markets since 1985. When the company produced popping candy, they used a certain sizes of popping candy. The acceptable particles size for the popping candy was from 0.5 mm to 5.16 mm. But these quality standards were made a headache to the company because there were always some powders which were out of the standard size ranges. A general manager of Jeongwoo tried to find a solution to use the remaining powders. One day, he got an idea that he used a lollipop dipping the powder. Jeongwoo developed new concept of candy in the market which was a dipping candy. This company introduced the new product to Chupa Chups.

The DVD compiles music videos from the band's albums Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, Significant Other, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, Results May Vary and The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1).  Production and content  A greatest hits album was announced for release as early as 2001. While recording the albums Results May Vary and The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1), the band continued to work on the compilation. A companion album, Greatest Hitz, was also released. Greatest Hitz contains material from the band's albums Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, Significant Other, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water and Results May Vary. Fred Durst began to take interest in directing late in 1997, directing the band's music video for \\"Faith\\". Before directing the final music video featured on this compilation, Durst filmed an early version in promotion for its appearance in the film Very Bad Things, but was unsatisfied with it. The final music video, as featured on this DVD, paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, who appeared in the video. The video for \\"Re-Arranged\\" reflects on the criticisms surrounding the band following their performance at Woodstock '99. Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event's controversy, and directed a video in which the band receives death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowning in milk while performing the song. The ending of the video sets up the concept for the band's next video, \\"N 2 Gether Now\\", which featured Method Man and Pauly Shore, and was inspired by Inspector Clouseau's fights with his butler, Cato Fong, in the Pink Panther film series. However, the videos for \\"Sour\\", \\"Take a Look Around\\", \\"The Truth\\" and \\"Home Sweet Home/Bittersweet Symphony\\", as well as the few videos from New Old Songs are missing.  Music and lyrics  The music of Greatest Videoz has predominately been described as nu metal and is noted for \\"kinetic, frenzied energy\\". On this compilation, DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, \\"I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. [...] It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player.\\" Wes Borland's guitar playing on this compilation is experimental and nontraditional, and is noted for creative use of six and seven-string guitars. The songs from Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ feature him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing on this album also makes use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland's guitar playing also has unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. His breakup with her inspired the Significant Other songs \\"Nookie\\" and \\"Re- Arranged\\".

In 1924, Lunn served in Ramsay MacDonald's short-lived First Labour Government as Secretary for Overseas Trade, a junior ministerial post subordinate to the President of the Board of Trade. When the Second Labour Government took office in June 1929, Lunn was appointed as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. He was moved in December that year to the post of Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and held that position until the formation of the National Government in August 1931. From 1931 until 1936, Lunn served on the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.

When the wheel rotates, asymmetries in its mass distribution may cause it to apply periodic forces and torques to the axle, which can cause ride disturbances, usually as vertical and lateral vibrations, and this may also cause the steering wheel to oscillate. The frequency and magnitude of this ride disturbance usually increases with speed, and vehicle suspensions may become excited when the rotating frequency of the wheel equals the resonant frequency of the suspension. Tire balance is measured in factories and repair shops by two methods: with static balancers and with dynamic balancers. Tires with large unbalances are downgraded or rejected. When tires are fitted to wheels at the point of sale, they are measured again on a balancing machine, and correction weights are applied to counteract their combined unbalance. Tires may be rebalanced if driver perceives excessive vibration. Tire balancing is distinct from wheel alignment. Static balance Physics of tire imbalance Static balance requires the wheel center of mass to be located on its axis of rotation, usually at the center of the axle on which it is mounted. Static balance can be measured by a static balancing machine where the tire is placed on a vertical, non-rotating spindle. If the center of mass of the tire is not located on this vertical axis, then gravity will cause the axis to deflect. The amount of deflection indicates the magnitude of the unbalance, and the orientation of the deflection indicates the angular location of the unbalance. In tire manufacturing factories, static balancers use sensors mounted to the spindle assembly. In tire retail shops, static balancers are usually non- rotating bubble balancers, where the magnitude and angle of the unbalance is indicated by the center bubble in an oil-filled glass sighting gauge. While some very small shops that lack specialized machines still do this process, they have been largely replaced in larger shops with machines. Dynamic balance Dynamic balance requires that a principal axis of the tire's moment of inertia be aligned with the axis about which the tire rotates, usually the axle on which it is mounted. In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a balancing machine test wheel, the assembly is rotated at 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces of unbalance are measured by sensors. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for the inner and outer planes of the wheel, and compared to the unbalance tolerance (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits). If the tire is not checked, it has the potential to cause vibration in the suspension of the vehicle on which it is mounted. In tire retail shops, tire/wheel assemblies are checked on a spin-balancer, which determines the amount and angle of unbalance. Balance weights are then fitted to the outer and inner flanges of the wheel. Although dynamic balance is theoretically better than static balance, because both dynamic and static imbalances can be measured and corrected, its effectiveness is disputed because of the flexible nature of the rubber. A tire in a free spinning machine may not experience the same centrifugal distortion, heat distortion, nor weight and camber that it would on a vehicle. Dynamic balancing may therefore create new unintended imbalances. Dynamic balancing has traditionally required removing the wheel from the vehicle, but sensors installed in modern cars, such as for anti-lock brakes, enable estimating the imbalance while driving. The physics of dynamic balance To a first approximation, which neglects deformations due to its elasticity, the wheel is a rigid rotor that is constrained to rotate about its axle. If a principal axis of the wheel's moment of inertia is not aligned with the axle, due to an asymmetric mass distribution, then an external torque, perpendicular to the axle, is necessary to force the wheel to rotate about the axle. This additional torque must be provided by the axle and its orientation rotates continuously with the wheel. The reaction to this torque, by Newton's Third Law is applied to the axle, which transfers it to the suspension and can cause it to vibrate. Automotive technicians can reduce this vibration to an acceptable level when balancing the wheel by adding small masses to the inner and outer wheel rims that bring the principal axis into alignment with the axle. Vehicle vibration Vibration in automobiles may occur for many reasons, such as wheel unbalance, imperfect tire or wheel shape, brake pulsation, and worn or loose driveline, suspension, or steering components. Foreign material, such as road tar, stones, ice, or snow, that is stuck in a tire's tread or otherwise adhered to the tire or wheel may also cause a temporary unbalance and subsequent vibration. Environmental consequences Every year, millions of small weights are attached to wheels by automotive technicians balancing them. Traditionally, these weights have been made of lead; it is estimated that up to 500,000 pounds of lead, having fallen off car wheels, ended up in the environment. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, worldwide these total more than 20,000 tonnes of lead annually,National Lead Free Wheel Weight Initiative (NLFWWI). epa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-26. and therefore the use of less-toxic materials is encouraged. In Europe, lead weights have been banned since 2005; in the US, some states have also banned them. Alternatives are weights made of lead alloys that include zinc or copper, or weights that are altogether lead-free. In addition, internal tire balancing products are a feasible alternative to tire balancing. They are products which are inserted into the tire when it is mounted to the rim, thus, eliminating the use of hammer-on weights or tape weights.

He was the brother of the acclaimed Persian poets Forough Farrokhzad and Pooran Farrokhzad. Farrokhzad was forced into exile after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and after relocating to Germany was the victim of an unsolved murder. The murder is widely believed to be the work of the Islamic Republic government of Iran, as part of the chain murders in 1988‚Äì98. Early life and career Fereydoun Farrokhzad was born in Tehran, to career military officer Colonel Mohammad Bagher Farrokhzad (originally from Tafresh) and his wife Touran Vaziri-Tabar.Michael C. Hillman, A lonely woman: Forugh Farrokhzad and her poetry, Washington, D.C.: Mage Publishers, 1987, p. 7. He was the fourth of seven children (Pooran, Amir (Masoud), Forough, Fereydoun, Gloria, Mehrdad, and Mehran). After graduating from high school he went to Germany and Austria for his post-secondary education. He received his doctorate in Political Science from Munich University. At a young age Fereydoun had a passion for poetry and for singing. He turned that passion to reality in 1962 when he started writing poems in German which were published in two German newspapers. In 1964 he published his collection of poems called \\"Fasleh Deegar\\" (Another Season). His book was critically acclaimed and was honored by many German poets. Five months after the release of \\"Fasleh Deegar\\", Fereydoun Farrokhzad received the Poetry Award of Berlin. For a couple of years Farrokhzad was a member of the Munich Academy of Poetry. In 1966 he found his way to the Television and Radio of Munich. On Radio he had a comedy and music program which played middle eastern music including music from Iran. On TV he created and produced a show called ÿÆŸäÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜ Ÿáÿß€å ÿ¢ŸÑŸæ (Alpine Roads). In 1967 he returned to Iran and performed on successful radio and TV shows. His most successful TV show was \\"Mikhakeh Noghrei\\" (Silver Carnation), and his radio show which aired every other Friday mornings called \\"Jom'eh Bazzar\\" (Friday Bazaar). The TV show was watched by millions of Iranians. On the show Farrokhzad introduced and discovered a number of Iranian artists including Sattar, Shohreh, Shahram Solati, Ebi, Morteza, Rouhi Savoji, Hamid Shabkhiz, Leila Forouhar, Saeed Mohammadi, and various others. After the 1979 revolution, Farrokhzad was imprisoned, then released. He escaped the country and settled in the country of his youth college years, Germany. Political views According to Voice of America, Farrokhzad was known by his fans as an \\"educated patriot\\" who frequently criticized the Islamic Republic and its leaders and who was present during many demonstrations against the clerical government. Farrokhzad produced a weekly radio show for the \\"Voice of the Flag of Freedom Organization of Iran,\\" the radio station of the Organization of Kaviyani Banner, an \\"organization of exiled supporters of the Iranian monarchy.\\" Farrokhzad also acted in a film, I Love Vienna, which was considered by some Iranian authorities as anti-Islamic. Personal life Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh has proposed that Farrokhzad was homosexual. He said: \\"His main obstacle was the homosexuality that he was not ashamed of; he knew it and he wanted people to understand it.\\" However, no record of such statement was found about Farrokhzad. Farrokhzad married and divorced twice. His first marriage took place in 1962, to a German-Polish woman named Ania Buchkowski, whom he met in Oxford. Like Farrokhzad, she had a passion for poetry and theater; it was after meeting her that Farrokhzad started writing poems. The result of this marriage was a son named Rostam. Farrokhzad and Ania later separated and got divorced. In 1974 he married an Iranian woman named Taraneh. Death Farrokhzad's grave in Nordfriedhof, Bonn, Germany. On August 8, 1992 Farrokhzad's body was found in the kitchen of his apartment in Bonn, Germany after neighbours reported barking by his two dogs. Farrokhzad had been killed violently, having been stabbed repeatedly in the face and upper torso. Many urban legends surround Farrokhzad's death, including the widely repeated myth that he was beheaded. Prior to his murder, Farrokzhad had been involved in producing an opposition radio program and reportedly received death threats. In his show the Royal Albert Hall in London he criticized Khomeini and made fun of Khomeini's obsession with sex in his Ressaleh book, which followed death threats and concerns for him. According to the U.S. state-funded Voice of America (VOA), the murder was \\"widely believed to be the work of Iran's Islamic government\\". Legacy Farrokhzad remains a significant Iranian cultural icon whose popular music and television programs continue to be circulated through various media platforms. His murder‚Äîa political assassination of a celebrity activist entertainer‚Äîis a well known and oft- cited event amongst Iranians.

Students for a Democratic Society members formed in a black bloc during an anti-war demonstration in DC. The March 17, 2007 anti-war protest was an anti-war demonstration sponsored by ANSWER Coalition that marched from Constitution Gardens in Washington, D.C. to The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The date was selected to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, and also the 40th anniversary of a similar anti-war march on October 21, 1967. Organizers estimated 15,000 to 30,000 protesters attended, while the police gave informal estimates of 10,000 to 20,000. Cindy Sheehan, a prominent opponent of the war, and who lost a son in the war, declared, \\"We want the people in the White House out of our house and arrested for crimes against humanity,\\" and called the president and his military advisers \\"war criminals.\\" Other protesters demanded that the U.S. stop perpetrating human rights abuses, and that the prison camps at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba be closed. Several protesters, dressed in orange outfits and black bags over their heads to simulate the prisoners, portrayed the image that America has lost its moral standing and has now become a nation that oppresses human rights. There was a sub-protest organized primarily by members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) organization, which formed a black bloc at the corner of 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue NW in Washington, and marched alongside the main group for much of the march's route. The black bloc separated just before the main march entered the Pentagon's north parking lot, and attempted to march closer to the Pentagon. Pentagon Police and Virginia State Police officers responding to the splinter march used concussive grenades and threatened to use less than lethal chemical crowd control agents. The black bloc had a two to three hour sit-in, and after that took a vote and decided to return to Washington. They followed the route of the original protest, except now blocking traffic, and knocking over construction barricades. The bloc was ultimately dispersed near where the protest originally gathered by MPDC officers on bicycles, and Park Police officers in riot gear. At least two were arrested. The war protest was preceded by a prayer service in the National Cathedral Friday night, the evening before the march. Speakers at the ecumenical protest called the war in Iraq \\"an offense against God.\\" After prayers in the cathedral, the Christian protesters walked with battery-powered candles toward the White House and continued the calls for peace. After dark police arrested 222 of the protesters near Lafayette Park for disobeying lawful order, or crossing a police line. The gathering included Christians from several groups including a coalition \\"Christian Peace Witness for Iraq\\". Despite the cold weather, wind, and snow, the National Cathedral was filled with Christians praying for an end to the war, and two other smaller churches hosted some of the overflow crowds. There were also a number of counter- protesters, including the Gathering of Eagles, a group formed to show support for the war in Iraq, the troops, and the government, and which also claimed to be protecting various monuments from any vandalism by anti-war marchers. It included, among others, members of the Rolling Thunder motorcycle group, and veterans and families who have or have lost family members in Iraq.  Other cities  Many cities held anti-war protests on this day, including San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; New York City; and even smaller student-run protests in suburbs such as the Saturday march in the downtown of Walnut Creek, California.

History A post office was established at Steam Corner in 1851, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1904. Steam Mill was named from the presence of a steam-powered mill. In the 1880s the Chicago and Great Southern Railway completed a north/south rail line through Fountain County which ran from Clay and Vigo counties in the south to Newton County and Kankakee County, Illinois in the north. Steam Corner, also known as Long Siding Station, became a stop along this railroad between stations at Veedersburg and Yeddo. The rail line was later operated by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad and ultimately the Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad, which ran the line until its closure in the 1940s. Attractions Steam Corner is notable in its area as the site of flea markets, exhibitions and festivals. The Steam Corner Flea Market began in 1970 as a yard sale by residents Don and Ruth Staggs and grew over many years; the site now hosts several annual events, including two antique power shows with flea markets, an Independence Day festival, and two weeks of events during Parke County's Covered Bridge Festival. Steam Corner has a Country Kitchen restaurant and concession stands owned by the Flea Market, open during events. Camping is also available.

Boogers spent almost all of his career in the Netherlands, apart from an ill-fated spell at English club West Ham United. He later worked as technical director at FC Dordrecht and managed the club on an interim basis in 2005.  Club career = West Ham United  After a decade playing in the Netherlands, especially prolific in their second tier Eerste Divisie, Boogers joined West Ham United from Sparta Rotterdam for ¬£1 million in July 1995, even though West Ham manager Harry Redknapp had never seen him play. Coming on as a substitute against Manchester United at Old Trafford in only his second appearance for the club, he was almost immediately sent off for a violent knee-high challenge on Gary Neville. The press called it a \\"horror tackle\\" and suggested that Boogers was hired to injure a Manchester United player on purpose. Boogers himself claimed the wet grass made him slide too far and noted that Neville was able to finish the match, but nevertheless he was suspended for four matches. In November he returned as a substitute against Aston Villa in a 4‚Äì1 loss. He played his last match a month later, on 2 December, against Blackburn Rovers in a 4‚Äì2 defeat. He never started a league match for West Ham; all four of his appearances for the club were as a substitute. During his first few months at West Ham Boogers had been suffering from worsening pain in his knee. After an MRI scan he underwent an emergency surgery. As his recovery was expected to take three months he was given permission by Redknapp to return to the Netherlands on 28 December in order to attend the birth of his son. While Boogers was recovering from his injury Redknapp signed another striker, Iain Dowie, rendering Boogers surplus to requirements.  Return to the Netherlands  In February 1996, Boogers was loaned out to Groningen for the remainder of the season, but a few days before he was scheduled to play his first match his knee problems returned and worsened, sending him back into recovery until March 1997. Even though he was still under contract at West Ham, Boogers knew he would not play there again. He last visited the club in February 1996 and never returned. He finished his career playing for RKC Waalwijk, FC Volendam and Dordrecht '90. Technical director After retiring as a player, Boogers worked for hometown club Dordrecht as technical director.

Sugg High School was a top K-12 educational institution founded in 1903, based at S. George St., Farmville, NC. It was closed on July 4, 1999. Academic Named after Herman Bryan Sugg, H.B. Sugg Elementary School is in Farmville, North Carolina. The Farmville Colored School was renamed H.B. Sugg in 1951. The son of slaves, Herman Bryan Sugg grew up hearing stories of his father‚Äôs escape from slavery in Greene County to link up with General Sherman‚Äôs Union Army as it marched through the Carolinas. Sugg heard of how his father was forced to sleep outdoors, like a dog, and how his mother was fortunate enough to have been taught to read by her masters. From this, H.B. Sugg rose from poverty to become a successful leader and molder of future generations. Stories of his parents‚Äô experiences as slaves doubtlessly colored the imagination of H.B. Sugg as he struggled to attain an education. With the shadow of slavery‚Äôs injustices still fresh in the minds of many in the South, H.B. Sugg was able to rise above the challenges that faced him through hard work, dedicated study, and personal initiative to become an educational leader in Farmville, North Carolina. In the post-slavery United States, H.B. Sugg‚Äôs life experiences were varied. He was born and reared on a farm in Greene County near Snow Hill. His early life consisted of farm labor and occasional elementary schooling. Sugg‚Äôs formal education was obtained at the Mary Potter Memorial School at Oxford, NC, and later at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pennsylvania. As a youth, Sugg commented that work on the farm often superseded the demands to be at school for most kids. But Sugg loved going to school so much that he found ways to be there. Sugg stated: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd do my share of the work. I‚Äôd get up early and feed the stock or do whatever else I was told. After school and on Saturdays, I‚Äôd have to do big jobs like hauling wagonloads of firewood for the coming week. I‚Äôve picked cotton many a time by moonlight so I‚Äôd be free to go to school the next day.‚Äù In his mid-twenties Sugg attended Mary Potter School in Oxford, North Carolina. Sugg lived in a dormitory on campus while pursuing his studies at Mary Potter, and he continued to work before and after school and during the summers to pay for tuition and books. ‚ÄúIn the summers I worked in the tobacco factory in Durham and also did some gardening there.‚Äù Following graduation from the Mary Potter School, Sugg went to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and earned his B.S. degree in teaching. During his time as a student in Pennsylvania, Sugg continued to work to pay his way: Sugg ‚Äúmilked cows, fed stock, and cut wood to pay my way there. I also worked summers as a waiter on a passenger steamship which ran from New York to Massachusetts . . .‚Äù Upon graduation from Lincoln, Sugg worked for six years in Lillington, North Carolina as well as serving as principal-teacher in Greene County for only a brief period of time. Military service during World War I interrupted Sugg‚Äôs teaching career. Following his military service, Sugg began a career as principal of the school in Farmville. From 1918 to 1959, Sugg served as a teacher and principal in Farmville, North Carolina. Additional work outside of the classroom did not cease once Sugg came to Farmville: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have to do odd jobs at night and go to Durham to work in the tobacco factory just to support my family. Sugg‚Äôs leadership in Farmville saw the Farmville Colored School grow from a four-room makeshift hotel hall school house into a brick and mortar building consisting of thirty-two rooms and thirty-four teachers. Sugg said that in 1918 ‚Äúthere were 54 different colored schools in Pitt County. All of these were little frame shacks and were one, two, and three teacher schools. The successful growth of what became H.B. Sugg school is an inspiring one in itself. Sugg recalled that in 1922, he and his students helped construct the new location of their school: ‚Äú The new school was built on State land which had been cleared of woods by Sugg and ‚Äòhis boys‚Äô after school hours and on Saturdays. [Tree] stumps which were too large to be dug or chopped out were dynamited by farmers whom Sugg hired with his own money.‚Äù Sugg created a school that consisted of the best features of the classical and vocational models of schooling that predominated during his formative period as an educator. The school's teachers continuously reinforced the 3 R‚Äôs as a way for students to acquire the literacy and numeracy skills to learn the European and Black classics. Teachers like Hazel Lawrence Jordan taught Shakespeare and Chaucer without sacrificing the work of the poets and novelists of the Harlem Renaissance. Lillie Graham taught advanced mathematics classes ranging from geometry to calculus and the school had a storied tradition of winning local and state awards in the biological and physical sciences due to the work of Mr. B. Meeks Briggs, Mr. Armistead, Mrs. Mebane and others. The great Roberta Flack taught music and directed a school chorus that won many local awards and performed a variety of musical compositions ranging from Negro spirituals, popular music, show tunes, and classical music sung in Latin. Mr. John l. Burge led a phenomenal school band that played marches, jazz, popular music, and classical fare. The school had a variety of co-curricular clubs and activities that included the Crown and Scepter Club (an honor society) debate teams, 4-H club, oratorical societies, boy and girl scout troops, and various social organizations supported by parents like Hazel and Nathan Cobb and the Redding family. The Farmville Colored School -- renamed after H.B. Sugg in 1951 -- grew to include a Home Economics Department, Industrial Arts course, a ‚Äú52 piece band,‚Äù as well as a ‚Äúgymnatorium.‚Äù The school produced teachers, engineers, physicians, lawyers, college professors, entertainers, ministers, writers, scientists, and even a watch maker. * Dr. Alma Hobbs has worked at the highest levels of the United States Department of Agriculture.

Their mother raised her children as a single parent after the premature death of her husband. Blenda Gay played professional football for the Oakland Raiders and the Philadelphia Eagles. Sugg achieved success because of his never faltering faith in the dignity of man and the value of education for all children. The most fruitful years of his life were dedicated to the advancement of a constantly expanding Farmville community. Success has crowned his efforts.

Contemporary references identify the sculptor as a Greek named Arcesilaus.Cassius Dio, xliii.22; Pliny's Natural History, vii.126, ix.116, xxxvii.11, Appian, Bellum Civile ii.102; these were noted in Dorothy Kent Hill, \\"Venus in the Roman East\\", The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery 31/32, (1968/1969:6-12) p. 6 note 1. The statue was set up in Julius Caesar's new forum, probably as the cult statue in the cella of his temple of Venus Genetrix.Noted in Pliny's Natural History XXXV.156 and XXXV.45; Pliny credits Varro as his source for the information (cf. Cassius Dio XLVII.18.4); see Roger B. Ulrich, \\"Julius Caesar and the Creation of the Forum Iulium\\" American Journal of Archaeology 97.1 (January 1993, pp. 49-80), p 66-71 and Weichert in Festschrift f√ºr Paul Arndt (1925), 54‚Äë61, for the type as represented on a relief in the Villa Borghese (Reinach, R√©pertoire iii.171.1), which he assigns to the period before 46 BC; and cf. Cornelia G. Harcum, \\"A Statue of the Type Called the Venus Genetrix in the Royal Ontario Museum\\" American Journal of Archaeology 31.2 (1927) pp 141‚Äë152. Through this historical chance, a Roman designation is applied to an iconological type of Aphrodite that originated among the Greeks. History On the night before the decisive battle of Pharsalus (48 BC), Julius Caesar vowed to dedicate a temple at Rome to Venus, supposed ancestor of his gens. In fulfilment of his vow he erected a temple of Venus Genetrix in the new forum he constructed. In establishing this new cult of Venus, De Bello Civile 2.68 and 102. Caesar was affirming the claim of his own gens to descent from the goddess, through Iulus, the son of Aeneas. It was in part to flatter this connection that Virgil wrote the Aeneid. His public cult expressed the unique standing of Caesar at the end of the Roman Republic and in that sense of a personal association expressed as public cult was the innovation in Roman religion. Two types, represented in many Roman examples in marble, bronze, and terra cotta, contend among scholars for identification as representing the type of this draped Venus Genetrix. Besides the type described further below, is another, in which Venus carries an infant Eros on her shoulder.Hill 1968/69 discusses the two contenders, with examples of statuettes at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (figs. 1-3). Original In 420 - 410 BC, the Athenian sculptor Callimachus created a bronze sculpture of Aphrodite (now lost), which, according to Pliny's Natural HistoryHistoria Nat. xxxv.156. showing her dressed in a light but clinging chiton or peplos, which was lowered on the left shoulder to reveal her left breast and hung down in a sheer face and decoratively carved so as not to hide the outlines of the woman's body. Venus was depicted holding the apple won in the Judgement of Paris in her left hand, whilst her right hand moved to cover her head. From the lost bronze original are derived all surviving copies. The composition was frontal,Many of the replicas are only roughly finished at the back. the body's form monumental, and in the surviving Roman replicas its proportions are close to the Polyclitean canon. Caesar's Venus Genetrix The now-lost original statue, or Sabina in the same pose, is represented on the reverse of a denarius above the legend VENERI GENETRICI, by R.M. Muich, \\"The Worship of Roman divae: the Julio-Claudians to the Antonines\\", p 64 with Vibia Sabina on the obverse. The iconological type of the statue, of which there are numerous Roman marble copies and bronze reductions at every level of skill, was identified as Venus Genetrix (Venus Universal Mother) by Ennio Quirino Visconti in his catalogue of the papal collections, Museo Pio-Clementina, by comparison with this denarius. \\"From the inscription on the coins, from the similarity between the figure on the coins and the statue in the Louvre,the Venus of Frejus and from the fact that Arkesilaos established the type of Venus Genetrix as patron goddess of Rome, and ancestress of the Julian race, the identification was a very natural one.\\"Cornelia G. Harcum, \\"A Statue of the Type Called the Venus Genetrix in the Royal Ontario Museum\\" American Journal of Archaeology 31.2 (April 1927, pp. 141-152) p 144. A Venus Genetrix in the Museo Pio-Clementina has been completed with a Roman portrait head of Sabina, on this basis.Image of this statue Other copies A number of the Roman examples are in major collections, including the Centrale Montemartini (discovered in the Gardens of Maecenas), Detroit Institute of Arts , Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Royal Ontario Museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum , the Louvre Museum, and the Hermitage Museum. Aphrodite of Fr√©jus The Aphrodite of Frejus at the Louvre A 1.64m high Roman statue, dating from the end of the 1st century BC to the start of the 1st century AD, in Parian marble, was discovered at Fr√©jus (Forum Julii) in 1650. It is considered as the best Roman copy of the lost Greek work. The neck, the left hand, the fingers of the right hand, the plinth, and many parts of the drape are modern restorations. It was present in the palace of the Tuileries in 1678, and was transported from there to the park of Versailles about 1685. It was seized on the Revolution, and has thus been in the Louvre since 1803, as Inventaire MR 367 (n¬∞ usuel Ma 525). The statue was restored in 1999 thanks to the patronage of FIMALAC. Hermitage Museum Another Roman copy of the statue, which is 2.14m high, was in the collection of Giampietro Campana, marchese di Cavelli, Villa Campana, Rome, from which it was acquired for the Hermitage in 1861, following Campana's disgrace. The head does not belong to this statue, which must originally have had a portrait head. In Rome, an ideal figure of a divinity might often be adapted slightly (here, for instance the chiton covers the breast) and given a separately made portrait head. Evidence that this was the case here can be seen in the locks of hair falling onto the shoulders. These are also seen in posthumous portraits of Agrippina the Elder, which enables us to date this statue to the second quarter of the 1st century AD.

She was also a notable architectural photographer.Architects and Artists, The work of Ernest and Esther Born, by Nicholas Olsberg, published by The Book Club of California (#234), 2015. Ernest was born in San Francisco, Esther in Palo Alto, and they married in 1926 after meeting at UC Berkeley‚Äôs architecture school. Careers Born studied architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating from the school of Architecture in 1922. After graduation he traveled to Europe on a Guggenheim Fellowship, then returned to UC Berkeley earning a master's degree in 1923, with a thesis on the relation of painting to architecture. He worked for prominent San Francisco architects such as John W. Reid, Jr., John Galen Howard, and George Kelham between 1923 and 1928. The couple relocated to New York‚Äôs Greenwich Village in 1929. Esther took a job with Wallace K. Harrison, the architect overseeing the creation of Rockefeller Center. Ernest spent time as a draftsman at Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, the firm best known for the Empire State Building. In 1931 he opened his own architectural practice, working on a wide variety of projects ranging from designing commercial spaces and exhibitions to architectural advertising. He served on the editorial staff of Architectural Record from 1933‚Äì34 and Architectural Forum from 1935-36.

It is in Hymettus marble and dates to the end of the 1st century BC. It may be a copy of the Aphrodite of Thespiae by Praxiteles, ordered by the courtesan Phryne.The attribution, as a youthful work of Praxiteles, was advanced by Adolf Furtw√§ngler, 'Meisterwerke der Griechischen Plastik (Berlin), 1893. In the 2nd century AD, Pausanias mentioned the existence at Thespiae in Boeotia (central Greece) of a group made up of Cupid, Phryne and Aphrodite.Pausanias, Description of Greece IX.27.5. The Praxitelean style may be detected in the head's resemblance to that of the Cnidian Aphrodite, a work of Praxiteles known through copies. In a tentative attempt to reconstruct his career, the original Aphrodite of Thespiae would be a work from his youth in the 360s BC, and this partially draped female (frequently repeated in the Hellenistic era, such as the Venus de Milo) is a prelude to his fully naked c. 350 BC Cnidian Aphrodite. The Venus of Arles was discovered in several pieces at the Roman Theatre of Arles. The sculptural program at Arles was executed in Italy, perhaps by Greek artisans. Venus was the divine ancestor of the gens Julia; Arles, which had backed Caesar when Massilia backed Pompey was rewarded in numerous ways. A semi-nude heroic statue of Augustus was the dominating figure in the sculptural program of the Arles theatre.Fred S. Kleiner, \\"Gallia Graeca, Gallia Romana and the Introduction of Classical Sculpture in Gaul\\", American Journal of Archaeology 77.4 [October 1973:379‚Äì390] p. 387f). The Venus was found in 1651, by workmen who were digging a well. The head appeared first, at a depth of six feet, which spurred further excavations. Later, after it had been given in 1681 to Louis XIV to decorate the Galerie des Glaces of Versailles, further excavations were made in the area of the theatre's scenae frons, but no further fragments were found. The statue was seized from the royal collection at the Revolution and has been at the Mus√©e du LouvreLouvre 439. ever since its inception. A copy is on display in the municipal building in Arles. In his restoration of the sculpture, the royal sculptor Fran√ßois Girardon, to make the sculpture more definitely a Venus, added some attributes: the apple in the right hand ‚Äì as won in the Judgement of Paris ‚Äì and the mirror in the left. The discovery in 1911 of a cast made of the sculpture as it had first been restored only sufficiently to reassemble, before Girardon was commissioned to improve it, demonstrated the extent of Girardon's transformative restorations, which included refinishing the surfaces, slimming the figure in the process. That the result is as much Girardon as Greco-Roman keeps the sculpture in the storerooms of the Louvre.Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, \\"The Aphrodite of Arles\\" American Journal of Archaeology 80.2 (Spring 1976:147‚Äì154) p 147. The head, though its broken edges do not directly join with the torso except for one point of contact, belongs with the body ‚Äì an important point, since it is the only sculpture of this particular model that retains its head, and the head is Praxitelean, comparable to his Aphrodite of Cnidus.Ridgway 1976:147.

This was the last episode to be aired until April 2007, when the series picked up once again to finish the season.  Plot  After Simone Deveaux dies, Isaac Mendez blames Peter Petrelli for her death and tries to shoot Peter, but he turns invisible and flies out the window. Distraught, Peter goes to Nathan for help. Nathan says he will leave an anonymous phone call to the police, directing them to Isaac's home. He advises Peter to get help from Mohinder, but Peter disappears again. Thompson questions Mr. Bennet, who states that the last thing he remembers is driving his wife, Sandra, home from the hospital. He does not know the whereabouts of Claire or the Haitian. Later, outside the room, Thompson and Candice Wilmer observe Bennet, along with Matt Parkman, who is being held against his will. Parkman says that Mr. Bennet is telling the truth. A few hours later, Mr. Bennet and Candice arrive at Isaac's apartment. Candice disguises herself as Simone and hides Simone's corpse to fool the police. She then uses this appearance to taunt Isaac, and he begs Mr. Bennet to stay. But Bennet refuses, claiming that they concocted an alibi, saying Simone will be in Europe indefinitely. After they leave, a devastated Isaac goes back to using heroin and paints several images which depict himself with his head cut open and his brain removed, the same as Sylar's victims, and just as Hiro saw when he traveled to the future. The Haitian tells Claire that they must flee the country because they cannot trust anybody else. He tells Claire that they cannot stay with Peter Petrelli. He makes a phone call and speaks in French. Later, when they arrive at the airport, Claire manages to separate from the Haitian by taking his passport and boarding pass. She goes to Peter Petrelli's apartment in New York because he is the only person she trusts. Angela Petrelli opens the door, lets Claire come in and starts speaking in French. Angela introduces herself as Claire's grandmother and reveals that she has been trying to protect her. Because of that, she has been working with the Haitian, who had somehow found his way there before Claire arrived. Before having his memory wiped, Mr. Bennet had told his wife to pretend that she had her memory erased by the Haitian. Moreover, he had told her the truth about whom he worked for and had given her a handwritten note, stating not to look for Claire. After returning from New York, Bennet reiterates his plan, affirming he will destroy Primatech, to \\"Sandra,\\" whom Candice had been impersonating. As Candice reveals herself, Thompson and the men arrive to apprehend Bennet. Nathan and Hiro meet each other at the hotel. Nathan gets Hiro into the museum, where he gives the remnants of the painting to the curator. After the curator leaves the room, Hiro performs a search on the curator's computer for the fabled sword of Takezo Kensei, which returns Item CRM-114. Just as Hiro is about to take the sword, the curator catches him and calls security. The first guard to get there is an undercover Ando, who helps him block off the rest of the security. Hiro finally gets the sword and teleports himself and Ando to the future New York, where they see the aftermath of the explosion.

Jessica surprises the agents, who are set up in another room, and speaks to them by name, calling them Alonso and Quesada (references to Marvel Comics editors Axel Alonso and Joe Quesada), before killing them both. Nathan comes back to his room, where Niki has been waiting. After removing the wire from Nathan, she warns him that his life is in danger and advises him to either accept Linderman's deal or run. Nathan then chooses one of his own choices, which is to kill Linderman. Nathan confronts Linderman, who is cooking dinner in the hotel kitchen. He is about to shoot Linderman when the old man states that it would be pointless if Nathan shot him because Nathan himself would be dead in moments. He states that he knows about the powers of Nathan and Peter and other heroes, in addition to knowing about Claire. Linderman continues, promising Nathan that he will not only win the election but that he will be in the White House in a few years' time, a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Nathan puts down the gun. Mohinder Suresh, back at his apartment, offers Sylar a cup of chai that is drugged with curare. After sipping the drugged drink, Sylar collapses. When Sylar reawakens, he is strapped down in a chair, hooked up to an I.V. filled with a fluid that prevents him from using his abilities. Mohinder reveals that he knew of Zane's death for quite some time, as Zane's body was eventually discovered and his death published in a newspaper. Sylar begs for his life and tells Mohinder that he knows about his sister and his father's secrets. Mohinder extracts spinal fluid from Sylar, runs the tests, and finally finds the key to being able to locate other people with superpowers. He tells Sylar that he will not forgive him for killing his father, despite their unstable relationship. Mohinder shoots at Sylar, but Sylar stops the bullet in mid-air, breaks free, and tells Mohinder he had stopped the I.V. long ago, adding that he was not really begging for his own life but offering Mohinder his.

The first mention of Hermias is as a slave to Eubulus, a Bithynian banker who ruled Atarneus. Hermias eventually won his freedom and inherited the rule of Atarneus. Due to his policies, his control expanded to other neighbouring cities, such as Assos, in Asia Minor. In his youth, Hermias had studied philosophy in Plato's Academy. There he first met Aristotle. After Plato's death in 347 BC, Xenocrates and Aristotle travelled to Assos under the patronage of Hermias. Aristotle founded his first philosophical school there and eventually married Pythias, Hermias' daughter or niece. Hermias' towns were among those that revolted from Persian rule. In 341/0 BC, the Persian King, Artaxerxes III, sent Memnon of Rhodes to reconquer these coastal cities. Under the guise of truce, Memnon tricked Hermias into visiting him, whereupon he sent Hermias in chains to Susa. Hermias was tortured, presumably for Memnon to learn more about Philip of Macedon's upcoming invasion plans. Hermias' dying words were that he had done nothing unworthy of philosophy. After Hermias' death, Aristotle dedicated a statue in Delphi and composed a Hymn to Virtue in Hermias' honour.  Early life  Hermias of Atarneus had surprisingly humble origins given the amount of political prestige and recognition he would gain in the later years of his life. Although his date of birth remains unknown, he is first mentioned as a Bithynian slave to Eubulus, a wealthy banker and despotic tyrant of the lands surrounding Assos and Atarneus, two commercial towns on the Troad coastline of Asia Minor. While several ancient historians, such as Theopompus, claimed that Hermias was a eunuch, modern historians discredit these claims as nothing more than attempts to blacken his reputation. Although Hermias was considered a slave, he was extremely valued, respected and privileged. At an early age, Hermias was sent to Athens to study under Plato and Aristotle for several years. It was during these years of his formal education that Hermias developed a strong and intimate friendship with Aristotle. During the first years of Hermias' life the Greek states were going through a transitional phase that would lead to the colossal expansion of Macedonian power in the form of the Macedonian Empire, led by Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. During this period of time, most neighbouring powers faced major internal strife and disorder. During the early to mid-4th century BC, the power of the Greek city-states continued to dwindle in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War while the Macedonian Kingdom to the north remained embroiled in dynastic conflicts. Likewise, the once-great Persian Empire was hampered by internal feuds and revolts and incompetent leaders, resulting in losses of some western territories as lands in Asia Minor began to revolt or cede from the empire (such as the despotic government created by Eubulus).  Mature life  After the completion of his education in Athens, Hermias returned to Atarneus to rule in partnership with Eubulus. However, not long after their reunion, Eubulus died, leaving Hermias to succeed as despotic ruler in about 351 BC. In control of a large expanse of territory, Hermias began to attract the attention of neighbouring powers as his domain continued to expand. Eager to launch expansive campaigns into Thrace and possibly Persia, Philip II of Macedon viewed Hermias as a useful prospective ally. Offering a strategic launching point for Macedonian invasions, an alliance with Hermias seemed vital. Taking advantage of their past friendship, King Philip ordered Aristotle ‚Äúto proceed to Asia Minor and join Hermias of Atarneus for political or imperialistic reasons‚Äù. Having taken leave from Athens due to rising resentment towards Macedonians as well as the death of Plato in 347 BC, Aristotle agreed to travel to Asia Minor, as requested by King Philip. Accompanied by fellow philosopher Xenocrates, Aristotle received a warm welcome and immediately began establishing political ties between King Philip and Hermias. One surprising aspect of Hermias's life is the amount of influence Aristotle was able to exert on his decisions. While originally ruling his lands with a strict despotism, Aristotle's arrival in Atarneus was quickly followed by a governmental shift to more Platonic methods, as well as a milder tyranny. Not only did these changes win Hermias the support of neighbouring peoples, they also managed to increase his territory into much of the coastal countryside. As time passed, Hermias began to fear a Persian invasion of Asia Minor. Indeed, while he had grown up during a period of incompetent Persian leaders and rampant internal conflicts, the ascension of Artaxerxes III Ochus to the throne of Persia in 358 BC promised eventual confrontation as the new king was determined to regain lands lost to revolt and secession from the Persian Empire.  Death  Although Hermias could have benefited greatly from a strong Macedonian military force protecting his borders from a Persian invasion, King Philip suddenly ceased his military support with Hermias as a result of Athenian threats to attack Macedonia with the assistance of Persian forces if the Macedonians continued with plans to invade Asia Minor. This change of plan by Philip II left Hermias to a cruel fate. In order to regain the lost Persian territory in Asia Minor and try and discover Macedonian invasion plans, Artaxerxes III commissioned a Greek mercenary named Mentor. (While some believed Hermias' captor to be Memnos of Rhodes, historian Diodoros claims that it was in fact his brother Mentor.) Mentor was charged with the task of capturing Hermias and therefore restoring his lands to the Persian Empire. Disgusted with the actions taken by King Philip, Aristotle began to write letters to persuade Mentor to change sides. Although he eventually agreed in order to secure the support of Hermias, Mentor seized the next opportune moment to capture him and sent Hermias to Susa in chains. Once in Susa, Hermias was tortured in a vain attempt to extract information regarding King Philip's invasion plans. Refusing to betray his colleagues, his last words were said to have been ‚Äútell my friends that I have done nothing shameful or unworthy of philosophy‚Äù. His death occurred in 341/0 BC. His final statement displayed the magnitude of Hermias' friendship with Aristotle as well as the influence of Aristotle's philosophy on his life. After his death, Aristotle created a memorial at Delphi commemorating Hermias‚Äô loyalty and wrote a hymn to his name. Aristotle also reserved the right to marry Hermias' niece or daughter, Pythias, once she came of age.  Hymn in honour of Hermias  Diogenes La√´rtius: ‚ÄúAnd the hymn in honour of Hermias is as follows‚Äù... > O Virtue, won by earnest strife, > And holding out the noblest prize > That ever gilded earthly life, > Or drew it on to seek the skies; > For thee what son of Greece would not > Deem it an enviable lot, > To live the life, to die the death > That fears no weary hour, shrinks from no fiery breath? > > Such fruit hast thou of heavenly bloom, > A lure more rich than golden heap, > More tempting than the joys of home, > More bland than spell of soft-eyed sleep. > For thee Alcides, son of Jove, > And the twin boys of Leda strove, > With patient toil and sinewy might, > Thy glorious prize to grasp, to reach thy lofty height. > > Achilles, Ajax, for thy love > Descended to the realms of night; > Atarneus' King thy vision drove, > To quit for aye the glad sun-light, > Therefore, to memory's daughters dear, > His deathless name, his pure career, > Live shrined in song, and link'd with awe, > The awe of Xenian Jove, and faithful friendship's law. ::::::::::''''  Hermias' historical contribution  Although Hermias played only a small role in the politics of his time, the details of his death had serious historical repercussions. Having kept in contact with King Philip through the presence of Aristotle, Hermias likely knew the specifics of Philip's invasion plans for Thrace, Asia Minor and Persia. Even after being betrayed by King Philip, Hermias displayed great loyalty to Philip in his refusal to divulge any information about Philip's plans to the Persians. This steadfast devotion to his allies protected the secrecy of the Macedonian invasion plans and most likely played a useful role in the later ease of Alexander's expansion into the lands of the Persian Empire. Another of Hermias‚Äô significant contributions was the insight gained through his accounts (as recorded by Aristotle) of the social and political events of the fourth century BC Greek and Persian states. A knowledgeable witness active in the political power struggle of the time, accounts of Hermias' life offer information regarding the political circumstances that facilitated the Macedonian conquests of Greece and then Persia. This included the diminishing power and general disorder of the Greek city states and the Persian empire. While the turmoil in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War prevented the Greek city-states from maintaining their influence as a Mediterranean power, internal conflicts and incompetency led to a steady reduction in Persian power and territory. By ending its dynastic conflicts and uniting under King Philip, Macedonia was able to assert itself as a stable and formidable kingdom capable of vast expansion of the lands under its control. Hermias‚Äô accounts offer a useful source of information for this period. While history is commonly determined by the victor, Hermias‚Äô strong friendship with Aristotle preserved his story as he was constantly mentioned in Aristotle's writing. If it were not for this strong bond, Hermias‚Äô existence would have been forgotten, and his effects on the politics of the time neglected.  Views about Hermias  As little is known of Hermias' life apart from the accounts of Aristotle, there are few sources of past historical interpretations. Due to his Bythinian origins, early Greek historians such as Theopompus and Theocritus regarded him as a barbarian. Declaring him a barbaric tyrant, they made attempts to blacken his reputation, such as spreading the rumour that he was a eunuch. The negative criticism by Theocritus and Theopompus could be due to his taking over the rule of Atarneus. As both historians were born in Chion, an island whose territory once included Atarneus, their resentment towards Hermias is understandable. Threatened by a Macedonian invasion from the north, most of the Greek city- states condemned Hermias because of his connections to King Philip. Even Aristotle was forced to leave Athens as he had connections with both rulers. While immediate historians rebuked Hermias for his affiliations with Macedonia, later studies of Aristotle's writing led to a more sympathetic view of the tyrant. More modern interpretations suggest that Hermias was an intelligent ruler, who suffered his harsh fate because he was betrayed. Joseph M. Bryant states that his significance is rooted in his attempts to ‚Äúbring philosophy to power‚Äù. Influenced by his academy-based education as well as his numerous philosopher friends, Hermias gradually relaxed his harsh tyranny, leaving in place a government based on Platonic principles.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media and broadcasts on 1260 kHz on the AM dial. It has been affiliated with CBS Sports Radio since January 2013. \\"The Score\\" is the flagship station for all Syracuse Mets baseball games.WSKO announcement History WSKO signed on in 1946 as WNDR. It was the most popular Top 40-format station in the area during the 1960s. The studio and 5000-watt transmitter were located on Andrews Road in DeWitt, a Syracuse suburb. During the 1950s, the station began its run as a popular music station after beginning as a Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate. Among its 1950s-era staffers was character actor and Golden Globe nominee Aldo Ray, who worked there in 1956 during an extended break in his film career; a publicity photo of him taken at the station survives and is reproduced on a station tribute website. During the station's heyday in the late 1950s and 1960s, personalities who would later achieve success in major markets including Bud Ballou, Peter Cavanaugh, Bob Shannon and Joey Reynolds were among the notable disc jockeys that worked at WNDR. Logo as ESPN Radio 1260, used from 2001 until 2010 During the 1990s and early 2000s, the station struggled. It adopted the WNSS callsign in 1996, after dropping a country music format in favor of all-news under the branding of \\"W-News\\". After a brief and ill-fated 2000 change to an all-comedy radio format, the station finally settled on a mostly straight satellite feed from the ESPN Radio network, including ESPN's MLB and NBA broadcasts. The station during most of this period was the flagship station of the Syracuse Orange along with sister station WAQX, until WTKW acquired the rights in 2007. The station was also the home of the Syracuse Chiefs from 2010 to 2012 and the Syracuse Crunch from 2010 to 2013.

Life In his youth he studied at Bologna and, after joining the Friars Minor, was sent to complete his studies at Paris. In 1507 he was elected vicar provincial of his order at Bologna, in 1514 vicar general of the Cismontane Franciscan families, and in 1517 he became minister general of the whole order of Friars Minor. Less than a month later he was raised, in spite of his protests, to the cardinalate by Pope Leo X, who in presence of the Sacred College paid a splendid tribute to Christopher's great learning and prudence and to his still greater holiness of life. In 1520 he became Bishop of Alatri (in Latin) and Bishop of Isernia in Italy, and in 1526 Bishop of Riez in Provence. He subsequently fulfilled the office of Apostolic legate to the King of France, and later became Apostolic nuncio and commissary for the construction of the Vatican Basilica, being then invested with the temporal dominion of Bertinoro. During the Sack of Rome (1527) by the soldiers of the Duke of Bourbon, Christopher suffered many hardships and insults, on account of which he received letters of condolence from Pope Clement VII, Francis I of France, and Henry VIII of England. He took refuge in Ancona, but died the next year as a consequence of the inflicted injuries. His remains were transferred back from Ancona to Rome, and placed in the Church of Ara Coeli. Works Besides an \\"Exhortatio ad Galliarum regem Franciscum I in Turcas\\" and a number of letters addressed to that king and the other rulers concerning the liberation of Clement VII, Christopher is said by Luke Wadding and others to have written several treatises on theological and ascetical questions, all of which appear to have perished during the sacking of Rome.

In 1682 William Penn sailed for America with a large fleet of ships carrying immigrants. Perhaps most of these people were Quakers, but many were not. William Penn himself landed at New Castle, but at least one of his fleet made its way into Chesapeake Bay: the Submission, out of Liverpool and Bristol. The Submission arrived at Choptank, on the Choptank River in Dorchester County on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in November 1682. The \\"ship's log\\" lists her passengers, among them James and Jane Clayton and their six children. They were from Middlewich, in the Cheshire County, England. Many or most of the passengers of the Submission disembarked at Choptank and traveled overland to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on the west side of the Delaware River a few miles above Philadelphia. It may be assumed that James Clayton and his family were in this number. Neither is it difficult to imagine that some of the party found desirable home sites along the way. Each of the three Clayton sons of James Clayton, as he reached his majority, appeared in the records of Kent County, Delaware. The listing below is not a genealogy of the family, and is missing many branches of a very large posterity. It is rather intended to an index, providing a guide for the relationships among the many members who are notable and are mentioned in other articles. Presently it is focused on the family in the state of Delaware. As with many family histories, attempts have been made to trace the lineage in the past based on incomplete or inaccurate information, and so therefore, older sources may have information inconsistent with later research.

In his lifetime Archibald built 36 gristmills and lumber mills ‚Äî 23 in Utah, 6 in Canada, 5 in Wyoming, and 2 in Idaho ‚Äî greatly benefiting the lives of those in the surrounding areas. Archibald also built hundreds of miles of canals to introduce the flow of water to the mills' apparatus. Archibald was known as a businessman, father, practical engineer, millwright, polygamist, husband, and Bishop. In March 1859 he was called as a local leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) lasting for the next 32 years. Early life Archibald was born on September 2, 1814, in Kilsyth, Scotland. His father, Robert Gardner, operated Black Bull Inn Tavern and rented Gamill Mill where Archibald was born. Robert Gardner with his wife Margaret Calinder had nine children, five of which survived ‚Äî William, Mary, Janet, Archibald, and Robert. During the unrest in Scotland, Robert Gardner was thought to be a rebel and thrown in prison. He was later released when no traitorous evidence could be found. Wanting nothing to do with the up rise, Robert Gardner immigrated to Upper Canada (near Port Dalhousie) in 1822 with children William and Mary; the next year the rest of the family joined him. At age 17, Archibald built his first mill by following the direction of his father. Six years later Archibald went on his own, moving to Brooke, Kent County, Western District, Canada (later named Alvinston). In Alvinston, Ontario, he built a gristmill in 1837 on the east end of the sixth concession of Brooke township. As was common to the technology of the period, Archibald Gardner's gristmills were \\"built without nails. Wooden pins and mortises were used instead. All shafts, bearings, cog wheels, etc. were of wood...\\", as found in an online reprint on the \\"Utah History to Go\\" section of utah.gov Gristmills often formed the economic center of a community, producing flour to bake bread. The gristmill area was on a hill that faces Alvinston. The area was called Gardner's Mill for several years. Archibald also built a saw mill in this area to produce shingles. On February 18, 1839, Archibald Gardner married Margaret Livingston in Brooke. Archibald Gardner was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in April 1845. Under business pressure and persecution, based on his joining the LDS Church, Gardner sold his Alvinston area mills at a reduced price and sent his family to America. Archibald fled Canada in 1846 after his affairs were in order. He was chased by the local sheriff and posse and forced to cross a dangerous river, St. Clair River by Lake Huron. Knowing his fate if he stayed in Canada, Archibald crossed the cold, icy river resulting in a miraculous escape to the United States. Mormon Pioneer In St. Louis, Missouri, Archibald met up with his family then traveled to Nauvoo, Illinois, only to find the LDS Saints driven out. After replenishing their packs the Gardner family headed to Winter Quarters where Archibald's daughter Janet died (October 10, 1846). Two years before on the same day Archibald's son also named Archibald died of the same illness at the same age. In June 1847 the family started their trek to the Rocky Mountains in Bishop Hunter's Company arriving October 1, 1847. John Taylor, at the time a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles also traveled in Archibald's company. Life in the West=Mills and canals After a season in Warm Springs with a failed attempt to build a sawmill, Archibald moved to Millcreek. In 1848 the family moved the mill to a site on Mill Creek where the water flow was greater, in time for the fall harvest. There the family claimed to have sawed the first lumber in the Salt Lake Valley. Archibald Gardner and his brother Robert planned and began digging a two-and-a-half-mile millrace in West Jordan to provide water power for their Mills. The canal started at Jordan river extending into what is now Taylorsville. The west side of Salt Lake Valley had little water flow forcing settlers to build irrigation systems to grow food. West Jordan business boomed with the building of its first gristmill completed in 1858, the year before Archibald became bishop of the West Jordan ward. \\"Gardner Mill inspired a cluster of small industries, including blacksmith shops, logging and hauling operations, woolen and carding mills, a tannery, several stores, a shoe shop, and later a broom factory\\". In total Archibald, partnering with many others, built 23 mills in Utah, with several of the mills selling its products to Camp Floyd and Fort Douglas. The Salt Lake Temple The Latter-day Saint Salt Lake City temple foundation was laid in 1855. However, cracks and defects in the foundation put the plans to a halt. The President of the Latter-day Saints, Brigham Young and his advisers knew the foundation wouldn't sustain the weight of the temple. President Young seeking revelation said \\"Here I shall remain until the Lord reveals to me what I should do next\\", spotting Archibald, Brigham said \\"Bishop, sit down\\" telling Archibald of the issue and asking him what could be done. After listening Archibald calmly explained, \\"the trouble has arisen through the use of too much mortar. This time instead of using mortar, have each and all of the stones in the entire building cut to exact measurement and place stone upon stone with precise fittings. This will prevent cracking, settling or spreading in any way\\". To this President Brigham Young exclaimed, \\"Brother Gardner, you are right. That is my revelation\\". To this day, almost 150 years later, the Salt Lake City, LDS temple still stands. Clarence Gardner, son of Archibald Gardner believes this was a revelation from God, \\"Because he [Archibald] had spent his life working out problems along practical lines. His past experiences made him equal to the occasion.\\" Mining business In 1863 Archibald Gardner unexpectedly became part of the mining business. While logging for Archibald Gardner, George B. Ogilvie discovered an \\"attractive piece of ore\\". He sent it off to General Patrick Edward Connor at Fort Douglas, the ore was discovered to have traces of silver. Claimants held a meeting and organized the Jordan Silver Mining District on September 17, 1863. Each individual (including Archibald Gardner and Patrick Edward Connor) was given one share except for George B. Ogilvie who was given two shares as the discoverer. Archibald Gardner was elected the first recorder for the district. The Jordan Silver Mining District eventually became the West Mountain Mining District. Today it is known as the Bingham Copper Mine owned by Kennecott. As a polygamist Archibald became a polygamist in 1849 by the requests of Brigham Young. His first wife Margaret Livingston intended to divorce him, believing that polygamy was a sinful act until Brigham Young spoke with her. The last of Archibald's 11 wives was illegal, taking place after the 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. Due to an unsettled polygamist status after 1882, Archibald was chased by federal agents enforcing anti-polygamy laws. In 1886 he made a trip to California to visit his brother William. On his last trip evading federal agents, Archibald visited Mexico, and his brother Robert in southern Utah. In 1889 Archibald established a home in Afton, Wyoming (Star Valley). In Star Valley he built additional mills and lived near and with two wives, Laura Althea Thompson, his fifth wife, and Mary Larson, his 11th wife, and near or with several of his 48 children. When Althea died in Afton in 1899, Archibald buried her in the Salt Lake cemetery's Gardner family plot. Archibald stayed on in Utah building another gristmill in Spanish Fork. At 86, Archibald Gardner was taken to St. Mark's Hospital for an operation on a strangulated hernia. After the operation he was heard to say, \\"Here I go to solve the great mystery\\". Archibald Gardner died in the early morning of February 8, 1902, and is buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

The first episode was broadcast on January 25, 1999, and was UPN's highest-rated comedy series premiere at that point in the network's history; it lasted two seasons with thirty episodes on the network and won a Primetime Emmy before its cancellation. Synopsis The series follows the adventures of a middle-aged white-collar office worker, named Dilbert, who is extremely intelligent in regards to all things that fall within the boundaries of electrical engineering. Although Dilbert's intelligence greatly surpasses that of his incompetent colleagues at work, he is unable to question certain processes that he believes to be inefficient, due to his lack of power within the organization. Thus, he is consistently found to be unsatisfied with the decisions that are made in his workplace, because of the fact that many times he has many suggestions to improve the decision, yet is incapable of expressing them. Consequently, he is often found to show a pessimistic and frustrated attitude, which ultimately lands him in various comedic situations that revolve around concepts like leadership, teamwork, communication, and corporate culture. History The first season centers on the creation of a new product, the \\"Gruntmaster 6000\\". The first three episodes involve the idea process (\\"The Name\\", \\"The Prototype\\", and \\"The Competition\\" respectively); the fourth (\\"Testing\\") involves having it survive a malevolent company tester named \\"Bob Bastard\\", and the fifth (\\"Elbonian Trip\\") is about production in the famine-stricken fourth-world country of Elbonia. The prototype is delivered to an incredibly stupid family in Squiddler's Patch, Texas, during the thirteenth and final episode of the season, \\"Infomercial\\", even though it was not tested in a lab beforehand. The family's misuse of the prototype creates a black hole that sucks Dilbert in; he instantly wakes up in the meeting seen at the start of the episode, then locks his design lab to keep the prototype from being shipped out. The second season features seventeen episodes, bringing the total number of episodes to thirty. Unlike the first season, the episodes are not part of a larger story arc and have a different storyline for each of the episodes (with the exception of episodes 29 and 30, \\"Pregnancy\\" and \\"The Delivery\\"). Elbonia is revisited once more in \\"Hunger\\"; Dogbert still manages to scam people in \\"Art\\"; Dilbert is accused of mass murder in \\"The Trial\\"; and Wally gets his own disciples (the result of a complicated misunderstanding, the company launching a rocket for NASA, and a brainwashing seminar) in episode 16, \\"The Shroud of Wally\\". The theme music, \\"The Dilbert Zone\\", was written by Danny Elfman. It is an abbreviated instrumental rewrite of the theme from the film Forbidden Zone, originally performed by Elfman's band, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. Conception Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, decided to create the series for UPN because the network promised 13 episodes on air, while other networks would only consider the series against other programming options. Adams added to that \\"If we had gone with NBC, they would have given Dilbert a love interest with sexual tension.\\" UPN was the sixth- ranked network at the time and picked up the show in hopes of broadening their appeal and to prove they were committed to riskier alternative shows. Adams stated about turning Dilbert into a series \\"It's a very freeing experience because doing the comic strip limits me to three (picture) panels with four lines or less of dialogue per issue, in the TV series, I have 21 minutes per episode to be funny. I can follow a theme from beginning to end, which will add lots of richness to the characters.\\" Adams wanted the series to be animated because the live action version shot previously for FOX didn't translate well. Adams added to that \\"If Dilbert's going to be at the top of the Alps, you just draw it that way and you don't have to build an Alps scene. You can also violate some laws of physics, and cause and effect. People forgive it very easily. So it's much more freeing creatively.\\" Cancellation On November 22, 2006, when Adams was asked why the show was canceled, he explained: On June 28, 2020, in light of the worsening of race relations in the United States, Adams reflected on the cancellation of his series 20 years earlier, tweeting: Cast=Main * Daniel Stern as Dilbert * Chris Elliott as Dogbert * Larry Miller as The Pointy-Haired Boss * Gordon Hunt as Wally * Kathy Griffin as Alice (uncredited) * Jackie Hoffman as Dilmom * Jim Wise as Loud Howard * Tom Kenny as Ratbert, Asok, additional voices * Gary Kroeger as Additional voices * Maurice LaMarche as The World's Smartest Garbageman, Bob the Dinosaur, additional voices * Tress MacNeille as Carol, Lena, additional voices * Jason Alexander as Catbert Griffin was starring in the NBC series Suddenly Susan during the time that Dilbert was in production.

He was regarded as illegitimate, although today his parents are not known. Ralston appears in the records for the first time in 1426, where he is chaplain and secretary to Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas.Borthwick, \\"Ralston, John (d. 1451/2)\\". He retained this position on the death of Douglas in 1439. Between 1429 and 1443 he served as the fourth provost of Bothwell Collegiate Church, the home church of the Douglas earls. On 26 November 1445 he became dean of the diocese of Dunkeld.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 104. From 1442, John was a member of the court of King James II of Scotland, and from the following year he is the King's personal secretary. At some stage he attended the University of St Andrews and obtained a Licentiate in decrees.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 74. In 1445 he was Prebendary (officially, Rector) of Cambuslang. He was in the process of obtaining a doctorate in canon law when, after the translation of Bishop William Turnbull to the bishopric of Glasgow on 27 October 1447, Ralston was elected Bishop of Dunkeld.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 98. He was consecrated by the end of April 1448, after making a payment of 450 gold florins.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 74-5; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 98. On 20 April 1448 he is recorded as secretary to King James II and keeper of the Privy Seal.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 75. In this year John and two other officials were sent to France as ambassadors in a mission to, among other things, find a suitable bride for King James; the mission went first to the King of France and then to the Duke of Burgundy. The bride chosen was Mary of Gueldres, a relative of the Duke and the daughter of Arnold, Duke of Guelders. On his return to Scotland, Ralston became the King's treasurer. However, the autumn of 1449 brought the collapse of the dominance of the Livingston family at the Scottish court, and Ralston lost his position as a result of his association with this family. Ralston is recorded alive for the last time on 5 July 1451. He appears to have died before 28 April 1452 when Ralston's successor Thomas Lauder was recorded as being bishop-elect of Dunkeld.Borthwick, \\"Ralston, John (d. 1451/2)\\"; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 98; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 75. He was buried in Dunkeld Cathedral.

It first aired on ABC on December 5, 1993. It is the sequel to I Yabba-Dabba Do! and is followed by A Flintstone Family Christmas, which aired less than two weeks later on the same channel. The movie has been reaired on Cartoon Network and Boomerang usually as part of Mother's Day special programming. Plot After Pebbles and Bamm- Bamm get married and move to Hollyrock in I Yabba-Dabba Do!, Fred and Barney are both working overtime for Mr. Slate, and Wilma and Betty now own a food delivery service called 'Bone Appetite', but much to Fred's disgust. Wilma is not there to cook for him, so he cooks his own TV dinners as well as Barney's. One day, the Flintstones and the Rubbles go to Hollyrock to visit their children, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm (who is trying his luck at being a screenwriter), after Pebbles reveals that she and Bamm-Bamm are going to have a baby. During the visit, they drive Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm crazy by telling them what to do now that Pebbles is going to have a baby. Meanwhile, Fred and Barney try to help Bamm-Bamm sell his script, but end up in a mess with a robbery of a giant pearl when it is mistaken for a bowling ball. Big Rock sends his henchmen Rocky and Slick to recover the giant pearl. Fred and Barney manage to get the tickets to a taping of a show at ABC studios in hopes to sell Bamm-Bamm's script. Fred and Barney encounter Shelley Millstone in hopes to have her for Bamm-Bamm's film. It doesn't go well and the security guard is called in to eject them. A chase begins throughout the ABC studios and they eventually get thrown out. Meanwhile, Wilma and Betty are designing a nursery when Pebbles reveals that she is attending the premiere of \\"It Came From the Tar Pits\\" starring Craig Craigmore. Fred and Barney decide to take the advantage by finding someone to buy the screenplay. Rocky and Slick also slip in to get to Shelley Millstone in an attempt to get the giant pearl. Bamm-Bamm mistakes Slick and Rocky for movie producers. When they find Fred's car, they are attacked by Dino. Back at the party, Fred tries to get to Shelly Millstone, which ends up with Craig Craigmore being injured. The next day, Pebbles has Fred attend a baby training seminar while she does paperwork for her boss, Mr. Pyrite. With Bamm-Bamm exhausted, Barney attends in Bamm-Bamm's place. Slick and Rocky follow Fred to the baby training seminar where Slick and Rocky infiltrate the class. It soon breaks up into a fight which ends up with Fred, Barney, Slick, and Rocky being thrown out. After a call from Rocky, Big Rock gets impatient and decides to take over the operation. Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm declare themselves unready for the baby after they were busy. Fred and Wilma try to get Pebbles to calm down until she breaks down. The next day while Fred apologises to Pebbles about being too helpful, Pebbles attends a baby shower which Wilma's mother Pearl also attends. Pearl sends Fred and Barney to get the baby supplies. At the grocery store, they end up gaining a lot of \\"Maps to the Stars' Homes\\" and decide to take another shot at Shelly Millstone. Later that night, Fred and Barney sneak into Shelly's property and distract the guard dogs. Rocky and Slick show Big Rock the house where Fred and Barney are staying and mistake Pearl for Fred when they abduct her. The next morning, Fred confesses to Bamm-Bamm that he lost the script in Shelley Millstone's yard. They soon return a call from Big Rock who demands the giant pearl in exchange for Pearl's freedom. They are forced to give them the pearl for the exchange. They disguise a bowling ball as the pearl when they forget the giant pearl. Pebbles goes into labor and they drive a bus towards the hospital with Big Rock, the real bus driver, and the painter of the bike the bus driver borrowed. There is a high speed chase which attracts the local cops. Fred finally makes it to the hospital and Pebbles is taken into the hospital fast. Big Rock, Rocky, and Slick catch up to them and Bamm-Bamm arrives to take them down as the cops arrest the crooks. Pebbles gives birth to twins, Roxy (who has muscular strength like her father) and Chip (who has his Grandpa Flintstone's mouth because he's another chip off the old Flintstone). As for Bamm-Bamm's script, Shelly Millstone got Bamm Bamm's script when Fred and Barney left it to her house. She loves the script and wants to star in it and Bamm Bamm sold his screenplay. Mr. Pyrite manages to get the script to Craig Craigmore and promotes Pebbles as Vice President. Fred and the others head back to Bedrock, leaving their children and grandchildren in happy harmony.

When activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. In its dual state mission, the 104th Fighter Wing is an Air Force component of the Massachusetts National Guard. Overview The 104th Fighter Wing flies the F-15 Eagle and supports Air Force wartime contingency requirements, performing a variety of missions to include a 24/7 active Air Control Alert (ACA) to protect the Northeast corridor of the United States. In addition to the ACA mission, the highly decorated Wing provides operationally ready combat units, combat support units and qualified personnel for active duty. Its goal is to organize, train and equip assigned personnel to provide an operationally ready squadron to the Air Combat Command that flies, fights and wins.

Robert J. Della Penna, Original artwork by: SSgt. Donald Bein, Computer Generated by: MSgt. Robert J. Sabonis History In 1946, the National Guard Bureau authorized an Air National Guard unit in Western Massachusetts. On 24 February 1947, the unit was federally recognized as the 131st Tactical Fighter Squadron, 131st Utility Flight, 131st Weather Flight, and Detachment B of the 202nd Air Services Group. The unit received its first plane, the P-47 Thunderbolt I, in the winter of 1949, and was chosen to conduct a flyover for President Truman's inauguration. That year the first edition of the unit paper, called the \\"Thunderbolt\\" was also published. The paper was later named the \\"Airscoop\\" and has won three Department of Defense (DOD) awards in nationwide competitions since publication began. The 131st FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 104th Headquarters, 104th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 104th Combat Support Squadron, and the 104th USAF Dispensary. In 1950, the unit was awarded the Spaatz Trophy based on its accomplishments in maintenance, personnel, training, safety, supply, and overall proficiency. Then, in 1951, the 131st Fighter Squadron underwent its first of eight conversions and flew the P- 51 Mustang Fighter for three years until the F-94 Starfire Fighter permanently put the 131st into the jet business. The Guard Base at Barnes Airport was dedicated on 19 October 1952. In 1954 the 131st stood up a dawn-to-dusk air defense alert with its F-94 jets, a rotation of pilots, and a 10-person support crew (a precursor of things to come). In April 1956 came the organization as the 104th Fighter Group, from the previous squadron-hierarchy. The mission of the 104th Fighter Group was the air defense of Massachusetts. Tactical Air Command The air defense mission ended on 10 November 1958 when the Massachusetts Air Guard and its units were reassigned to Tactical Air Command (TAC) and converted to F-86H Sabre fighter-bombers. During the 1950s and early 1960s, better training and equipment, and closer relations with the Air Force greatly improved the readiness of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. =1961 Berlin Federalization= 131st Tactical Fighter Squadron - North American F-86H Sabre 52-2030 During the summer of 1961, as the 1961 Berlin Crisis unfolded, the 131st TFS was notified on 16 August of its pending federalization and recall to active duty. On 1 October the 131st was federalized and 730 members were placed on active duty. The mission was to reinforce the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and deploy to Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base, France. In France, the unit was to provide close air support to NATO ground forces and air interdiction. This involved keeping its aircraft on 24/7 alert. Between 28 and 30 October, the Wing departed for Phalsbourg. Starting on 5 December, the Wing began deploying to Wheelus Air Base Libya for gunnery training. During its time in Europe, the 104th participated in several USAF and NATO exercises, including a deployment to Leck Air Base, West Germany near the Danish border. At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks. On 7 May 1962, USAFE Seventeenth Air Force directed that the 104th would deploy back to the United States during the summer, and the unit returned to the United States in July 1962. The last of the ANG aircraft departed on 20 July. =Vietnam era= 131st TFS F-100D 55-2830 After the Berlin Crisis, the readiness status of the 104th Tactical Fighter Group greatly improved under the \\"gaining command concept\\", whereby the U.S. Air Force Tactical Air Command was responsible for overseeing the training of the Group. Operational readiness inspections also honed the edges of the wing. In 1964, the 131st TFS was switched from F-86H Sabres to the F-84F Thunderstreak. Exactly why this equipment change was made can not be determined. The F-86H was a viable aircraft in the ANG's inventory, with the Sabres from both the 101st and 131st TFS's being sent to the New Jersey ANG, and the 119th and 141st TFS's sending their F-84Fs to the Massachusetts squadrons. The 131st flew the Thunderstreaks throughout the 1960s, and although the squadron was not activated during the Vietnam War, several of its pilots volunteered for combat duty in Southeast Asia. In 1971, the 104th began re-equipping with the F-100D Super Sabre; the Air Guard was always one generation of fighter aircraft behind the Air Force during this time. =Close Air Support = 131st Tactical Fighter Squadron A-10 78-0628 The 104th remained as a tactical fighter unit flying the F-100 until July 1979 when the F-100s were retired and the unit was re-equipped with new A-10 Thunderbolt IIs as part of the \\"Total Force\\" concept which equipped ANG units with front-line USAF aircraft. This marked the first time the 131st had received new aircraft. For most of its existence, the Air Guard had been a reserve force for use only in wartime. By the 1980s, the Air Guard was an integral part of daily Air Force operations. As a result, the Massachusetts Air Guard took on more missions. With the receipt of the A-10, the 104th began a commitment to the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), beginning frequent deployments to West Germany, England, Italy, Turkey, and other NATO bases. As the Cold War was ending, the Massachusetts Air National Guard was called upon to meet new challenges. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 led to a U.S. response with air, ground and naval attacks during Operation Desert Storm. While no flying units of the Massachusetts Air Guard were mobilized, mission support units provided personnel to backfill deploying Air Force units in the U.S. The Total Force Policy of the Department of Defense stipulated that the Reserve Components were to play a large role in the nation's defense. Air Combat Command In March 1992, with the end of the Cold War, the 104th adopted the Air Force Objective Organization plan, and the unit was re-designated as the 104th Fighter Group. In June, Tactical Air Command was inactivated as part of the Air Force reorganization after the end of the Cold War. It was replaced by Air Combat Command (ACC). In 1995, in accordance with the Air Force \\"One Base-One Wing\\" directive, the 104th was changed in status back to a Wing, and the 131st Fighter Squadron was assigned to the new 104th Operations Group. Two 131st Fighter Squadron A-10s in flight From August to October 1995, some 400 Airmen of the 104th Fighter Wing deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy as part of the NATO mission to repel Serbian forces in Bosnia. This was the first time that the 131st Fighter Squadron flew combat sorties. Four years later, in 1999, elements of the 104th mobilized and flew sorties over the skies of the former Republic of Yugoslavia. As part of an Air Guard A-10 group, the 131st attacked Serb forces in Kosovo. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. As a result of the Global War on Terrorism, in 2003, the 131st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron flew hundreds of combat missions with the A-10 in support of U.S. Army and Marine operations in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom). During March and April 2003, as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, 131st Fighter Squadron A-10s supported the U.S. Army by flying combat missions that interdicted enemy forces. The 104th played a major role with its air support. 131st FS F-15C 78-0476 In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to Barnes Municipal Airport Air Guard Station and send its A-10s to the Maryland Air National Guard 104th Fighter Squadron, Warfield Air National Guard Base, Middle River, Maryland. In return, the 104th received the mission of the 102d Fighter Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base, which required converting from the A-10 to the F-15 Eagle. In turn, the 102nd converted into a non-flying Intelligence Wing. The realignment marked the end for the 104th's nearly 30-year mission of flying close-air support missions with the A-10. The 104th took over the homeland security mission of the 102d. In 2007, the A-10s began flying to Maryland and the F-15s began arriving from Otis ANGB. By the end of 2007, eighteen F-15C and a trainer F-15D arrived. In addition to the air defense mission, the men and women of the 104th Fighter Wing deploy on Air Expeditionary missions to the Middle East in support of combat operations as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The last such deployment was completed in July, 2012. In May 2013, it was announced that one third of the 104th Fighter Wing's F-15 aircraft would be moving to Otis Air National Guard Base to take up an alert mission for four to six-month, as Barnes' runway underwent renovation. On 27 August 2014, a jet from the wing crashed into the ground near Elliot Knob, Virginia just before nine in the morning. The pilot, Lt. Col. Morris \\"Moose\\" Fontenot Jr., had reportedly made an emergency call before the crash and was on its way to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans. Officials scoured George Washington National Forest in an attempt to find the pilot. It was later revealed that the pilot was unable to eject from the aircraft and was killed instantly.

E-Research therefore involves collaboration of researchers (often in a multi-disciplinary team), with data scientists and computer scientists, data stewards and digital librarians, and significant information and communication technology infrastructure. In addition to human resources, it often requires the physical infrastructure for data-intensive activities, often using high performance computing systems such as grid computing. Applications Examples of e-Research problems range across disciplines which include: * Modelling of ecosystems or economies * Exploration of human genome structures * Studies of large linguistic corpora * Integrated social policy analyses In Australia Specialist services, centres or programmes instituted to support Australian data and technology intensive research operate under the umbrella term: eResearch. In March 2012, representatives from these eResearch groups came together to discuss the need build a \\"collaborative program to strengthen eResearch and address issues facing the sector nationally\\". The Australian eResearch Organisation (AeRO) emerged from this forum as \\"a collaborative organisation of national and state-based research organisations to advance eResearch implementation and innovation in Australia\\". Professionals working in Australian eResearch annually convene a conference known as: eResearch Australasia.

It features the adventures of the eponymous character Canon Fodder, the sole survivor of the Priest Patrol, a bizarre cross between the police and the church who patrol the streets of a future London after Judgment Day has caused the dead to rise, and a breakdown of society. Publication history Canon Fodder first appeared in 1993, with a sequel written by Nigel Long (as \\"Kek-W\\") in 1995. A dispute between Fleetway and Mark Millar regarding ownership of the character prevented further development. Millar had stopped working for 2000 AD by the time the second series was created and objected to the series being continued in his absence. Artist Chris Weston has since said that he only agreed to illustrate the second series because he thought the character was the property of 2000 AD. 2000 AD 's editor, David Bishop, shelved plans to continue the series to avoid offending Millar. Cast *Canon Fodder: The last surviving member of the Priest Patrol; the other members were Deacon Blue, Father O'Blivion, and Cardinal Syn. He was a judge at a beauty pageant the day his comrades were horribly killed. Canon usually tries to conduct himself in a calm authoritative manner but when annoyed can be quite sarcastic and impatient. Canon is firmly grounded in his belief in God; he is a skilled fighter and can be very insightful. Canon has no patience for sinners and issues harsh punishments to even those who confess voluntarily. *Sadie: Canon's housekeeper. Although she has feelings of love for him (as does he for her), neither have ever told each other of their feelings. Plot=Canon Fodder The story opens with a badly wounded Canon Fodder being confronted by Lucifer who then apparently finishes him off. It then cuts to a flashback with Dr. Watson discovering that Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty have killed themselves in a suicide pact, in order to go to heaven and kill God for not appearing on Judgement Day. Fodder and Watson recruit Mycroft Holmes (who is portrayed as a psychopath similar to Hannibal Lecter), to get them to heaven before Holmes and Moriarty. However, Holmes and Moriarty were themselves too late, and discover that Lucifer has overthrown and killed God. Fodder and his comrades arrive on the scene to be confronted by Lucifer, whose demons kill Watson and Mycroft and rip off Fodder's hand. As Lucifer is about to finish Fodder off, God unexpectedly returns. He kills Lucifer and asks why he shouldn't wipe out mankind, but Fodder points out that without mankind, God will never find the answer to who created him. The story ends with Dr Watson completing his entry in the Purgatory journals as the last adventure of Sherlock Holmes. Dark Matter After a failed attempt at stopping a hostage crisis in a church, Canon is locked up in Bedlam asylum, being treated by Sigmund Freud. He is freed by Deacon Blue, one of the vanished members of the Priest Patrol, who reveals that the Priest Patrol (apart from Fodder, who was judging the \\"Miss Purity 2000\\" pageant) were investigating the League of Anabolic Atheists when they were sucked into another dimension. Blue managed to escape and return to the real world, and now wants Fodder to return with him to rescue their colleagues. Freud, Fodder and Blue travel to the other dimension, which seems to be the collective unconscious, where Deacon Blue turns out to be a demon in disguise, and the rescue mission a trap. Fodder is rescued in the nick of time by a trans-dimensional airship captained by Jules Verne. Returning to the normal universe, he is briefed by Albert Einstein and Wilhelm Reich on the threat posed by the accelerating expansion of the dimension they have just come from, which it seems is composed of dark matter, and which is feeding on humanity's fears and dark desires. Reich has constructed an \\"Orgone Bomb\\" which can destroy the dark matter universe, and Fodder returns there to detonate it. After facing down his deepest fear he detonates the device expecting to die but is amazed to discover he has instead set free the Goddess who was imprisoned in the universe and who returns him to the normal universe.

Energy security is the association between national security and the availability of natural resources for energy consumption. Access to (relatively) cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. International energy relations have contributed to the globalization of the world leading to energy security and energy vulnerability at the same time.Indra Overland (2016) ‚ÄòEnergy: The Missing Link in Globalization‚Äô, Energy Research and Social Science, 14, pp. 122‚Äì130. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296486356 In the context of energy security, security of energy supply is an issue of utmost importance. Moreover, it is time to define \\"a global energy policy model, which not only aims at ensuring an efficient environmental protection but also at ensuring security of energy supply\\".Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dra≈æan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers ‚Äì Energy, Vol. 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2‚Äì11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005. Renewable resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency and transitions exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits. Threats The modern world relies on a vast energy supply to fuel everything from transportation to communication, to security and health delivery systems. Perhaps most alarmingly, peak oil expert Michael Ruppert has claimed that for every calorie of food produced in the industrial world, ten calories of oil and gas energy are invested in the forms of fertilizer, pesticide, packaging, transportation, and running farm equipment. Energy plays an important role in the national security of any given country as a fuel to power the economic engine. Some sectors rely on energy more heavily than others; for example, the Department of Defense relies on petroleum for approximately 77% of its energy needs. Threats to energy security include the political instability of several energy producing countries, the manipulation of energy supplies, the competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents, natural disasters, terrorism, and reliance on foreign countries for oil. Foreign oil supplies are vulnerable to unnatural disruptions from in- state conflict, exporters' interests, and non-state actors targeting the supply and transportation of oil resources. The political and economic instability caused by war or other factors such as strike action can also prevent the proper functioning of the energy industry in a supplier country. For example, the nationalization of oil in Venezuela has triggered strikes and protests in which Venezuela's oil production rates have yet to recover. Exporters may have political or economic incentive to limit their foreign sales or cause disruptions in the supply chain. Since Venezuela's nationalization of oil, anti-American Hugo Ch√°vez threatened to cut off supplies to the United States more than once. The 1973 oil embargo against the United States is a historical example in which oil supplies were cut off to the United States due to U.S. support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. This has been done to apply pressure during economic negotiations‚Äîsuch as during the 2007 Russia‚ÄìBelarus energy dispute. Terrorist attacks targeting oil facilities, pipelines, tankers, refineries, and oil fields are so common they are referred to as \\"industry risks\\". Infrastructure for producing the resource is extremely vulnerable to sabotage. One of the worst risks to oil transportation is the exposure of the five ocean chokepoints, like the Iranian-controlled Strait of Hormuz. Anthony Cordesman, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., warns, \\"It may take only one asymmetric or conventional attack on a Ghawar Saudi oil field or tankers in the Strait of Hormuz to throw the market into a spiral.\\" New threats to energy security have emerged in the form of the increased world competition for energy resources due to the increased pace of industrialization in countries such as India and China, as well as due to the increasing consequences of climate change. Although still a minority concern, the possibility of price rises resulting from the peaking of world oil production is also starting to attract the attention of at least the French government. Increased competition over energy resources may also lead to the formation of security compacts to enable an equitable distribution of oil and gas between major powers. However, this may happen at the expense of less developed economies. The Group of Five, precursors to the G8, first met in 1975 to coordinate economic and energy policies in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, a rise in inflation and a global economic slowdown.Panoptic World: \\"Globocops of Energy Security\\" Mathew Maavak, originally published in The Korea Herald on July 18, 2006 NATO leaders meeting in Bucharest Romania, in April 2008, may discuss the possibility of using the military alliance \\"as an instrument of energy security\\". One of the possibilities include placing troops in the Caucasus region to police oil and gas pipelines.\\"Climate change may spark conflict with Russia, EU told\\" Guardian, March 10, 2008 Long-term security Long-term measures to increase energy security center on reducing dependence on any one source of imported energy, increasing the number of suppliers, exploiting native fossil fuel or renewable energy resources, and reducing overall demand through energy conservation measures. It can also involve entering into international agreements to underpin international energy trading relationships, such as the Energy Charter Treaty in Europe. All the concern coming from security threats on oil sources long term security measures will help reduce the future cost of importing and exporting fuel into and out of countries without having to worry about harm coming to the goods being transported. The impact of the 1973 oil crisis and the emergence of the OPEC cartel was a particular milestone that prompted some countries to increase their energy security. Japan, almost totally dependent on imported oil, steadily introduced the use of natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed mass transit systems, and implemented energy conservation measures.Oil Crisis, US Senator Bob Bennett, September 27, 2000 The United Kingdom began exploiting North Sea oil and gas reserves, and became a net exporter of energy into the 2000s. In other countries energy security has historically been a lower priority. The United States, for example, has continued to increase its dependency on imported oil although, following the oil price increases since 2003, the development of biofuels has been suggested as a means of addressing this.CNN: Oil majors question Bush biofuel plan, February 15, 2007 Increasing energy security is also one of the reasons behind a block on the development of natural gas imports in Sweden. Greater investment in native renewable energy technologies and energy conservation is envisaged instead. India is carrying out a major hunt for domestic oil to decrease its dependency on OPEC, while Iceland is well advanced in its plans to become energy independent by 2050 through deploying 100% renewable energy. Short-term security=Petroleum A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, 2013 Petroleum, otherwise known as \\"crude oil\\", has become the resource most used by countries all around the world including Russia, China (actually, China is mostly dependent on coal (70.5% in 2010)) and the United States of America. With all the oil wells located around the world energy security has become a main issue to ensure the safety of the petroleum that is being harvested. In the middle east oil fields become main targets for sabotage because of how heavily countries rely on oil. Many countries hold strategic petroleum reserves as a buffer against the economic and political impacts of an energy crisis. All 28 members of the International Energy Agency hold a minimum of 90 days of their oil imports, for example. The value of such reserves was demonstrated by the relative lack of disruption caused by the 2007 Russia-Belarus energy dispute, when Russia indirectly cut exports to several countries in the European Union. Due to the theories in peak oil and need to curb demand, the United States military and Department of Defense had made significant cuts, and have been making a number of attempts to come up with more efficient ways to use oil. Natural gas natural gas proven reserves, based on data from The World Factbook, 2014 Compared to petroleum, reliance on imported natural gas creates significant short-term vulnerabilities. The gas conflicts between Ukraine and Russia of 2006 and 2009 serve as vivid examples of this.Orttung, Robert & Overland, Indra. (2011). A limited toolbox: Explaining the constraints on Russia‚Äôs foreign energy policy. Journal of Eurasian Studies. 2. 74‚Äì85. Many European countries saw an immediate drop in supply when Russian gas supplies were halted during the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute in 2006. Natural gas has been a viable source of energy in the world. Consisting of mostly methane, natural gas is produced using two methods: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas comes from methanogenic organisms located in marshes and landfills, whereas thermogenic gas comes from the anaerobic decay of organic matter deep under the Earth's surface. Russia is the current leading country in production of natural gas. One of the biggest problems currently facing natural gas providers is the ability to store and transport it. With its low density, it is difficult to build enough pipelines in North America to transport sufficient natural gas to match demand. These pipelines are reaching near capacity and even at full capacity do not produce the amount of gas needed. Nuclear power Sources of uranium delivered to EU utilities in 2007, from the 2007 Annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency Uranium for nuclear power is mined and enriched in diverse and \\"stable\\" countries. These include Canada (23% of the world's total in 2007), Australia (21%), Kazakhstan (16%) and more than 10 other countries. Uranium is mined and fuel is manufactured significantly in advance of need. Nuclear fuel is considered by some to be a relatively reliable power source, being more common in the Earth's crust than tin, mercury or silver, though a debate over the timing of peak uranium does exist. Nuclear power reduces carbon emissions.U.S. Energy Legislation May Be 'Renaissance' for Nuclear Power . Although a very viable resource, nuclear power can be a controversial solution because of the risks associated with it.Lessons of a Triple Disaster; Nature 483, 123 (08 March 2012) doi:10.1038/483123a . Another factor in the debate with nuclear power is that many people or companies simply do not want any nuclear energy plant or radioactive waste near them. Currently, nuclear power provides 13% of the world's total electricity. The most notable use of nuclear power within the United States is in U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and submarines, which have been exclusively nuclear-powered for several decades. These classes of ship provide the core of the Navy's power, and as such are the single most noteworthy application of nuclear power in that country. Renewable energy The deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. For those countries where growing dependence on imported gas is a significant energy security issue, renewable technologies can provide alternative sources of electric power as well as displacing electricity demand through direct heat production. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from petroleum products. As the resources that have been so crucial to survival in the world to this day start declining in numbers, countries will begin to realize that the need for renewable fuel sources will be as vital as ever. With the production of new types of energy, including solar, geothermal, hydro-electric, biofuel, and wind power. With the amount of solar energy that hits the world in one hour there is enough energy to power the world for one year. With the addition of solar panels all around the world a little less pressure is taken off the need to produce more oil. Geothermal can potentially lead to other sources of fuel, if companies would take the heat from the inner core of the earth to heat up water sources we could essentially use the steam creating from the heated water to power machines, this option is one of the cleanest and efficient options. Hydro-electric which has been incorporated into many of the dams around the world, produces a lot of energy, and is very easy to produce the energy as the dams control the water that is allowed through seams which power turbines located inside of the dam. Biofuels have been researched using many different sources including ethanol and algae, these options are substantially cleaner than the consumption of petroleum. \\"Most life cycle analysis results for perennial and ligno-cellulosic crops conclude that biofuels can supplement anthropogenic energy demands and mitigate green house gas emissions to the atmosphere\\". Using oil to fuel transportation is a major source of green house gases, any one of these developments could replace the energy we derive from oil. Traditional fossil fuel exporters (e.g. Russia) struggle to diversify away from oil and develop renewable energy.Overland, Indra. (2010).

The Spaniards noted that Guatari was far from the coast. The settlement is believed to have been in present-day Rowan County, North Carolina. In 1670, English colonists and explorers mentioned the Wateree as inhabiting the area of the upper Yadkin River, to the northwest of their later habitat. 18th-century history A English copy of a deerskin Catawba map of the tribes between Charleston (left) and Virginia (right) following the displacements of a century of disease and enslavement and the 1715‚Äì7 Yamasee War. The Wateree are labelled as \\"Waterie\\". By 1700, when observed by John Lawson's expedition, the Wateree had migrated south to settle near present-day Camden, South Carolina along the Wateree River. The British observed that the chiefs of the Wateree had a higher degree of power than those of other Indian tribes of the region. Originally a large tribe, the Wateree had their power broken during the Yamasee War of 1715 against Carolina colonists. The Wateree became allies in a tribal confederation dominated by the Catawba. The latter tribe absorbed remnant bands of many other tribes of the region from the chaos of intertribal fighting. : \\"James Adair heard more than twenty different languages spoken by the Indians in the Catawba River settlements when he trade there between 1736 and 1743. This included Eno, Cheraw, Wateree, Congaree, Natchez, Yamasee, Coosah, and others. He could probably have added Saponi, Waccamaw, Pedee, Santee and others to his list. The groups varied in size. If large enough, each language tribe tended to create its own village and appoint its own leaders.\\" James Hart Merrell, The Indians' New World: Catawbas and Their Neighbors from European Contact through the Era of Removal (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1989), 110. The Wateree appeared to have been able to maintain their culture and distinct language as late as 1744. A record of land sale noted that Wateree Indians sold to a white man. The tribe as a group culture has become extinct, but some present-day Catawba are likely genetic descendants of the Wateree.  Notes  References  Mooney, James. Siouan Tribes of the East.

It was produced by Hanna- Barbera and is the second Christmas-themed animated work in the franchise, after the 1964 episode \\"Christmas Flintstone.\\" Both feature the character Fred Flintstone taking on the role of Santa Claus. The special first aired on NBC on December 7, 1977. The special has been released on VHS and DVD. It is followed by two more Flintstones Christmas specials, A Flintstone Family Christmas (1993) and A Flintstones Christmas Carol (1994). Plot It is Christmastime in Bedrock, and the Flintstones and the Rubbles are all getting ready for when Santa Claus comes to town. On the morning of Christmas Eve Fred is busy decorating the house, alongside Wilma and Pebbles, when the Rubbles show up. While Barney helps Fred finish the decorations before heading to work, Wilma and Betty, who have been busy with the preparations for the Christmas party at the Bedrock Orphanage, talk about how Wilma has failed to convince Fred to dress up as Santa for the children. Still, she believes that Fred will change his mind, if she keeps insisting. Fred arrives at work in Slate's Quarry, where Mr. Slate tells him that he has chosen him to be Santa for the children of Bedrock Orphanage during the Christmas party that very same night. Fred immediately accepts the honor, with Mr. Slate telling him to take the rest of the day off, while warning him that he must show up on time, or he will be fired. Leaving work, Fred heads home, while singing \\"It's My Favorite Time of the Year\\". Back at home, Fred tells Wilma how he accepted Mr. Slate's offer to be Santa, and quickly changes into the Santa costume. Shortly after, Barney shows and Wilma leaves for the orphanage, while Fred and Barney plan Fred's grand entrance. While planning, the two of them hear a noise coming from the rooftop. Going outside, they see a pair of boots stuck in the snow. Pulling them out, they find out that the owner of the boots is none other than the true Santa, who accidentally slipped and fell off Fred's roof, spraining his ankle. The guys find out that on top of a sprained ankle, Santa has also caught a cold, preventing him from delivering the presents. With Christmas in jeopardy, Barney suggests that Fred should be the one to do it. Loving the idea, Santa uses his magic, giving Fred his suit and turning Barney into a Christmas elf, while also instructing Fred on how to drive the sleigh. After a couple of mishaps, Fred and Barney start delivering the presents around the world. Having managed to deliver half of the presents, they fly over China, when they are caught in a snowstorm, which forces them to take the sleigh to a higher altitude in order to escape it. They do so, but in the process, they lose the remaining half of the presents. Calling Santa for help and explaining the situation, the old man tells them that there is only one thing to do, and that they must go to his workshop back on the North Pole to get the rest of the presents. When asking how to get there, Santa tells Fred and Barney to tell the reindeer to head back home, because they know the way. Arriving at the North Pole, Fred and Barney quickly fill the sleigh with a new set of presents and fly into the sky. They begin dropping the rest of the gifts down the chimneys, when Fred remembers about the Christmas party. Knowing that they will not be able to reach Bedrock in time, they call Santa for help, who tells them to put the sleigh in top speed. This allows them to deliver the rest of the presents and reach Bedrock in time. Not having a minute to lose, they arrive at the orphanage, sliding down the chimney. Using Santa's magic to produce gifts for the orphans, Fred not only saves the party, but also his job.

The convention was elected in early 1861, and voted against secession. When open fighting broke out between Pro-Confederate governor Claiborne Fox Jackson and Union authorities, and Union forces occupied the state capital, the convention formed a provisional state government, and functioned as a quasi-legislature for several years. The convention never did produce a new constitution; that task was delegated to a new convention, elected in 1864. Background Missouri has had four constitutions:Law Matters: A Celebration of Two Constitutions by Missouri Chief Justice Michael A. Wolff - Your Missouri Courts - September 9, 2005 *1820 (when the state entered the Union) *1865 (at the conclusion of the Civil War) *1875 (at the end of Reconstruction) *1945 (in the wake of the toppling of the Pendergast Machine). The 1820 constitution provided for minor revisions to be made by amendment, but required that any general revision be carried out by an elected special convention. When secession was proposed, the Missouri General Assembly (the state legislature) voted that such a drastic change in the status of Missouri was comparable to such a general revision, that the General Assembly was not empowered to decide the issue, and called a convention. The bill calling the convention passed on 17 January. The election was scheduled for 18 February, with three delegates chosen from each state senate district (99 total). In addition, by an amendment submitted by Charles H. Hardin, a secession declaration by the convention would have to be ratified in a referendum by a majority vote of the state's qualified voters. Hardin's amendment passed the state senate by only two votes, 17 to 15. Three groups contended for the convention seats. One group called for Missouri to follow the Deep South slave states such as South Carolina by declaring secession immediately - not even waiting for Abraham Lincoln to take office as President. Another group opposed secession at any time; they were the Unconditional Union Party. A third group opposed immediate secession, but was willing to consider secession unless the various slavery- related political questions were resolved on terms acceptable to the slave states. These men were \\"conditional Unionists\\". The two Unionist factions won nearly all the seats. At that time, both outgoing governor Robert Marcellus Stewart and incoming governor Jackson had declared that Missouri should remain neutral in any conflict between the Union and Confederacy. First session The convention met on 28 February 1861, in Jefferson City, the state capital. 82 of the 99 delegates had been born in slave states, including 53 from Virginia and Kentucky.Missouri in the Civil War - Vol. 9 Chapter III On 1 March, the convention chose as chairman former governor Sterling Price, a conditional Unionist. The convention then adjourned, and reassembled on 4 March in Mercantile Library in St. Louis.St. Louis Mercantile Timeline On March 19 the convention voted 98-1 against secession.Journal and Proceedings of the Missouri State Convention Held at Jefferson City and St. Louis, March 1861, George Knapp & Co., 1861, p. 46 The convention resolved: > That at present there is no adequate cause to impel Missouri to dissolve her > connection with the Federal Union, but on the contrary she will labor for > such an adjustment of existing troubles as will secure the peace, as well as > the rights and equality of all the > States.http://gathkinsons.net/sesqui/?p=2265 Gathman, Allen, \\"March 19, > 1861: Missouri Convention rejects secession\\", March 19, 2011Journal and > Proceedings of the Missouri State Convention Held at Jefferson City and St. > Louis, March 1861, George Knapp & Co., 1861, p. 36 The convention established a Federal relations committee, with Unconditional Unionist Hamilton Rowan Gamble as chairman. The committee declared that while most Missourians might sympathize with the South, secession from the Union was too dangerous. > The position of Missouri in relation to the adjacent States which would > continue in the Union, would necessarily expose her, if she became a member > of a new confederacy, to utter destruction whenever any rupture might take > place between the different republics. In a military aspect, secession and > connection with a Southern confederacy is annihilation for Missouri. The > true position for her to assume is that of a State whose interests are bound > up in the maintenance of the Union, and whose kind feelings and strong > sympathies are with the people of the Southern States with whom they are > connected by ties of friendship and blood. The convention then adjourned. Second session Missouri could remain inactive and effectively neutral, as long there was no fighting between the Union and the Confederacy. However, on 13‚Äì14 April, Confederate forces bombarded and captured Fort Sumter in South Carolina. The following day Abraham Lincoln declared a state of rebellion existed and called for the states to provide troops to put down rebellion. This included a request for several regiments from Missouri. Governor Jackson rejected the request, declaring it to be illegal, arguing that the constitution gave no authority to the federal government to make war on the states. On 20 April secessionist militia companies seized the U.S. Arsenal in Liberty, Missouri. Governor Jackson plotted to seize the St. Louis Arsenal. He called out the state militia, appointed pro-secession officers to command it, and obtained artillery from the Confederacy. Union forces under U.S. Army Captain Nathaniel Lyon reacted on 10 May surrounding the militia and taking them prisoner in the Camp Jackson Affair. This drastic action prompted the General Assembly to pass a military bill proposed by Governor Jackson, which reorganized the militia as the Missouri State Guard. Jackson appointed Sterling Price as commander of the Guard. Price and General William S. Harney, the top Union commander in Missouri, agreed to the Price-Harney Truce, which lasted until Lyon replaced Harney. Lyon met with Governor Jackson and General Price. He gave them one hour to leave the city, telling them he intended to seize control of the state from them. Lyon then marched his forces on Jefferson City, entering the undefended state capital on 15 June. The executive committee of the convention called a new session to meet on July 22. Twenty of the members were now in retreat with Jackson and Price (the original chairman). Pro-Union vice chairman Robert Wilson became the chairman. The remaining convention members declared all of the state's elective offices to be vacant and appointed pro- Union provisional officers, some of whom were not even in the state at the time. These included: *Governor - Hamilton Rowan Gamble *Lt. Governor - Willard P. Hall *Secretary of State - Mordecai Oliver *Treasurer - George Caleb Bingham The convention also declared all offices of the Missouri General Assembly vacant, and ordered an election to be held in November to fill the executive and legislative offices. The convention adjourned on July 31. Third session The constitutional convention met for the third time in St. Louis on 10 October 1861. It abolished many state offices, cut the salaries of state employees by 20 percent, postponed the planned state election to August 1862, created provisions for a new pro-Union state militia, and enacted a loyalty oath requirement for all state officials. Fourth session The convention held its fourth session time in Jefferson City in June 1862. In this session, the convention imposed its loyalty oath on teachers, attorneys, bank officers, and preachers, and on voters, thereby ensuring a strong Union vote in future elections. (Lincoln, who had received 10.3% of the Missouri vote in the 1860 election, received 70% in the 1864 election.) In 1861, General John C. Fr√©mont had issued an emancipation decree for Missouri. Lincoln rescinded it as a dangerous measure that would alienate Unionists in Missouri and Kentucky. In 1862, the convention tried unsuccessfully to abolish slavery in Missouri. Fifth session Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation declared free all slaves in Confederate-held territory, but not those in Union-held territory such as states that had not seceded. The final session of the convention met in June 1863 with the aim of eliminating slavery in the state. The major obstacle was a provision in the constitution that required consent of the slave's owner and payment of compensation. The state did not have enough money to do so. Therefore, the convention passed an ordinance for gradual emancipation with compensation, a process to be completed on 4 July 1870. Constitutional convention of 1865 This plan for gradual emancipation infuriated the Radical Republicans, who wanted slavery abolished immediately. They took their grievances to Lincoln, who refused to take sides in the dispute. Provisional governor Gamble offered to resign, but the convention would not accept it. He died in office on 31 January 1864. Lincoln's inaction became a grievance for the Radicals, and in the election of 1864, they nominated John C. Fr√©mont for President, hoping to replace Lincoln. (Fr√©mont dropped out of the campaign a few weeks later.) The Radicals also arranged for elections to a new constitutional convention. In November 1864, the Radicals won two-thirds of the seats to the convention, which elected Radical leader Thomas Clement Fletcher as governor of Missouri. The convention met in the Mercantile Library on 6 January 1865. On 11 January, the convention, by a 60 to 4 vote, abolished slavery in the state with no compensation for owners. A month later the convention approved the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to abolish slavery throughout the U.S. The convention also wrote a new constitution for the state, which remained in force until 1875.

Background Brian McTigue's birth as registered in Wigan, Lancashire, England, and he died aged 51. Playing career ‚ÄòSheer Wizardry' often described the distribution skills and sleight of hand of Brian McTigue. He started his Wigan career as a , but took his handling skills into the pack where he won many club and international honours. The sport however, nearly missed the talents of Brian McTigue because boxing was his first love at one time. He was so highly rated that former world champion Joey Maxim invited him to the United States after McTigue had figured in some exhibitions with the American. McTigue decided to stick with rugby and, after only five games as a hooker for the Giants Hall Colliery team, Wigan signed him and converted him into a three quarter. Although he made his d√©but at Oldham in April 1951, he spent the next three years languishing in the 'A' Team. Wigan were prepared to sell him to Oldham but he refused. His patience paid off and, just as it looked as though he was not going to make it, he suddenly shot to prominence. The rest of his career was nothing but one success after another. He went on to become one the all-time great prop forwards being capped 21 times by Great Britain. He made his Great Britain d√©but against Australia in 1958 and toured twice. Brian McTigue played right-, i.e. number 10, and scored a try in Wigan's 8‚Äì13 defeat by Oldham in the 1957‚Äì58 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1957‚Äì58 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 19 October 1957. Brian McTigue's Testimonial match at Wigan took place in 1960. McTigue also appeared at Wembley that year and score on try in the 13‚Äì9 win over Workington Town. He scored another try a year later as Wigan beat Hull FC, and enjoyed one of his own personal great moments as he strode like a colossus through the Hull defence and collected the Lance Todd Trophy. He was in all four Wigan sides that went to Wembley in the 1960s, an collected a third winner's medal when they beat Hunslet in 1965. After more than 400 matches, his long association with the club ended in 1966‚Äì67. He moved to Blackpool Borough but played only one more game before going to Australia to coach Bathurst St Patricks. He later returned to Wigan to work. Challenge Cup Final appearances Brian McTigue played right-, i.e. number 10, and scored a try in Wigan's 13‚Äì9 victory over Workington Town in the 1957‚Äì58 Challenge Cup Final during the 1957‚Äì58 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 10 May 1958, in front of a crowd of 66,109 played left-, i.e. number 11, and scored a try in the 30‚Äì13 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1958‚Äì59 Challenge Cup Final during the 1958‚Äì59 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 9 May 1959, in front of a crowd of 79,811, and played right- in the 20‚Äì16 victory over Hunslet in the 1964‚Äì65 Challenge Cup Final during the 1964‚Äì65 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 8 May 1965, in front of a crowd of 89,016.

The site is bounded by South Miami Avenue to the east, SW 14th Terrace to the south, SW 1st Avenue to the west, and SW 14th Street to the north. The site broke ground in 2006 and was excavated for a previous project that stalled known as Capital at Brickell. It was revived in 2014 by China City Construction Corp, an affiliate of China Communications Construction Company. History=Capital at Brickell Capital at Brickell was a proposed complex of two skyscrapers. The project was cancelled due to financial reasons caused by the Great Recession. The complex was to consist of two towers made up of residential, office, a hotel and retail, \\"Capital at Brickell Tower I\\" and \\"Capital at Brickell Tower II.\\" Tower II will be the taller one, rising to a height of . Tower I was to be tall, and will be located to the south of Tower II. Tower I was to be 53 floors and Tower II was to be 57 floors. Although not the tallest buildings proposed during the first Miami \\"Manhattanization wave\\" from 2006-2008, the towers were planned to be some of the more striking architecturally, and would have surpassed the Four Seasons Hotel Miami as the city's tallest building, but not the Panorama Tower completed in 2017. Both towers were designed to be reminiscent of the Chrysler Building in New York City. The tops of the buildings were especially similar, with a \\"crown\\" at the top of each building and a similar spire. The towers were part of the recent push to build more skyscrapers in the western side of the Brickell neighborhood, which does not border Biscayne Bay as does most of Downtown. The architect of the complex was Fullerton-Diaz Architects, Inc. The developer was Cabi Developers, led by VP of Development Miroslav \\"Misha\\" Mladenovic. In July 2011, two developers began competing for the lot. CCCC Miami CCCC sign was briefly with the old Capital sign in 2016 In December 2014, the site was sold to Chinese developers for US$74.74 million, who plan a redesign. In 2015 it was revealed that they were aiming to build the tallest building in Miami and that it could be largely office space, though it would be mixed-use. They are seeking EB-5 funding, similar to Panorama Tower, to cover part of the expected $875 million cost.

The program was co-hosted by Harry Reasoner and Mary Fickett. Madeline Amgott, who became one of the first women to produce television news during the 1950s and 1960s, helped create the show. CBS scheduled the half-hour program in the 10 a.m. timeslot on the East Coast. Since the network then believed women were the primary audience for daytime television, it created a substantive information program geared toward a female audience. Each show began with Reasoner giving a summary of the latest news and then introducing the topic for the day, which was presented by Fickett. A review in TV Guide commended Reasoner for not oversimplifying the news and noted that Fickett contributed \\"as another intelligent questioner and commentator\\" rather than someone who just represented \\"the woman's side.\\" Calendar's topics were diverse, ranging from national politics to interior decorating. The mood of the program was relaxed despite its serious ambition. During an interview with a designer of modern furniture, Reasoner asked, \\"What would you say if I said you were giving us 'fake simplicity'?\\" The designer responded, \\"I'd say you're being offensive.\\" And on a day when the topic was redrawing voting districts to equalize representation between urban and rural regions, Fickett introduced the segment by acknowledging it was a subject that \\"sounds weighty for this time of the morning\\" before assuring viewers that she herself had found it interesting.

He traveled to India a second time in 1847, spending a decade, mainly in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh state, in southern India, where he ministered and performed yeoman service to the people there. Supported initially by the Pennsylvania Ministerium, and later by the Foreign Mission Board of the General Synod, Heyer was also encouraged and assisted by British government officials. He established a number of hospitals and a network of schools throughout the Guntur region. Later travels For health reasons, he returned to the United States in 1857, and spent the next decade organizing churches, particularly in the new State of Minnesota.

In January 1872, he was appointed chaplain and the first \\" house father\\" of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia. Despite his brief time among the students, he was much respected and loved by the faculty and students. He died in 1873 at the age of eighty, and his body was buried beside his wife in the Friedens Lutheran Church cemetery, Friedens, Pennsylvania. His estate contained roughly $7,000-$500 of which he devoted to pay for his final expenses, a grave stone, and erecting an iron fence around his and his wife's graves. He left $2,500 to his children and grandchildren, with the condition that his grandchildren remain members of the Lutheran Church and abstain from alcohol and tobacco, and bequeathed the remaining $4,000 to the Somerset Lutheran congregation, the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Ministerium for foreign mission work in India, and to the Passavant orphanages in Zelienople and Germantown Pennsylvania. Legacies In 1880, when a missionary society was organized by the students at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Mount Airy, they named it the Father Heyer Missionary Society. The missionary field that Heyer founded in Guntur in 1842‚Äîtogether with the Rajahmundry Mission that was founded by the Rev. Luis P.

Biography He was the son of Thomas W. Fairburn and Elizabeth Jemima Frosdick,Census, immigration, vital records and passport applications, England and USA, for William Armstrong Fairburn, Thomas W. Fairburn, Jemima Elizabeth Frosdick and families at http://ancestry.com . who married in Leeds, Yorkshire, England, in 1867. Census information shows that Thomas worked as a ship fitter, then foreman at a ship yard in Braintree, Massachusetts. He made trips home to visit family still in Huddersfield, and his passport application (1923) shows that he was born in Hull, England in 1849, and that his father was another Thomas. William was born in Huddersfield, England, 12 October 1876, the 1891 census showing that he had already begun work as a \\"Post Office boy\\" by the age of 14. He emigrated in May 1891 from Liverpool to New York on the \\"S.S. Servia\\" with his mother Elizabeth, and sisters Alice and Annie, following his father who had emigrated the year before. He attended the public schools in Bath, Maine, became an apprentice, and by age 18 was a master mechanic. In 1896, he went to the University of Glasgow and studied naval architecture and marine engineering for a year. He returned home to work at Bath Iron Works where he built an all-steel freighter, the first in America. By 1900 he was an independent consultant. In this capacity, he met O. C. Barber and Edward R. Stettinius, Sr., at the Stirling Boiler Co. (later merged into Babcock & Wilcox). They were also executives at the Diamond Match Company, and in 1909 they put Fairburn in charge of its operations in hopes of solving some problems it had encountered. In the 1910 census (Groton, Connecticut), Fairburn is shown as a naval architect. A major problem at Diamond Match was the white phosphorus used in making matches which caused health problems for workers and poisoned children who ate the matches. Fairburn discovered company patents which provided an alternative, and, working with company chemists, by 1911 an improved match, which substituted sesquisulfide for the phosphorus, was introduced. At Diamond Match, Fairburn also discovered and worked out a chemical process for extracting potash from kelp. Owing to this discovery, the price of matches did not increase when the start of World War I shut off the old sources of potash supply. Fairburn later became president of the Diamond Match Company in 1915, succeeding Stettenius. In the 1930 census (Morris, New Jersey), he is shown as an executive in a match factory. The Fairburn Marine Education Foundation, Inc., of Center Lovell, Maine, was established in his honor. Writings Fairburn published several dozen books in the early twentieth century concerned generally with sociology in the workplace, theories and speculations on human potentialities, and other topics. Among his works are: * Human Chemistry (1914) This work describes workers as chemical elements in a well-stocked laboratory and handlers of people as chemists. * Man and his health; Liquids (1916) * Life and Work (1916) * Mentality and Freedom (1917) * Organization and Success (1923) * Justice and Law (1927) * Russia, the Utopia in chains (1931) * Work and workers: Essays and miscellaneous writings (1933) Family He married Isabella Louise Ramsay (born 4 August 1878, Summerfield, Prince Edward Island, Canada) in September 1904.

It provides highly skilled Airmen and operationally ready equipment necessary to meet United States inter-theater airlift and expeditionary combat support commitments. Multiple groups, squadrons, and flights execute the unit's mission by providing administrative and logistical support, including airlift operations, combat control, pararescue, maintenance, supply, transportation, contracting, communications, civil engineering, personnel, base services, security forces, and medical functions.

Received federal recognition by the National Guard Bureau and activated on 1 May 1956 as the 105th Fighter Group (Air Defense). The group was assigned to the NY ANG 107th Air Defense Wing and stationed at Westchester County Airport, White Plains, New York. Cold War Its primary mission was the air defense of New York City and Long Island. It was assigned the 137th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron as operational unit, equipped with F-94B Starfires. A major change to the 107th Air Defense Wing in 1958 was the transition from an Air Defense Command (ADC) mission to Tactical Air Command (TAC) and a tactical fighter mission, the 105th being re-designated as a Tactical Fighter Group and the 137th also being re-designated. The new assignment involved a change in the group's training mission to include high-altitude interception, air-to- ground rocketry, ground strafing and tactical bombing. The 137th TFS retained their F-86H Sabres. =Airlift mission= The 105th Tactical Fighter Group was inactivated on 1 February 1961 with the 137th being transferred to the 106th Aeromedical Transport Group on 1 February 1961 and was re-designated as the 137th Aeromedical Transport Squadron under the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). The 137th converted to flying the C-119 Flying Boxcar. The squadron airlifted critically injured and sick personnel until late 1963. With air transportation recognized as a critical need, the 137th was re-designated the 137th Air Transport Squadron (Heavy) 1 December 1963 and equipped with C-97 Stratofreighter heavy transports, although the Aeromedical Flight remained as a secondary mission. With the C-97s, the 102d augmented MATS airlift capability worldwide in support of the Air Force's needs in Europe. It also flew scheduled MATS transport missions to Europe, Africa the Caribbean and South America. On 8 January 1966, Military Air Transport Service became Military Airlift Command (MAC) and the 137th was re-designated as the 137th Military Airlift Squadron. In 1966, the squadron began operations to and from bases in South Vietnam. During 1967, in addition to the Southeast Asia flights which continued throughout the year until September, the squadron flew missions to South America, Africa, Australia, Asia and Europe in support of the Military Airlift Command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff airlift (directed) missions. The overseas flights also were in addition to a variety of airlift missions flown within the continental United States to include Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico carrying personnel of the active military, Reserve and National Guard units to and from training sites and a continuing series of joint exercises. =Forward air support mission= In 1969 the C-97s were reaching the end of their operational lifetime and in March, the 105th changed again to become the 105th Tactical Air Support Group and became part of Tactical Air Command. The 137th received interim Cessna U-3 aircraft which was shortly replaced with the O-2A Super Skymaster direct from Cessna. The O-2 was the military version of the Cessna 337 Skymaster, a high wing, twin boom aircraft with a unique centerline pusher/tractor twin engine configuration. The O-2A version, used by the 137th TASS, was used in forward air control (FAC) missions, often in conjunction with a ground FAC and ROMAD (radio operator, maintenance, and driver) team. The mission of the 105th Tactical Air Support Group was to train forward air controllers and to maintain proficiency in the unit aircraft. An unusual highlight of 1970 was the call to active duty on 24, 25 and 26 March for the New York City Postal Strike, U.S. Post Office workers went off the job in a pay dispute, and President Richard Nixon called on New York City area Guardsmen to sort and deliver the mail. The 105th performed its postal duties at the Main Bronx Post Office, on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. Members of the unit were rewarded for this service with a year off their active reserve commitment. The NYANG ramp at the Westchester County Airport continued to be the \\"entrance of choice\\" by foreign dignitaries, and President Nixon during 1970. The Presidents of France, Ecuador, and several other foreign notables landed there on visits to the U.S. President Nixon arrived there during his campaign for Republican Congressmen in the fall During this time, the unit received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. After becoming a part of the Tactical Air Command, the unit received the New York State Governor's Trophy, as the State's outstanding flying unit, more than one half of the years. As part of the draw-down of forces in Southeast Asia, aircraft from the Vietnam War were added to make up the allocated number to the Group. However, the 105th had to actually rebuild most of the Vietnam Veteran aircraft, which had been through the most rigorous of combat operations in South Vietnam. The 105th made national news through their program of assisting local governmental health agencies in the detection of violations of water and stream pollution laws. 105th pilots, on the kind of observation missions they would be doing in combat, initiated a program of photography and reporting to local civic officials. The local health agency would then send its own aircraft up to take similar photographs for evidence and possible action. The 105th was awarded the Governor's Trophy for 1974, signifying the outstanding flying unit of the New York Air National Guard for that year. The 105th was upgraded to a wing on 14 June 1975, the group becoming the operational organization for the new wing organization. In August 1978, the group was inactivated with the 137th TASS being assigned directly to the Wing. However, the unit reverted to Group status on 1 July 1979, when the Wing organization was transferred to the 174th Tactical Fighter Group to accommodate the newly organized A-10 Thunderbolt II Wing. In 1981, the group deployed to Lechfeld Air Base, West Germany, to observe A-10 close air support operations, and forward air control in the NATO/USAFE environment. The visit provided a first-hand look at tactics used by various NATO members, as well as an in-depth look at forward operating locations and NATO air tasking orders. In the early 1980s, it became apparent that the facility at Westchester Airport was not large enough to support a conversion to a new aircraft or mission. The state's Division of Military and Naval Affairs started negotiations with National Guard Bureau to relocate the unit. As a result, USAF and the Air National Guard approved a unit relocation to Stewart International Airport, Newburgh, New York. This move took advantage of the excellent airfield facilities at Stewart, which was an active Air Force Base through 1969. The move, initiated during 1982, was completed by the last quarter of 1983. =Strategic airlift= 137th Airlift Squadron C-5A taxiing for takeoff at Portland International Airport In May 1983, the unit relocated to Stewart International Airport. It was re-designated the 105th Military Airlift Group on 1 May 1984 and later in July 1985 became the first Air National Guard unit in the nation to fly the C-5A Galaxy aircraft. Soon after receiving its first C-5A aircraft, in October 1985 the unit airlifted 84,600 pounds of cots and bedding to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Gloria. In October 1988, the 105th airlifted 300,000 pounds of hurricane relief and reconstruction supplies to the Jamaica following Hurricane Gilbert. In January 1989, the unit carried 146,610 pounds of earthquake relief supplies to aid Soviet Armenia. In March 1989, the 105th responded with less than 24 hours notice to an AMC request to airlift an over 80,000-pound submersible vehicle from Andrews AFB, Maryland and Homestead AFB, Florida, to Kadena AB, Japan to assist in search and recovery operations for an Air Force Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopter which crashed in the East China Sea. Throughout the summer and fall of 1989, the 105th continued to support reconstruction efforts in Jamaica by airlifting National Guard civil engineering teams and equipment to that island nation. Beginning in October 1989, the unit airlifted over 2,000,000 pounds of relief supplies to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands following Hurricane Hugo. In December 1991, the 105th airlifted over 145,000 pounds of clothing, blankets and medical supplies to Bucharest, Romania. In February 1992, the unit participated in Operation Provide Hope, the airlift of humanitarian aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union), delivering 384,000 pounds of relief materials to Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Yerevan, Armenia. 1989 ended on a dramatic note for the 105th Airlift Wing as it performed its wartime mission in support of Operation Just Cause. The over 2,200,000 pounds of cargo airlifted by the 105th in support of that operation represented approximately 25% of the initial total airlift effort of all of the Military Airlift Command's C-5 fleet assigned to both active duty and reserve component elements. 137th AS C-5A Galaxy (s/n 70-0460) sits on the flightline before cargo is loaded on 5 September 2005 by airmen with the 109th Aerial Port Squadron at the Albany International Airport. The cargo was bound for Gulfport, Mississippi, in support of Hurricane Katrina relief operations. On 7 August 1990, Governor Mario Cuomo announced that the Department of Defense had requested, and he had approved, the participation of the personnel and C-5A aircraft of the 105th in active and direct support of Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf region. On 24 August, the 137th Military Airlift Squadron was called to active duty by President George H. W. Bush to provide continued support for the operation. While the 137th was released from active duty on 15 May 1991, the majority of unit members chose to remain in active status until 1 August 1991 in response to the Military Airlift Command's need for continuing airlift support of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Provide Comfort (Kurdish relief). On 28 February 1991, a part of the 105th USAF Clinic was also called to active duty with duty stations at Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, Maryland. All medical personnel were released from active duty during May 1991 In March 1992, with the end of the Cold War, the 105th adopted the Air Force Objective Organization plan, and the unit was re-designated as the 105th Airlift Group. On 1 October 1995, in accordance with the Air Force \\"One Base ‚Äì One Wing\\" policy, the 105th Airlift Wing was established and the 137th Airlift Squadron was assigned to the new 105th Operations Group. In September 1992, the unit responded to Hurricane Andrew, delivering 1,289,953 pounds of food, tents, mobile kitchens, vehicles, and emergency services personnel to the Homestead area of South Florida. In November 1992, the 105th airlifted 118,450 pounds‚Äîincluding generators, portable shelters and medical supplies and equipment‚Äîto Zagreb, Croatia to support the U.S. Army's 212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital's establishment of a facility to provide a full range of health care for United Nations forces deployed in Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina. From December 1992 to April 1993, the 105th supported Operation Restore Hope, providing humanitarian airlift of 2,800,000 pounds of supplies and over 600 passengers into Somalia. Following massive flooding in the central United States in July 1993, the unit airlifted, to Des Moines, Iowa; ten reverse osmosis water purification systems weighing a total of over 380,000 pounds and capable of providing over 600,000 gallons of potable water a day. In August 1993 the unit airlifted 75 tons of relief supplies and equipment to Southern Turkey to be used to help Kurdish refugees from Iraqi terrorism.

In October 1993, the 105th returned to Somalia, delivering military personnel and almost 860,000 pounds of equipment non-stop‚Äîwith triple air refueling‚Äîdirectly from bases in the United States to Mogadishu. In July 1994, 105th aircraft began carrying humanitarian relief supplies to the people of Rwanda‚Äîby early September 1,635,189 pounds of supplies and equipment were delivered to the African Great Lakes region. In late September 1994, the unit began airlifting over a million pounds of supplies and equipment to Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy. The 105th played a key role in July 1995 for Operation Quick Lift when it airlifted 431,000 pounds of cargo and 190 British troops from RAF Brize Norton, UK to Split Croatia in support of the United Nations' Rapid Reaction Deployment Force. In October 1994, 105th aircraft and volunteer crews played a role in Operation Vigilant Warrior and Operation Southern Watch, deterring potential Iraqi aggression in the Arabian Peninsula. In August 1995, the 105th played a role in airlifting personnel and equipment to Kuwait in support of Operation Vigilant Warrior II and Exercise Intrinsic Action. Immediately following Hurricane Marilyn in September 1995, the unit airlifted 527,200 pounds of supplies and equipment to the citizens of the American Virgin Islands. In December 1995, 105th Airlift Wing C-5 crews embarked on the first of six missions in support of President Clinton's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, transporting almost 800,000 pounds of U.S. Army support equipment to the European theater. The 105th returned to the African Great Lakes country of Rwanda in March 1996 to deliver 120,000 pounds of supplies and equipment in support of the Rwandan War Crimes Tribunal and the World Food Program. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix active-duty, reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. Since 1996, the 137th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron was formed and deployed in support of world contingencies including Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Allied Force, and Operation Joint Guardian. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the 137th EAS was formed and activated to support Operation Northern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. =Post Cold War Era= 137th Airlift Squadron ‚Äì McDonnell Douglas C-17A Globemaster III 95-0005 On 27 November 2010, the USAF selected the New York Air National Guard's 105th Airlift Wing at Stewart Air National Guard Base as its \\"preferred base\\" for eight C-17 Globemaster III aircraft. The 12 C-5A Galaxy operated by the 105th AW were retired and replaced by the C-17s. The last 105th Airlift Wing based C-5A Galaxy, tail number 0001, departed its Hudson Valley home for the last time on 19 September 2012. The initial C-17 assigned to Stewart AGB, tail number 50105, arrived on 18 July 2011. The 105th AW C-17 roll-out ceremony was held 6 August 2011 with two C-17s being placed on display during the event, the first of eight which replaced the larger, aging C-5A fleet. Unlike its predecessor, the C-17 can take off and land from unpaved runways. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the 105th Airlift Wing and the 213d Engineering Installation Squadron deployed 75 New York ANG Airmen as part of the state response to the disaster in New York City and Long Island. The Airmen were part of Joint Operations Area 3, Joint Task Force 3 hurricane relief operations in Manhattan and were among more than 2,400 Army and ANG service members deployed at the order of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

A preliminary version of the character also appears in the novel Go Set a Watchman, written in the mid-1950s but not published until 2015. Atticus is a lawyer and resident of the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, and the father of Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Finch and Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. He represents the African-American man Tom Robinson in his trial where he is charged with rape of Mayella Ewell. Lee based the character on her own father, Amasa Coleman Lee, an Alabama lawyer, who, like Atticus, represented black defendants in a highly publicized criminal trial. Book magazine's list of The 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 names Finch as the seventh best fictional character of 20th-century literature. In 2003, the American Film Institute voted Atticus Finch, as portrayed in an Academy Award-winning performance by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film adaptation, as the greatest hero of all American cinema. In the 2018 Broadway stage play adapted by Aaron Sorkin, Finch is portrayed by various actors including Jeff Daniels, Ed Harris, Greg Kinnear, Rhys Ifans, and Richard Thomas.  Effect on the legal profession  Claudia Durst Johnson has commented about critiques of the novel, saying, \\"A greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals\\".Johnson, Boundaries pp. 25‚Äì27 Alice Petry remarked, \\"Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person\\".Petry, p. xxiii Examples of Atticus Finch's impact on the legal profession are plentiful. Richard Paul Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence.Petry, p. xxiv One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook from which he taught was To Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in the Michigan Law Review asserts, \\"No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession\\", before questioning whether \\"Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun.\\"Lubet, Steven. \\"Reconstructing Atticus Finch.\\" Michigan Law Review 97, no. 6 (May 1999): 1339‚Äì62. In 1992 Monroe H. Freedman, a professor of law and noted legal ethicist, published two articles in the national legal newspaper Legal Times calling for the legal profession to set aside Atticus Finch as a role model. Freedman argued that Atticus still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered. Freedman's article sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession holding Atticus Finch as a hero and the reason for which they became lawyers.Monroe H. Freedman, \\"Atticus Finch, Esq., R.I.P.\\", 14 Legal TImes 20 (1992); Monroe H. Freedman, \\"Finch: The Lawyer Mythologized\\", 14 Legal TImes 25 (1992) and Monroe Freedman, \\"Atticus Finch ‚Äì Right and Wrong\\", 45 Ala. L. Rev. 473 (1994). Freedman argued that Atticus Finch is dishonest, unethical, sexist, and inherently racist, and that he did nothing to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb.Metress, Christopher. \\"The Rise and Fall of Atticus Finch.\\" The Chattahoochee Review; 24 (1): September, 2003 Freedman's article sparked furious controversy, with one legal scholar opining, \\"What Monroe really wants is for Atticus to be working on the front lines for the NAACP in the 1930s, and, if he's not, he's disqualified from being any kind of hero; Monroe has this vision of lawyer as prophet. Atticus has a vision of lawyer not only as prophet, but as parish priest\\". In 1997 the Alabama State Bar erected a monument dedicated to Atticus in Monroeville marking his existence as the \\"first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history\\".\\"'Mockingbird' Hero Honored in Monroeville.\\" Birmingham News (Alabama): May 3, 1997; Pg. 7A.  Social references  Atticus Finch's willingness to support social outcasts and victims of prejudice is the eponymous inspiration for the name of the Atticus Circle, which is an organization composed of \\"straight allies\\" (that is, heterosexual people supportive of the LGBT rights movement). In 2016, the lawyer Joseph Madison Beck published the memoir My Father & Atticus Finch, in which he noted the numerous parallels between his father Foster Beck's defense of a black man accused of raping a white woman in the 1938 trial State of Alabama vs. Charles White, Alias, and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird. In a letter to the author, Harper Lee herself noted the \\"obvious parallels\\" between the cases (Lee was 12 at the time of the Charles White trial) and between Atticus Finch and Foster Beck, though she also stated that she could not recall the trial, and that To Kill a Mockingbird was a work of fiction.Beck, My Father & Atticus Finch, p. vii Former President Barack Obama referenced Atticus Finch as an ideal American character. In addition Atticus was mentioned during one of Obama's speeches.  Go Set a Watchman  In July 2015, days before Lee's highly anticipated second novel, Go Set a Watchman, was officially published, the first chapter was released on The Guardian for public viewing. On that day, a New York Times review of the book (which is set about twenty years after the time period depicted in Mockingbird but is not a chronological sequel) revealed that Atticus, depicted in this version as being in his early seventies, is portrayed as a far less progressive character. He makes comments that favor segregation and has attended a Citizens' Council meeting. This has proved controversial to many readers, unaware perhaps that although To Kill a Mockingbird was published first, Watchman is the first draft of the text that later became Mockingbird and the characterizations and key plot details between the two books are not only different but sometimes contradictory. In terms of plot, Tom Robinson is acquitted in Watchman while in Mockingbird his unjust conviction as the result of prejudice was a central part of not only the story but why Atticus is seen culturally as such a righteous and progressive character. His defense is based on not just Robinson's innocence but on his fundamental equality. His closing argument is a more polished version of the progressive argument the adult Jean Louise makes in Watchman and there are other instances where both versions contain the same descriptions word for word. This kind of character development, where motivations and ideals between characters, for reasons of plot, are changed is not unusual in the process of creative writing. Apart from the more progressive depiction of Atticus, the depiction of the town itself, especially the African-American characters, is also dramatically altered between the two drafts. Real-life comparisons with Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, have also been made in the two differing versions of Atticus in that originally Amasa Lee was in favor of segregation but became more liberal later in life, later changing his views to those of Integration. Tay Hohoff, Lee's editor, has also been argued to have played a major part in the character development of the novel and particularly Atticus' liberal transformation. Jonathan Mahler of The New York Times notes in his article The Invisible Hand Behind Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird that Ms. Hohoff, at the same time as she was guiding Ms. Lee through the Mockingbird re-write, was working on her own biography of the early-20th-century New York activist and humanist John Lovejoy Elliot. He notes that the book, A Ministry to Man, was published in 1959, a year before Mockingbird.  References  Bibliography  *Beck, J. M. (2016).

Designed by Ivan Zvezdin and completed in 1935, it is the only listed postconstructivist memorial building in the city. It was reconstructed between 1999 and 2003 to meet modern safety standards and Zvezdin's original design, both externally and internally. The site The school was built on a 2.9 hectare waterfront lot between Sadovnicheskaya Street and Vodootvodny Canal. This area, near Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge, underwent significant construction in the 1930s. The bridge and adjacent Textile Institute were completed in 1938. Further east, the historical Sadovniki area retained its 19th-century mix of residential blocks, military depots and factories. The architect Ivan Andreyevich Zvezdin was born in 1899 in Nizhny Novgorod. He studied in Warsaw, Nizhny Novgorod and graduated from the Moscow Institute of Civil Engineers in 1927. He spent his entire life working on low-profile architectural and city planning projects in Moscow, such as working-class apartment buildings, schools and theaters. Since 1935, Zvezdin has been associated with Mossovet Workshop No. 10. He died in 1979 and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery. Architecture Between 1932 and 1936, Soviet architects began to transition from the Constructivism of the 1920s to Stalinist architecture. Two groups of architects - constructivists and neoclassicists - converged on the same transitional style, known as postconstructivism (or simply early Stalinism) and featuring classical shapes without classical detail; in which the architects stopped experimenting with shapes. However, they remained reluctant to accept classical order. Instead, they invented their own order, in which they combined large window surfaces with slim, capital-less supporting columns. School 518, for example, has such constructivist features as large glass panes and circular top floor windows. It also has a portico of slim white columns supporting the protruding third-floor hall, and is perfectly symmetrical. Technologically, it was built of man-made lime and cinder blocks, with wooden ceilings, partitions and roof trusses. With a gross volume of 18,500 cubic meters, it has nearly twice more volume per student than the 1935 standard (30.8 vs. 16.5 cubic meters per student). History Zvezdin designed a so-called Moscow Suburban School (–ü–æ–¥–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞) for 600 students, an experimental institution with a main school hall, gym, stadium and workshops. By 1935, the age of experimentation was over, and the main building opened as two regular high schools - No. 518 for boys and No. 519 for girls. Other buildings were never completed; a small gym was attached in 1950s. The main building was only partially completed. It had open-air terraces but no provisions for open-air classes, and the rear wall was coarsely finished. During World War II the school was converted to a military hospital. Reconstruction By 1996, the cinder and wood structure was literally falling apart, and demolition was imminent. Parents and preservationists, led by Selim Khan-Magomedov, managed to list the school on the national register of memorial buildings. Thus, it became the only listed postconstructivist building in Moscow. This memorial status allowed it to receive city funding for reconstruction of the protected interiors and southern facade. The reconstructions between 1999 and 2003 also expanded the rear facade, adding the fourth floor with circular windows. Single-story rear terraces were built out to complete the building's 4-story height. Additionally, the small gym was torn down and replaced with a larger, separate structure. Historical interiors were rebuilt to 1935 drawings. Unlike other recently rebuilt constructivist buildings (i.e. Mostorg by Vesnin brothers), School 518 retains its original function and interiors.

The adaptation is based on the novel of the same name by Bernard Cornwell. Plot summary In 1813, the war turns in favour of the British. Lord Wellington (Hugh Fraser) is poised to invade southern France after triumphing in Spain. The Comte de Maquerre (Christian Brendel), a French nobleman, offers to raise a rebellion in Bordeaux against Napoleon. Major General Ross (James Laurenson), is unconvinced, as his spies have reported no discontent in the region, but agrees that a brigade can be sent as a probe if the Comte can provide a secure base; he offers a family castle, though he admits that it is garrisoned. Wellington is forced to put a young, inexperienced Colonel Horace Bampfylde (Christopher Villiers) (the son of a general Wellington needs to placate) in charge of the expedition, instead of Major Sharpe (Sean Bean). Sharpe is reluctant to go, as he has just married Jane Gibbons (Abigail Cruttenden) and she has come down with a deadly fever. Without quinine, her prognosis is bleak, but he is a soldier and he has his orders. Bampfylde botches the initial assault on the fortress and is driven back with heavy casualties. Disgusted, Sharpe and his men gain entry to the castle at night by a ruse, pretending to be a French patrol, and capture the place. The Comte is reunited with his sister (Amira Casar) and gravely ill mother. For his trouble, Sharpe is sent by Bampfylde on a useless reconnaissance in order to grab the credit for himself. While Sharpe is away, the Comte brings the \\"Mayor of Bordeaux\\" to Bampfylde who confirms that Bordeaux is ripe for rebellion, however the Comte is in league with Napoleon and the mayor is in fact Napoleon's agent and Sharpe's old enemy Major Ducos (F√©odor Atkine). Ducos also tells Bampfylde that Sharpe was ambushed and killed by a French column. Now convinced that his mission is a success and there's no further reason to stay, Bampfylde is convinced by the Comte to demolish the front gates, blow up the captured ammunition, abandon the wounded, and return to Wellington immediately with the wonderful news. Sharpe's patrol meanwhile ambushes and annihilates a French column of reinforcements, and captures a resupply cart and a doctor bringing quinine for the Comte's mother. Resisting the temptation to save it for his wife, Sharpe allows it to be given to the ailing woman. Rifleman Robinson (Danny Cunningham) is found with a local French girl. Sharpe is required to hang him by Wellington's standing orders, but when the girl says she had been willing, Sharpe reduces the sentence to a beating from Sergeant Harper (Daragh O'Malley). During the incident, they question the locals and find them fiercely loyal to Napoleon and conclude that the Comte's rebellion is a sham. Hearing the explosion from the castle's magazine, Sharpe and his men hurry back. When he gets a description of the mayor, he realises he has been trapped by Major Ducos. Not only will Wellington be tricked into advancing into an ambush, but Ducos will have his own personal revenge on Sharpe. French General Calvet (Olivier Pierre) arrives with a sizable, but inexperienced, force. Under a flag of truce, the Comte reveals himself to be Napoleon's agent, and offers to let the British go free provided they leave Sharpe behind; Robinson replies for them all, \\"Fight them to the finish, sir.\\" Sharpe turns them down. In a shooting contest, sharpshooters mortally wound the Comte in the back at long range as he returns from the parley. Sharpe and his men only have 18 rounds a man. Earlier, out of gratitude for Sharpe providing her mother with quinine, the Comte's sister had told them to burn a cellar full of oyster shells to produce lime. The French attack, but are met by accurate volley shooting. With the British ammunition running low, Sharpe's men dump powdered lime from the walls, blinding their foes as they enter the castle. The British form ranks and proceed to massacre the blinded Frenchmen. The French retreat just as the British run out of ammunition. Then, a messenger arrives from Marshal Soult, Calvet's superior, wondering why he wasn't guarding the flank when Wellington attacked... fifty miles away. The wily British commander had been suspicious and so only ever intended the uprising to be a distraction while he attacked elsewhere. General Calvet hurries away, leaving Sharpe victorious. When Sharpe gets back, Bampfylde is placed under arrest for cowardice and other charges. Sharpe is astounded to find his wife well; she tells him that Wellington had gone to some lengths to obtain quinine for her.

Fru Gunillas Gr√§nd () is a historical alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden, once connecting Skeppsbron to √ñsterl√•nggatan between Johannesgr√§nd and Packhusgr√§nd. In the old town, minor passages between properties, especially those located just outside the old city wall, were often shut off by adjacent proprietors to be used as back-yards and filled with heaps of rubbish, and were frequently the subject for lengthy legal proceedings between proprietors and the city during the 17th century. While some of these alleys, such as M√•rten Trotzigs Gr√§nd, today the narrowest alley in the old town, was reopened in 1945, Fru Gunillas Gr√§nd remains closed. During the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, it was open in both ends, thereafter closed off towards Skeppsbron, and, judging from its absence on a map dated 1733, then sealed off in both ends. The alley was known as Doktor Belows gr√§nd during the end of the 17th century, probably in reference to a major proprietor in the block constantly disputing the use of the alley with his neighbours. It is most likely the alley named Herr Henning Pinnows gr√§nd (\\"Alley of Mr. Henning Pinnow\\") and Herr M√•ns Erikssons gr√§nd (\\"Alley of Mr. M√•ns Eriksson\\") in the 15th century, the former known to have sold a house to the latter in 1472.

Parties *Appellant, The United States represented by Mr. Butler, attorney-general, for the United States *Appelle, Bernardo Segui represented by Mr. White. Matter Appeal from the superior court for East Florida. January Term, 1836 Mr Justice Baldwin delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an appeal from a decree of the judge of the superior court for the eastern district of Florida, confirming the claim of the appellee to sixteen thousand acres (65 km¬≤) of land; pursuant to the Acts of Congress for the adjustment of land claims in Florida. In the court below, the petition was in the form prescribed by law, presenting a proper case for the jurisdiction of the court. The claim of the petitioner was founded on his application to the governor of East Florida, for a grant of sixteen thousand acres (65 km¬≤) of land, in consideration of his services to the Spanish government; and for erecting machinery for the purpose of sawing timber. The grant was made by the governor, in absolute property, with a promise of a title in form. The date of the grant was the 6th of December 1814. It has been suggested by the attorney- general, that though there was no express condition in the grant, one was implied from the consideration being in part the erection of a saw-mill. But we cannot attach any condition to a grant of absolute property in the whole quantity. It was exclusively for the governor to judge of the conditions to be imposed on his grant: he appears to have considered the services of the appellee a sufficient consideration, and made the grant absolute. The land was surveyed in one tract, at the place called for in the grant, on 2 September 1818. On an inspection of the whole record, we are of opinion that the title of the petitioner to the land surveyed, is valid; and therefore affirm the decree of the court below. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the superior court for the district of East Florida, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said superior court for the district of East Florida in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed. This is one of the Spanish Land Grant cases from early 19th century Florida.

Gabreski Air National Guard Base, Westhampton Beach, New York. If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Special Operations Command. The 102d Rescue Squadron, assigned to the 106th Operations Group (OG) of the 106th RQW, is a descendant organization of the World War I 102d Aero Squadron, established on 23 August 1917. It was reformed on 4 November 1922, as the 102d Observation Squadron, and is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The squadron has a history going back to 30 April 1908, and is the oldest unit of the New York Air National Guard. Overview The 106th Rescue Wing deploys worldwide to provide combat search and rescue coverage for U.S. and allied forces. Combat search and rescue missions include flying low-level, preferably at night aided with night vision goggles, to an objective area where aerial refueling of a rescue helicopter is performed, or pararescue teams are deployed. During peacetime, the unit also provides search and rescue services to the maritime community, supports the US Coast Guard in missions outside their capabilities as well as NASA.

Constituted as 394th Bombardment Group (Medium) on 15 February 1943. Activated on 5 March 1943. Trained with B-26's. Moved to RAF Boreham England, February‚ÄìMarch 1944, and assigned to Ninth Air Force. Their group marking was a white diagonal band across the fin and rudder. When the first Martin B-26 Marauders of the Group arrived some hardstands and buildings were still being built. Operations commenced only 12 days after the majority of the group arrived with the initial mission being flown on 23 March. In the weeks that followed, the 394th was repeatedly sent to attack bridges in occupied France and the Low Countries, which led to its dubbing itself 'The Bridge Busters'. A total of 96 missions, on which 5,453 tons of bombs were dropped, were flown from Boreham before the 394th was moved on 24 July to RAF Holmsley South in the New Forest due to the urgent requirement of IX Bomber Command to extend the radius of action of part of its Martin B-26 Marauder force. There was no break in operations at this critical period when the Saint-L√¥ offensive was underway. The 394th received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its work during the period 7‚Äì9 August, when it made a series of attacks against heavily defended targets, destroying four rail bridges and devastating an ammunition dump. Loading bombs on Martin B-26G-1-MA Marauder, AAF Ser. No. 43-34194, of the 584th Bomb Squadron. It was during a bridge attack on 9 August that the Lead B-26, piloted by Captain Darrell Lindsey, was hit by flak and the right engine set alight. Although knowing that the fuel tanks were likely to catch fire and explode, Lindsey did not waver from leading the bomb run or order his crew to bail out until after bombs had been released. The bombardier offered to lower the nosewheel so that Lindsey might escape through the nose hatch but, knowing the likelihood of his losing control if this was done, Lindsey ordered the bombardier to jump. Lindsey did not escape before the aircraft crashed. The award of a posthumous Medal of Honor was the only occasion that this highest US award for bravery went to a Ninth Air Force bomber crewman serving in the ETO. All told, six 394th B-26s were lost in operations from Holmsley South. The group's aircraft began to move to the airfield at Tour-en- Bessin in France (A-13) on 21 August and the last personnel left Holmesley South on the 31st. On the continent the group hit strong points at Brest and then began to operate against targets in Germany. Took part in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945, by hitting communications to deprive the enemy of supplies and reinforcements. Bombed transportation, storage facilities, and other objectives until the war ended; also dropped propaganda leaflets. By VE-Day, the 394th was based at Venlo (Y-55) in the southeastern Netherlands. The group remained in the theater to serve with United States Air Forces in Europe as part of the army of occupation at Kitzingen, Germany. It was transferred, without personnel and equipment, to the United States on 15 February 1946 and was inactivated on 31 March 1946. New York Air National Guard The wartime 394th Bombardment Group was re-designated as the 106th Bombardment Group (Light), and was allotted to the New York Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn, New York, and was extended federal recognition on 21 March 1947 and activated by the National Guard Bureau. The 106th Bombardment Group was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 394th Bombardment Group. It was assigned to the NY Air National Guard 52d Fighter Wing. The Group was assigned the 106th and 114th Bombardment Squadrons, both equipped with B-26 Invader attack bombers. Its mission was to train in proficiency with the B-26 and obtain operational readiness with the weapons system. In the postwar era, the Air National Guard was like a flying club for the many World War II veterans that filled its ranks. Parts were no problem and many of the maintenance personnel were experienced from wartime duty so readiness was quite high and the planes were often much better maintained than their USAF counterparts. A pilot could often show up at the field, check out an aircraft and go flying. However, the unit also had regular military exercises that kept up proficiency and in gunnery and bombing contests they would often score at least as well or better than active-duty USAF units, given the fact that most ANG pilots were World War II combat veterans. In October 1950, the Air National Guard converted to the wing-base (Hobson Plan) organization. As a result, the 52d Fighter Wing was withdrawn from the Air National Guard and inactivated on 31 October 1950. The 106th Bombardment Wing was activated as one of two new NY ANG Wings (the other being the 107th Fighter Wing at Niagara Falls Airport) which replaced it, both reporting directly to the New York National Guard Adjutant general in Albany. =Korean War activation= 106th Bombardment Wing B-29 Superfortresses at March AFB, 1951 With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, and the regular military's complete lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was federalized placed on active duty on 1 February 1951. The 102d and 114th's B-26 light attack bombers were sent to Fifth Air Force in Japan for use in the Korean War, and the 106th Bomb Group was federalized and assigned to Strategic Air Command. On 28 March 1951, the Wing was deployed less equipment to March Air Force Base, California. The 106th was re-equipped with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses and given the mission to train reservist crewmen to back-fill rotating B-29 combat crews serving in Korea. While the air guardsmen were undergoing training they were paid on the lesser reserve pay scale. The personnel and equipment at March were re- designated as the 320th Bombardment Wing in December 1952 and the 106th Bomb Wing was returned to New York state control. =Cold War= With its return to New York state control in 1953, the 106th was again equipped with B-26 Invaders, the aircraft being returned from combat duty in Korea. The 102d trained in proficiency with the attack bomber until the removal of the B-26 from bombing duties in 1956 as neared the end of their service lives. The 106th was transferred from Tactical Air Command to Air Defense Command (ADC) and assumed an air defense mission over Long Island and New York City, entering the Jet Age with the limited all-weather F-94B Starfire interceptor. With the Starfire, the 102d began standing end of runway air defense alert, ready to launch interceptors if ADC Ground Intercept Radar picked up an unidentified target. The squadron stood air defense alert from one hour before sunrise until one hour after sunset every day, 365 days a year. In 1957, ADC upgraded the 102d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron to the all-weather F-86D Sabre Interceptor. With the receipt of the F-86D, the alert mission was extended to 24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 days a year. 102d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron ‚Äì Convair F-102A-70-CO Delta Dagger 56-1241. Photographed in September 1974, the 102d FIS was unusual in the fact that its interceptors carried an unusual color tactical camouflage motif. In 1956, Lt. Col. Norma Parsons made military and National Guard history when she became the first woman member of the National Guard, the first woman member of the Air National Guard, and the first woman to be commissioned in the Air National Guard. The State of New York was notified by HQ United States Air Force on 26 September 1957 that support for the 114th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron would be ended due to fiscal constraints. Despite protests from the Governor of New York State that this was in violation of the law with respect to State militia units, the Air Force eventually prevailed and the 114th FIS was inactivated on 30 September 1958. As a result of an agreement between the New York Governor's office and the Air Force, under which the State accepted a new aeromedical transport assignment, thereby preserving the military-reserve careers of most of the 106th personnel and, at the same time, provided the State with a valuable airlift potential. The new 106th Aeromedical Transport Group was reassigned to Military Air Transport Service (MATS), The 106th worked closely with the 1st Aeromedical Transport Group at Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, a regular Air Force unit. Initially equipped with specialized MC-119J Flying Boxcars configured for transport of wounded and injured, the 102d Aeromedical Transport Squadron airlifted critically injured and sick personnel until 1964. With air transportation recognized as a critical wartime need, the 102d was re-designated the 102d Air Transport Squadron (Heavy) in January 1964 and equipped with C-97 Stratofreighter heavy transports.. With the C-97s, the 102d augmented MATS airlift capability worldwide in support of the Air Force's needs in Europe. It also flew scheduled MATS transport missions to Europe, Africa the Caribbean and South America. With the acquisition of KC-97 Stratotankers from Strategic Air Command, the 104th was transferred back to Tactical Air Command in September 1969 and the 106th became an air refueling group. Its mission was to provide aireal refueling to tactical fighters. With the KC-97 being a variant of the C-97 Stratofreighter the conversion of the unit from transports to refueling aircraft was easily accomplished, the squadron receiving the KC-97Ls with addition of jet engine pods mounted to the outboard wings. It rotated personnel and aircraft to West Germany as part of Operation Creek Party, a continuous rotational mission flying from Rhein Main Air Base, West Germany, providing air refueling to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) tactical aircraft. The success of this operation, which would continue until 1972, demonstrated the ability of the Air National Guard to perform significant day-to-day missions without being mobilized. In 1969, the Air Force closed Suffolk County Air Force Base and the NYANG relocated there. The 102d Air Refueling Squadron returned to Air Defense Command in 1972 and again became an air defense unit. The 102d was re-equipped with the F-102A Delta Dagger, which was being replaced in the active duty interceptor force by the F-106. The Mach-2 \\"Deuce\\", still a very potent interceptor, served with the 106th FIG until June 1975, when Aerospace Defense Command was reducing the USAF interceptor force as the threat of Soviet Bombers attacking the United States was deemed remote. =Rescue mission= 101st Rescue Squadron ‚Äì Hurricane Katrina Rescue, 2005 The 102d converted to an Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron in 1975, flying Sikorsky HH-3E rescue helicopters and HC-130 Hercules tankers for in-flight refueling. The squadron's base on Long Island enables it to act as the only Air Force rescue organization in the northeastern United States. It upgraded its inventory to provide a capability for long range over-water missions using the aerial refueling capabilities of the HC-130s and Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters. After the midair explosion of the Space Shuttle \\"Challenger\\" in 1986, the 106th Rescue Wing was designated to provide support for every shuttle launch thereafter. In October 1991, an HH-60 and a tanker flew to an endangered sailboat about 250 miles south of its base. The Pave Hawk and HC-130 dropped survival gear to the vessel, which was riding out the storm, and began their return to base. Both aircraft encountered severe weather conditions and the helicopter was unable to take on fuel. The HH-60 was forced to ditch in the Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles south of the base in what would later become known as \\"the Perfect Storm\\", and all but one member of the crew were saved by the crew of the United States Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa. Technical Sergeant Arden Smith, a pararescueman (PJ), lost his life fulfilling the squadron's motto That Others May Live. The mission was recounted in both a best-selling book and major motion picture. From 1991 to 2002, the 102d RS deployed personnel and aircraft to support Operation Northern Watch in Turkey and Operation Southern Watch in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. While supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom, the squadron made its first two combat rescues on 2 November 2003 by using a hydraulic rescue tool to extricate two injured soldiers trapped in the burning wreckage of an Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter shot down near Fallujah. 103d Rescue Squadron ‚Äì Pararescue airmen jumping out of HC-130 Hercules. The 102d RS received international recognition when two aircrews and PJs of the squadron successfully completed the \\"longest over-water rescue with a helicopter in aviation history\\" in December 1994, a mission in which a pair of HH-60s flew to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and then 750 miles out over the Atlantic Ocean to search for survivors of the Ukrainian cargo ship Salvador Allende. A search of the area located the last survivor, and PJ TSGT James Dougherty jumped into the ocean to effect the rescue. During the 15-hour mission, the two helicopter crews were refueled in flight 10 times by HC-130s. The rescue was made famous by the book Pararescue: The True Story of an Incredible Rescue at Sea and the Heroes Who Pulled It Off, written by Michael Hirsh The 106th Rescue Wing has assisted the state in battling the 1995 \\"Sunrise Wildfires\\" in the Hamptons, they were first on the scene after the crash of TWA Flight 800, and the recovery of the wreckage from the plane flown by John F. Kennedy, Jr., which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 1999. The squadron located the transponder of the wreckage of the plane underwater. On 11 September 2001, the first ANG personnel on scene at World Trade Center were those of the 106th Rescue Wing. In 2004, Air Force Special Operations Command re-organized Air National Guard rescue wings, establishing separate squadrons for fixed-wing, helicopter and pararescue. The squadron transferred its HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters to the 101st Rescue Squadron; its pararescue personnel to the 103d Rescue Squadron. October 2012 saw 150 Airmen of the 106th Rescue Wing deploy as part of more than 2,300 Soldiers and Airmen to prepare flood defences before Subtropical Storm Sandy made landfall. Between 6 Sep and Sept. 2017 the wing deployed 126 Airmen, three HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters and two HC-130 search and rescue aircraft to the Caribbean in the aftermath hurricanes Maria and Irma. The unit flew cargo missions delivering vital aid to U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and its aircraft took part in the evacuation of American civilians from St. Maarten. HC-130J Combat King II of the 106th Rescue Wing On 15 March 2018 four of the wing's guardsmen were killed when the HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopter they were flying crashed near the city of Al-Qa'im in western Iraq. The personnel were deployed as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the American-led coalition operation to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. During September 2018 the 106th deploy aircraft and personnel to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and Naval Air Station Oceana at Norfolk, Virginia to rescue civilians in The Carolinas after Hurricane Florence had struck. On 17 May 2019 the wing took delivery of the first of four new HC-130J Combat King IIs named \\"Spirit of Long Island\\". They will replace the wing's aging HC-130P/Ns July 2019 saw the wing take part in Exercise Northern Strike 2019 at the Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center and the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, both in northern Michigan.

The archdiocese was erected in the 1st century as a diocese, and was elevated to an archdiocese in the 6th century. Among its famous archbishops are Saint Peter Chrysologus, a Doctor of the Church, and Saint Guido Maria Conforti, who was canonized as a saint in 2011 by Pope Benedict XVI. The early medieval Ravenna papyri form an important record from the church's chancery between the 5th and 10th century. The archdiocese was created in 1947 through the merger of the Archdiocese of Ravenna and the Diocese of Cervia. The archdiocese in 2014 had one priest for every 1,830 Catholics.

Vehicles supplied by the National Health Service had three wheels and were very lightweight, and therefore their suitability on roads amongst other traffic was often considered dubious on safety grounds. The last ones were withdrawn from the road in 2003, 27 years after the end of production, though some are still in existence.

At the time of his death, he was captain general and de facto regent of Hungary, ban (governor) of Slavonia, Croatia and Dalmatia and feudal lord of vast areas in present-day Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Austria, and Slovakia. He was also a claimant to the Bosnian throne.ƒÜirkoviƒá, Sima. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–∞ —Å—Ä–µ–¥—ö–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–µ –±–æ—Å–∞–Ω—Å–∫–µ –¥—Ä–∂–∞–≤–µ. Srpska knji≈æevna zadruga: 1964, pp. 276. This accumulation of power prompted his assassination by the hands of the Hunyadi clan which plunged Hungary into civil unrest that was resolved a year later by the sudden death of king Ladislas the Posthumous and the election of Matthias Corvinus, Ulrich's son- in-law, as king. Ulrich's possessions in the Holy Roman Empire were inherited by the Habsburg Emperor Frederick III, while his possessions in Hungary were reverted to the crown. Life Ulrich IIEnciklopedija Slovenije II, 1988, f. 14 was the son of Count Frederick II of Celje and his wife Elizabeth, a scion of the Croatian House of Frankopan and a grand daughter of Francesco I da Carrara, lord of Padua. Little is known of his youth. In about 1432 he married Kantakuzina Katarina Brankoviƒá, daughter of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, despot of Serbia., and the sister of Mara Brankoviƒá. His influence in the affairs of the Kingdom of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire soon overshadowed that of his father, with whom he was raised to a Prince of the Empire by Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1436. This led to feuds with the Austrian House of Habsburg, wounded in their rights as Styrian overlords of Celje, ending, however, in an alliance with the Habsburg King Albert II of Germany, who made Ulrich his lieutenant in Bohemia for a short while. Upon King Albert's death in 1439, Ulrich took up the cause of his widow Elizabeth of Luxembourg, and presided at the coronation of her infant son Ladislaus the Posthumous with the Holy Crown of Hungary in 1440. A feud with the Hungarian Hunyadi family followed, embittered by John Hunyadi's failed attack on the forces of the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Varna in 1444‚Äîwhile Ulrich remained idle‚Äîand Hunyadi's refusal to recognize Ulrich's claim to Bosnia on the death of King Tvrtko II (1443). In 1446 Hunyadi, now regent of Hungary, harried the Celje territories in Croatia-Slavonia; however his power was broken at the Second Battle of Kosovo in 1448, and Count Ulrich was able to lead a successful crusade, nominally in the Habsburg interest, into Hungary (1450). Ladislaus and Ulrich of Celje, 1870 In 1452, he forced Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg to hand over the boy king Ladislaus to his keeping, practically making him ruler of Hungary. In 1454 his power was increased by his succession to his father's vast wealth; and after the death of John Hunyadi at the Siege of Belgrade in 1456, he was named Captain General of Hungary by Ladislaus, an office previously held by his rival. Ulrich's triumph did not last: On 8 November, he entered the fortress of Belgrade with King Ladislaus; the next day he was killed by agents of John Hunyadi's son L√°szl√≥ in unknown circumstances. With him died the male line of the Counts of Celje.The Chronicles of Celje He was buried in the Minorite Church of St. Mary in Celje. The eulogy was delivered by the famous humanist rhetorician and prelate Johann Roth.Jo≈æe Pogaƒçnik, Starej≈°e slovensko slovstvo (Maribor, 1980), pp. 472-76 Ulrich's estates were claimed by his widow Catherine, his son-in-law Matthias Corvinus of Hungary - the younger brother of L√°szl√≥ Hunyadi - as well as Count John of Gorizia, and Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg, who outlived his rivals. Ulrich's high ambitions were sharply criticized by Aeneas Sylvius (the later Pope Pius II), although his writings were politically minded, as he had served as the personal secretary of Emperor Frederick III at the height of his conflict with Ulrich. On his mother's side, Ulrich was the closest surviving male descendant of Francesco I da Carrara, lord of Padua. However, he is not known to have ever pressed claim on the Carraresi inheritance.  Possessions  At the time of his death, Ulrich held around 12 towns, 30 market towns and 125 castles: around 20 in Carinthia, Carniola, and Slavonia each, and the rest mostly in Styria.Drago Bajt, Marko Vidic, eds.

In a good state of preservation, it was built on the top of a hill and dominates the town. The name comes from the chapel of the castle, dedicated to Sainte Marie- Madeleine. History The keep The construction of the Ch√¢teau de la Madeleine began between 1020 and 1090, under Guy I, lord of Chevreuse. The objective was to protect the village of Chevreuse against pillage. From this period, only the keep remains. At this time, the keep was surrounded by a wooden palisade; this palisade was replaced by stone curtain walls during the 12th century. One century later, probably under the reign of Anseau de Chevreuse, the castle was modified, notably with the construction of the machicolations. The gatehouse was protected by a moat; the water was retained by a dam for domestic use. The castles changed hands in 1356: Ingerger le Grand, lord of Chevreuse and Amboise, was taken prisoner by England during the Hundred Years' War. He was constrained to sell his domain to pay his ransom; the castle was bought by the future Pierre de Chevreuse. The well; the modern park headquarters is under the square towers The existing fortifications were largely improved under the reigns of Charles V and Charles VI; they financed the outworks with royal taxes. The modifications were completed under Louis XI (1461 ‚Äì 1483). Along with the castle, the village was also fortified: a crenelated rampart, high with turrets, was built. The defence was completed by a 15 m large ditch (50 feet). Circa 1661, Jean Racine supervised modifications of the keep; his name was given to the road from the convent of Port-Royal to the center of the village, passing by the Ch√¢teau de la Madeleine. The keep was partially restored during the 19th century. The last modifications were in the 20th century. The heart of the castle now houses the park headquarters for the regional natural park of the valley of Chevreuse (); the modern architecture is mixed with the square towers, and uses old rooms. Present state The tower of the guards The intact parts are: *the complete curtain wall with two square towers in the east, facing the village; *the main door surrounded by two towers; the stone pediment collapsed and was replaced by a wooden lintel; *two round towers; one is semicircular, the other is surmounted by a turret for watching; *the keep, having small openings from the 11th century on one side, and windows from the 15th century on the other front; *a well (15th century) *machicolations, on the top of the ramparts. The castle is open to the public for free. A few rooms are accessible; an exhibition shows the history of the castle.

For the deluded, matter seems to appear. This is due to non-recognition of the five lights. Matter includes the mahƒÅbh≈´ta or classical elements, namely: space, air, water, fire, earth. Knowledge (rigpa) is the absence of delusion regarding the display of the five lights. This level of realization is called rainbow body. Basis (gzhi) In the basis () there were neutral awarenesses (sh shes pa lung ma bstan) that did not recognize themselves. (Dzogchen texts actually do not distinguish whether this neutral awareness is one or multiple.) This non-recognition was the innate ignorance. Due to traces of action and affliction from a previous universe, the basis became stirred and the Five Pure Lights shone out. When a neutral awareness recognized the lights as its own display, then that was Samantabhadra (immediate liberation without the performance of virtue). Other neutral awarenesses did not recognize the lights as their own display, and thus imputed ‚Äúother‚Äù onto the lights. This imputation of ‚Äúself‚Äù and ‚Äúother‚Äù was the imputing ignorance. This ignorance started sentient beings and samsara (even without non-virtue having been committed). Yet everything is illusory, since the basis never displays as anything other than the five lights. For the deluded, matter seems to appear. This is due to non-recognition of the five lights. Matter includes the mahƒÅbh≈´ta or classical elements, namely: space, air, water, fire, earth. The illusion of matter includes even the formless realms and the minds of sentient beings. For example, the beings of the formless realms are made of subtle matter. And the mind of a human is merely matter, specifically vayu (wind, air).

There are other evocations of the rainbow lights as well in the Bardo Thodol literature such as Namkha Chokyi Gyatso (1806-1821?), the 3rd Dzogchen Ponlop's \\"Supplement to the Teaching revealing the Natural Expression of Virtue and Negativity in the Intermediate State of Rebirth\\", entitled Gong of Divine Melody (Caveat lector: 'gaND-I' is a transcription of the Tibetan as per the Extended Wylie Transcription System of Garson & Germano (2001).

It was dug in 1631, making it the oldest tow-canal in Holland. Travel on such canals was historically done by barges (or trekschuit in Dutch) which were towed by animals (and sometimes by man-power) on a path along the canal's edge (towpath). History Until the beginning of the 17th century, the primary waterway between Amsterdam and Haarlem was the IJ, a bay of the Zuiderzee. The land route was over the twisty dike along this bay. In 1631 construction began and the canal was dug in a virtually straight line to guarantee the shortest route. It shortened the waterway from Haarlem to Amsterdam considerably. Until that time, boats needed to travel up the Spaarne river to pass the narrow sluice gate at Spaarndam, to reach the IJ. Similarly, the towpath shortened the route considerably for land traffic. Prior to this route, coaches traveling by land would leave Haarlem over the Oude Weg up to the Liede, where they would cross at Penningsveer (a ferry for a penny), to Spaarnwoude and along the IJdijk (on older maps, Spaarndammerdijk) to Amsterdam.Beknopte geschiedenis van Haarlem,by Gerdina Hendrika Kurtz, 1946, p.31 The first trekschuit 'sailed' in 1632 between Amsterdam and Haarlem, and could carry 30 passengers. Because of the sluice gate between the Haarlem Lake and the IJ, the canal was not continuous. The passengers needed to disembark and change boats at this point, which was halfway, and where the town of Halfweg (meaning \\"halfway\\") formed. Commercial freight was not allowed to use the canal, and a complicated tax system on water transport kept the trekschuit system a stable means of passenger transport for centuries. The success of the Haarlemmertrekvaart led to the extension of the canal from Haarlem to Leiden by means of the Leidsevaart in 1657. When the Haarlem Lake became a polder in 1852, the former sluice gate became a steam-driven drainage pump, which is now a museum. A railway parallel to the canal was built in 1839 which rendered passenger transport on the Haarlemmertrekvaart obsolete. While there is no longer any shipping on the canal, it is still being used for water management.

She is known as the first African-American woman cartoonist and creator of the Torchy Brown comic strip and the Patty-Jo 'n' Ginger panel.  Early life and career  Jackie Ormes was born Zelda Mavin Jackson on August 1, 1911, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to parents William Winfield Jackson and Mary Brown Jackson. Her father William, the owner of a printing company and movie theater proprietor, was killed in an automobile accident in 1917. This resulted in the then six-year old Jackie and her older sister Dolores being placed in the care of their aunt and uncle for a brief period of time. Eventually, Jackie's mother remarried and the family relocated to the nearby city of Monongahela. Ormes described the suburb in a 1985 interview for the Chicago Reader as \\"spread out and simple. Nothing momentous ever happens here.\\" She graduated from high school in Monongahela in 1930. Ormes drew and wrote throughout high school. She was arts editor for the 1929‚Äì1930 Monongahela High School Yearbook where her earliest efforts as a cartoonist can be seen in the lively caricatures of her school's students and teachers. It was during this period that she wrote a letter to the editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, a weekly African-American newspaper that was published on Saturdays. The then-editor, Robert Vann, wrote back. This correspondence led to her first writing assignment‚Äîcovering a boxing match. Her coverage of subsequent matches led to her becoming an avid fan of the sport. Ormes started in journalism as a proofreader for the Pittsburgh Courier. She also worked as an editor and as a freelance writer, writing on police beats, court cases and human-interest topics. While she enjoyed \\"a great career running around town, looking into everything the law would allow, and writing about it,\\" what she really wanted to do was draw.  Cartooning  Ormes's first comic strip, Torchy Brown in Dixie to Harlem, first appeared in the Pittsburgh Courier on May 1, 1937. Her work was not syndicated in the usual sense, but, since the Courier had fourteen city editions, she was indeed read from coast to coast.Goldstein, Nancy. Ibid. p. 39 The strip, starring Torchy Brown, was a humorous depiction of a Mississippi teen who found fame and fortune singing and dancing in the Cotton Club. Torchy's journey from Mississippi to New York City mirrored the journey of many African-Americans who ventured northward during the Great Migration. It was through Torchy Brown that Ormes became the first African- American woman to produce a nationally appearing comic strip. The strip ran until April 30, 1938. The reason for the strip's abrupt end is uncertain, but it is presumed to have been due to an end of her contract. Ormes moved to Chicago in 1942. She soon began writing occasional articles and, briefly, a social column for The Chicago Defender, one of the nation's leading black newspapers, a weekly at that time. For a few months at the end of the war, her single panel cartoon, Candy, about an attractive and wisecracking housemaid, appeared in the Defender; the panel ran from March 24 to July 21, 1945. By August 1945, Ormes's work was back in the Courier, with the advent of Patty-Jo 'n' Ginger, a single-panel cartoon which ran for 11 years. It featured a big sister-little sister set-up, with the precocious, insightful and socially/politically-aware child as the only speaker and the beautiful adult woman as a sometime pin-up figure and fashion mannequin. The strip ran from September 1, 1945 to September 22, 1956. Starting August 19, 1950, the Courier began an eight-page color comics insert, where Ormes re-invented her Torchy character in a new comic strip, Torchy in Heartbeats. This Torchy was a beautiful, independent woman who finds adventure while seeking true love.Goldstein, Nancy. \\"The Trouble With Romance in Jackie Ormes's Comics\\", Black Comics: Politics of Race and Representation, Sheena Howard and Ronald L. Jackson II, eds., Bloomsbury, 2013, pp. 2‚Äì21. Ormes expressed her talent for fashion design as well as her vision of a beautiful black female body in the accompanying paper doll topper, Torchy Togs.Goldstein,Nancy. \\"Fashion in the Funny Papers: Cartoonist Jackie Ormes's American Look\\", The Blacker the Ink: Constructions of Black Identity in Comics and Sequential Art, Frances Gateward and John Jennings, eds., Rutgers University Press, 2015, pp. 95‚Äì116. The strip is probably best known for its last installment on September 18, 1954, when Torchy and her doctor boyfriend confront racism and environmental pollution. Ormes used Torchy in Heartbeats as a sounding board for several big issues of the time. In a 1985 interview for Chicago Reader she claimed she was \\"anti- war-I was anti-everything-that's-smelly\\". Torchy presented an image of a black woman who, in contrast to the contemporary stereotypical media portrayals, was confident, intelligent, and brave.  Patty-Jo dolls  Ormes contracted with the Terri Lee doll company in 1947 to produce a play doll based on her little girl cartoon character. The Patty-Jo doll was on the shelves in time for Christmas and was the first American black doll to have an extensive upscale wardrobe. As in the cartoon, the doll represented a real child, in contrast to the majority of dolls that were mammy and Topsy-type dolls. The dolls were popular with both black and white children. In December 1949, Ormes's contract with the Terri Lee company was not renewed, and production ended. Patty-Jo dolls are now highly sought collectors' items.  Content and influence  Her heroines, including the iconic Torchy in Heartbeats, are strong and independent women who are socially and politically aware, who strive for their goals against all odds, defy social norms, and pick themselves up by the bootstraps and move on to the next adventure. In an interview towards the end of her life Ormes said, \\"I have never liked dreamy little women who can't hold their own.\\"Williams, Jasmin K. \\"Meet Jackie Ormes and Torchy Brown\\". New York Amsterdam News: 19.July 2012. ProQuest. Web. October 30, 2017.

New York Amsterdam News: 23 April 2008. ProQuest. Web. October 30, 2017. Jackie Orme‚Äôs heroines faced challenges that were not dragons or evil stepmothers, but instead relatable and contemporary issues, such as smothering aunts or the dangers of being taken advantage of in an unfamiliar environment. While this artist generated a fanciful career path for Torchy Brown, the young performer‚Äôs tale is woven with seeds of reality. Torchy faced deception, unsympathetic peers, racism, danger, and heartbreak‚Äîbut, no matter the odds, she came through. Ormes created women that her readership could believe in, root for, and aspire to be.Calloway, Earl. \\"First Black Woman Cartoonist Created Characters that Fascinated Her Readers\\". Chicago Defender: 31 April 2008. ProQuest. Web. October 30, 2017. Ormes tackled social and political issues everywhere from race to sex to environmental pollution. In each aspect of her life the cartoonist was involved in humanitarian causes, and her passion for left-wing ideologies post-World War II even led to an investigation by the FBI.  Retirement  Jackie Ormes married accountant Earl Ormes in 1931.Goldstein, Nancy. Jackie Ormes: The First African American Woman Cartoonist, University of Michigan Press, 2008, p. 15. The couple initially moved to Salem, Ohio so Earl could be close to his family. But Ormes was not happy there, and they eventually moved to Chicago. The pair had one child, Jaqueline, who died of a brain tumor at the age of three. Ormes remained married to Earl until his death in 1976. She retired from cartooning in 1956, although she continued to create art, including murals, still lifes and portraits until rheumatoid arthritis made this impossible. She contributed to her South Side Chicago community by volunteering to produce fundraiser fashion shows and entertainments. She was also on the founding board of directors for the DuSable Museum of African American History. Ormes was a passionate doll collector, with 150 antique and modern dolls in her collection, and she was active in Guys and Gals Funtastique Doll Club, a United Federation of Doll Clubs chapter in Chicago. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Chicago on December 26, 1985. Ormes was posthumously inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame in 2014, and was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Industry Eisner Award Hall of Fame as a Judges' Choice in 2018.  Legacy  A Google Doodle on September 1, 2020, paid homage to her work.

Nicknamed 'Jacko', he was an Australia national and Queensland State of Origin representative or . Jackson played club football in the Brisbane Rugby League for the Souths Magpies, before moving to the New South Wales Rugby League and playing for the Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos and North Sydney Bears. He also played in the Rugby Football League for English club Leeds. Jackson worked in the media following his retirement in 1993, and died as the result of a drug overdose in 1997. Playing career=1980s In 1980, Jackson played rugby union in the under-17s Australian schoolboys representative team, before playing in the under-18s Australian schoolboys rugby league team the following year. He went on to play in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for Souths Brisbane, and proved himself as a valuable attacking player at and under the coaching of mentor Wayne Bennett. At Souths, Jackson was also a teammate of heavyweight centre partner Mal Meninga, and fullback Gary Belcher. In 1986, Jackson made his State of Origin d√©but for the Queensland team coached by Bennett, and the following year he followed Bennett to play for the Canberra Raiders in the NSWRL premiership, where he re-linked with Meninga and Belcher, who had moved there at the end of 1985. Jackson later signed for the English rugby league club Leeds, and played there for the 1987‚Äì88 English season, along with fellow Australian imports Peter Tunks, Steve Morris and Marty Gurr. Jackson played left-, and scored a try in Leeds' 14‚Äì15 defeat by St. Helens in the 1987‚Äì88 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1987‚Äì88 season at Central Park, Wigan on 9 January 1988. Jackson also played in the centres at Canberra, appearing in the Raiders' 1987 Grand Final loss to Manly-Warringah in the last Grand Final to be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The 1988 season saw Jackson achieve international selection for the first time in Australia's successful home defence of The Ashes against the touring Great Britain team. In the Centenary Test in 1988, the first match of the three-Test series at the Sydney Football Stadium, Jackson scored two tries, contributing to Australia's 17‚Äì6 win. He went on to play in all three Tests of this series against the Lions, as well as the one-off Test against Papua New Guinea. At the end of this season, Jackson departed Canberra to sign with the Brisbane Broncos for the next two years, once again under the coaching of Bennett. 1990s Jackson joined the North Sydney Bears in 1991 and his arrival, along with the addition of veteran forward Mario Fenech, and goal-kicking winger Daryl Halligan, saw the club's fortunes turn around as they went from being easybeats (not having won a premiership since 1922) to being title contenders. Playing at five-eighth, Jackson was the focal point of the team's attack during their successful 1991 season where they finished just one game shy of qualifying for the club's first Grand Final appearance since 1943, losing the preliminary final 30‚Äì14 to defending premiers Canberra. After being overlooked for a Test return in the first match of the 1991 Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand in favour of former Test captain Wally Lewis, Jackson's form for the North Sydney Bears earned him a recall for the second Test in Sydney after Australia's shock 24‚Äì8 loss to the Kiwis in Melbourne. His international return quickly turned sour, though, as he was sent off midway through the first half of the game, which Australia's new-look team won 44‚Äì0. Despite his send-off, Jackson retained his place for the deciding Test at Lang Park in Brisbane, where Australia won again, 40‚Äì12. At the end of the 1991 season, Jackson toured Papua New Guinea on Australia's short, two-Test tour against the Kumuls in October. The 1992 season saw his form continue for both the North Sydney Bears and for Queensland in the Origin series, and he was selected for the first two Ashes Tests against Great Britain on their 1992 Australasian tour, however Jackson's Test career came to an end when Australia suffered a 33‚Äì10 loss to Great Britain in the second Test in Melbourne. Also in 1992, Jackson released a book of \\"rugby league facts, funnies and argument starters\\" called Whatd'ya Reckon!. Jackson missed most of the 1993 season through illness and injury, and retired after North Sydney's Reserve Grade Grand Final win over the Newcastle Knights to concentrate on his career in the media. Death It would later be revealed that, as a fifteen-year-old, Jackson had been sexually abused by his football coach, Hugh (Ossie) McNamara, a former Catholic Marist Brother who was later convicted for indecently dealing with a boy at Marist Brothers Ashgrove. McNamara had molested boys at St Joseph's Hunters Hill in Sydney while he was a Brother at the school during the 1970s. It has been alleged that McNamara was let go by St Josephs but was never actually charged. He then started working at The Southport School where he sexually abused a number of the 1980 1st XV Rugby team including Jackson. The trauma caused by this abuse led Jackson to suffer from depression and to use drugs and alcohol throughout his life to try to combat it. In November 1997 Jackson shocked the Australian rugby league community when he died, alone in a Sydney hotel room,The Independent, 16 November 1997 of a heroin overdose. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at both Stanwell Park, where he lived, south of Sydney and at Lang Park in Brisbane. Jackson's death went on to be used as a powerful image in 2000 in a radio and television campaign to raise awareness of an anti-child abuse campaign. Since 2003, the Peter Jackson Memorial Trophy has been awarded to the person, whether a player or member of the support staff, who makes the greatest contribution to the Queensland State of Origin team each year.

According to Peter Kingsley, iatromantis figures belonged to a wider Greek and Asian shamanic tradition with origins in Central Asia. A main ecstatic, meditative practice of these healer-prophets was incubation (·ºêŒ≥Œ∫ŒøŒØŒºŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ, enkoimesis). More than just a medical technique, incubation reportedly allowed a human being to experience a fourth state of consciousness different from sleeping, dreaming, or ordinary waking: a state that Kingsley describes as ‚Äúconsciousness itself‚Äù and likens to the turiya or samƒÅdhi of the Indian yogic traditions.

Overview Hirsch used the term to broaden and expand on what William James discussed in his landmark 1907 work in epistemology, Pragmatism. James gave a now famous example of dispute over a squirrel: > The corpus of the dispute was a squirrel--a live squirrel supposed to be > clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the tree's opposite > side a human being was imagined to stand. This human witness tries to get > sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how > fast he goes, the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction, and > always keeps the tree between himself and the man, so that never a glimpse > of him is caught. The resultant metaphysical problem now is this: DOES THE > MAN GO ROUND THE SQUIRREL OR NOT? James' solution was that by clarifying \\"pragmatically\\" whether \\"around\\" meant traversing north/east/south/west of something versus traversing left/right/before/behind something, the dispute was readily solvable. Hirsch actually calls James' example a \\"verbal\\" dispute and explains, at some length, the connection between verbal and soft ontological disagreements (they are, according to Hirsch, partly but not completely overlapping sets of problems). Soft ontological dilemmas are contrasted with hard ones‚Äîthose which would not admit of translation, reconciliation, or overlap, and would instead require a systematic or paradigmatic shift of one's ontology. One can choose to construct a hard or soft ontology, depending on the flexibility one intends to obtain. Other related terms in philosophy and in cognitive science include \\"ontological relativity\\" (as in Quine) and \\"cognitive relativism\\" (as in Jack Meiland). Computer science (unrelated terminology) Soft ontology, as proposed in computer science circles by Aviles et al. (2003), is a definition of a domain in terms of a flexible set of ontological dimensions. It can be regarded as a subclass of ontologies as they are conceived of in computer science, in Gruber's terms (1993) as definitions of conceptualization. Unlike standard ontologies, the approach allows the number of its constitutive concepts to increase or decrease dynamically, any subsets of the ontology to be taken into account at a time, or the order their mutual weight or priority to vary in a graded manner so as to allow different ontological perspectives. Where conventional ontologies describe or interpret the conceptualization of a domain from a prioritized perspective, the soft ontology approach transfers the task of interpretation to the observer, user or learner, depending on the context. (see Weak ontology) Application areas in the information sciences The approach is particularly applicable for expert practices that intend to present raw content or data without presenting any authoritative taxonomy or categorization. It also serves to support neutrality for domains such as ethics, politics, aesthetics or philosophy, in which there may not exist a single authorized conceptualization or truth, or it may be instrumental to present a range of perspectives to the domain. Soft ontologies also result inherently from user-defined ontology practices, such as folksonomies or tagging practices (\\"tagsonomies\\"), characteristic of many contemporary user- driven media genres.

The Leidsevaart (also known as Leidse trekvaart, Dutch for \\"Leiden's Pull-Canal\\") is a canal between the cities of Haarlem and Leiden in the Netherlands. It was dug in 1657, making it one of the oldest canals in the Netherlands. It was the major means of transport between Leiden and Haarlem for almost two centuries until the rail connection was established in the 19th century. The original stops along the railway mirrored the toll bridges of the canal. The canal runs through or borders the municipalities of Haarlem, Heemstede, Bloemendaal, Hillegom, Noordwijkerhout, Lisse, Teylingen, Oegstgeest, and Leiden.

Bestekken van aanbesteding voor het graven der vaart en het aanleggen van den weg. The Leidsevaart was the extension of the Haarlemmertrekvaart (Haarlem's Pull-Canal) connecting Amsterdam to Haarlem. Travel on these canals was done by trekschuit for people, and by barge for goods, which were pulled by animals (and sometimes by man-power) on a towpath along the canal's edge. It was reliable, comfortable and cheap. The speed was about 7 kilometers per hour, which was faster than walking, and more comfortable than by coach. Many wealthy Amsterdam families had summer homes along the Leidsevaart or Spaarne River, and they arrived with their heavy belongings by barge, often being pulled or sailed all the way to their door, as most summer estates had canals dug for this purpose. Even today the old canals are visible though probably too shallow for a trekschuit. The canal was kept up with toll money and taxes. Many estate owners spent money on making canal spurs to their doorstep and then had to pay taxes for fishing rights, \\"swan\\" keeping rights, or general canal use. The same was true for landowners whose lands were seized for digging the canal. They were compensated for the loss of the land strip taken up by the canal, but they had to pay for a bridge themselves. Trekschuit owners also had to pay taxes for using the canal. Taxes for traffic in people (by trekschuit) was heavier than taxes for traffic in goods (by barge).Full text of \\"Inventaris van het archief der stad Haarlem\\" 640. II Oct. 1657.

After the railway line from Leiden to Haarlem (Oude Lijn) was built, many of these extra costs made trekschuit travel unattractive and the canal quickly fell in popularity from 1842 onwards.

Most property is alienable, but some may be subject to restraints on alienation. In England under the feudal system, land was generally transferred by subinfeudation and alienation required licence from the overlord. Some objects are incapable of being regarded as property and are inalienable, such as people and body parts. Aboriginal title is one example of inalienability (save to the Crown) in common law jurisdictions. A similar concept is non-transferability, such as tickets. Rights commonly described as a licence or permit are generally only personal and are not assignable. However, they are alienable in the sense that they can generally be surrendered. English common law traditionally protected freehold landowners from unsecured creditors. In 1732, the Parliament of Great Britain passed legislation entitled ‚ÄúThe Act for the More Easy Recovery of Debts in His Majesty‚Äôs Plantations and Colonies in America‚Äù, which required all real property in British America to be treated as chattel for debt collection purposes.

There have been two incarnations of the character. The Caretaker appeared in the 2007 film Ghost Rider, in which he was portrayed by actor Sam Elliott. The Caretaker appears in the Hulu television series Helstrom played by Robert Wisdom. Publication history The first Caretaker debuted in Ghost Rider vol. 3 #28 and was created by Howard Mackie and Andy Kubert. The second Caretaker debuted in Ghost Rider vol. 6 #26 and was created by Jason Aaron and Tan Eng Huat. Fictional character biography=Caretaker (Original) Caretaker is a member of The Blood, a mystical organization dedicated to fighting evil. Caregiver himself is the guardian of the family line associated with the ancient Medallion of Power. He watches over the Salem Fields Cemetery in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, New York. The cemetery has been the site of much magical evil, partly due to an ancient race of evil beings trapped beneath it. Caretaker has his own system of secret tunnels leading throughout the place, many that go in visual range of the bodies. Well before becoming involved in the lives of both Ghost Riders, Caregiver meets and befriends Doctor Strange.Ghost Rider vol. 3 #28 Ghost Rider, very weak from an attack on his human host, Daniel Ketch, was being pursued by Lt. Badalino through the cemetery. Caretaker knocked out the police officer with his shovel. With the assistance of Johnny Blaze, Ghost Rider is able to escape capture. At a later time, Caretaker informs Daniel that he need not wait until innocent blood had been spilled before transforming into Ghost Rider. Caretaker later works with Seer,\\"Ghost Rider\\" #40 (September 1993) a younger, 'rookie' member of his race, who sometimes fails to listen to orders. Seer is capable of boosting Caregivers powers.\\"Spirits Of Vengeance\\" #16 (November 1993) In one incident, when Lilith returns from a seeming death, the result is a mist seeping from the cemetery. Where it touches, death literally follows. A group of Midnight Sons associates gather, including Hannibal King, Victoria Montesi and the two Ghost Riders. They enter the cemetery in an attempt to save lives but are quickly overwhelmed. They rescue the reporter Linda Wei but all seems lost. Caretaker appears and saves their lives by leading them through one of his secret passages but even then they are almost overwhelmed. Later, well outside the cemetery, he declares he will take those involved with the 'Medallion of Power', Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze and Vengeance, well away from the city. If the forces of Lilith get the Medallion as a whole, they would be unstoppable. The heroes resist leaving, even to the point of Blaze drawing his gun on Caretaker. This is enough to convince him, though he still believes the group is being foolish. The Lilin would be the least of Caretaker's problems as a new threat would arise in the form of a traitorous angel seeking to overthrow God and claim Heaven for himself - Zadkiel. To accomplish his goal, Zadkiel had to enlist earthly subordinates to eliminate any who would threaten his mission. In a bitter act of betrayal, Zadkiel coerced Daniel Ketch to confront and destroy his former Caretaker. Ketch didn't face his mentor alone, however. He had help in the form of some of his old enemies: Blackout, Doghead and Death Ninja plus the Orb had returned from obscurity. Caretaker wasn't about to go down without a fight, but the numbers were against him. Eventually, he did go down, Blackout striking the fatal blow, but before he left this world, he met his granddaughter, Sara, and told her she was to replace him. For his loyal service on Earth, Caretaker's soul went to Heaven, but a Heaven ruled by Zadkiel meant his soul was torn to pieces and scattered to the winds on arrival.Ghost Rider vol. 6 #26 However, Zadkiel is ultimately banished to Hell, and his actions against Paradise were presumably undone by God, thus possibly indicating that Caretaker's soul was ultimately restored.Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire #6 Sister Sara Believing God sent her a disturbing vision of a grandfather she never knew, Sister Sara left her convent in Kansas to journey through unfamiliar territory to get to Tennessee to offer her help. Sara, alone and na√Øve, asked a trucker for a ride, but once they arrived Sister Sara had no money to pay the driver for the trip. The trucker wanted to negotiate some form of payment, but he soon found out one of the Lord's flock was not a meek little lamb. Sara knocked the trucker's head through his window and ran from the truck. As fate would have it, Johnny Blaze was on his way to Tennessee too. First he was unwilling to help, but an angry and injured truck driver convinced Johnny to give Sister Sara a lift. The two of them wound up at the seemingly insignificant shack of Sara‚Äôs grandfather, Caretaker. Caretaker was badly wounded and dying because of an assault on his home led by Daniel Ketch ‚Äì a former Ghost Rider now servant of the rogue angel, Zadkiel. Caretaker managed to defeat three of Ketch's allies, Doghead, The Orb, and Death Ninja, before the vampire known as Blackout struck the fatal blow. Ketch began to destroy the contents of Caretaker's home as Blackout confronted Blaze. Caretaker, in the meantime, told Sara she was about to enter a life that he never meant for her to have. She desperately wanted to get him to a hospital, but Caretaker knew his time on Earth was done, so he urged her to get to the tunnels under his house and save what she could before Danny destroyed it all. Distraught over losing the family she never knew she had, Sara did as she was told and found a library of books within the tunnels. One touch was all it took, and the knowledge contained within the books flooded Sara's mind. She became the new Caretaker, librarian and guardian to everything dealing with the Spirits of Vengeance. Blaze found his half- brother, Ketch, who fled to Tibet, and Sara insisted on tagging along now that she was ready to embrace her new role in life. Blaze agreed because Sara had the answers he was looking for, and the two chased Daniel down. In Tibet, Blaze and Sara arrived too late to save a Ghost Rider named Nima from being killed at the hands of Ketch, but Blaze had the chance to confront his family only to wind up on the losing end of the battle. Blaze sank into a depression despite Sara's best efforts to snap him out of it, and even the arrival of two more Ghost Riders, Molek and Bai Gu Jing, didn't help at all. The group eventually journeyed to Japan to seek another of their kind, but all they found was a frightened man stripped of his powers by Daniel Ketch. Yoshio Kannabe, now a former Spirit of Vengeance, would be no use to them. However, Molek knew of a place in the Congo where two more Ghost Riders were waiting. Baron Skullfire and his lover, Marinette Bwa Chech, were ready to join Sara and her allies in the war against Zadkiel. Sara and Molek had a heart-to-heart talk before the final battle, and he told her she was an amazing woman to take everything in stride even though her burden was thrust upon her so suddenly. Sara and Molek seemed to have a connection, and she stood at his side when Ketch and the Black Host arrived, but when the dust settled, Sara was one of the only survivors of the conflict. Ketch had successfully drained the other Ghost Riders of their powers, and Zadkiel had won his war with Heaven. Afterwards, Blaze and Ketch went their separate ways, leaving Sara alone. She journeyed back home to her convent in Kansas, but she walked into a horrific scene. It appeared as if all the nuns inside were brutally slaughtered by an unknown assailant. Mother Superior, head of the convent, was left barely breathing and she explained what had happened in Sara's absence. After Sara buried the bodies, she decided to avenge her fallen sisters and seek out their murderer ‚Äì The Deacon. However, she was visited by Spirits of Vengeance from the future who gave her hope by informing her the war with Zadkiel wasn't truly over. Sara sought out Johnny Blaze, and found him in battle with a demon called the Skin-Bender. At first, she didn't recognize him, claiming the Ghost Rider was free of Blaze's presence, but that was not the case. Blaze wanted no part in a rematch with Zadkiel until Sara reminded him the souls of his children reside in Heaven. Fearing what Zadkiel might do to them, Blaze rode away with Sara, ready to dish out vengeance. They traveled all over the country to find a way to get to Zadkiel, but it wasn't until a pair of his minions told them about the Antichrist, Kid Blackheart, that Sara and Blaze knew what to look for. They tracked the Antichrist down to New York, but he was already in the company of Hellstorm and Jaine Cutter who had rescued him from certain death. Ketch also showed up with a story how he sold his soul for the keys to Heaven. The only catch was the group had to keep the Antichrist safe. Blaze and Ketch split off from the rest of the group, leaving Sara with the others, but an attack from Madcap and Scarecrow isolated Sara with the Son of Satan. The Antichrist quickly turned on Sara, and with aid from Master Pandemonium, knocked her unconscious. Bound and helpless, Sara was at the mercy of her captors, but what came next was even a surprise to her. The Antichrist showed her what she truly was ‚Äì a gateway to Heaven. Her power was revealed, and as he laughed that Blaze and Ketch had the key under their noses the whole time without knowing it, the Antichrist led an army of demons into Heaven through Sara. The power within her grew to such an extent, Sara teleported to the site of another gateway guarded by the Gun Nuns. She was too late to help them as the Deacon slaughtered most of them as he did her sisters, but she was on time to avenge their deaths. Sara fought Deacon and left him paralyzed from the neck down. Despite his expecting her to slay him as he would have done her, Sara refused, instead choosing to pray to God, as she told him her late sisters had taught her to do. Sara reunited with Blaze and Ketch after they defeated Zadkiel and God condemned the renegade angel to Hell for all eternity, and the three of them rode off in search of new adventures. Powers and abilities Caretaker is part of the ancient race called 'the Blood'. He is seemingly immune or resistant to aging and conventional disease. He possesses a degree of superhuman strength and is a skillful fighter, mainly using his shovel. When needed, he has shown he can overpower Ghost Rider and Vengeance (a similarly powered being) at once. He can break the connection users have with the Medallion of Power: he can turn Ghost Rider back to Daniel Ketch at will. Caretaker also rides an \\"ancient motorcycle\\", which possibly refers to its being an older 1960s-era model. In other media Robert Wisdom portrays the Caretaker in Helstrom on Hulu. This version is an African-American and his real name is Henry. This version has a more pleasant personality and is especially friendly towards Louise Hastings (June Carryl), the head of Saint Teresa Center for Mental Health, where it is heavily implied that the two were close, and presumably, romantically involved at one point. Sam Elliott portrayed the Caretaker in the 2007 film based on Ghost Rider. This version of the character, however, was not a member of the Blood, of which there is no mention in the movie, but in fact was Johnny Blaze's predecessor to the Ghost Rider title, having been subjected to the same curse 150 years before. In the film, the Caretaker turns out to be Carter Slade, a former Texas Ranger who sold his soul to Mephistopheles in consequence for being greedy. His final act during his time was to maintain safety over the Contract of San Venganza, where he collected a contract that worth 1,000 souls. Knowing that these evil souls would cause hell on earth, he outran his master. After mentoring Blaze, and telling him of the son of the Devil Blackheart, he transforms into his Rider state and rides with him to San Venganza. He passes Blaze the Contract, his shotgun and thanks him before vanishing Sam Elliott's depiction of this character is more along the lines of the Caretaker, in terms of emotion, or lack thereof. At one point, he even transforms into a Ghost Rider-style version of Carter Slade, complete with a flaming skull, nearly-charred clothes, and a mystical horse on fire as the Phantom Rider. Caretaker appears in the Ghost Rider video game voiced by Fred Tatasciore.

The Battle of New Britain is a documentary/propaganda film produced by the US military in 1944. It details, as its name implies, the New Britain campaign, which was part of the New Guinea and Solomon Islands Campaigns during World War II. The film follows a rather standard format: it is a chronological narrative of the campaign from the arrival of the soldiers in New Guinea to their capture of most of the island. Opening with travelers book pictures of the area, reminding the audience what the average soldier image of what the South Seas would be like, and it then details the natural hazards of fighting, or even being in the jungle, including the insects, diseases and heat. The marines and soldiers set up a little tent city, with the significant help of the local natives or \\"fuzzy wuzzies\\". After the base has been established and enough men are ready, General Douglas MacArthur arrives in person to discuss the upcoming campaign with the unit's CO. With the aid of maps and non-combat footage, the audience learns about the plans for the attack, the geography of the island, and the variety of armored vehicles that will be used in the upcoming battle, including the \\"alligator\\" and \\"buffalo\\" amphibious assault vehicles. D-day is on Christmas, and while the sailors and marines assemble in the rear, the airmen spend Christmas Eve strafing the island, to make way for their comrades' assault. The campaign is then followed through chronologically, focusing, at the end, on the many wounded and killed who have sacrificed so much.

Creationism  Creationism is the religious belief that the universe and life originated \\"from specific acts of divine creation\\",Gunn 2004, p. 9, \\"The Concise Oxford Dictionary says that creationism is 'the belief that the universe and living organisms originated from specific acts of divine creation.'\\" as opposed to the scientific conclusion that they came about through natural processes such as evolution. Churches address the theological implications raised by creationism and evolution in different ways. Evolution Most contemporary Christian leaders and scholars from many mainstream churches, such as Roman Catholic, Anglican and some Lutheran denominations, reject reading the Bible as though it could shed light on the physics of creation instead of the spiritual meaning of creation. According to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, \\"[for] most of the history of Christianity there's been an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time.\\" The Roman Catholic Church now explicitly accepts the theory of evolution,see e.g. John Paul II address here (albeit with most conservatives and traditionalists within the Church in dissent), as do Anglican scholars such as John Polkinghorne, arguing that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier examples of this attitude include Frederick Temple, Asa Gray and Charles Kingsley, who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories on publication,see e.g. John Polkinghorne's Science and Theology pp6-7 and the French Jesuit priest and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Liberal theology assumes that Genesis is a poetic work, and that just as human understanding of God increases gradually over time, so does the understanding of his creation. In fact, both Jews and Christians have been considering the idea of the creation narrative as an allegory (instead of an historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. Two notable examples are Saint Augustine (4th century) who, on theological grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, (and not in seven days as a plain account of Genesis would require)Davis A. Young, \\"THE CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF AUGUSTINE'S VIEW OF CREATION\\" (From: Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith 40.1:42-45 (3/1988)), The American Scientific Affiliation and the 1st century Jewish scholar Philo of Alexandria, who wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.The Works of Philo Judaeus, Chapter 2, translated by Charles Duke Yonge See also * Anti-intellectualism * Faith and rationality References Creationism Evolution and religion Intelligent design controversies ","title":"Theology of creationism and evolution"},{"id":"9561635","text":"Mohnhaupt is a German surname.

It resulted in a victory for ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát over the Chinese forces. Background At the end of 979, Vietnamese emperor ƒêinh Ti√™n Ho√†ng and crown prince ƒêinh Li·ªÖn of ƒêinh dynasty were assassinated. In May 980, the Song dynasty ambassador to ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát reported this incident to the Song emperor. In August of 980 Hou Renbao, Governor of Nanning, requested the Song emperor for permission to invade Vietnam. Emperor Taizong accepted this.

Besides that war message also sent to ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát with aim that they wish to restore the rule of ƒêinh dynasty although their ambition was to intervene in Vietnamese politics.  ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát's house ruling change  The ƒêinh dynasty of ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát (present-day north Vietnam) had successfully sought out and developed diplomatic relations with the Song dynasty of China. After the death of emperor and crown prince, the third son of ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh was ƒêinh To√†n took the throne at 6 years old. The emperor was too young to lead the country so L√™ Ho√†n was positioned as regent and commander in chief. The Song dynasty of China was inclined to send their military forces to restore the throne to the ƒêinh dynasty. The threat of a Chinese intervention caused the ƒêinh court officials to worry about the survival of their independence, so the officials urged L√™ Ho√†n to become emperor and establish a stable government. In autumn 980, Governor of L·∫°ng province (now L·∫°ng S∆°n Province) announced the emergency news to ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát royal court about the oncoming Song invasion, the court was put in the crisis, then the mother of emperor, Empress D∆∞∆°ng V√¢n Nga decide to take the fate of nation. In 979 she enthroned L√™ Ho√†n as the emperor in exchange L√™ Ho√†n asked her to be his wife. Although this deal opposed to the tradition, the empress accepted the request and L√™ Ho√†n accepted to lead the country. In 980, L√™ Ho√†n proclaimed as the emperor L√™ ƒê·∫°i H√†nh and ƒêinh dynasty was replaced by Early L√™ dynasty. Immediately, he made the nation ready to face the invaders, deploying army, boat and archers and send the envoy to show the peace letter to Song dynasty and said that he will be the next ruler of nation. Song dynasty did not accept it and they just regarded only ƒêinh dynasty was the legitimate government of ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát, thus Song refused to accept the letter.

During his time in the United States Army, he worked on gas mask innovations. These masks were used by soldiers as well as the public during World War I for protection against chemical weapons. His innovative improvements were used through the twentieth century. In his civilian life, Pipkin invented a process for frosting the inside of incandescent light bulbs to cut down on the sharp glare, and to diffuse the light. This process had the side effect of making a stronger constructed glass envelope that held up well with ordinary handling. He went on to make many other inventions and further improvements to the light bulb. His patents were developed into General Electric's popular Soft-White bulb series that were mass-produced. He also had patents for the photo flash bulb.  Early life and education  The fourth of six children, Pipkin was born November 18, 1889, south of Lakeland, Florida in a suburban community called Christina. His parents were Daniel M. Pipkin and Sarah Catherine (Moore) Pipkin. His father owned a citrus grove and was a farmer. Pipkin attended Lakeland elementary school and graduated from Bartow High School in Bartow, Florida. One of his classmates noted that he knew more about chemistry than all the rest in his class put together. Pipkin's first job was at a prospecting firm, where he worked for a year. Following that, he worked for about a year at International Mineral and Chemical Corporation of Bartow, where he was surrounded by college-educated people. Pipkin decided that he had to attend college in order to expand the ideas he had on certain chemistry theories. He attended Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API), graduating with a degree in Chemical Engineering in 1913. Pipkin then worked for a year in a fertilizer laboratory after which he returned to API where he gained his master's degree in 1915. He then attended Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland where he graduated with a doctorate in chemistry.Marvin Pipkin, 87, Lakeland Inventor, Dies From Cancer, The Ledger, January 8, 1977, pp. 1 & 7 Nela Operating Building factory, c. 1920  Mid life  Pipkin enlisted in the Army in Jacksonville, Florida, on November 5, 1917. Because the Germans were using gas as a chemical weapon during World War I, gas mask research had a high priority. With his chemistry background, Pipkin was posted to the Army's Gas Defense Department at General Electric's Nela Park in Cleveland. He was promoted to the rank of a senior grade master engineer. The principles embodied in the gas mask innovations he created while there remained in use throughout the twentieth century. Pipkin remained at Nela Park as a research scientist after the war. He worked in General Electric's light bulb development department.  Light bulb innovations  Clear transparent incandescent lamps give off a sharp light, which is unpleasant to many people, and also makes it hard to see objects close to the lamp. In 1920, General Electric developed a 30 watt light bulb that had outside etching as a frosting effect. It effectively diffused the light to make it softer; however, it decreased the light produced by 15‚Äì25 percent. Another problem with the lamp was that fluorides used in the etching attacked the tungsten filament, and that external etching of the globe bulb weakened it. The rough outside surface collected dust and dirt and was difficult to clean. The etched bulbs were brittle and would often break with ordinary handling. When Pipkin went to work for General Electric he was assigned the supposedly impossible task of finding a way to frost electric light bulbs on the inside without weakening the glass. He was not aware that this assignment was considered a fool's errand, so he went about the task as if it was something that could be done. Pipkin produced an innovative acid etching process for the inside of the globe of an electric lamp so that it did not deteriorate the lamp glass globe. His was a two step acid process that etched the interior of glass with tiny crevasses on the first process like in the normal procedure, but he added a second acid step that caused soft, rounded dimples from the crevasses which gave the bulbs added strength. There was minimal loss of diffusion of light with his innovation. It left the outside of the globe of the glass lamp smooth so that it did not hold dust like those etched on the outside. The first electric light bulb frosted on the inside with sufficient strength for ordinary handling that could be sold to the public was invented by Pipkin in 1925. This idea of having a second treatment to smooth out the fine-grained texture to dimples came about by accident. Pipkin would often clean out the experimental bulbs with another solution of the acid, but in a weaker solution. If he left the filled bulb for a while with this weaker solution it would clean out the etching previously done and return the glass globe to its transparent state. This made it possible to repeat an etching experiment on the following day. One day, while he was pouring the weaker solution into a bulb, the phone rang. In the process of answering the phone, he accidentally tipped the bulb over before it had enough time to finish cleaning out the previous etching. When he returned to his work, he accidentally knocked the glass bulb off the workbench and onto the floor. To his surprise it did not shatter, as etched bulbs normally did, but bounced a few times and then rolled under the workbench. Pipkin was surprised to find that the bulb glass had somehow become much stronger. As it turned out, a short bath in the weaker cleaning solution, not long enough to remove the etching, caused the etching of the first frosting treatment to form dimples in the etching, that strengthened the glass. Deluxe Soft-White frosted bulb Pipkin did a demonstration of the bulbs' integrity to his supervisor at General Electric. He presented to his supervisor six light bulbs that had been frosted on the inside. Some had just the one application of acid and others with his reinforced second treatment. He placed the bulbs on his supervisor's desk, standing up on their screw bottoms. He tipped the first three over, one at a time, to simulate a bulb being dropped from a small height. These were the bulbs treated with original single acid application, and as expected, all three bulbs shattered. He then tipped over the remaining three bulbs, which were tempered with his new two-step acid treatment. They remained unbroken, much to the surprise of his supervisor. Then, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of his tempering process, Pipkin took bulbs that had not shattered and dropped them again, this time allowing them to fall to the office floor. The bulbs bounced on the floor, and settled without breaking. Pipkin's new frosted bulb revolutionized the industry, allowing the manufacture of frosted bulbs that diffused the light without losing much intensity, and were strong enough to be commercially viable. He went on to make many innovations to the light bulb and two decades later developed the soft white light bulb. Pipkin in 1947 invented an improved version of the process with silica coating that replaced the internal acid etching process. The 1947 internal silica coating was used for 30 years and had the trade name \\"Q coat\\". Pipkin is also credited with perfecting the photo flash bulb with several patents. Besides the frosted light bulb, Pipkin invented or improved many other products during his career with General Electric. One was for a toy light that could be used on a child's toy train or toy car. Pipkin's innovations were noted in articles in Time magazine, Newsweek magazine, and the Saturday Evening Post magazine, as well in scientific journals.

History The Frozen Autumn started life as the solo project of Diego Merletto, founded after several years of involvement with various darkwave groups in Turin. The singer, keyboardist and synth programmer employed the talents of guitarist Claudio Brosio during early studio sessions and live performances, then in 1995 the first album, Pale Awakening, was released under the German Weisser Herbst Produktion label. The album was well received by gothic-wave/dark-romantic fans across Europe, and in 1997 the follow-up was released, Fragments of Memories, this time by Milan-based Eibon Records. In 1998, Merletto co-founded a side-project called Static Movement with Arianna, who provided guest vocals on the title-track from Fragments of Memories. The duo composed together for six months and in March 1999 the album Visionary Landscapes was released. The musical style of Static Movement was not dissimilar to The Frozen Autumn, however with only electronic instruments being used, the result was a more synthetic coldwave sound. The partnership proved fruitful for both parties and so Arianna became a permanent fixture in The Frozen Autumn line-up, Static Movement remaining their \\"concept research project\\". After 18 months working on The Frozen Autumn's third album, Emotional Screening Device was released in April 2002 and hailed as the group's best album to date. They decided to leave Eibon Records in 2003 and, while contemplating offers coming in from both Italian and foreign labels, spent over two years on the next album. Is Anybody There? was finally released in September 2005 by the Argentinean label Twilight Records and German label Pandaimonium through Xymox Control. Merletto has since been working on his video art which has in recent years become an integral part of the band's live shows, while in addition to playing concerts all over Europe and collaborating with various artists, the duo have (as of October 2006) begun the process of reprinting The Frozen Autumn's back catalogue. In 2009, Pale Awakening, Fragments of Memories and Visionary Landscapes were re-printed through Twilight Records. At the same, The Frozen Autumn announced that Ashes is no longer their official fan club. In September 2009, a new official forum was created. In December 2009, The Frozen Autumn published on their Facebook a \\"manifesto against music killers\\", stating their position on music sharing over the Internet. In the same article they pointed out that they were exploited by someone who they thought as a good friend. At the end of 2010, a new 10\\" single, \\"Rallentears\\" was released. The song is on their new label, Calembour Records, as a forerunner of their next album, called Chirality, which was released in November 2011. Many fans of the band ask one another, which is the music genre that best describes The Frozen Autumn, as the band works in various styles such as darkwave, cold wave, gothic and new wave. The duo call their style \\"frozen wave\\". The Frozen Autumn were to embark on their first visit to America, occurring on the West Coast in Autumn of 2013. A new EP titled Lie in Wait was released in December 2014 by Calembour Records and this was followed in 2015 by a \\"best of\\" compilation vinyl Time Is Just A Memory by Dark Entries Records.

In the effect of a pincer maneuver some 160 kilometres behind the front line, the Polish Army was able to seize the strategically important town of Korosten. The town, a major railway hub and a Red Army supply depot, was captured with negligible Polish losses. The battle, along with a similar Raid on Korosten, resulted in a complete disruption of the Soviet 12th and 14th Armies of the South-Western Front. The Soviets lost approximately two divisions and a large amount of materiel, and roughly 8000 Soviet soldiers became prisoners of war. This allowed the Polish forces to capture Kiev soon afterwards. The maneuver is taught in military colleges around the world as an example of a blitzkrieg- like offensive executed before the advent of tank warfare. Before the battle In the early months of 1920 the Polish headquarters realized that it had insufficient forces to wage a full-scale war against the Soviets on all fronts of the Polish-Soviet War. To counter the threat of a large scale offensive by the Red Army, the Polish HQ prepared a preemptive strike in the south towards Kiev. This was to create a large operational space in the southern section of the front and allow the Poles to move parts of their forces northwards, to Belarus, while leaving the southern flank secured by Petlura's forces nominally of the defunct Ukrainian People's Republic, allied to Poland at that time. In order to neutralize superior Soviet numbers, the Poles decided to create a large, all-cavalry unit that was to strike a wedge between the Soviet 12th Army and the Soviet 14th Army, thus disrupting their defenses and encircling a large number of enemy troops between the front line and a large pocket of resistance created far behind it. The unit, called the Cavalry Division, comprised units withdrawn from other fronts. Commanded by Gen. Jan Romer, it started to be formed in early April, some two weeks prior to the planned offensive. The first unit to be transferred to the southern front was the 5th Cavalry Brigade, moved to the area on 12 April. The 4th Cavalry Brigade arrived soon afterwards. Although both brigades were seriously undermanned and under-equipped, they formed a considerable force by contemporary standards. However, all sub-units until then fought separately and did not have enough time to train cooperation. Finally, the commander of the new division was a skilled staff officer, but had no cavalry experience. Opposing forces The Polish units consisted of a Cavalry Division as well as several smaller detachments. The division was composed of 192 officers and 6260 privates and NCOs, as well as 5881 horses. It was equipped with only 8 Russian guns and 8 Italian 75 mm guns, as well as 69 machine guns of various calibers. The rear of the division was to be guarded by the Polish 15th Infantry Division that was to follow the assaulting cavalry and replace it as soon as the town was taken and secured. The Russian defenders consisted of the 44th and 58th Rifle Divisions, as well as various smaller elements of both the 12th and 14th Red Armies. The raid=Opening moves The assault started on 25 April at 4 AM. The 9th Uhlan Regiment aided by elements of the 14th Uhlan Regiment and 4th Mounted Artillery Battalion crossed the Sluch river and formed the offensive's spearhead. They were followed by the remainder of the 14th Regiment, the 8th, 1st and 16th Uhlan Regiments, as well as the 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment and the 4th and 5th Mounted Artillery Regiments. Initially there was no contact with the enemy as the route lead through dense forests and the cavalry advanced in a fast pace, with the artillery much to the rear. The first clashes occurred at 8 AM when the 9th Regiment reached the village of Prutivka (now Zhytomyr Oblast), from where it was attacked by the machine guns of a brigade of the Soviet 17th Cavalry Division (composed of the 94th and 100th Regiments, with 800 men at arms altogether). The commander of the 9th Regiment, Rotmistrz (Captain) J√≥zef Dunin-Borkowski ordered his unit to assault the village. The 2nd squadron assaulted the village on foot, while the 1st squadron outflanked it from the south and was to attack from the rear. However the Polish assault failed and the Russians counter-attacked the Polish left wing with a cavalry charge. However, two waves of Russian cavalry were repelled by Polish machine gun fire. The result was a stalemate, with neither side able to defeat the other. In order to sustain momentum, General Romer ordered his artillery to shell the village and the 14th Regiment to aid in the assault. This finally broke the Soviet defenses and allowed the Poles to advance. The Soviet forces withdrew to the south-east where they were intercepted by the 1st squadron of the 9th Regiment and forced to retreat further east. After half an hour of rest, the march was resumed. In the village of Tartak Cudnowski a company of Soviet engineers was surprised during construction work and surrendered almost without a shot fired. From there a patrol of 14th Regiment with an artillery platoon moved to secure the southern flank of forces along the Teterev river and a ford in the village of Nova Rudnya (now in Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine). After another rest, at 5.30 PM the assault was resumed. Soon before midnight the Division reached the village of Rudnya and remained there for the rest of the night. Since the enemy was expected to occupy the nearby village of Troyanivka (now Khmelnytskyi Oblast), the units were ordered to remain silent. During the first day of the offensive, Polish units advanced some 80 kilometers behind Soviet lines without alerting the enemy. Day 2 By the end of the following day the Polish forces planned to reach the outskirts of the town of Koziatyn and advance through the villages of Gwozdkowo, Siemiaki, Skak√≥wka, Krasivka and the town of Bia≈Çopol. The vanguard for the second day was formed by the 1st Uhlan Regiment and a battery of the 5th Mounted Artillery Battalion. The main force consisting of the remainder of the 5th and 4th Brigades was to follow, while the rear guard was to be formed by the 9th Uhlan Regiment shielding the tabor of the division. In addition, as the element of surprise lost much of its meaning, the Polish command dispatched numerous patrols to find the enemy and link up with the 15th Infantry Division slowly following the spearhead. The division resumed its advance at 4 AM. After crossing the Gni≈Çop≈Çat river, the spearhead reached a relatively good road which allowed the Polish forces to advance quickly. General Romer ordered the cavalry to advance two thirds of the road at a trot (10 minutes at a trot, then 5 minutes in step). By 7.30 AM the spearhead had reached train stations at Reja and Siemianki, on the rail road linking Koziatyn with Zhytomyr. In order to prevent the Soviets from recapturing Koziatyn with an armoured train, both stations, rail lines and the telegraph line and rails were destroyed. The Poles then proceeded further into the Russian-held territory, where they were to organize a 1-hour rest. Around midday the Tabors were attacked by an armoured train whilst crossing the railroad near Siemianki. Polish carts were withdrawn beyond range of Russian artillery and the crew of the train left it to observe the effects of their fire. However, by that time the 9th Uhlan Regiment managed to turn back and assault the train from the other side of the tracks. The train retreated, thus allowing the Poles to resume their advance. Although the skirmish was fierce and artillery fire was used on both sides, Polish casualties were negligible: one NCO and several horses were killed and several cart drivers were wounded. During the skirmish a Polish fighter plane appeared over the battlefield. Seeing the Polish carts withdrawing, the pilot returned to base and reported that the Poles were in retreat and severely defeated. Meanwhile, the Polish advance was resumed. General Romer ordered a platoon of the 1st Uhlan Regiment to leave the main route and follow the tracks leading towards Zhytomyr. The unit reached a wooden railway bridge and took its crew by surprise. The bridge was destroyed without casualties and the unit returned to the main force. Assault on Koziatyn=The charge By 1 PM the front guard reached the village of Bia≈Çopole, where the division headquarter's was to prepare an assault on the nearby town of Koziatyn. The encounter with the armoured train delayed the advance and last elements of the Polish division only arrived there at 3 PM. General Romer decided to move his troops through the dense forest north of Koziatyn, seize the village of Jankowce and then order a cavalry charge in the open terrain between the town and the forest. Then the Polish cavalrymen were to dismount and assault both railway stations - the passenger station and the cargo depot - on foot, using standard infantry tactics. The cavalry charge was to be started before dusk, in a loose formation intended to minimize losses from enemy machine gun and artillery fire. Then the cargo depot was to be assaulted by the 14th Regiment (Eastern part), 1st Regiment (Central area) and the 16th Regiment (Western part), while the passenger station was to be attacked by the entire 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment. All regiments were reinforced with platoons of mounted infantry, while the 8th and 9th Cavalry Regiments were to form the reserve. The 4th Brigade was the first to leave Bia≈Çopole, supported by the 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment. The remainder of the division rested in the village of Wernyhorodek and waited for the 4th Brigade to arrive at the edge of the forest. However, the commander of the 4th Brigade, Maj. Tadeusz Sulimirski, ignored Gen. Romer's orders and had his men dismount and prepare an infantry assault across more than a kilometre of open terrain. Romer managed to reach the 4th Brigade and countermand Sulimirski, but precious time was lost and the soldiers were ready only by 8.30 PM. Romer feared a Russian attack might disrupt the Polish units and therefore changed his plans. Soon afterwards the charge started and the Poles rushed towards the city in a column. While the city's outskirts were completely undefended, resistance intensified as the charging Poles reached the centre. The 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment dismounted and assaulted the passenger railway station, which was heavily defended by infantry and an armoured train. When the Poles failed to take the station by surprise, the regiment's commanding officer, por. Karski, called for artillery support and ordered his men to withdraw. A short barrage allowed and the Poles managed to capture several buildings, supply trains and a hospital train. However, in the complete darkness that covered the battlefield, Karski ordered his men to retreat and resume the assault in the morning. During the entire struggle the 2nd Regiment lost 1 officer and a dozen-or-so killed and wounded soldiers. Located to the north-east was the large railway cargo depot, covering roughly 2 kilometres of area along two railway lines. At 9.30 AM the 16th Uhlans Regiment assaulted on the right flank and managed to cross the fence. Despite heavy machine gun fire, Polish soldiers managed to reach the first buildings and neutralize those machine guns on the platform with hand grenades. This allowed the 16th Regiment to seize the main station and reach a bridge leading to the passenger station. Here too the assault was also halted until the next morning. Soon the 2nd Light and 1st Uhlan Regiment joined the 16th and the Polish front-line was established along a 400 metre long track from Koziatyn to Kiev. The 14th Regiment soon joined the rest of the Polish forces, strengthening the left wing. At midnight a squadron of the 14th Regiment, aided by a single heavy machine gun, started a sortie towards the roundhouse. The assault succeeded and at 2.30 AM the building lay in Polish hands. However, one hour later the Russians counter-attacked and by 5.30 AM the Poles were forced back to their lines, with losses on both sides. Mopping-up As the Cavalry Division was unable to seize the town's train stations overnight, at 6 AM an all-out assault was ordered. The entire 14th Regiment assaulted the roundhouse, aided by a battery of the 4th Mounted Artillery Battalion. The 14th Regiment was followed by the tired soldiers of the 16th and 1st Uhlan Regiment, who spent the best part of the night fighting the Russian armoured train. As the station was filled with wagons, cars and all sorts of packages and pieces of military equipment, the units of both sides got separated into tiny groups fighting for each railway car and for each entrevoie. In the meantime the roundhouse was finally secured and the 1st Regiment seized the southern part of the station, thus pushing elements of enemy forces into the forest. This ended the fight for the cargo station as the tiny groups of enemy soldiers were surrounded and in large part surrendered quickly. Simultaneously the Poles resumed their attack on the passenger station. The main building was a stronghold manned by around 2000 Red Army soldiers. However, this time the 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment was reinforced by the 9th Uhlan Regiment and the 7th Mounted Artillery Battalion. Following a short shrapnel barrage placed on the courtyard, the Poles managed to reach the building and pound it with hand grenades. This forced the Russians to surrender. The tired 2nd Regiment secured it, while the 9th Regiment continued the assault, skirmishing with an armoured train. As close proximity prevented either side from deploying artillery, the train was finally forced to retreat by intensive Polish machine gun fire. Those units fighting for the station were soon reinforced by the 14th Uhlan Regiment, until then fighting for the cargo depot. The regiment assaulted the Russians from the east, finally forcing them to surrender. By 7:45 AM the town and stations of Koziatyn were in Polish hands. By the end of the day the first elements of the 15th Infantry Division arrived to relieve the tired Uhlans. By 30 April the entire division had been withdrawn. Until then the 8th Uhlan and 2nd Light Cavalry Regiments were busy catching marauders of the routed 44th and 58th Rifle Divisions. Outcome The raid proved to be a complete success for the Poles. The Cavalry Division managed to strike a wedge behind the rear of the Soviet 12th Army, disrupt its southern wing and cut it off from the Soviet 14th Army. In addition, the Russians lost the entire 44th Rifle Division and the 1st Rifle Brigade of the Soviet 58th Rifle Division. By capturing Koziatyn, the Polish forces seized one of the most important railway hubs in the area and the supply depot of the entire army. In addition to roughly 8000 soldiers taken prisoner of war, the Polish Army seized 500 horses, 200 carts, 120 railway engines (25% of them readily used), over 3000 railway cars, 30 pieces of artillery, an armoured train and 7 complete hospital trains. Besides that, the prize included 170 machine guns, several dozen cars and large amounts of materiel and supplies. Among the most bizarre cargo kept in the depot was a camel captured by the 14th Uhlan Regiment. The soldiers initially wanted to take the animal with them as a mascot, but finally decided to give it to the Warsaw Zoo as a gift.

Even though he spent 55 games in the minors, his Major League season would be the best of his career. He hit .249 with 10 sacrifice hits-good for fourth most in the league. On November 17, 2001 Mark married spouse Jamie Suzanne Webster, In Warner Robins, Georgia. He hit only .209 in , and that may have prompted his trade. On December 3, 2002, he was traded with Keith Foulke, Joe Valentine, and cash to the Oakland Athletics for Billy Koch and two players to be named later (who would end up being Neal Cotts and minor leaguer Daylan Holt). He spent most of his season in the minors in , hitting only .228. In the thirteen games that he played in the Majors, his batting average was .111. After the 2003 season, he was granted free agency and signed by the Milwaukee Brewers. Like the season before, he spent most of his time in the minors that year, actually breaking the .250 mark and hitting .259. His time in the Majors was again unimpressive-in eleven at bats, he collected only one hit, for a .097 batting average. After , he was granted free-agency, but was re-signed by the Brewers, who then traded him to the Chicago Cubs for Travis Ezi. He spent entirely in the minors, hitting .266 in 60 games. After the 2005 season, he was granted free agency and picked up by the Brewers again. He spent all of in the minors, hitting only .203 there. On November 10, 2006, he signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks and spent the entire year in the minors; though Johnson did have the best season hitting for average in his career, with a .320 batting average. In December , he signed a minor league contract with the St Louis Cardinals and was invited to their spring training, but did not make the team. He was called up by the Cardinals in September , appearing in the majors for the first time in four years. One source describes him as this: \\"He has decent gap power, resulting in his share of doubles, as well as a good eye at the plate. Defensively, he calls a good game and gets the ball quickly down to second base.\\" Although he has never quite lived up to the \\"gap power\\", he has shown a fairly good eye at the plate, with 123 walks and 195 strikeouts so far in his career. His defense is also reliable‚Äîhis career fielding percentage is .993. That same source goes on to say this about him: \\"He has very little home run power and is a fairly light hitter on the whole -- even worse against southpaws.\\" He has averaged just over two home runs a season in the Majors, and his statistics ‚Äì .217 batting average with 16 home runs and 81 RBI so far in his career ‚Äì are rather unsavory. In November 2009 Johnson was granted free agency from the Chicago Cubs. On January 20, 2010, Johnson re-signed a minor league contract with the Cubs Minor league manager In 2011, Johnson managed the Boise Hawks, the Cubs' affiliate in the Class A-Short Season Northwest League. In 2013, Johnson was named manager of the Kane County Cougars, the Class A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. In 2015, Johnson was the manager of the Myrtle Beach Pelicans.

The book has been praised by some scholars and criticised by others. Controversy over the book intensified five years after its publication, after news emerged in 2006 that Abu El Haj was under consideration for tenure at Barnard College where she served as an assistant professor. Barnard alumnae mounted a campaign to deny tenure to Abu El Haj that centered on what they described as the book's anti-Israel bias, prompting a counter-campaign in support of the book and Abu El Haj. The University ultimately granted Abu El Haj tenure in November 2007.  Contents  In the book, Abu El Haj uses anthropological methods to study the relationship between the development of scientific knowledge in Israeli archaeology and the construction of the social imaginations and political orders in the Israeli State and what she characterizes as the \\"formation and enactment of its colonial-national historical imagination and...the substantiation of its territorial claims\\".Facts on the Ground, p. 2. She argues that facts generated by archaeological practice have fashioned \\"cultural understandings, political possibilities and 'common-sense' assumptions\\". Reception Facts on the Ground has been widely reviewed in both scholarly and popular publications. It was one of the winners of the 2002 Albert Hourani Book Award, granted by the Middle East Studies Association of North America for outstanding publishing in Middle East studies.Albert Hourani Book Award Recipients, 1991-2005 , Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESAN). Jere Bacharach, a MESA member and historian at the University of Washington, described the book as a \\"nuanced, nonpolemic work\\". The book has received both accolades, particularly from Abu El Haj's fellow anthropologists, and denunciations, from some archaeologists, whose colleagues' work she criticizes. According to Jane Kramer, writing in The New Yorker, \\"the book was praised by colleagues who responded to the critical tropes that were Abu El Haj's legacy from scholars like Michel Foucault, Ian Hacking, Bruno Latour, and Edward Said, and dismissed by colleagues with a theoretical or a political or simply a turf interest in dismissing it.\\" Academic reviews (chronologically-ordered) In the MIT Electronic Journal of Middle East Studies, Elia Zureik, a professor of sociology at Queen's University, writes that Abu El Haj's \\"use of the sociology of science as a perspective in her research is both clever and refreshing. It further elevates research about Palestine to new heights, by placing it squarely in current social science literature and debates. We need more such studies.\\" Edward Said wrote of being \\"indebted\\" to the book and work of Abu El Haj, in Freud and the Non-European (2003), offering that: > What she provides first of all is a history of systematic colonial > archaeological exploration in Palestine, dating back to British work in the > mid-nineteenth century. She then continues the story in the period before > Israel is established, connecting the actual practice of archaeology with a > nascent national ideology - an ideology with plans for the repossession of > the land through renaming and resettling, much of it given archeological > justification as a schematic extraction of Jewish identity despite the > existence of Arab names and traces of other civilizations. This effort, she > argues convincingly, epistemologically prepares the way for a fully fledged > post-1948 sense of Israeli-Jewish identity based on assembling discrete > archaeological particulars -scattered remnants of masonry, tablets, bones, > tombs...\\"Said, Edward (2003). Freud and the Non-European Verso Books, , p. > 47 In her review of Facts on the Ground for American Ethnologist, Kimbra L. Smith professor of anthropology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, writes that \\"Abu El Haj provides an important and timely look at some of the politics of self-representation behind the Israeli government's public face, within a broader argument about science's capacity for political involvement and for maintaining and even advancing colonialist policies. However [...] her failure to present either official Palestinian or public Palestinian/Israeli opinions and attitudes within the context of Israel's (settler) nationalist- archaeological discipline means that answers to the excellent questions she raises are never made clear.\\"Kimbra L. Smith. Book Reviews On-line , American Ethnologist, Volume 30 Number 2, May 2003. Apen Ruiz, at the University of Texas at Austin, writes in H-Net that \\"Facts on the Ground offers a unique and pioneering approach to examine the politics of archaeological research.\\" He explains that, \\"Inspired by cultural and social studies of science, El-Haj puts archaeology under an ethnographic lens and examines its practices: excavating, surveying, cataloguing, naming, mapping, and exhibiting,\\" noting that it is this, \\"focus on archaeological practices as the main object of study,\\" that is the \\"primary contribution of the book\\".Apen Ruiz. \\"Review of Nadia Abu El-Haj, Facts on the Ground: Archaeological Practice and Territorial Self-Fashioning in Israeli Society,\\" H-Gender-MidEast, H-Net Reviews, May, 2004. Aren Maeir, professor of archaeology at Bar Ilan University, writing in Isis, calls the book \\"a highly ideologically driven political manifesto, with a glaring lack of attention both to details and to the broader context.\\" Regarding Abu El Haj's criticism of methodology in Israeli archeology, Maeir writes, that in contemporary archeology in Israel, \\"only marginal elements act in accordance with or identify with the non-scientific agendas that she attempts to delineate.\\" Maeir argues that the major reason for the lateness of Israel to adopt modern techniques was not a \\"hidden colonial agenda,\\" but rather a result of the \\"European classical archeology\\" from which it developed.Aren M. Maeir. Isis, Volume 95 Number 3, September 2004. pp. 523-524. Full text at James Gelvin, a UCLA historian, describes Facts on the Ground in his book The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War, as \\"probably the most sophisticated presentation of Israel's archaeological obsession and its relation to nationalism and 'colonial knowledge'\\".Gelvin, James L. (2005). The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War. Cambridge University Press. . p. 13. Alexander H. Joffe, an archaeologist and past director of the pro-Israel organization Campus Watch, writes in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies that \\"Abu El Haj's anthropology is undone by her [...] ill-informed narrative, intrusive counter-politics, and by her unwillingness to either enter or observe Israeli society [...] The effect is a representation of Israeli archaeology that is simply bizarre.\\" Alexander H. Joffe. Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 64 Number 4, October 2005. p. 297. Available online at Solomonia. Keith Whitelam, professor of religious studies at the University of Sheffield and author of The Invention of Ancient Israel: The Silencing of Palestinian History, told a New York Sun reporter that Facts on the Ground was a \\"first-rate book,\\" which made \\"a very fine contribution\\" to the study of \\"how national identity is constructed and the assumptions which are then built into academic work on history and archaeology.\\" In the same article, William Dever, a retired professor of Middle Eastern archaeology at the University of Arizona, describes Abu El Haj's scholarship as \\"faulty, misleading and dangerous\\". Alan F. Segal, a professor of religion and Jewish studies at Barnard College, has been a vocal critic of the book. In the Columbia Daily Spectator, he writes that Abu El Haj's work is tainted by a failure to examine primary sources in Hebrew, a reliance on anonymous sources, and a lack of breadth in its review of scholarship to date. According to Segal, Abu El Haj focuses her attention on the \\"extreme conclusions\\" of \\" biblical minimalists\\" who constitute \\"no more than a handful of scholars\\" out of \\"thousands at work (in Biblical scholarship) in the world\\". Segal writes that \\"none of the minimalist scholars she relies upon for this purpose is actually a working archaeologist,\\" and that \\"pretty much every other one of the virtually countless theories about Israelite settlement in First Temple times would disprove her hypothesis about Israeli archaeology.\\" He adds that she \\"does not tell her readers about\\" these fields, \\"why they are necessary\\", or, \\"how decisions are actually made in biblical studies.\\" In the fall 2007 issue of The Current, there was criticism of Abu El Haj from three different scholars. First, David M. Rosen, professor of anthropology at Fairleigh Dickinson University asks, \\"How can a work that apparently demonstrates an impaired understanding of the archeological sciences be regarded as good anthropology?\\" Answering his own question, he offers that while in the contemporary political climate, \\"One hardly needs to be Braveheart to be openly antagonistic to Israel at a meeting of anthropologists,\\" the more serious problem lies in the tradition of post- colonial studies, where anthropologists like Abu El Haj can \\"construct their analyses with little concern for empirical or logical connectedness. Like mythology, they are masters of the found object, and pull in anything to create a story. This methodology has no connection to science. Its power lies in its politics and its aesthetics, and not in such boring ideas as validity and reliability.\\"Searching for \\"Facts\\" on the Ground, by David Rosen, The Current, Fall 2007 In the same issue, Jonathan Rosenbaum, paleographer and President of Gratz College, suggests that Abu El Haj's \\"personal agenda\\" is \\"the furtherance of her own nationalistic ideology at the expense of decades of careful excavations and rigorous publications\\" establishing the historicity of much of the Biblical narrative.Is Truth Attainable? Jonathan Rosenbaum The Current, Fall 2007 Finally, James R. Russell, a professor at Harvard University, describes Facts on the Ground as a \\"malign fantasy\\" designed to demonstrate the \\"colonial essence\\" of Zionism by denying the history of ancient \\"Jewish sovereignty and long historical presence.\\" Ideology over Integrity in Academe, by James R. Russell, The Current, Fall 2007 Bulldozer use One controversy related to the book came from a passage in Facts on the Ground in which Abu El Haj wrote that during a dig in Jezreel, British and Israeli archaeologists used \\"bulldozers ... in order to get down to the earlier strata, which are saturated with national significance, as quickly as possible.\\" She noted that \\"among Palestinian officials at the Haram al-Sharif and the Awqaf as well as many other archaeologists ... the use of bulldozers has become the ultimate sign of 'bad science' and of nationalist politics guiding research agendas.\\"Facts on the Ground, p. 148. She wrote that the incident took place \\"a week after [she] stopped participating in the excavations\\" and attributed the account to \\"several participants, both archaeologists and student volunteers,\\" whom she did not name.Facts on the Ground, n. 12, p. 306. The dig in question was led by David Ussishkin of the University of Tel Aviv, who responded to Abu El Haj's characterization in an open letter published on the internet in December 2006. While confirming that the earlier strata was the main interest of the dig, Ussishkin denied that any damage was done to other strata, which he insisted were properly excavated. Ussishkin defended the use of the bulldozer at the site as being necessary to properly excavate the site, and said he did not believe it had caused any damage.David Ussishkin. Archaeologist David Ussishkin Responds to El Haj Accusations, Solomonia, December 5, 2006. In September 2007, archaeologist Aren Maeir, in an opinion column in the Columbia Daily Spectator student newspaper, wrote, \\"In her book she attacks, harangues, vilifies and slanders respected archaeologists in the field.\\" According to Maeir, Abu El Haj's assertions concerning Ussishkin are \\"analogous to accusing a surgeon of deciding whether to use a scalpel or a hacksaw according to the patient‚Äôs ethnic 'identity'\\" and \\"an attempt to prevent him from doing his work.\\" Abu El Haj does not mention Ussishkin by name in her book.

Usmonxojayev became General Secretary following the disastrous \\"Cotton Scandal\\".  The Cotton Scandal  Usmonxojayev succeeded Sharof Rashidov, who had been General Secretary since the 1950s. As orders from Moscow to grow more and more cotton spiraled in, the Uzbek government had respond by reporting miraculous growth in land irrigated and harvested, and record improvements in production and efficiency. Today it would seem that most of these records were falsified. Falsification of the results involved many officials in both Central Soviet Government in Moscow and Uzbekistan. In 1986, it was announced that almost the entire party and government leadership of the republic had conspired in falsifying cotton production figures. A massive purge (only one minister survived the purge) of the Uzbek leadership was carried out, with prosecutors brought in from Moscow, leading to widespread arrests, executions, and suicides. It may never be known how high the corruption extended, as Leonid Brezhnev‚Äôs own son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov was implicated in the affair. In 1989, Usmonxojayev was charged with the \\"Cotton Case\\" and sentenced to 12 years in prison. After a short time, in 1990 he was released from prison, but was not fully acquitted. The Supreme Court of Uzbekistan fully rehabilitated Usmonxojayev on 18 November 2016, after the death of the first president of the country Islam Karimov.  Usmonxojayev's term  It was while Usmonxojayev was General Secretary that satellite images showed that the Uzbek government's reports were false. Usmonxojayev held his position throughout the scandal, serving as a puppet of Moscow as the Central Committee tried to strengthen its grip in Uzbekistan. Usmonxojayev was General Secretary from 3 November 1983 until 12 January 1988. His replacement was Rafiq Nishonov. On 12 January 1988, he was relieved of his duties as first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan \\"in connection with his retirement\\", and on 24 May 1988, he was removed from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

Route Both the Saddleworth villages of Delph and Greenfield are on the western slopes of the Pennine hills. The branch followed the main cross country line between Manchester and Huddersfield as far as Delph Junction set above the village of Uppermill. Just before the junction was Moorgate Halt. Although this was situated on the main line, it was only ever used by trains to Delph. The Delph branch then left the main line and veered sharply left past Ladcastle Quarry before reaching Dobcross halt. It then continued to Delph with one additional intermediate halt that served the 'Measurements' factory on Delph New Road where trains only called at the start and end of the working day. The line terminated at Delph where a private siding served Messrs Mallalieu's Bailey Mill. There was also a goods shed and coal staithes serving local business. Delph was the only station on the line beyond Moorgate with permanent structures; the station building still survives as a private residence (as does Grotton & Springhead station). Services ran to and from Oldham via Greenfield with connections to several other destinations, and summer specials ran usually to coastal resorts. Origin of the name The line took its name from a claim that the original service on the railway was a carriage drawn by a donkey. However, Gordon Suggitt states in his book, Lost Railways of Merseyside & Greater Manchester, that it has never been proven that there was a donkey or horse- drawn service on the line. Since trains on the branch worked onto the main Manchester to Huddersfield line, it is unlikely horse-drawn trains would have been permitted. Closure Passenger trains ceased running on the Delph Donkey in April 1955, although a limited number of freight trains continued to use the line until November 1963.The Leeds, Huddersfield & Manchester Railway by Martin Bairstow () The track was lifted in 1964 to turn the line between Oldham and Grotton into a cycle and walk way. The line between Moorgate and Delph became the Delph Donkey Trail footpath and bridleway, on which the halts at Dobcross and Measurements are now marked by replica station nameboards. The section of the railway between Greenfield and Grotton was either abandoned as waste land or converted into small footpaths. A section of the line that ran below Grasscroft through Friezland is now part of a large housing estate. , old pieces of track, that had not been moved since the closure almost 50 years before, remained outside Bailey Mill at the old Delph terminus. Lydgate Tunnel The tunnel running underneath Lydgate, connecting Grasscroft and Grotton, is still completely intact and maintained, but it is unused and completely inaccessible. It was felt, after lifting the track and deciding the future use of the new available land, that it would be too costly and dangerous to collapse or infill the tunnel, especially as there were more structures above the tunnel, such as housing, than there had been when the tunnel was built in the mid-19th century. Minor work was carried out in the 1980s, as part of a planned maintenance programme, which in-filled the centre air vent to avoid any subsidence. In 2008, 44 years after the tunnel had been last used, a routine inspection revealed some areas of loose and hollow brickwork in the tunnel lining. Routine maintenance work to rectify that was carried out by BRB (Residuary) Limited, with substantial areas of the tunnel lining replaced with new brickwork, incorporating drainage pipes and other securing works. News of the inspection and remedial work led to concern by some local people that the tunnel was near to collapse, but BRB(R) stated that was never a risk, and the work was just on-going planned maintenance.

Hartzell started his career with the St. Louis Browns (now known as the Baltimore Orioles), and was later traded to the New York Highlanders (now New York Yankees) for two other players, Jimmy Austin and Frank LaPorte. Early life Hartzell was born on July 6, 1881, in Golden, Colorado. His parents were James and Nellie Hartzell from Illinois. James G. Hartzell was a Civil War veteran and died and is buried in California. Hertzel had two brothers named Lester and Harry. Lester was a mining engineer and a professor at the State School of Mines in Colorado. Lester was quarterback of the Mines football team. Harry was involved in tourism operations in the Golden community. Roy Hartzell played baseball and football in the Denver area. Hartzell worked in the smelters in Montana before signing with the pros. He married Ella Stebbins in Philadelphia in April 1911. She was also from Golden. He had some business in the Golden area working with rentals and sales. Major Leagues Hartzell was 24 years old when he played his first game in the big leagues on April 17, 1906, with the St. Louis Browns. He played many positions including second base, third base, shortstop, and outfield in each of his 11 seasons of baseball. At the plate he batted left-handed, but threw right-handed. He stood about 5 foot 8 inches tall, and weighed 155 pounds. On October 3, 1911, New York was playing the Boston Red Sox. Jack Lewis of Boston was pulling a steal and collided with Hartzell and had to be replaced by a pinch runner named Duffy Lewis. The two Lewises are of no relation. Hartzell played in 1,290 games with a life-time batting average of .252. His last MLB game was on July 25, 1916. He signed to play for the 1917 Toledo Iron Men of the American Association. Accomplishments On July 12, 1911 when Hartzell was the cleanup hitter, he hit a 3-run double and another double in the same inning, then added a sacrifice fly and a grand slam, driving in a total of 8 runs. It was a Major League record until Jimmy Foxx had 9 RBI in a game in 1933. Hartzell's 595 at-bats for the Browns led the American League in 1909, and his 91 RBI for New York in 1911 were the most by a player in the Yankees' first 13 years. Later years Hartzell died on November 6, 1961, in Golden, Colorado, his birthplace. He was buried in Golden Cemetery.

To be accepted into the school, the student must receive a certain grade in their Secondary Schools Entrance Examination (SSEE). This is the fourth highest school in Guyana, closely followed by St. Joseph High School (Guyana). History Six nuns and two postulants from the Ursuline convent in Athlone, Ireland traveled to the then-colony of British Guiana in 1847. The sisters, Mothers Mary Bernard Perry, Mary de Sales Molony, Mary Magdalen Doyle, Mary Regis O‚ÄôBrien, superior, Mary Stanislaus Hearne and Mary Alphonsus O‚ÄôBeirnem opened a secondary school for girls on August 31 of that year, the celebration of St. Rose of Lima. Three-story structures were built to accommodate the growing student population in 1869 and 1925. The latter building included an auditorium that was the largest of its kind in Georgetown for many years. Construction began on a gymnasium in 1935. The boarding program closed in 1953, followed shortly by completion of a new wing of the school, the Marian Wing, in 1954. New laboratories and classrooms were added in the late 1960s. St. Rose's accepted its first male students in 1975, a year before all Guyana schools became state-controlled. Despite the government oversight, St. Rose's maintained its logo (badge) of the Ursuline shield. In 2005, a board of governors was established to manage St. Rose's High School. Student organizations and traditions St. Rose's students are sorted into five houses. Their names, colors and mottos are: *Brescia, red, He conquers who overcomes himself, *Cologne, yellow, Nothing ventured nothing gained, *Lima, pink, Excelsior. *Loretto, blue, Unity is strength, *Merici, green, Where there's a will, there's a way. School Song \\"Serviam\\" There‚Äôs a word that wakes our spirits Lifts our thoughts on high Where St. Ursula‚Äôs own emblem Sparkles in the sky As on to the Pole Star pointing Brightly shines the Bear, She doth point the way to Heaven Leads our footsteps there SING! CHORUS: And the badge that shows our motto Shall be ever dear And for God we‚Äôll serve our neighbour His own image here, ‚ÄúServiam‚Äù shall be our watchword, Marching on we‚Äôll sing Battling against the pride of Satan Serving Christ our King (Repeat last 2 lines) All St. Angela has taught us, We will strive to do, She shall be our guide and mother All our whole life through. She will know us for her children Ursulines we‚Äôll be: Holding fast the cross that takes us on to victory. CHORUS Storm or cloud will not dismay us, We will do and dare When it‚Äôs dark we‚Äôll just remember That the stars are there If we fail we‚Äôll rise unconquered; Set our armour right; Hope and Love will heal our bruises Faith will win the fight. CHORUS The badge The Serviam Badge is a symbol of all Ursuline schools worldwide. Although St. Rose's is now a government school and is therefore no longer an Ursuline school, the Ursuline badge was never changed, and the following is an explanation of its meaning. Pope Pius XI has said that the badge of the Ursuline schools, with the motto \\"Serviam\\" is a symbol of Christian education. It bears a field of stars [the constellation Ursa Minor, in which the Pole Star lies], signifying the Eternal Heavens to which we must aspire. The Little Bear ‚ÄúUrsus‚Äù recalls St. Ursula, patroness of Christian Education and special patroness of Ursuline Schools. Just as the light from the Little Bear leads up to the brighter light of the Pole Star, so Ursuline Education helps students to the knowledge of Truth, here symbolised by the Pole Star, and it is Truth which will guide students on their path through life. The Ursuline badge bears a cross - whence comes all grace into the world, to remind students that all blessings of God flow from the Redemption. The colour Green represents the virtue of hope, the colour Silver reminds students to be sincere in all that they do. The word ‚ÄúServiam‚Äù (I will serve) expresses loyalty to Christ, and a desire to serve Him. Alumni The St. Rose's High School Alumni Association has chapters located throughout the world. The chapters help raise funds for the improvement of the school and its institutions.

Lutyens' Delhi is an area in New Delhi, India, named after the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens (1869‚Äì1944), who was responsible for much of the architectural design and building during the period of the British Raj, when India was part of the British Empire in the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s. This also includes the Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ). Sir Edwin Lutyens, the architect of Delhi, designed 4 bungalows in the Rashtrapati Bhavan Estate, (Viceroy House Estate); now, these bungalows lie on the Mother Teresa Crescent (then Willingdon Crescent). Lutyens, apart from designing the Viceroy's House, designed large government building and was involved with town planning. Sir Herbert Baker, who also designed with the Secretariat Buildings (North and South Block), designed bungalows on the then King George's Avenue (south of the Secretariats) for high-ranking officials. Other members of the team of architects were Robert Tor Russell, who built Connaught Place, the Eastern and Western Courts on Janpath, Teen Murti House, Safdarjung Airport, National Stadium and several government houses, William Henry Nicholls, CG Blomfield, FB Blomfield, Walter Sykes George, Arthur Gordon Shoosmith and Henry Medd. It is on the 2002 World Monuments Watch list of 100 Most Endangered Sites made by World Monuments Fund, a heritage organization based in New York. The South Block History The area was constructed after the British decided to move the capital of their Indian Empire from Calcutta to Delhi, by creating a new district of the latter entitled New Delhi Before the new imperial capital was established in 1911, the Old Delhi Railway Station served the Agra-Delhi railways, the line cut through what is today called Lutyens' Delhi. The line was eventually shifted to make way for the new capital and the New Delhi Railway Station was built near Ajmeri Gate in 1926. Design and construction The North Block, as viewed from South Block; the South Block is identical from North Block Lutyens led a group of architects in laying out the central administrative area of the city, with the charge of retaining one- third of the area as green space. At the heart of the city was the impressive Rashtrapati Bhawan, formerly known as Viceroy's House, located on the top of Raisina Hill. The Rajpath, also known as King's Way, connects India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, while Janpath, which crosses it at a right angle, connects South End Road (renamed as Rajesh Pilot Marg) with Connaught Place. Currently, Ram Nath Kovind is the President of India, and stays in the official house of Rashtrapati Bhawan. The Secretariat Building, which house various ministries of the Government of India including the Prime Minister's Office, is beside the Rashtrapati Bhawan and was designed by Herbert Baker. Also designed by Baker was the Parliament House, located on the Sansad Marg, running parallel with the Rajpath. Two magnificent cathedrals in the area, the Anglican Cathedral Church of the Redemption and Catholic Sacred Heart Cathedral were designed by Henry Medd. Lutyens Bungalow Zone The Lutyens Bungalow Zone covers an area of about 26 km2. All land and buildings in the LBZ belong to the central government, except for which is in private hands. It is a very important and expensive zone in New Delhi. There are about 1000 bungalows in the LBZ, of which less than ten percent are in private hands. In order to create development control norms, the Ministry of Urban Development constituted the 'New Delhi Redevelopment Advisory Committee' (NDRAC) in 1972, when the redevelopment of the areas around the walled city, north of Connaught Place and on Prithviraj Road was taken up. Land prices In 2013, it was reported that the market value of the of land in private hands in the LBZ had increased eightfold in the previous ten years, from around Rs to . In June 2014, Rajiv Rattan, Indiabulls co-founder, bought a plot for Rs 220 crore. In December 2016, Renuka Talwar, daughter of DLF Chairman KP Singh, acquired a bungalow on Prithviraj Road for 435 crore INR in one of the biggest deals for a property in Lutyens' Delhi. Contiguous areas Around the great green expanse of the LBZ, is a thick swathe of green, a glacis of trees, and manicured lawns, and grand buildings, that protect and cushion LBZ from the swirl and swarm of Delhi's crowded parts: on the west is the vast wooded area of the Delhi Ridge, adjoining the grand acres of the Presidential Estate; to the west and south is Nehru Park, the Race Course, the Air force station, the Delhi Gymkhana Club, Safdarjung Airport, Safdarjang Tomb, and the Diplomatic enclave; to the south is the Lodi Gardens, with its fabulous Lodhi era tombs, and remains; on the SE are great lavishly tended greens of Delhi Golf Club, with its Mughal era ruins; and beyond the Golf course, on the edge of the LBZ boundary is the green stretch of National Zoological Park, lakes, the Purana Qila, and the Humayun's Tomb. The contiguous areas are lavished with as much care by the government as the LBZ. Those who can't buy into the LBZ buy into the contiguous areas, like Jhor Bagh, where property prices are almost as steep as in the LBZ. Notable residents The official residence of the Prime Minister of India is at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg a complex of five bungalows, spread over 12 acres. The former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, also resides here. He was allotted a Type VIII bungalow, on 3 Motilal Nehru Marg, previously occupied by Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, on 27 February 2014 by Kamal Nath Minister of Urban Development, on account of his being Rajya Sabha MP from Assam.Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are a few more politicians who live here at 10 Janpath Former Prime Ministers, not a member of Parliament (MP), are not entitled to a government bungalow, however, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, another former Prime Minister and not a Member of any house, resided in a bungalow on Krishna Menon Marg since 2005. Notable businessmen include Laxmi N Mittal, KP Singh, Sunil Mittal, C. K. Birla, Shashi Ruia, Ravi Ruia, Analjit Singh, Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Atul Punj.

The menu name may even be different from the kitchen name. For example, from the 19th until the mid-20th century, many restaurant menus were written in French and not in the local language. Examples include veal (calf), calamari (squid), and sweetbreads (pancreas or thymus gland). Culinary names are especially common for fish and seafood, where multiple species are marketed under a single familiar name.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot Synopsis Waking from their latest jump, Ryan Cawdor and his friends find themselves in a MAT-TRANS chamber which is smaller than the norm. This curious change is overshadowed by their next discovery: the chamber door release latch is stuck, leaving the group no way to leave the chamber and no way to start another MAT-TRANS jump to a different redoubt. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to make the mechanism work, Krysty Wroth calls upon her mutant strength and forces the door open. This frees the group but breaks the latch mechanism completely, rendering the MAT-TRANS inoperable. Rick Ginsberg, a cryonic patient from 2001 who was \\"thawed\\" by Ryan, estimates that he can fix the mechanism, but will need at least basic tools to do so. The remainder of the redoubt is unusually small and limited, lacking the usual assortment of rooms and equipment. The only exit leads up a long, spiraling metal staircase which eventually comes out in a secret door built into the attic chimney of a partially fire- destroyed dacha. Finally able to see the sky, J. B. Dix uses his pocket sextant to find their approximate location; to his disbelief, the latest jump has taken him and his friends somewhere near Moscow. After taking food and clothing from hostile residents of a nearby town, Ryan, J. B. and Krysty head out to obtain tools to repair the MAT-TRANS chamber. Their progress is halted when they are nearly shot by a Russian government security patrol. Realizing they need to be able to understand the local language to avoid further incidents, the group returns to the dacha for Rick, who is fluent in Russian. Rick protests at first, revealing that his ALS is no longer in remission and is making him progressively weaker, but relents when it becomes clear there is no other option if they are to find tools. Meanwhile, in the Russian government capital (located in the suburbs near the heavily bombed ruins of Moscow), the recently promoted Major-Commissar Gregori Zimyanin has been following reports of the group's actions. The descriptions of the people involved stir memories of his encounter with a one-eyed American in Alaska. Despite orders to the contrary, Zimyanin continues his investigation, culling reports for suspicious behavior or crimes committed by one-eyed men. On the advice of several locals, Ryan, Krysty, and Rick travel to the Russian War Museum in order to learn more about the current Russian government. Shortly thereafter Zimyanin arrives at the Museum, having estimated the group's likely path and assuming they would not be able to ignore the Museum. Ryan spots Zimyanin, immediately recognizing him, and hastens the group's progress through the Museum. On the way through they come across an ill-visited side exhibit which unexpectedly holds all the tools Rick needs to fix the MAT-TRANS chamber, presumably looted from the nearby dacha. The three resolve to come back at night when the Museum is closed to retrieve the tools. With Zimyanin closing in from the front entrance and soldiers moving to set up roadblocks, Ryan and his friends move to leave through the back, only to discover that the back exit goes past the most popular (and monitored) exhibit: a tattered American flag, which attendees are expected to spit on. All three are nearly overcome with disgust, and Rick balks at following through, but in the end all three spit on the flag and leave unnoticed. As they leave Rick demands that the flag be taken as well when they return in the evening. With Rick's condition rapidly worsening, Ryan and Kristy return to the Museum without him. The tools are stolen easily, their cases not even locked, but taking the American flag trips an alarm and alerts Museum security. Ryan and Kristy shoot their way through the confused guards and escape. Ultimately Zimyanin is able to track the group's path back to the abandoned American dacha, following a path of violent firefights and other crimes, while the group works quickly to repair the MAT-TRANS door under the guidance of Rick, who is entering the final, fatal stages of ALS. Zimyanin's forces attack the dacha as repairs are nearing completion, and Rick asks to be left behind with cans of gasoline and a pyrotab to cover the escape. Ryan and the others are able to hold off the Russians long enough for the door to be repaired; before they leave Rick, wrapped in the rescued American flag, asks for one last favor, to hear The Star-Spangled Banner before he dies. With Doc's help the group tearfully sings the anthem for Rick, who dies before the song is finished. Zimyanin manages to make it to the hidden redoubt during this time, and enters the control room just as Ryan hurls the burning pyrotab into the gas-soaked room before closing the chamber door; Zimyanin narrowly avoids being killed by the ensuing fire. As the MAT-TRANS activates he runs through the fire and quickly enters the chamber, intent on killing the now-incapacitated Ryan. Ryan is aware of Zimyanin's hands around his neck as the jump continues, but is unable to do anything as he slides into unconsciousness.

Falckner's published works include Grondlycke Onderricht which first appeared in the Dutch language during 1708. This was the first Lutheran catechism to be published in North America. He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on November 24 together with Jehu Jones and William Passavant.Falckner Ordination Tercentenary (The Swedish Colonial Society) November 23, 2003 Background Falckner was the fourth son of Daniel Falckner, a Lutheran pastor at Langenreinsdorf, a subdivision of Crimmitschau in Saxony. In 1693, he entered the University of Halle, where he studied theology under August Hermann Francke.Bente, F. American Lutheranism, Volume I St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House. 1919, 25. He completed his studies, but determined that he was not truly prepared to follow a career in the ministry. He went to Rotterdam, where he and his brother Daniel accepted power of attorney to sell the land of William Penn in Pennsylvania.Justus Falckner Biography (Cyber Hymnal) Career In 1701, 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) of land along the Manatawny Creek were sold to Swedish Lutheran Pastor Andreas Rudman and other Swedish settlers. After working with Pastor Rudman, Falckner reconsidered entering the ministry. He was ordained on November 24, 1703 at Gloria Dei Church, the Swedish Lutheran Church in Wicaco, today South Philadelphia. His first pastoral assignment was with the settlers on the Manatawny Creek in New Hanover Township, Pennsylvania. On February 23, 1704, King Carl XII of Sweden, issued an order formally confirming Andreas Rudman as Superintendent of the Swedish Lutheran Church in America. Shortly thereafter, Falckner was reassigned by Rudman to serve as the pastor of the Dutch Lutheran congregations in Manhattan and Albany County, New York and Hackensack, New Jersey. He learned the Dutch language and also preached in English and later in German after he succeeded Joshua Kocherthal in the ministry of German Lutheran immigrants.Bente, F. American Lutheranism, Volume I St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House. 1919, p. 32. In 1714, Falckner led worshippers at the founding of Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldwick, New Jersey's oldest Lutheran congregation. In time he was serving fourteen congregations in the Hudson River valley. Tercentenary of Justus Falckner‚Äôs Ordination Celebrated at Philadelphia Cathedral (by Alfred J. Nicolosi, Swedish Colonial News. Page 6. Fall 2003) Zion Lutheran Church History (Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldwick) Falckner evidently believed that music was a very important element of missionary work. He wrote to Germany to ask for an organ, which he said would attract more Native American converts. Falckner wrote hymns such as \\"Rise, Ye Children of Salvation\\" (German: Auf! ihr Christen, Christi Glieder) which he composed while a student at the University of Halle in 1697. Personal life Justus Falckner was married to Gerritje Hardick in 1717. Three children were born to the couple: Anna Catharina (1718), Sara Justa (1720), and Benedictus (1723). Justus Falckner died during 1723 in Orange County, New York.

Little is known of their habits, but all are believed to be predatory on small invertebrates, such as larvae of flies. They tend to be lively and capable of active leaping and flight. The immature instars of some species camouflage themselves extremely effectively by gluing sand grains and similar particles to their backs, and so do the adults of a few species. They are not conspicuous and most species are physically small and occur patchily and in small numbers; these factors make them difficult to study and partly explain why there is a poverty of detailed knowledge of the biology of most species.

It won an Academy Award for Best Documentary. Story Russian women making artillery shells The film begins in Moscow, with civilians preparing defences in their streets. Men in civilian clothes with rifles prepare for battle. Women machine shell cases and prepare hand grenades. An apparently huge Stalin makes a battle speech in Red Square to thousands of cheering Red Army soldiers on parade with greatcoats, ushankas and fixed bayonets.

A crashed German bomber is seen in close- up. Russian fighters and bombers are readied and armed. snow-camouflaged tank Artillery guns of many types fire many times. Tank crewmen scramble to their tanks and jump aboard. Tanks race across snow-covered plains towards the enemy. Snow camouflaged troops parachute behind enemy lines. They collect skis parachuted to them and go into battle, lying down under fire before attacking again. Tanks rush from a forest across the snow, infantrymen riding on their rear decks or skiing into battle in large numbers. A tank is hit and explodes as the attack goes on. Russian infantry in greatcoats storm a village and clear the houses of surrendering German soldiers. Towns and cities are liberated. The Russian soldiers are greeted by smiling civilians. An old woman kisses several soldiers. German atrocities are shown. The elegantly preserved houses of the playwright Anton Chekhov and the novelist Leo Tolstoy are seen badly damaged, the museum exhibits destroyed. The bodies of murdered civilians are shown. Quantities of destroyed German armour and transport are scattered across the landscape. Captured artillery is to be used against the Germans. The bodies of dead Germans are seen frozen in the snow. Maps show the extent of the Russian advance. The front line has retreated far from Moscow. Making the film Tanks and ski infantry attack together The film's director Ilya Kopalin recalled of the film shoot in the winter of 1941‚Äì1942 that: > It's been severe, but happy days. Severe, because we made a movie in a > front-line city. Basement studio has turned into the apartment where we > lived like in casern. At night, we discussed with the cameramen the job for > the next day, and in the morning the machine took away the cameramen to the > front to back in the evening with the footage.

Moscow Strikes Back, now at the Globe, is not a film to be described in ordinary reviewer's terms, for these events were not staged before a camera and artistically arranged; they were recorded amidst a struggle that knew no quarter. Yet, here is a film to knot the fist and seize the heart with anger, a film that stings like a slap in the face of complacence, a scourge and lash against the delusion that there may still be an easy way out. Here is a film to lift the spirit with the courage of a people who have gone all-out.\\" The Times reviewer describes the film in detail, admitting that words are inadequate, and adds that \\"The savagery of that retreat is a spectacle to stun the mind.\\" He finds \\"infinitely more terrible\\" the sight of the atrocities, \\"the naked and slaughtered children stretched out in ghastly rows, the youths dangling limply in the cold from gallows that were rickety, but strong enough.\\" The review concludes that \\"To say that Moscow Strikes Back is a great film is to fall into inappropriate clich√©.\\" Slavko Vorkapich's editing is described as brilliant; Albert Maltz's writing as terse, Robinson's voice-over as moving, \\"but that does not tell the story of what the heroic cameramen have done\\", filming \\"amid the fury of battle\\". Awards In the USSR, the film was awarded the Stalin Prize. In America, it was one of four winners at the 15th Academy Awards for Best Documentary. It also won the National Board of Review award for best documentary in 1942 and New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best War Fact Film.

A native of New Orleans, Franko studied the violin in Europe, working with Joseph Joachim and Henri Vieuxtemps among others. Upon his return to the United States he joined the Mendelssohn Quartet, later working with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. Franko soon grew disgusted with prejudice against American musicians, and created the American Symphony, made up entirely of American performers, in 1894. With this group he gave many American premieres. Franko also taught violin and arranged 17th- and 18th-century music, and transcribed numerous pieces for the violin. His work with old music won him accolades from the German press. His autobiography, Chords and Discords, was published in 1938, and he died in New York City in 1937. The set of cadenzas he wrote for Mozart's Violin Concerto in G-major K. 216 has become a standard part of the concert repertoire, more so than all of the numerous other cadenzas that have been written for this piece.

Life He was born in San Pedro da Mezquita, A Merca, Ourense, Galicia, a region of northwest Spain. He wrote in both Galician and Castilian, and worked as a teacher in the areas of Amoroce and Maceda (Ourense). In the impoverished Galician village atmosphere, a love- affair with pedagogy began, which would be the great passion of his life. In 1932 he was the director of a pedagogical magazine Escuela del Trabajo (School of Work), published by A.T.E.O. (Ourense Teachers Association), of which he was president. The magazine had a successful two-year run, with twenty-six published editions, and caused an authentic revolution within the education system, which was anchored in the old methods of the time. Nu√±ez imposed on this system a distinctively technical and pedagogical character, rejecting the old methods of memorisation and excessive intellectualism completely. He introduced methods from the new school, based on the latest pedagogical doctrines, and worked tentatively, yet steadily towards their establishment. It was the beginning of the introduction of new pedagogical techniques to schools in Ourense, and Nu√±ez was the central figure in this change (Montessori, Kerschensteiner, Ovide Decroly, Dewey, Cousinet, etc.). Headmaster at ¬´Concepci√≥n Arenal¬ª school, in A Coru√±a, he continued developing the new scholastic techniques, establishing \\"new aims\\" of the education and orienting the social work of the school towards those aims. But The Spanish Civil War truncated his humanitarian aspirations. From 1936 on he became dedicated to deprived education, first in Lugo, and later in Orense, where he founded, in 1949 the center for the study of \\"Estudios Galicia\\". The interest of this center was mainly the special attention dedicated to the formation of teachers who would soon take the new techniques of education to their classrooms. In August 1959 he was reinstated, first as a teacher and soon after as school headmaster, holding his last position in A Estrada (Pontevedra). The primary school of Casardomato (Ourense) was named after him by city council agreement (1980). Works Although most of the work of Albino N√∫√±ez Dom√≠nguez remains unpublished, some interesting works can be mentioned: * Parnaso Galaico (1956) * Musa Galega (1957) * A nosa fala (1958) * Maruxa ou a femineidade' (1958) * Grandezas e miserias da nosa terra (1959) * Nin lendas negras nin historias brancas (1962) * Toponimia galaica (1965) * Romance de Castrelo de Mi√±o He also wrote the book Temas de pedagog√≠a (Ourense, 1963), where his educative ideals are gathered, based on his personal experiences and deep readings of the most important pedagogy experts of the time. He defended active and functional schooling, respect and freedom of pupils and advocated the heuristic-socratic method as the most suitable to achieve scientific knowledge. AsAside from his educative work, N√∫√±ez Dom√≠nguez made geographic studies, research into toponymy and literature, collaborated assiduously with the press -La Regi√≥n, La Voz de Galicia, Faro de Vigo, ', Lar, ', ABC, ', Irmandade (Caracas) ...- and translated poems by Antonio Machado to Galician.

Established in 1961, KKIN is owned and operated by Jimmy D. Birkemeyer's R & J Broadcasting. History KKIN started out as a station that plays old time country music from the 1940s to the 1970s with such artists as Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Hank Williams. Now that is the music that is played on KKIN-FM (94.3 FM). Around circa the mid 1990s, in spite of the increase of older people in the area, the station had switched to an adult standards format. The station was built around 1961 by Fred Moegle, who previously had his own children's show called The Fred Moegle Show that aired for a few years in the 1950s before moving his family to Aitkin, MN and building KKIN. Fred ran the station for several years. KKIN was an affiliate of America's Best Music and Music Of Your Life format. In recent years, circa 2010, the format has changed to feature less big bands and traditional standards, to a more or less oldies/soft adult contemporary format playing softer music that was popular from the 1960s to today that is targeted to the more mature listening audience, age 45 and older. Some 1940s and 1950s music is still played on KKIN but it is not as prominent as it was in the previous decades. The station is also one of the few in the country, along with Radio Disney that are still broadcasting in AM Stereo. On August 4, 2014 KKIN changed their format to sports, with programming from NBC Sports Radio. On September 16, 2016, Red Rock Radio announced that it would sell KKIN to R & J Broadcasting as part of an eight station deal; the sale was completed on December 21, 2016. On August 1, 2017 KKIN changed their format from sports to adult standards.Northpine.com In late 2019, KKIN-AM along with its FM translation 103.1 FM has rebranded itself once again as \\"The Gobbler\\", playing oldies and classic hits from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

The building in which the school is located was designed by the architect C.B.J. Snyder and built in 1913. The original building is eight stories high, though the extension on 16th Street designed by Walter C. Martin and built in 1938, is eleven stories high. The school had been located on Lafayette Street, but because the student population was growing at a rapid rate, a decision was made to move the school to another location, and land was purchased at 40 Irving Place. The school started out as a branch of Wadleigh High School, known at first as Girls' Technical High School, the first school for girls in the city. In 1913 the name changed to Washington Irving.

His brother was violinist and conductor Sam Franko. Biography Franko was born in New Orleans on July 23, 1861. He studied the violin in Europe with Joseph Joachim and August Wilhelmj. He became an orchestral violinist, playing with leading American and European orchestras; he later became the first American-born conductor to work at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Nahan Franko made his debut in 1869 at Steinway Hall, and subsequently toured with Adelina Patti as a child prodigy. After studying with Joachim and Wilhelmj in Berlin, he returned home and played with various orchestras, becoming concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in 1883, a position he retained until 1907. On November 30, 1904, he made his debut as conductor with the company, leading Le Nozze di Figaro‚Äîthe first native-born American to conduct with the company. Other works Franko conducted were Rom√©o, Faust, Zigeunerbaron, Die Fledermaus, Hansel und Gretel, Il Trovatore, Don Giovanni, and two ballets, Copp√©lia and Bayer's Puppenfee, as well as numerous Sunday-evening concerts. He conducted 68 performances at the Met, and 33 performances with the company elsewhere. He conducted approximately 67 opera performances and 9 dance works. The remaining were Metropolitan concerts. As third conductor and concertmaster in 1904-05, he was paid $4045. Beginning in 1908, he led open-air concerts in Central Park, and it was largely through his efforts to make good music popular by performing these al fresco concerts did NYC and the Metropolitan Opera begin the habit of performing free outdoor performances. Franko celebrated his golden jubilee with a concert at the Hippodrome. Nahan continued public and private performances with his orchestra for nearly two decades. Married three times, Franko's first wife was Edith Edwards whom he wed and divorced at a young age. On 7.3.1895 he married Cornelia Anna Ruppert (b. 6.21.1865) and became her widower on 12.3.1896.

Plot summary The story is set in 1964 in and around Los Angeles, California. Jim Hastings is a young boy who lives with his uncle, Edward St. Ives; Jim's father suffered a nervous breakdown upon his wife's death and has been institutionalized ever since. Jim is increasingly puzzled by a series of strange events that seem to happen around his friend Giles \\"Gill\\" Peach who, like his father and forefathers before him, has gills. The boys are fascinated by pulp science fiction, and Gill begins building a device inspired by the \\"subterranean prospector\\" described in Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel At the Earth's Core. Jim's father William, who periodically escapes the psychiatric facility run by Hilario Frosticos, is convinced that Gill is being manipulated by unscrupulous adventurers allied with Frosticos: a hollow earth conspiracy. This is discounted as paranoia by St. Ives, Russell Latzarel, Roycroft Squires, and William Ashbless, all members of the Newtonian Society, an alternative science-oriented social club. However, as events unfold it appears that William's worst fears have a bizarre truth behind them, and the ideas described in Gill's diaries are more than weird tales. Clues found by William lead St. Ives and Latzarel to sewers connected to an underground river, mermen, bizarre technology, and a longevity serum based on carp. Together with Jim, the four men try to outmaneuver Frosticos in the race to reach a not- quite unimaginable goal.

Jeffrey Collins Senator Jeffrey Collins is a Republican senator from Georgia; the disappearance of his wife. Throughout the series, he wavers in his decision whether to confirm Judge Wallace Rainer to the Supreme Court or not, believing he is part of the conspiracy and is using her to make him confirm Rainer. When he believed that Sara was killed, he stood firm in his stance to not confirm him; however, Agent Graham Kelton informed him that the murder scene was staged. Believing that he was going to vote against crunchy, one of the kidnappers named Morrel threatened to kill Sara right in front of his eyes, but the shot turned out to be a blank, but more importantly, a warning to confirm Rainer. Jeffrey does so, but is astounded when doesn't get the call from the kidnappers informing him where Sara will be released. Agent Lucas then tells him that the whole kidnapping was a wider plot whose main objective was to release a death-row criminal who could decipher an important message for the kidnappers. Marcy Collins Marcy Collins is the daughter of Senator Jeffrey Collins and step daughter of the missing Sara Collins. Her boyfriend, Ben Wilson, is arrested as part of the Sara Collins disappearance. Marcy plays a part in the capturing of Ben, but then helps him get bail, after she thinks that he was set up. Her mother gives her the money to bail him out. She was pregnant, but she miscarried. She believes that Wallace Rainer caused the miscarriage by slipping her an abortifacient. She only tells her boyfriend Ben that the father could possibly be Wallace Rainer after she miscarries. Max Collins Max Collins is the son of Senator Jeffrey Collins and stepson of the missing Sara Collins. He is played by John Patrick Amedori. Max is a troubled teen, and after getting caught stealing and crashing one of his father's limousines Sara sent him to a home for troubled teens. Later in the series, a video showing his dislike of Sara is played in her cell, although it is unknown whether the kidnappers made that or if it is truly authentic. Sara Collins Sara Collins is the second wife of Senator Jeffrey Collins, and her disappearance spurs the events that drive the plot of the series. She is portrayed by Joanne Kelly. Sara, before her abduction, was a Kindergarten teacher. She met Jeffrey Collins when he visited the school as part of his senatorial campaign. After the event Jeffrey asked her out on a date. While his campaign often interfered with their schedule, Jeffrey eventually proposed to Sara. She accepted and they got married. Many people then credited with Jeffrey's subsequent win to his marriage to Sara, since more people were able to relate to him. Later, she became an owner of a charity centered towards helping troubled children. Before she disappeared, she sent her stepson, Max, to a home for troubled teens. Unbeknownst to Jeffery, this was the same place that she was sent to as a teenager. While there she was tortured, but was later able to escape. Following Sara's abduction, the FBI opened an investigation, with Special Agent Graham Kelton called in to head the case. They soon discover that Sara's abduction is part of a wider conspiracy. While being held people try to turn her against Jeffrey for unknown reasons. When the FBI discovers where she is being held and storms the place, she escapes into the forest, not knowing that it was the FBI who had come for her. She soon meets a highway patrol cop and tells him who she is. When told the FBI investigation team instructed him not to let her talk with her family, she is stunned, but still lets the police officers to take her to the local police department where she is given a meal and told to rest until the FBI team comes. However, the kidnappers are able to track her with a device that was implanted into Sara's arm while she was in captivity. They dress up as FBI officers and go to the police department and shoot everyone there. Sara sees this and the FBI uniforms and flees. At a local gas station, she discovers the tracking device. Using a piece of glass she was able to remove it. Sara then sought refuge in a suburban home, but later discovered that the mother wanted to alert the FBI for the reward money involved. Thinking the FBI wanted to kidnap her again, she escapes once again, this time buying a train ticket heading home. She then goes to her former fianc√©, Peter Manning, telling him she had \\"no other place to go.\\" They then embrace. Sara's ultimate fate, due to the ending of the series, is unknown. Graham Kelton Graham Kelton was the lead FBI investigator in the disappearance of Sara Collins. He was played by Gale Harold. Before the Collins case he helped find Nathen Miller, grandson of Supreme Court judge Gil Prescott, however while delivering 1,000,000 dollars to the kidnapper, the kidnapper pulled an explosive control killing Nathen Miller and critically injuring Kelton. He spent almost a year in the hospital for a crushed lung a broken skull and a serious head trauma, leaving him in a coma for 4 months. He returned to work 2 weeks before Sara Collins vanished. When it was believed that Sara Collins was dead, Kelton was forced to take a leave of absence from his position. After realizing that Sara was alive, Kelton tried to alert Senator Collins but was shot five times by a man named Evil Ben Franklin. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. The last thing he saw before he died was a hallucination of Sara over him. He received FBI honors after his death, including having his picture added to the Wall of Martyrs. In the television show Bones a character named Graham Kelton is called \\"a creep\\" by Special Agent Seeley Booth. Graham Kelton had apparently the best chair at the F.B.I., however, like Graham Kelton, this turned out to be a dud. This is likely a reference to Vanished, seeing as creator Josh Berman was also a writer on Bones. Daniel Lucas Daniel Lucas, portrayed by Eddie Cibrian, is the Special Supervisory Agent for the FBI Criminal Investigations Unit, a group located at the agency's Washington D.C. headquarters. He is an old acquaintance of FBI investigator Agent Graham Kelton, as they graduated from the FBI's training academy together. After Kelton was murdered by Edward Morell, Lucas transferred himself to Atlanta to lead the investigation in the Sara Collins case and bring Kelton's murderer to justice. Lin Mei Lin Mei, portrayed by Ming-Na, is an FBI Agent stationed in the Atlanta, Georgia office and investigated the disappearance of Sara Collins. Mei is a field agent who was partnered with Agent Graham Kelton until his death. Even though she was offered the choice to leave, she decided to remain on the case. She then joined up with new lead investigator Agent Daniel Lucas. Throughout the rest of the series, she expressed the desire to avenge Graham's death, and even tried to once with no results. She often acts as a backup. Judy Nash Judy Nash is a reporter investigating the disappearance of Sara Collins. She is played by Rebecca Gayheart. Adam Putnam Adam Putnam is a cameraman working with Judy Nash investigating the missing Sara Collins, and is also her lover. He later breaks up with her when she shows distrust in him and is never seen again. He is played by Robert Hoffman. Michael Tyner Michael Tyner served as the head of the FBI's Atlanta headquarters as well as an overseer to the Sara Collins case throughout the series' run. He often let the investigation into the Sara Collins case go unhindered, but when Graham Kelton disobeyed a direct order not to communicate with the media without his permission, he nearly fired Graham. In a plot twist in the last episode, it is revealed that he is part of the Masonic group after Sara Collins. Ben Wilson Ben Wilson is the erstwhile boyfriend of Marcy Collins. He is played by Christopher Egan. Ben has a criminal record; he spent 4 years in juvenile hall for beating up and robbing a man, 3 months for vandalism and 8 years for drug dealing. His parents died in a shipwreck when he was 4. Ben met Marcy while working as a cater-waiter for a Christmas party at the Collins estate. Ben was arrested on suspicion of being involved in Sara's disappearance, He was bailed out of jail by Marcy's mother, although the money came from Senator Collins' deputy as a payoff for Marcy's mother to disappear. Marcy told Ben that she was pregnant with his child, although it appears the father could also have been Judge Wallace Rainer, as he and Marcy had had a sexual relationship some months before. At the end of the last episode he broke into Wallace Rainer's townhouse and shot him 3 times in the heart.

Hurricane Wilma developed on October 15, 2005 in the Caribbean Sea, and after initially organizing slowly it explosively deepened to reach peak winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and a record-low pressure of 882 mbar (hPa). It weakened and struck eastern Mexico as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and accelerated northeastward to make landfall on southwestern Florida on October 24\\\\. After crossing the state, Wilma briefly restrengthened in the open Atlantic Ocean, moving north of The Bahamas before weakening and later becoming an extratropical cyclone. On October 24, Hurricane Wilma made its closest approach to The Bahamas, passing about 150 km (90 mi) north-northwest of Freeport. While passing the archipelago, Wilma produced hurricane-force winds and powerful storm surge, flooding southwestern coastal areas of Grand Bahama and destroying hundreds of buildings. Damage totaled about $100 million (2005 USD), almost entirely on the western half of the island. Central Grand Bahama, including the Freeport area, reported minor to moderate damage, while the eastern end received little to no damage. One child died on the island from the flooding. Elsewhere in the Bahamas, moderate damage occurred on Abaco and Bimini, while islands further to the south reported minimal wind damage. Preparations At 1200 UTC on October 23, about 24 hours before Wilma made its closest approach to the archipelago, the government of The Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama, and New Providence. The government of The Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion, though many failed to fully prepare, believing Wilma would pass through the region as a tropical storm. Many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters, as well. Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island, and established multiple shelters on the island. Evacuations were minimal; it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left. As most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane, hardware stores and food markets were generally well-stocked. Impact On Grand Bahama Island, Wilma produced sustained winds of 155 km/h (95 mph) and a gust of 178 km/h (111 mph). The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3.7 m (12 ft), reportedly as high as 6.1 m (20 ft) along the southwestern portion of the island. The surge, which moved about 305 m (1,000 ft) inland, caused large-scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800 homes. Damage was estimated at $100 million (2005 USD) on the western portion of the island. Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama, the majority of the island reported minor wind damage, and the eastern end of the island reported little, or no, damage. Over 7,000 people on the island were directly affected by the hurricane, many of whom had not fully recovered from hurricanes Frances and Jeanne during the previous year. Damaged homes in Freeport Significant damage was reported in coastal areas of Grand Bahama Island, with widespread destruction of roofs and vehicles, along with downed poles and trees. Power and telephone services were disrupted throughout the island. A total of 400 structures sustained damage, of which about 200 commercial buildings were severely damaged and recommended by engineers not to be repaired. Among the destroyed buildings were a police station on the western end and several buildings in Freeport. More than 500 automobiles were flooded, including five police cars. The storm surge also raised 54 corpses in five graveyards on the island. Several resorts were closed for an extended period of time, all on the western portion of the island. One hotel, the Xanadu Beach and Marine Resort, reported about $3.5 million in damage (2005 USD), including numerous destroyed windows designed to withstand hurricane- force winds. Further to the east, numerous houses and commercial buildings lost their roofs in the city of Freeport. One serious traffic accident occurred when the winds overturned a bus, inflicting injuries on the driver. Several other traffic accidents were reported in the area, although none were severe. During the passage of the hurricane, five cases of looting were reported, of which one person was caught in the process. Storm surge from the hurricane killed one child, the only casualty directly related to Wilma in the archipelago. Damage was also heavy on Bimini island, where heavy rainfall and powerful storm surge damaged homes, trees, and utility poles. On the island, the hurricane severely damaged a hotel and eight waterfront homes. On Abaco, eight homes and a governmental clinic were destroyed. The storm surge destroyed a government dock and caused flooding and beach erosion near the coast. New Providence and the Berry Islands also reported minor wind damage from Wilma, primarily to downed trees and power lines. Throughout the Bahamas, Wilma damaged public infrastructure such as schools, roads, health clinics, and electrical systems. Aftermath Fallen trees in the Freeport area By about two days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800 residents on Grand Bahama remained in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500 affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500 families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005 USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005 USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans. Electricians had power restored to the Freeport area by the day after the storm, and had power restored to most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane. Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs, and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000‚Äì4,000 people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340 kg (750 lb) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico left many tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By about three weeks after the hurricane, the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane.

He then devoted himself to the management of his estates and rural sports and occasionally published essays on rural economy, controversial articles on political science and economics, sporting sketches signed \\"Venator\\" and \\"Piscator\\" and poems, and he delivered many addresses before agricultural societies. His letters against secession, signed \\"Agricola\\" and published in 1851, were among his latest expressions of opinion upon political subjects. He died in Charleston in 1863. Works He contributed largely to the periodical press of the south, especially the Southern Review. His published works include: * Address before the St. Paul's Agricultural Society (Charleston, 1850) * Carolina Sports by Land and Water, a collection of sporting sketches originally contributed to one of the newspapers of Charleston, South Carolina (1856) * Fiesco, a tragedy (1850) ReferencesExternal links 1788 births 1863 deaths 19th- century American people 19th-century American writers American agricultural writers American male non-fiction writers American columnists Harvard College alumni People from Beaufort, South Carolina 19th-century American male writers ","title":"William Elliott (writer)"},{"id":"9562936","text":"Authority to wear the British War Medal and the Mercantile Marine Medal issued to Minnie Mason for service on English Channel ferries in World War I The Mercantile Marine War Medal was established in 1919 and awarded by the Board of Trade of the United Kingdom to mariners of the British Mercantile Marine (later renamed the Merchant Navy)First formal use of title 'Merchant Navy' came with the appointment of the Prince of Wales as Master of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets in 1928 for service at sea during the First World War.The Mercantile Marine War Medal ‚Äì 1914‚Äì1918 (Access date 30 March 2015)Mackay, J and Mussel, J (eds) ‚Äì Medals Yearbook ‚Äì 2007, Token Publishing. p175.The Great War 1914‚Äì1918 ‚Äì A Guide to British Campaign Medals of WW1 Institution Between 5 August 1914, the day following the British declaration of war against the German Empire, and the armistice of 11 November 1918, 2,479 British merchant vessels and 675 British fishing vessels were lost as a result of enemy action, with respectively 14,287 and 434 lives lost.

Early and family life Jones was born enslaved in Charleston, South Carolina, and named after his father, Jehu Jones Sr., a tailor who bought his freedom (along with that of his wife, Jehu's mother, Abigail) in 1798, and eventually became a successful real estate investor and innkeeper in Charleston.http://www.blackpast.org/aah/jones-jehu-sr-1769-1833 Because of his mixed race ancestry, Jehu Jones was able to join Charleston's relatively privileged mulatto elite; his father bought his first slave in 1807. Jones took over his father's tailoring business circa 1816, as his father concentrated his own energies on a hotel which he opened to cater to white travellers. Although originally connected with the Episcopal Church, Jones Jr. joined the Lutheran Church and became of member of Charleston's St. John's Lutheran congregation in 1820.http://www.blackpast.org/aah/jones-jehu- jr-1786-1852 However, after the Denmark Vesey conspiracy of 1822, South Carolina increasingly restricted the civil rights even of free blacks. His brother Edward Jones, became the first black college graduate, eventually immigrating to Freetown, Sierra Leone to become the first principal of Fourah Bay College. African American Registry:From slavery to ministry, Jehu Jones! citing Marvin Andrew McMickle, An Encyclopedia of African American Christian Heritage (Judson Press 2002) Ministry In 1832, with the encouragement of his pastor, Rev. John Bachman, Jones traveled to New York for ordination as a missionary by the New York Synod, having accepted a job as a missionary to Liberia. There, he was to work with freed slaves sent by the American Colonization Society who emigrated to that new nation. However, Jones did not reach Liberia, for upon his return to Charleston after ordination, he was briefly jailed for violating South Carolina's new law (passed after Nat Turner's slave rebellion) which increased the prohibition on free blacks from returning to the state (which his mother Abigail had encountered after a trip to New York some time before 1827). Upon his father's death (and his own release from jail) in 1833, Jones received his inheritance and moved to Philadelphia. In June, the Lutheran Church there appointed Jones as a missionary to the city's black population, already served by St. Thomas' Episcopal Church. Shortly thereafter, his St. Paul's Lutheran congregation decided to build a church, and with the assistance of nearby Lutheran congregations, bought two lots on Quince Street.The original address of 150 S. Quince Street was renumbered in the 1850s to 310 S. Quince Street. http://articles.philly.com/1998-02-22/news/25754844_1_storefront-church- evangelical-lutheran-church-pastor-jones After raising about 40% of the funds needed, in 1836, Rev. Jones and fellow Lutheran pastors Philip Mayer and Benjamin Keller dedicated the new building. However, three years later, approximately $1300 was still owed on the mortgage, which was foreclosed and sold at auction. The building now is The Mask and Wig Club. Jones remained active in the Philadelphia African American congregation, as well as Pennsylvania politics and the national Colored Conventions Movement through at least 1851, the year before his death. In 1845, he helped organize a convention to unite freed blacks to petition for civil rights. He and the St. Paul's congregation were also active in the Moral Reform and Improvement Society, a group of African-American churches whose goal was to improve the social conditions for blacks in Philadelphia. Jones also founded Lutheran Churches (with congregations of all races) in Gettysburg and Chambersburg. Death and legacy The Lutheran Church remembers Jones (and his priestly service) annually in the Calendar of Saints on November 24, with Justus Falckner and William Passavant. The year following his death, the Methodist Church ordained fellow Charleston native turned Pennsylvania Daniel Payne (who had studied at the Lutheran seminary in Gettysburg circa 1835 but had never been ordained by that church, instead joining the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1842) its first African-American bishop (the Lutheran Calendar remembers Payne, who helped found Wilberforce University in Ohio in 1856, on November 2). Although the St. Paul's congregation dissolved a few years after Jones's death, its former building remains standing in Philadelphia.

Suspects The four original suspects are: *Abdul Basit Abu-Lif√¢, born June 1989 in Br√∏ndby Strand, of Palestinian background with dual Danish- Jordanian citizenship. Apparently the most active of the four, he was preparing to join Bektasevic in Sarajevo. His father discovered his plans and took away his passport and therefore he was replaced by Cesur. He is said to be very intelligent and a good, but quiet student. He received a seven-year sentence, but was released on parole in 2010. After his release Abu-Lifa legally changed his name to Isaac Meyer. In 2013, he re-appeared in Danish headlines after he assaulted Islam critical teen poet Yahya Hassan. He received a five-month sentence.Mand id√∏mmes fem m√•neders f√¶ngsel for overfaldet p√• Yahya Hassan, Politiken, 9 December 2013. *A 20-year-old man from Br√∏ndby. A Bosnian who emigrated with his family to Denmark in 1993. He was studying industrial technology at the Technical School of Copenhagen. His family was concerned over his radicalization. *19-year-old young man from Frederiksberg in central Copenhagen. He was studying at the time of arrest and worked at the telecompany TDC. He started to take an interest in Islam during his second year in high school. Reported to have visited Syria in 2005. *16-year-old minor from N√∏rrebro. He is of Moroccan background and grew up in Denmark. Two additional suspects in their early 20s were arrested two days later after approaching the police. The two, a man and his girlfriend, has been living in an apartment owned by the sister of one of the suspects arrested previously. The two were released without charges on November 29. On November 1 a 22-year-old man was arrested. He was convicted for sending a death threat to a political organization. He voluntarily submitted to psychiatric treatment. Charges Three of the four original suspects attracted security service attention when they traveled to London to visit Omar Bakri. They went together to the same mosque in N√∏rrebro in Copenhagen. According to reports they hated society and were introverted. The four also attended the al-Tawhid study circle, organized by Abu Ahmed, in which he spoke against democracy and integration. The four original suspects had been in contact with Cesur and Bektasevic during the summer of 2005. According to news reports the four had been considered a terror attack in downtown Copenhagen. The N√∏rreport train and Metro station, and Field‚Äôs and Fisketorvet shopping malls were all primary targets. One of the suspects had been detained two weeks prior to his arrest for 'behaving suspiciously' outside a football stadium in Br√∏ndby. An Israeli team was supposed to play in the stadium and police suspected he might have been planning an attack there. Evidence Among the evidence were taped telephone calls and internet communication supposedly connecting the four to the Bosnian investigation. The four had used different names and call signs, making the investigation a complicated one. Searches at the residences of the four suspects disclosed 200000 Danish kroner (~35,000 USD) in cash and a substantial collection of Islamist propaganda material. Prosecutors also had a taped conversation, apparently between Abdul Basit Abu-Lifa and Maximus in which Abu-Lifa says \\"We‚Äôre trying to find a place but it‚Äôs too risky\\". In many of the taped conversations, the suspects says they will continue their conversation by internet. The suspects refused to talk to police. Trial The trial started on Dec. 6th, 2006. A jury found all four guilty of planning terror attacks. On Feb. 15th, 2007 a panel of judges overturned the verdict for three of the suspects, due to insufficient evidence. The guilty verdict for the fourth suspect, 17-year-old Abdul Basit Abu-Lifa, was upheld. Abu-Lifa was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Later in 2007 the public prosecutor in Copenhagen decided to proceed with a re-trial for one of the 3 suspects whose conviction had been overruled by the judges. The trial was scheduled to commence in January 2008.

The film was directed by James Whale and stars Louis Hayward as royal twins, Joan Bennett as Princess Maria Theresa, Warren William as d'Artagnan, and Joseph Schildkraut as Nicolas Fouquet. British actor Peter Cushing made his screen debut in a minor part.TV.com review Plot In 1638, King Louis XIII of France is delighted when his wife bears him a son, Louis, the heir to the throne. However, a few minutes later, a second son is born. Colbert (Walter Kingsford), the king's trusted adviser, persuades the king to secretly send the second child, Philippe, away to Gascony to be raised by his majesty's dear friend, d'Artagnan (Warren William), in order to avert a possible civil war later. Fouquet (Joseph Schildkraut), a mere cardinal's messenger at the time, finds out about the twin and uses this to advance his career. Twenty years later, he is the Minister of Finance under Louis XIV. The king is hated by the commoners for levying oppressive taxes and for executing them for not paying them. Fouquet sends soldiers to force d'Artagnan and his people to pay the taxes, though the old king had exempted him and his village from them. They are driven off, but return in much greater numbers and, with great difficulty, capture d'Artagnan, the three musketeers and Philippe. Louis is about to order their executions when Colbert tells him about Philippe's uncanny resemblance to him. As Louis is aware of an assassination attempt to take place that day (but not where or when), he makes Philippe impersonate him in exchange for his friends' lives. Philippe not only survives the ambush, he shows mercy to his would-be killers and is cheered by the people. Princess Maria Theresa (Joan Bennett), whom Louis is to wed to seal an alliance with Spain, finds this new Louis much more attractive than the real one. However, when she discovers that Louis is having an affair with Mademoiselle de la Valliere (Marion Martin), she returns to Spain. When the truth is discovered, Louis has Philippe imprisoned with an iron mask placed on his head, hoping that Philippe's beard will grow inside the mask and eventually suffocate him. Philippe is rescued by the musketeers, who break into the sleeping Louis's chamber and imprison him in the mask. The musketeers drag him away and lock him in the Bastille, where the jailers mistake him for Phillippe, and whip him. When Louis manages to get a message to Fouquet, he is freed, and a chase by coach ensues to stop Philippe from marrying Maria Theresa and taking Louis' place on the throne. The coach is waylaid by the musketeers, who all die heroically, but Fouquet and the real Louis XIV are also killed when the driverless coach plunges off a cliff.

James Whale was signed as director in September 1938. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., whose father had starred as D'Artagnan in the 1929 epic version The Iron Mask, was originally announced as male star and met with director James Whale. However producer Edward Small insisted on Louis Hayward, who had just made The Duke of West Point for him. Louis Hayward played D'Artagnan in a gender-switched 1952 remake entitled Lady in the Iron Mask with Patricia Medina in the titular role and Alan Hale, Jr. as Porthos, the part his father Alan Hale, Sr. had portrayed in the 1939 version. In what may have been another instance of stunt casting, Hale Jr. played Porthos in the 1979 film The Fifth Musketeer (which is also based on The Man in the Iron Mask). Reception Frank S. Nugent called the film \\"a moderately entertaining costume piece\\" with \\"an overfondness for pageantry and stiff heroics.\\" He criticized the casting of Marion Martin as \\"outright absurd\\" and called her performance \\"artless\\" and \\"rather hopeless\\". Variety called the film \\"a highly entertaining adventure\\" with \\"excellent\\" direction. Harrison's Reports declared it \\"good mass entertainment\\" with a \\"charming\\" romance. Film Daily called it \\"a vivid picturization of Alexandre Dumas' novel\\" with Hayward's \\"best screen work to date.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote, \\"The piece belongs to the old school of things and the Douglas Fairbanks of 1929, but Douglas Fairbanks is not here, and the swordplay, the hard riding, the desperate escapes seem to demand him. Louis Hayward can give a modern effete touch when that is needed in the double role he has, but he can't compete with his rapier or his acrobatics.\\" Influence The first film adaptation of Dumas' novel to allow for the lasting triumph of the good twin over the evil twin was Douglas Fairbanks' 1929 version of the tale, The Iron Mask (although in this case the good twin was the one already on the throne, reared under the tutelage of D'Artagnan, and it was he who had to be rescued when the evil twin was put onto the throne). The 1939 version flips this around so that the evil twin, Louis, sits on the throne and the good twin, Phillipe, is raised by D'Artagnan and must eventually win the throne. The staging of several other scenes are borrowed from the 1929 version, most importantly the ending. The ending of the 1939 version, with the ghosting of the figures of the four musketeers together (presumably in heaven), is a direct homage to the ending of the 1929 Douglas Fairbanks' film in which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis greet D'Artagnan upon his death and they in a ghosted image head off together for the \\"greater adventure beyond.\\" Most subsequent film versions, including the 1977 version and the 1998 version, have followed the basic outline of the 1939 film (and its borrowings from the 1929 version), not of the original novel. The English band Iron Maiden was named by founder Steve Harris after seeing the film.

Career  Dobrzynski, in the 1980s, while she was at Business Week, was one of the first journalists to write about activist shareholders and the importance of good corporate governance. While Dobrzynski was an arts reporter at the New York Times, she wrote an investigative article about the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of paintings owned by Rudolph Leopold, a Viennese doctor and art collector.Dobrzynski, Judith H. \\"A Singular Passion for Amassing Art, One Way or Another\\". The New York Times, 24 December 1997. (Many of those works are now on view at the Leopold Museum in Vienna). Her article told the story of Portrait of Wally by Egon Schiele, which had been taken from its Jewish owner, Leah Bondi Jaray, in the Nazi era and later purchased by Leopold. Soon after the story was published, the Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau started proceedings to help restore the piece to descendants of its owner. After years of legal wranglings, the ownership of the painting was decided in an out-of-court settlement in July, 2010:Herrick Press Release July 20, 2010 The Leopold Museum agreed to pay Bondi's heirs $19 million for the portrait and to permanently display, wherever the painting is on view, the correct accounting of its ownership \\"including Lea Bondi Jaray‚Äôs prior ownership of the Painting and its theft from her by a Nazi agent before she fled to London in 1939.\\" A documentary about the case, called \\"Portrait of Wally,\\" made its debut in spring 2012 at the Tribeca Film Festival to favorable reviews. The Forward said the \\"film that carefully reviews the complex history of the painting.\\" The outrage that followed Dobrzynski's articles helped persuade Austria to change its laws.

E. Randol Schoenberg, who served as attorney in the famous case claiming five Gustav Klimt paintings for the heirs of Adele Bloch-Bauer, also cited Dobrzynski's 1997 article in his paper, delivered at the International Foundation for Art Research in July, 2006, saying that it changed the climate for Nazi-looted art claims. When Bettina Rothschild Looram died in 2012, the Daily Telegraph in London cited the Bondi case as a reason \\"Austria‚Äôs minister of culture had directed the country‚Äôs national museums to identify any items in their collections that had been stolen or extorted by the Nazis from the Jews.\\" Dobrzynski has also written many other articles about Nazi-looted art.

It was released in Europe with the alternative title Behind the Iron Mask. It was directed by Ken Annakin, and stars Beau Bridges as the twins (Louis XIV and Philippe of Gascony), Sylvia Kristel as Maria Theresa, Ursula Andress as Louise de La Valli√®re, Cornel Wilde as d'Artagnan, Ian McShane as Fouquet, Rex Harrison as Colbert (Philippe's tutor), and Lloyd Bridges, Jos√© Ferrer and Alan Hale Jr. as the Three Musketeers.

The film was shot in and around Vienna, Austria at locations including Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, Auersperg Palace, Votive Church, Liechtenstein Castle and Kreuzenstein Castle. Sylvia Kristel's lines were reportedly dubbed in by another actress. She was paid $300,000. The cinematographer was Jack Cardiff. In what may have been an instance of stunt casting, Alan Hale Jr. played the same character, Porthos, that his lookalike father, Alan Hale Sr., did in The Man in the Iron Mask (1939). This film was rated PG on release. Release The film was not released for a number of years. It was felt this was due in part in the financial failure of another movie made by the Austrian production company, Sacha-Wien Films, A Little Night Music. It was also due to the fact that The Man in the Iron Mask had aired on television. Eventually the film's title was changed to The Fifth Musketeer although the final movie had no affiliation with the hit Richard Lester films The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers other than their all being based on Dumas stories, the title was chosen to capitalize on the recent success of those films and inform audiences that it was the same characters involved in the plot. Reception=Critical Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"Though 'The Fifth Musketeer' is loaded with intrigue, duels, large scale swordplay, heavy costumes and heavier d√©cor, it is singularly without style or even excitement.

Dale Pollock of Variety stated that the film \\"adds nothing new to the genre, deriving its inspiration totally from the 1939 United Artists release written by George Bruce, who is credited here along with Dumas\\", adding that director Ken Annakin \\"stifles 'The 5th Musketeer' with ornate production values, deadly earnest swordplay and dialog as moth-eaten as the peasant costumes. The result? Yawnsville.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \\"one of those big, one-star-from-every-country productions.

Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"There are some nice moments along the way from a largely nostalgic cast and some reasonably sumptuous settings, with the Schoenbrunn Palace standing in for Versailles. However, since Ken Annakin's direction and David Ambrose's script are uninspired, 'The Fifth Musketeer' tends to be plodding.\\" Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail asked, \\"How does a movie this bad ever get made? ... actors recite their lines in a dull monotone and the direction is absolutely wooden; the reaction shots are so studied that one can almost hear the director counting out.

He coached at the University of Alabama from 1981 to 1992 and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock from 1994 to 1999. Sanderson was born in Florence, Alabama. He prepped at Coffee High School and graduated from Florence State College, now known as the University of North Alabama, in 1959. In 1960 he became a graduate assistant under Hayden Riley at Alabama, and in 1961 he was made a full-time assistant. He served in this capacity for 20 years under both Riley and C. M. Newton, eventually becoming Newton's top assistant. When Newton resigned to become assistant commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, Sanderson was named his successor. In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267‚Äì119 record, and they won 5 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and ten NCAA tournaments making the Sweet 16 six times. He is only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987. Sanderson was known for wearing plaid sport jackets on the sidelines. During his tenure at Alabama, the Coleman Coliseum was known as the \\"Plaid Palace\\" (with its midcourt logo painted crimson-and-white plaid), the Million Dollar Band was known as the \\"Plaid Players\\", and many fans came to games wearing plaid in Sanderson's honor. Early life and playing career Winfrey Sanderson was named for his uncle, Hayes Winfrey, who died from kidney problems in his twenties after he blocked a punt in his stomach during a high school football game. His father, who worked for an auto parts company, died when he was six, and Sanderson, an only child, shared an apartment with his mother, Christine, a secretary for the Veterans Administration. During his senior year in high school, he became class president. In 1955, Sanderson went to Abilene Christian College to play basketball. He planned to go into radio and television, but flunking Spanish soured his plans. He transferred home to Florence State (now the University of North Alabama) and continued his hoops career while graduating in physical education. He took a high school head coaching job in Carbon Hill, Alabama and one year later, in 1959‚Äì60, he went to Alabama as a graduate assistant under Hayden Riley for $75 a month. Sanderson figured it was a stepping stone for a better high school job. \\"When he was hired, Wimp felt a tremendous amount of pressure\\", said his wife, Annette. \\"He had his doubters. People wondered, 'Why did they ever hire Wimp?'\\" Sanderson played his freshman season of college basketball at Abilene Christian before transferring back to Florence State. In three seasons with the Lions, from 1957 to 1959, he scored 1,076 points and averaged 14.9 points over his 72-game career. He was named team captain as both a junior and a senior and led the Lions in scoring in 1958 with 403 points. His best single- game performance came against Jacksonville State University in 1958 when he scored 31 points. Sanderson graduated in 1959. Coaching career=Alabama Before he resigned in 1992, Sanderson had been at Alabama for 32 years‚Äîone year as a graduate assistant, 20 as a full-time assistant and 12 as head coach. He led the Crimson Tide to 10 NCAA Tournaments and six trips to the Sweet 16. He lived 32 of his 58 years in Tuscaloosa, watching three decades of history pass from one season to another. In 1963, as Governor George Wallace stood at the schoolhouse door, Sanderson, an assistant coach without political convictions, watched from a window in a building across the street, unaware he was privy to history. Six years later, as Alabama Coach C.M. Newton became the first Southeastern Conference coach to heavily recruit African-Americans (Vanderbilt's Perry Wallace was the first African-American to play in the conference, in 1967-68), Sanderson was pounding the recruiting trail, helping to lure players like future All-American Wendell Hudson to Tuscaloosa. \\"I have a lot of respect for C.M. and Wimp,\\" says Hudson, the first African-American athlete at Alabama and now the assistant AD at Alabama. \\"I would talk to a lot of guys who came in the league at the same time as I did, who didn't have as easy of a time as I did. There were no special rules. Everyone was treated equally.\\" Sanderson's skills as a recruiter were legendary. Enticing Robert Horry, Derrick McKey and Latrell Sprewell to football-mad Tuscaloosa was considered remarkable. In addition to Sprewell, Horry and McKey, eight other players recruited when Sanderson was head coach made it to the NBA, including James Robinson and David Benoit. =Scandal and resignation= Sanderson resigned from Alabama on May 18, 1992, days after Nancy Watts, his longtime secretary, filed a sexual discrimination lawsuit against him and the university with the US Equal Opportunity Commission. Both Sanderson and Watts admitted they had had an affair from about 1970 to 1985, but both offered conflicting stories about what happened on March 17, 1992. Watts said that on that day, two days before Alabama was to play Stanford in the NCAA tournament, Sanderson punched her in the face during an argument, giving her a black eye. Sanderson said Watts had become hysterical and that, in an effort to defend himself, he extended his hand and she collided with it, resulting in the injury. More than a year later, Watts' lawsuit against Sanderson, the university and then-athletic director Hootie Ingram, was settled out of court, days before it was scheduled to go to trial. Alabama and Sanderson's homeowner's insurance policy paid Watts $275,000. Sanderson's employment with the university ended after 32 years. \\"It was a situation where if you're accused of anything, you're guilty, and that's not right. I know what happened,\\" Sanderson has said. \\"I gave the university 32 years, all I could give them. Tried to do everything the right way. It was a sad day in my life. I loved the school, but it's behind me. It's over.\\" David Hobbs, a former assistant, was promoted as head coach when Sanderson resigned. Mark Gottfried, a former player under Sanderson, followed Hobbs and coached for 10-1/2 seasons before he was fired on January 26, 2009. Arkansas‚ÄìLittle Rock Sanderson resurfaced in 1994 at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. He was the Trojans' coach when they appeared in the National Invitation Tournament in 1996.

Treaty between France and Savoy This treaty, signed on March 11, 1629, following the French capture of the city, was agreed between Louis XIII of France and Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. Its terms allowed French military passage through Savoy to assist in relief of the siege of Casale in the War of the Mantuan Succession, which was to be guaranteed by French occupation of Susa. The Duke was also to refrain from hostilities against the Duchy of Mantua. In return France was to give Savoy Trino and other territory in Monferrat worth 15,000 crowns. Treaty between France and England and Scotland This treaty, signed on April 14, 1629 ended a war between England and France that had broken out in 1627. Ratified by Charles I of England and Scotland on June 11 and Louis XIII of France on July 4, it reconfirmed the terms of a marriage contract between Charles and Louis' sister Henriette Marie. Each party was allowed to retain territories captured during the conflict, but was obliged to return territories taken after the peace was agreed. This latter clause affected a number of territories taken in New France, including Quebec, which was surrendered by Samuel de Champlain in July 1629 to David Kirke and his brothers, three months after the peace was agreed, as well as other territories in Acadia (present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, then a Scottish colony, and Cape Breton Island).

It is a European-developed sequel to Capcom's arcade game Strider, which U.S. Gold previously ported to home computers in Europe. Capcom later developed their own sequel in 1999, titled Strider 2 for the arcades and PlayStation, which ignores U.S. Gold's version of Strider II. Computer versions Strider II was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Strider II was later remade for the Sega Genesis and Master System in 1992. In the computer versions of Strider II the objective of the game is to rescue the Princess of Planet Magenta from a terrorist group that is keeping her captive. The controls in the computer version are similar to U.S. Gold's home computer ports of the original Strider, although the character cannot slide nor climb ceilings like in the original game. However, he can still climb walls, as well as ropes. In addition to his cypher, he can also use a rifle whenever he is standing still. If the player character has collected enough energy icons throughout each stage, he will transform into a wheeled robot when confronting the boss at the end of each stage. As a robot, Strider can shoot lasers, but cannot jump nor crouch. His robot form has a separate health gauge from his regular health gauge as a human. When his robot gauge runs out, he will transform back to a human. The game consists of five stages. Console versions Two years after the release of the computer versions, U.S. Gold and Tiertex ported Strider II to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. In addition to its European release, Strider II was also released for the American Sega Genesis under the title of Journey from Darkness: Strider Returns. The Genesis version of Strider Returns differs from the previous computer version in several ways. While the plot is the same, the antagonist is now the Grandmaster (Meio) from the original Strider (who is referred in the game's manual as the \\"Evil Master\\"). Although the main character uses the same sprite as in the Genesis version of the original Strider, this Strider is addressed in the manual as \\"Hinjo\\" (instead of \\"Hiryu\\", the actual code name of the original protagonist). The player controls Hinjo similarly to Hiryu in the first Genesis game (with the ability to slide and move under ceilings retained). Instead of a gun like in the home computer versions, Hinjo throws shurikens but only if he collects them first. Instead of transforming into a robot when he confronts a boss, Hinjo collects orbs throughout each stage instead. These orbs will surround Hinjo and protect him when he faces the stage's boss. The player can choose between Hiryu's original cypher from the first game or a new \\"sweeping\\" cypher. Strider II was also released for the 8-bit Master System in Europe. This version features gameplay similar to its Genesis counterpart. Unlike the Genesis version, the Strider's supply of shurikens are unlimited, but he can only throw two on- screen at the same time. Due to the fewer buttons of the Master System's controller, shurikens are thrown while the player is standing still. This version was converted to the Game Gear and released in North America as Strider Returns. An Atari Lynx version was being developed and listed as 50% complete, but it was never released. Reception Matt Bielby of Your Sinclair magazine gave the game a positive review, and went so far as to claim that Capcom wanted to use the Sinclair port of this game as the basis for a coin-op sequel. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version a 6.75 out of 10, describing it as a decent but disappointing sequel. They praised the massive size of the game and the high amount of digitized voices, but criticized that the animation is much too choppy. Three of the four also felt that the gameplay lacked the excitement of the original Strider. They gave the Game Gear version a unanimous score of 7 out of 10, but were sharply divided in their opinions. Two of them felt it to be \\"surprisingly better on the Game Gear than on the Genesis\\", citing better playability with far less choppiness in the animation, while the other two felt it to be far worse than the Genesis version, complaining of both inferior graphics and the annoyingly long distance the player character is knocked back when hit. GamePro took the middle ground, saying the \\"Graphics and game play parallel the Genesis version.\\" They praised the controls, large sprites, and detailed backgrounds, but criticized the slower pace and droning soundtrack, and concluded \\"Strider fans will welcome his return, but others will shrug.\\" In a Strider series retrospective, Ken Horowitz of Sega-16.com compared Strider Returns to \\"seeing a loved one revived as a mindless zombie\\". Travis Fahs, writing a Retro feature for IGN, commented that U.S. Gold had made multiple improvements to Strider II for its console ports, but that the core problem of dull level design remained.

It occupies the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca, a mountain range which lies mostly within the state of Oaxaca, and extends north into Puebla and Veracruz states. It is one of a chain of pine‚Äìoak forest ecoregions extending along the American Cordillera from Oregon and California in the north to Nicaragua in the south. Pine Forest between San Isidro Llano Grande and San Miguel Cajonos, in the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca. Geography The ecoregion covers an area of , lying above elevation. The Sierra Madre de Oaxaca runs northeast-southwest, extending from Pico de Orizaba in the northeast to extends to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the southeast. Peaks in the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca average meters in elevation, with some peaks exceeding . The range intercepts humid air moving west from the Gulf of Mexico. Adjacent ecoregions The Gulf Coastal Plain lies to the east, and a series of river valleys separate the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca from the Sierra Madre del Sur to the southwest and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt to the northwest. The ecoregion is bounded on the east by the humid Oaxacan montane forests, which lie below elevation. To the east, the xeric Tehuacan Valley matorral occupies the Tehuacan valley to the northwest, the Jalisco dry forests occupy the upper basin of the Santo Domingo River, which lies in the rain shadow of the Sierra, and the Southern Pacific dry forests lie to the south along the Pacific coast, extending into the upper basin of the Tehuantepec River and the Valley of Oaxaca. The dry forests separate the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca pine‚Äìoak forests from the Sierra Madre del Sur pine‚Äìoak forests to the southwest. Flora The associated vegetation of the pine‚Äìoak forests varies with elevation and exposure. Besides the pines (Pinus spp.) and oaks (Quercus spp.) trees, the forests can have a great diversity of bromeliads, orchids, ferns. The communal land of the Chinantec Community of Santiago Comaltepec contains cloud forest. Fauna The forests of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca are one of the last remaining habitats with Jaguar and Puma in Mexico. People The pine‚Äìoak forests of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca have been inhabited for a millennia by indigenous cultures. The primary cultures are of the Mazatec, Zapotec, Mixe, Cuicatec, and Chinantec peoples. Rhynchostele cervantesii ssp. membranacea is one of the many orchids that inhabit the high forests of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca. Conservation and threats Some of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca pine‚Äìoak forest habitats/areas are among the better conserved forests in Mexico. However, only a small fraction its virgin/old growth forests are protected by the Federal government, within Benito Ju√°rez National Park (Parque Nacional Benito Juarez) located north of Oaxaca city. Most conservation in the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca is controlled by indigenous communities. For example, Santiago Comaltepec's vast expanse of cloud forests is considered some of the best conserved cloud forests in the world. Many communities, notably Ixtl√°n de Ju√°rez and the Pueblos Mancomunados, among others, strive to conserve their forest through projects including sustainable forestry and selective logging, ecotourism, education projects, and the prohibition of private property within their communities (thus hampering unsustainable development and industry by foreign or outside agents). The forests are under threat by foreign investment, and by mining and logging commissions to foreign companies from the Oaxaca state government.

He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on November 24 with Justus Falckner and Jehu Jones. He is also honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on January 3. Early life William Alfred Passavant was born in 1821 in Zelienople, Pennsylvania, the third and youngest son of Phillipe Louis Passavant and Fredericka Wilhelmina Basse (nicknamed \\"Zelie,\\" hence the town's name). His grandfather, Baron Dettmar Basse, born in Iserlohn in the Ruhr Valley in what was then the Grand Duchy of Hesse and later became Germany, spent a decade in Paris as a diplomat and merchant before fleeing the Napoleonic Wars and emigrating to Philadelphia and then Pittsburgh in 1801. Drawn by the prospect of religious freedom and economic opportunity, the widower Baron bought 10,000 acres along Connoquenessing Creek in Butler County, Pennsylvania, began building a stone, brick, and wood framed castle, and founded (with Christian Buhl) a new town complete with sawmill, brickyard, and an iron furnace. He also traveled and sent glowing letters back to Germany, persuading his daughter and her new husband (a French Huguenot who fled after repeal of the Edict of Nantes) to emigrate in 1807 from Frankfurt. Phillipe Passavant built a store and became the new town's first merchant. The Baron experienced financial reverses at the war's end, and eventually sold Bassenheim to Michael Beltzhoover and headed back to Germany in 1818, dying in Mannheim in 1836.https://ojs.libraries.psu.edu/index.php/wph/article/viewFile/1371/1219 at p. 22 It was resold to Mr. Saunders, who ran a Presbyterian school on the site (attended by young William Passavant as well as his lifelong friend the future Rev. George Wenzel) until it was hit by lightning and burned down on July 29, 1841. Meanwhile, the Baron had also sold half his land to the Harmonites, a pietist sect led by Johann Georg Rapp and his brother Frederick, who then founded Harmony, Pennsylvania, but eventually sold their colony to Abraham Zeigler who moved it further west, to New Harmony, Indiana.https://ojs.libraries.psu.edu/index.php/wph/article/viewFile/1371/1219 p.23Shelby Miller Ruch, Harmony (Arcadia Publishing, 2009) at p. 8 Young Passavant and Wenzel crossed the Allegheny Mountains to attend Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. In addition to his studies, Passavant taught Sunday school and sold subscriptions to the Lutherische Kirchenzeitung (published in Philadelphia beginning in 1838), as well as an English-language Reform magazine, the Observer. Realizing that he needed Wenzel's tutoring in German, and that other American-born Lutherans faced similar problems, Passavant tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Philadelphia publisher to publish a Lutheran almanac in English.Gerberding, G.H., Life and Letters of W.

Sidney Jennings.Gerberding at p. 38 After taking a year off from his studies due to the unexpected death of his eldest brother Detmar in Pittsburgh, Passavant entered the Gettysburg Seminary under Rev. Samuel Schmucker to prepare for a pastoral career.Gerberding p. 42 et seq. Among his classmates was Charles Porterfield Krauth, son of the President of Gettysburg College and who later led the neo-Lutheran movement Passavant ultimately joined.Historical roots run deep in Zelienople (Trudy M. Gray, The Tribune-Review Publishing Co. August 1, 2004) http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_205376.html There, Passavant continued his Sunday School work, and also canvassed for the Pennsylvania Bible Society, sought funds for the Protestant mission in Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended revival meetings that his father considered too Methodistic.Gerberding at pp. 53-61 Career William Passavant received his license and began his ministry as well as his publishing career in Baltimore, Maryland in 1842. Ordained in 1843, he published the Lutheran Almanac for its first two years, before passing that project to others. Another project was a Sunday School Hymn book.Gerberding at p. 103 Passavant also met his future wife, Eliza Walter, although he felt his finances were not secure enough to support a family.Gerberding at pp. 109-111 In 1844, Rev. Passavant accepted the repeated calls of a struggling Pittsburgh congregation, and after moving to that city, organized the Pittsburgh Synod. By its second meeting, he had already established six Sunday schools, some with the help of other Protestant clergy.Gerberding pp. 113-126 Pastor Passavant married Eliza Walter on May 1, 1845, shortly after his friend Krauth married, despite a fire in Pittsburgh's business district three weeks earlier which also devastated many parishioners. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon with the General Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in Philadelphia, as well as visited friends and relatives in Baltimore.Gerberding pp. 130-132 The following year, Passavant traveled to Europe as the region's delegate to the Christian Alliance in London in August 1846. He also toured historic sites in England, France and Germany, and managed to secure promises of Lutheran missionaries from Basel, Switzerland.Gerberding pp. 139-151 While in Germany, William Passavant met Pastor Theodore Fliedner who had opened a hospital and training school for deaconesses in Kaiserswerth, near D√ºsseldorf and the Basse family's traditional estates. At Passavant's request, in 1849, Fliedner brought four German deaconesses to Pittsburgh to work in the Pittsburgh Infirmary (later Passavant Hospital and merging with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center).Baden's First 100 Years (Christ Lutheran Church of Baden, PA.) http://www.oefgroup.com/34.html Gerberding at pp. 183-193 Especially after his Continental tour, William Passavant became known for addressing important social issues: including slavery before the American Civil War (in which he served as a chaplain), to the needs of German and Scandinavian immigrants and freed blacks. Passavant founded and administered a variety of benevolent institutions, particularly in his native country's industrializing cities. He noted the comparable apostolic deaconesses, as well as the Sisters of Charity (a Roman Catholic order founded by St. Vincent DePaul), the Mennonite nursing deaconesses in the Netherlands, and Elizabeth Fry's work in England.Gerberding at pp. 175-183, 250-259 The sabbatical also convinced Passavant of the importance of the Augsburg Confession in Lutheran doctrine. Although Presbyterians and Episcopalians joined in welcoming the Protestant deaconesses and the Pittsburgh hospital refused to allow proselytizing or discrimination on the basis of color or creed, and Passavant brought his Protestant deaconesses to work with Dorothea Dix in Civil War hospitals treating both Union and Confederate wounded,Gerberding pp. 307-319 Passavant broke with the pan-Protestant ethos of his former mentors Drs. Schmucker and Kurtz. The Pittsburgh Synod, following his lead, did not fully join the General Synod in 1853, despite discussions during several sessions, but reserved the right to withdraw, which it exercised in 1864.Gerberding pp. 327-350, 443-457 Moreover, in 1848 Passavant began publishing the monthly Missionary, to compete with the increasingly controversial Lutheran Observer,Gerberding pp. 194 et seq. and in 1861 merged his periodical into Krauth's The Lutheran of Philadelphia, with Passavant continuing as co-editor of the Lutheran and Missionary. After the war, in 1867 Passavant assisted Krauth in organizing the rival General Council. After his father's death in 1858, Passavant accepted a position as pastor of Christ Lutheran Church in Baden along the Ohio River, where he served for 21 years (until 1879), while also traveling, publishing and corresponding both within the United States and abroad. In 1863, he established an orphanage for girls in Rochester, Pennsylvania, in addition to the one in Zelienople, which he had established in 1854 both with a small inheritance after his sister Victoria's death and to honor their still-living mother (with whom Passavant remained close until she died in 1870). The deaconesses also taught, and worked with female prisoners in Allegheny County. Passavant founded many missions, as well as hospitals in Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Chicago, homes for epileptics at Jacksonville, Illinois and Rochester, Pennsylvania, and an orphanage as well as an old peoples' home in Mt. Vernon, New York. Beginning in 1866, Rev. Passavant and Louis Thiel worked to establish Thiel College, which the Pittsburgh Synod convention in Greensburg, Pennsylvania in 1869 approved to serve western Pennsylvania, and which formally incorporated on September 1, 1870.The History of Thiel College 1866-1974 (Dr. Roy H. Johnson. Thiel College, Greenville, Pennsylvania) http://www.thiel.edu/about_thiel One of the last institutions Passavant founded was the Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary.

His son and namesake, William Passavant, Jr., turned down an invitation to lead a Philadelphia congregation to continue his father's work, both pastoral and in editing the Workman during his lifetime. William Passavant died in his Pittsburgh home after falling ill attending a fellow pastor's funeral.Gerberding at pp. 575-588 He is buried in the cemetery of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Zelienople.

Glasper (born June 15, 1985) is a former professional Canadian football and American football safety. He was signed as a street free agent by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 2007. He played college football for the Boston College Eagles. Glasper has also been a member of the Toronto Argonauts, Edmonton Eskimos and Hartford Colonials. Early life Ryan Glasper was born in New Britain, Connecticut. At the age of 14, his mother signed legal custody of him over to his then high school football coach, Jude Kelly. Ryan attended Southington High School in Southington, Connecticut. He started on the varsity squad his sophomore year and played a pivotal role on the offense as a receiver and running back. Catching passes from quarterback Dan Bruetsch, he became a dangerous offensive weapon and showed his potential. Glasper helped the Blue Knights win the CCC South crown. As a junior, he progressed to have a greater role in the offense, as he started at wide receiver, at running back, and on special teams. Glasper helped lead his team to another CCC South title. In the beginning of his senior campaign he was asked to play quarterback with the graduation of strong-armed quarterback Doug Fink (who was later drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 29th round of the 2003 draft). Glasper eagerly took on the role and was progressing well until an ankle injury sidelined him. It was during this time that Glasper signed his letter of intent with Boston College to play safety on their defense. After signing his letter of intent, Glasper moved over to the defensive backfield full-time. While mentoring young sophomore quarterback Aaron Canterbury, Glasper helped lead the Blue Knights to a share of the CCC South title. Glasper was voted part of the tri-captain squad during his senior year with Dan Bird and John Vose. During his high school career, Glasper also returned punts and kickoffs. He set school records for longest punt return (92 yards), longest kickoff return (98 yards) and longest play from scrimmage (97 yards). He earned SuperPrep All-American honors as a senior defensive back and was voted to the All-State Class LL team, as well as 2001 New Haven Register All- State,http://www.iwasallstate.com/FallSports/Football/FootballAllStateTeams/2000s/2001/tabid/117/Default.aspx for his outstanding play. Glasper also played varsity basketball and was on the track team in high school. College career Glasper was not redshirted his freshman year at Boston College, eventually making a total of 29 starts and appearing in 45 total collegiate contests. He ended his college career with 177 career tackles, including 100 unassisted stops. He finished with six interceptions, eight pass breakups, 5.5 tackles for loss and 1.0 sack in his career. Glasper won 2 awards for the Boston College Eagles. He was awarded the Paul Cavanagh Award, for the player whose collective on and off the field accomplishments speak volumes about his commitment to balance, a level-headed and realistic outlook on life, and his wholesome perspective on volunteerism, ethics and the community; a football player whose accomplishments on the field distinguish him as an achiever and as a contributor in many ways. He was also awarded the Jay McGillis Scholarship Award, given in recognition of a defensive back who best exemplifies the personal qualities of team dedication and leadership by example, an extraordinary competitive spirit, and personal concern for family, friends and teammates. In January 2006, during 7-on-7 drills with teammates, Glasper took a false step and tore his labrum and cartilage in his left hip, requiring surgery three months later. He was not granted a medical red-shirt by the BC coaching and medical staff, forcing him to miss the first 5 games of the season or not play at all and have his college career be over. He eventually returned but was never at 100% during the season but he still was a force on the defense. By the time BC's bowl game came around on December 30, Glasper was back down to his playing weight of and notched his best game of the season. With help from his agent, Glasper got a late invitation to the Hula Bowl in January. Despite getting to Hawaii on Tuesday night, when most of the team had been there since Saturday, Glasper was tabbed as a starter after just one meeting and one practice. Professional career=NFL Glasper worked out at the Boston College Pro Day on March 21, 2007. He had a relatively good showing running his 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds. He ran a 20-yard dash in 2.66 seconds and a 10-yard dash in 1.56 seconds. Ryan also ran the 20 yard shuttle run in 4.15 seconds and maneuvered the 3-cone drill in 6.86 seconds. Ryan bench pressed a standard 14 times, had a vertical leap of , and had a leap of in the broad jump. Glasper went undrafted but attended the New York Giants rookie camp as a try-out, but was not signed to a contract. CFL In 2007, Glasper was signed by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The Ti-Cats converted Glasper from a strong safety to an outside linebacker. The move proved to be successful, as he served as a starter for the Hamilton defense. Glasper made his CFL debut on July 7 of that year. He completed the season playing in eight games, recording 27 defensive tackles, 10 special teams tackles, one forced fumble, 2 tackles for losses, and two pass knockdowns. In 2008, Glasper dressed in the first 10 games of the Tiger-Cats' season, recording 30 defensive tackles and five special teams tackles. He was eventually released by the Tiger-Cats on September 30, 2008. On October 15, Glasper was signed by the Toronto Argonauts to a practice roster agreement. He was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos on May 4, 2009. He was released on June 25, 2009. UFL Glasper was signed by the Hartford Colonials on June 15, 2010. He was released on November 6.

It is the opening track on the group's debut studio album, Cheshire Cat (1995). The song originated during the first jam session between band members guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus. The song has been a staple of the band's live performances since its inception. \\"Carousel\\" was later included as the only non-single on the band's Greatest Hits. Background The origins of \\"Carousel\\" lie in the first jam session between guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus in August 1992. The two were introduced by Hoppus' sister, Anne, and met in DeLonge's garage. For hours, the two practiced the songs DeLonge had written (collected in a red notebook) and Hoppus' compositions. By the end of the night, the two had formed the basis of \\"Carousel\\"; \\"Instantly, I felt like we had the same musical style; he just had it on a different instrument than me,\\" DeLonge said. The song was first recorded for the band's third demo, which came to be known as Buddha, released in January 1994 and distributed via cassette. The song was recorded once more, in a slightly different arrangement, on the band's debut, Cheshire Cat, issued in February 1995. The song remains a staple of the band's live performances, and has become a crowd favorite.Hoppus, 2001. p. 11 \\"I felt massively enamored with how the kids reacted to [performing the song],\\" DeLonge told Rolling Stone in 2013, following the band's show at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg. \\"I got soaked into their enthusiasm last night, trying to figure out why that song is still around.\\" When asked if he still felt a connection to the song, two decades after its recording, he responded: \\"It's a love-hate thing. To me, it was a philosophical kind of question: How did we have one of our first songs, if not our first? How do you feel not a part of it? I always feel I wish I wrote better lyrics, yet at the time it was so different for pop-punk. It was, like, so fast.\\" Music The song is composed in the key of D major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 148 beats per minute. DeLonge's vocal range spans from A4 to G5.

The Institution approaches the education process with a lenient model of teachers as counsellors, guides, and friends, based on a relationship of concern and mutual respect. The Secondary School (Grade 7‚Äì12) academic programs include: *Arts and Humanities *Science, Design and Technology, *Wildfire Outdoor Education Centre for Environmental Studies, *Performing, Visual, and Media Arts *World Citizenship Curriculum Students participate in the Advanced Placement Program in association with the College Board, the American body of college and high school instructors that provide students with college/university level credits for advanced standing when they arrive at post-secondary education institutions. Many students have received scholarships with institutions such as McGill University, McMaster University and the University of Toronto. Other programs include Independent Tutorial and accredited English as a Second Language as needed. The Moral Framework used by the institute was adapted from the Moral Framework developed at Universidad Nur. It is harmonized with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For example, two of the moral capabilities include: *Thinking systematically and strategically in search for solutions. *Encouraging others and bringing happiness to their hearts. Student life Formal qualities of student life at NCA include a \\"student family\\", proactive counseling programme, and group spiritual observances. \\"Student families\\" are annualized groupings of students of different ages, races, nationalities, religions, talents and abilities who are carefully grouped in a way such that strengths and weaknesses are balanced out by all the members. The families and their faculty sponsors work together to plan and participate in service projects, hold social and family unity activities and consult together on school-related issues. In the counseling programme students learn how to resolve conflicts through effective communication making decisions that are compatible with spiritual and personal values. Effort is also made to educate students about the effects of drug and alcohol addictions, safe dating practices, and goal setting. The spiritual life at NCA is shared by staff and students which observe religious and cultural celebrations from around the world.

His father was killed while serving in World War I. Life and Education Ramberg and his mother moved from Italy to Munich for the remainder of World War I, and in 1920 they moved to his mother's family home in Portland, Oregon. He graduated from Lincoln High School in 1922. That year he enrolled in Reed College, but two years later he transferred to Cornell University. During the years 1925 to 1927, he took a hiatus and worked for Bausch & Lomb on optical computing. Upon receipt of his bachelor's degree from Cornell in 1928, he stayed at the University to work with Floyd K. Richtmyer.

In its major use, it is mixed with ammonia (NH3) in LPCVD chambers to grow silicon nitride in semiconductor processing. A higher concentration of DCS¬∑NH3 (i.e. 16:1), usually results in lower stress nitride films. History Dichlorosilane was originally prepared in 1919 by the gas- phase reaction of monosilane, SiH4, with hydrogen chloride, HCl, and then reported by Stock and Somieski.Seyferth, D., Prud‚ÄôHomme, C., Wiseman, G., Cyclic Polysiloxanes from the Hydrolysis of Dichlorosilane, Inorganic Chemistry, 22, 2163-2167 It was found that in the gas phase, dichlorosilane will react with water vapor to give a gaseous monomeric prosiloxane, H2SiO. Prosiloxane polymerizes rapidly in the liquid phase and slowly in the gas phase, which results in liquid and solid polysiloxanes [H2SiO]n. The liquid portion of the product, which is collected via vacuum distillation, becomes viscous and gelled at room temperature. Hydrolysis was done on a solution of H2SiCl2 in benzene by brief contact with water, and the molecular weight was determined to be consistent with an average composition of [H2SiO]6. Through analytical and molecular weight determinations, n was decided to be between 6 and 7. Then, through more experimentation with the product, it was determined that n increases as time increases. After being in contact with the aqueous hydrolysis medium for a longer period of time, a polymer, [HSi(OH)O]n, was produced. There was limited availability of dichlorosilane until the silicone industry grew. Reactions and formation Most dichlorosilane results as a byproduct of the reaction of HCl with silicon, a reaction intended to give trichlorosilane. Disproportionation of trichlorosilane is the preferred route.Vorotyntsev, V., Mochalov, G., Kolotilova, M., Kinetics of Dichlorosilane Separation from a Mixture of Chlorosilanes by Distillation Using a Regular Packing, Theoretical Foundations of Chemical Engineering, 38(4), 355-359 :2 SiHCl3 SiCl4 \\\\+ SiH2Cl2 Hydrolysis Stock and Somieski completed the hydrolysis of dichlorosilane by putting the solution of H2SiCl2 in benzene in brief contact with a large excess of water.Seyferth D., Prud‚ÄôHomme C., Linear Polysiloxanes from Dichlorosilane, Inorganic Chemistry, 23, 4412-4417 A large-scale hydrolysis was done in a mixed ether/alkane solvent system at 0 ¬∞C, which gave a mixture of volatile and nonvolatile [H2SiO]n. Fischer and Kiegsmann attempted the hydrolysis of dichlorosilane in hexane, using NiCl2‚ãÖ6H2O as the water source, but the system failed. They did, however, complete the hydrolysis using dilute Et2O/CCl4 at -10 ¬∞C. The purpose of completing the hydrolysis of dichlorosilane is to collect the concentrated hydrolysis products, distill the solution, and retrieve a solution of [H2SiO]n oligomers in dichloromethane. These methods were used to obtain cyclic polysiloxanes. Another purpose for hydrolyzing dichlorosilane is to obtain linear polysiloxanes, and can be done by many different complex methods. The hydrolysis of dichlorosilane in diethyl ether, dichloromethane, or pentane gives cyclic and linear polysiloxanes. Decomposition  Su and Schlegal studied the decomposition of dichlorosilane using transition state theory (TST) using calculations at the G2 level. Wittbrodt and Schlegel worked with these calculations and improved them using the QCISD(T) method.Walch, S., Dateo, C., Thermal Decomposition Pathways and Rates for Silane, Chlorosilane, Dichlorosilance, and Trichlorosilane, Journal of Physical Chemistry, 105, 2015-2022 The primary decomposition products were determined by this method to be SiCl2 and SiClH. Ultrapurification  Dichlorosilane must be ultrapurified and concentrated in order to be used for the manufacturing of semiconducting epitaxial silicon layers, which are used for microelectronics. The buildup of the silicon layers produces thick epitaxial layers, which creates a strong structure. Advantage of use Dichlorosilane is used as a starting material for semiconducting silicon layers found in microelectronics. It is used because it decomposes at a lower temperature and has a higher growth rate of silicon crystals. Safety hazards It is a chemically active gas, which will readily hydrolyze and self ignite in air. Dichlorosilane is also very toxic, and preventative measures must be used for any experiment involving the use of the chemical.Vorotyntsev, V., Mochalov, G., Kolotilova, Volkova, E., Gas-Chromatographic and Mass-Spectrometric Determination of Impurity Hydrocarbons in Organochlorine Compounds and Dichlorosilane, Journal of Analytical Chemistry, 61(9), 883-888 Safety hazards also includes skin and eye irritation and inhalation.Praxair Material Safety Data Sheet (2007) ReferencesExternal links * Safety data sheet for dichlorosilane from Praxair¬Æ Silanes ","title":"Dichlorosilane"},{"id":"9563464","text":"Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus was a French Jewish philosopher and controversialist. He lived at Arles, perhaps at Avignon also, and in other places, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He belonged to the well- known Nathan family, which claimed its descent from David; he was probably the grandson of the translator Maestro Bongodas Judah Nathan. According to the statement of Isaac himself, in the introduction to his concordance (see below), he was completely ignorant of the Bible until his fifteenth year, his studies having been restricted to the Talmud and to religious philosophy. Later he took up other branches of learning, and owing to his frequent association with Christians and to the numerous anti-Jewish writings of Jewish apostates that appeared at that time, he turned his attention to religious controversy. Works Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus was the author of the following Jewish apologetic works (some are still extant, and some are known only through citations): * Toka·∏•at Mat'eh, against Joshua Lorki (Geronimo de Santa F√© after baptism)Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi Bibliotheca Antichristiana, pp. 76‚Äì77 * Mib·∫ìar Yi·∫ì·∏•a·∏≥, counter-missionary anti-Christian polemicsDe Rossi, l.c. * Me'ah Debarim, for the instruction of youth, twenty-one essays on various topics, the Biblical names of God forming one, another being on the MasorahCollection of I.

In the introduction the author says that his work aimed to facilitate the study of Biblical exegesis and to prevent Jewish converts to Christianity from making, in their religious controversies, incorrect quotations from the Bible, as was often the case with Geronimo de Santa F√©. The \\"Me√Ør Netib,\\" with its complete introduction, was first published at Venice (erroneously under the name of Mordecai Nathan) in 1523; in 1556 it was published at Basel by Antoine Reuchlin (printed by Henri Pierre), but with only a part of the introduction.

West Crater's lava dome formed on the floor of a glacial cirque, and has a similar size to the lava dome formed after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. West Crater has erupted at least two large lava flows within the Holocene epoch, about 8,000 years Before Present, each of which extend about from the volcano. Emplaced into canyons on the sides of the crater, the flows are being eroded by local streams. The lava dome likely formed before the lava flows erupted.  Geography and access  West Crater lies in Skamania County, in the U.S. state of Washington. It reaches an elevation of .

West Crater and the rest of the Marble Mountain-Trout Creek Hill field can be accessed by roads in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. Washington Route 503 and Forest Service Route 90 lie to the east of Woodland. West Crater can be accessed by traveling north on the Wind River highway and following Forest Service road 54.  Geology  Juan de Fuca tectonic plate is being subducted under the North American Plate, leading to volcanic activity in the Cascades like at West Crater In southern Washington state, the Cascade Range, which sits south of the dacitic Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, spans from British Columbia in Canada to Lassen Peak in northern California in the United States. Volcanoes in the range have been produced by subduction of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the North American Plate. The Washington Cascades consist of Cenozoic era volcanic and intrusive rocks, and they can be divided into two segments based on age and rock type: the Western Cascades (formed between 50 and 5 million years ago) and the High Cascades (produced within the past 5 million years). Whereas the High Cascades have largely been unaffected by geological deformation processes, the Western Cascades are more folded and faulted. In the Wind River area, the Cascades sit atop Cenozoic era lava flows and volcaniclastic deposits, which have a calc-alkaline composition. Divided into the Ohanapecosh Formation, Eagle Creek Formation, Yakima Basalt, and Quaternary basalt flows, they show variable thickness and topographies. The Cascade Arc formed during the Oligocene epoch, and by the late Miocene epoch there was a low but broad gap between the Washington segment of the arc and Cascade volcanoes in Oregon. Activity picked up during the Quaternary period in Washington, as andesitic stratovolcanoes and small, olivine basalt cinder cones and shield volcanoes erupted. Before the Pleistocene, uplift and erosion was widespread, which was followed by eruptions from the northeastern part of the Wind River area during the early Pleistocene. Rocks in the Wind River area have not been altered significantly by orogenic movement (large structural deformation of the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle due to the interaction between plate tectonics). There are a number of faults, but they show relatively little displacement. The western slope of the Wind River valley is shaped like a fault scarp, and it seems to be aligned with Trout Creek Hill, suggesting a potential fault line there that trends to the northwest. West Crater may also be part of this fault, as both it and Trout Creek Hill appear to be aligned with the lower Wind River and St. Martin's Hot Springs. West Crater forms part of the Quaternary Marble Mountain-Trout Creek Hill volcanic field in southern Washington state, formed by small basaltic and basaltic andesite shield volcanoes and cinder cones. This field encompasses an area of , running from Marble Mountain to the area to the south of Trout Creek Hill. Located south of Mount St. Helens, it extends for and has a width of . It consists of mostly monogenetic scoria cones, each of which produced three or four lava flows. There are at least 22 cones, and all volcanic landforms older than 12,000 years have been glaciated, the oldest the Soda Peaks basalt lava flows, dated to 0.36 million years old. The West Crater-Soda Peaks zone covers an area of , to the southeast of Mount St. Helens. A monogenetic volcanic field, it consists of 13 basaltic to andesitic volcanic edifices that vary from 360,000 years old to 2,000 years old. They appear as a series of isolated lava flows emplaced as single units, except for the deposits at Bare Mountain, South Soda Peaks, and West Crater where deposits are more complex. West Crater is a small lava dome, made up of andesitic lava with two large lava flows. It is not highly prominent. The volcanic edifice has a ridge of Tertiary volcanic and intrusive rock, which lies on the southern edge of West Crater. West Crater's dome reaches an elevation of , with a diameter of . It has a summit crater with a width of and a depth of . The dome still possesses a lobe of lava at the bottom of this summit crater. West Crater's lava dome formed on the floor of a glacial cirque, and has a similar size to the lava dome formed after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.  Eruptive history  West Crater has erupted at least two large lava flows since Quaternary time, each of which extend about from the volcano. Emplaced into canyons on the sides of the crater, the flows have just started to be eroded by local streams. The flows have a gray color, and they consist of a platy, olivine basalt lava interspersed with olivine phenocrysts. The western flow has ridges perpendicular to its flow with heights of , as well as two levees that reach heights of which span of the deposit. The eastern flow has at least ten subunits with a rough surface; it was more viscous than the western flow. Both deposits have impeded soil development. In addition to the lava flows, hornblende andesite can also be found near West Crater to the northwest of the Trout Creek Hill. Scientists think West Crater erupted during the Holocene epoch, about 8,000 years Before Present. Its lava flows intermix with tephra from an eruption of Mount St. Helens and tephra from the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama about 7,700 years ago. Within the Marble Mountain-Trout Creek Hill field, only two other volcanoes have erupted during the Holocene: the volcanic cone near Hackamore Creek and a phreatic crater at Bare Mountain's summit. These cones were likely active simultaneously, as one of the lava flows from West Crater is embedded with an andesitic lava flow from the Hackamore Creek cone. Their similar ages and locations imply that they resulted from the same movement of magma and were possibly fed by the same magma chambers. The lava dome likely formed before the lava flows erupted, suggested by its steep western side and the appearance of rock from the dome on the western lava flow. The dome's deep depression may have formed when the dome's top collapsed as lava moved out of the volcano during the eruption of the two flows.  Potential hazards  The human population within of West Crater is slightly more than 500 people, but more than 14,000 people live within of the volcano, and more than 2 million live within . However, the United States Geological Survey lists the threat potential from West Crater as \\"Low/Very Low\\".

Jenny Agutter plays Louis XIV's mistress, Louise de la Valli√®re and Vivien Merchant appears as Queen Marie-Therese. It was directed by Mike Newell. Plot In this version, the twins' ages are swapped: Philippe is the firstborn and rightful king, who had been spirited away at birth and raised with no knowledge of his true identity in a plot by Cardinal Mazarin to manipulate Louis before his own death. Colbert and D'Artagnan plot to replace Louis (who is an ineffective king more interested in dancing and pleasure than the welfare of France) with Philippe, and in the process bring down the corrupt finance minister Fouquet, who has embezzled from the national treasury. Louis is repulsed by his own wife and makes repeated advances on Louise, who is in turn repulsed by him yet falls in love with Philippe.

In addition to this, he was also the managing director of First Scottish Group, a legal services company, however in October 2012, he retired from this position. Yorkston, a lifelong fan of the club and keen wharler, has two sons and 6 grandchildren. At 6-foot 9 inches tall. Yorkston is the tallest club chairman in British football. He initially took up acting with limited success. Keen to utilise his height to full effect he auditioned for and got down to the last two for the role of \\"The Green Cross Code Man\\" eventually losing out to Dave Prowse of Darth Vader fame. Other unsuccessful auditions included the role as \\"Hunny Monster\\" alongside veteran comic actor Henry Magee. His biggest success as a thespian was in the role of \\"Herman Munster\\" in the Lochgelly Theatre Company's pantomime hit \\"Munster Family Christmas\\" in 1982. A close friend of the comedian Bobby Davro it was Davro who suggested Yorkston leave his show business aspirations behind and become a civil servant a role which Davro thought he would be ideal for. Yorkston was becoming disillusioned with show business feeling he was being unfairly typecast due to his height and took the advice of one-time mentor and friend Davro and quit. He took up a full-time post in the civil service where he gradually moved up the ranks. He then left to start up a company searching public records under the auspices of the First National Bank. First Scottish began life back in 1987 as a subsidiary of First National Bank to undertake Searches on behalf of the Bank. From 1989 onwards, this service was extended to solicitors.

It previously had a sister charity located in Wrexham, along with locations in Llanberis in Gwynedd, and the Adventure Centre in Narberth, Pembrokeshire. Techniquest was first established in Cardiff in 1986. It was founded by Professor John Beetlestone (1932‚Äì2016) and his colleagues from Cardiff University. Techniquest gives visitors a hands-on approach to science and includes a science theatre, a planetarium, and a discovery centre.  History of the Cardiff site  Techniquest first opened on 13 November 1986 on the site of the old British Gas showroom on the corner of Duke Street and St John Street. There were 48 exhibits at that time, many of them were designed and built by Techniquest. The former showroom housed the centre for around nine months. Less than seven weeks after it had opened Techniquest had welcomed its ten thousandth visitor. In 1988 Techniquest re-opened in a pre-fabricated building opposite the now demolished Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum in Bute Street. The two buildings were removed to make way for Mermaid Quay. They moved again in 1995 about 100 metres along Stuart Street to its present location on the site of the former Baileys engineering workshop which is now its permanent headquarters. The building, the UK's first purpose-built science discovery centre, opened on 1 May 1995. It uses the steel framework of the original building which can be clearly seen on the photograph. It Is currently closed until further notice due to (COVID-19) Coronavirus  Activities  Inside Techniquest, Cardiff Bay Its aims are to engage people with science and to motivate them to learn more and they also address science-related areas such as maths, engineering and technology. Techniquest operates exhibitions, shows and programmes intended to make science accessible to people throughout Wales, and to improve the quality of public debate about science and technology. It also offers comprehensive education services to schools and teachers, to complement formal education provision in Wales. Techniquest takes exhibitions and programmes to special events at many venues around Wales, from shopping centres to major cultural events such as the National Eisteddfod, in addition to further activities through schemes such as Wales Gene Park, mathcymru, Science Caf√© Wales and Teacher Science Network. To provide this range of experiences, Techniquest maintains an Active Design and development arm, with workshops and facilities. It also work with a range of partners and other experts, which include academics, scientists, industry and government, both within Wales and internationally. Funding As an independent registered educational charity, Techniquest is funded from a variety of sources. The Welsh Government provides approximately 1/3 of the funding, particularly to support schools programmes, although it intends to withdraw this funding over the coming years. Admission charges help to meet operating costs, whilst grants and other earned income are also essential. They are currently seeking ¬£12m of capital funding to develop their sites and services over the next 5 years.

He first appears on record in 1478 as the rector of the church of Tyningham, and is called a clerk of the diocese of Brechin.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 79, & n. 3. In 1482, he was selected to be Chancellor of the diocese of Aberdeen.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 13. On 22 October 1483, he was selected to be Bishop of Dunkeld, despite the election of Alexander Inglis on 17 September the same year.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 98; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 78. On 13 June 1484, Brown had been consecrated at the Papal see.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 98. Brown, as orator regis (\\"the king's priest\\"), had been sent to Rome by King James III of Scotland to press the claims of George Carmichael to the bishopric of Glasgow.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 79-80. According to Alexander Myln, in his 16th century Vitae Dunkeldensis ecclesiae episcoporum (\\"Lives of the Bishops of Dunkeld\\"), Brown used the opportunity to become friendly with many of the cardinals, including Roderick Borgia, papal vice-chancellor and Bishop of Porto, the future Pope Alexander VI. Myln alleges that it was Borgia's influence that secured Brown's provision and consecration, even though, he alleges, it was against the will of the Scottish king.Myln, Vitae Dunkeldensis, p. 28; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 80. Brown's position was not thus initially secure. In May 1485 the Parliament of Scotland supplicated the Pope to reverse his decision in favour of Alexander Inglis. Brown, however, had the support of Robert Lauder, Lord of the Bass, and through a mixture of pressure and bribery, secured James III's recognition of Brown.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 80-1. Brown returned to Scotland, landing at Inchcolm, part of the diocese of Dunkeld.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 81. Brown's episcopate was comparatively long, though most of the details were not recorded. Alexander Myln attributes reconstruction of the diocese to Brown's episcopate, namely in the creation of four rural deans. This is supported by other records, whereby four new deaneries come into the record during Brown's tenure, although Deans of Angus (Rattray) and Atholl can be found in the 13th century.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 122-4. Bishop Brown's last years witnessed the defeat and death of King James IV of Scotland at the Battle of Flodden, while the bishop himself suffered from Gallstone. He died on either 14 or 15 January 1515, aged 76.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 81, gives the 14th, based on Myln, while offering a letter by Gavin Douglas suggesting the 15th; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 99, gives 15 January, while citing Dowden and Myln as his sources.

Overview Rutherford Library was officially opened in a ceremony on May 15, 1951, in which former university president R.C. Wallace paid tribute to his former friend and colleague. The initial library inventory included most of Alexander Cameron Rutherford's personal book collection, of over 8000 volumes, with some select books having been gifted to Queen's University. History The plans for Rutherford Library were drawn up from 1948 to 1951, and included features that would make the new library one of the best in Canada. Durable building materials were specified, including all oak trim and doors, combined with marble floors and staircases with brass railings. As there was no previous free-standing library on campus, for over 5000 students, other than a reading room arrangement, the addition was welcomed by students and staff alike, heralding a new era for the university. Rutherford North A new wing of the library was officially opened on September 27, 1974, by Mrs. Hazel McCuaig (Hazel Elizabeth Rutherford) and designated \\"Rutherford North\\". The distinctive brickwork of Rutherford North was designed by the architectural firm of Minsos, Vaitkunas and Jamieson in conformance with the structure of the original Rutherford Library. The Rutherford North design encapsulates and encloses the north face of the original building in a large open space. The new brick motif of Rutherford North was named \\"Rutherford Autumn Leaf\\" and registered in the building industry.

The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 6 (US 6) in the Texas Township community of Indian Orchard. The highways heads to the northeast, and reaches the eastern terminus at the New York-Pennsylvania border in Damascus Township, where PA 652 crosses the Narrowsburg‚ÄìDarbytown Bridge over the Delaware River and into New York, continuing as New York State Route 52 (NY 52) and County Route 24 (CR 24) in Sullivan County. The highway originated as the easternmost stretch of US 106 when the United States Highway System was first put together in 1926. The route, however, was assigned as a state highway in 1920. PA 652 was once used south of the alignment, in the northern suburbs in Philadelphia. PA 652 remained on that alignment until 1946, and in 1972, the PA 652 designation was reassigned onto the US 106 alignment. Route description PA 652 in Damascus Township PA 652 begins at an intersection with US 6 (Texas-Palmyra Highway / Grand Army of the Republic Highway) in the village of Indian Orchard. PA 652 progresses northeast as a two-lane local road through Texas Township as the Beach Lake Highway. Crossing into the village of Bethel, the route winds northeast through Berlin Township and enters Beach Lake. PA 652 is the main road through downtown Beach Lake, crossing an intersection with Milanville Road, which connects to the Skinners Falls-Milanville Bridge. After Beach Lake, PA 652 wanders northeast past Little Beach Pond and into Damascus Township. In Damascus, PA 652 enters a more wooded region of the county until Woodland Drive, where it becomes primarily residential once again. The route soon bends eastward then to the southeast at Kaiser Street, reaching the Delaware River as it enters Darbytown. Running eastward along the river, PA 652 reaches the Narrowsburg-Darbytown Bridge, where it crosses the river into the state of New York, where it continues as NY 52 and CR 24 in Narrowsburg. History Entering Pennsylvania on PA 652/NY 52. The newer style of sign is visible nearby PA 652 was first assigned in 1928 to a series of local streets in the northwestern suburbs of Philadelphia. The southern terminus of the route was at the modern US 30/Old Eagle School Road intersection on the Chester‚ÄìDelaware county line near Devon to the west and Wayne to the east. PA 652 followed Old Eagle School Road north to King of Prussia, where the route turned east onto East Swedesford Road. At the location of the modern US 422/US 202 interchange, PA 652 turned north onto Guthrie Road, running alongside the right-of-way of what is now the US 422 expressway to North Gulph Road. PA 652 continued north on North Gulph Road to the Valley Forge National Historical Park, where it terminated at PA 23. In 1946, PA 652 was transferred to the control of the local suburbs along its entire length, and control of the roads went to local highway departments. The portion of the route between Guthrie Road and PA 23 returned to state control in 1967 when PA 363 was routed onto North Gulph Road. The current alignment of PA 652 was classified as a state highway as early as 1920, nine years after the Sproul Road Bill was passed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature. The Sproul Road Bill also assigned the first state highways in Pennsylvania. There was no designation given to the highway. From 1926 to 1972, the modern routing of PA 652 was part of US 106. The road also carried a portion of PA 19 from 1927 to 1930. On March 14, 1972, US 106 was decommissioned and replaced with the PA 652 designation between Indian Orchard and the Delaware River. Signs were changed by April of that year. The Narrowsburg‚ÄìDarbytown Bridge over the Delaware River. The state line is about mid-span, serving as PA 652's northern terminus PA 652 has a consistent stretch of water crossings that helps put the highway together. The first bridge along the highway, built in 1925, was the US 106 bridge spanning a tributary of the Delaware River. The concrete-paved span was reconstructed in 1980 and crosses the tributary into New York on a long span. The next bridge was the current Narrowsburg‚ÄìDarbytown Bridge, built in 1954 over the Delaware. The bridge is structurally deficient according to the United States Department of Transportation, and is in need of replacement. The bridge is long and made of steel. The final two bridges were constructed in 1964. The first was constructed for US 106 over Indian Orchard Brook. It is located about east of State Route 2011 (Poor Farm Road). It is a structurally deficient, concrete bridge. There is no recorded estimate for replacement costs. The second bridge is also over Indian Orchard Brook, and is in Texas Township. The bridge is long and built out of concrete, which handles an average of 6,804 commuters a year.

As Chief of the Polish Naval Command (1925-1947), he was a member of an elite group of high ranking Polish naval officers from foreign navies who became founder members of the re-established naval forces of the newly independent Poland after World War I. During World War II, Polish naval forces under his command, were embedded with the Royal Navy and contributed significantly to the success of Britain's maritime war effort. He notably fell out with Poland's war time Prime Minister-in-exile, General Sikorski, but was backed by the British and survived in post. He was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Background He was born into a military family on 5 April 1882 in Kalisz, in the Russian Partition of Poland. His father, a graduate of the Moscow Cadet Corps, was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army. ≈öwirski attended the Marine Cadet Corps School in St Petersburg from 1889 to 1902. He completed the course for Navigation officers. Russian Imperial Navy service Pamyat'Merkuriya1879-1907a As a commissioned officer in 1902, he joined the Russian Imperial Navy in the rank of Midshipman. Initially he was Watch officer and junior navigation officer on board the cruiser Askold. From 1905 he served in the Black Sea Fleet, as watch officer on the destroyer, Rostislav, on the -type minelayer Dunay and on the frigate, Donetz. He was later engaged in mine laying operations and as navigation officer on the cruiser Pamiat Merkuria. During 1908 he was briefly training officer on board the mine layer, Kronstadt. Between 1909 and 1911 he returned to the Pamiat Merkuria as its navigation officer and also on the Jevstatije. Subsequently he served as navigation officer of the Russian Torpedo Division and commander of the torpedo boat, Stremitielnyi. In 1912 he advanced to navigational Flag officer of the Brigade of Naval Destroyers. From 1914 he was a member of the Training Commission for the Black Sea Fleet. Throughout World War I he was the navigation officer of the Black Sea Fleet, rising in 1917 to the rank of Captain, then naval commander. Navy of the Ukrainian People's Republic In 1918 he was nominated Chief of Naval Operations of the Navy of the Ukrainian People's Republic and Minister of Naval Affairs of the Ukrainian People's Republic. That same year he was promoted to Rear admiral of the Ukrainian Hetmanate. Interwar Period=Independent Poland  Before the end of hostilities, in December 1917, he had made contact with Polish organisations. He became an active member of the 'Polish House' in Sevastopol. After the fall of the Ukrainian People's Republic, he left for Poland, where he joined the League for the Renewal of the Polish Navy, and later went to France where he was active in the National Committee for Poland.M. Graczyk, p. 37. In 1919 he joined the Polish Army and was integrated into the Department for Maritime Affairs in Warsaw, becoming head of the Organisational Section.Dziennik Rozkaz√≥w Wojskowych Nr 63 of 7 June 1919 , pos. 2006. In July 1920 he was deputy to the chief of the Department for Maritime Affairs and was acting chief between 6 August to 5 September 1920. From September 1920 he was commander of the Coastal Force, Wybrze≈ºe Morskie, based in Puck.M. Graczyk, p. 54. In January 1921 he was confirmed in the rank of colonel of the navy and in April became a member of the Marine Corps.Dziennik Personalny Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych Nr 7 of 19 February 1921, pos. 188. In February 1921 he advanced to the rank of Commander. In May 1922 he was confirmed in the rank with retrospective recognition of seniority dating from June 1919 within the Marine Corps.Rocznik Oficerski 1923, Ministerstwo Spraw Wojskowych, Oddzia≈Ç V Sztabu Generalnego Wojska Polskiego, Warsaw 1924, p. 1437, 1443.M.

In August 1924 he moved with the Fleet Command to Grab√≥wek, Gdynia. In May 1925 the President of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski released him from the Fleet Command and appointed him as chief of Marine Operations in Warsaw.Dziennik Personalny Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych Nr 58 of 29 May 1925, p. 289. In 1931 he was promoted to the rank of Rear admiral. On behalf of the Polish Treasury, he signed contracts for the procurement of naval Destroyer, Submarines and in 1938 for the Minelayer, ORP \\"Gryf\\". ORP Gryf (1936)  World War II  On 5 September 1939 ≈öwirski and his staff left Warsaw for Pi≈Ñsk, but due to heavy bombing they diverted to the border at Kuty and crossed into Romania, arriving in Paris on 6 October. He reported to General Sikorski and presented him with a strategy for the deployment of the Polish Marines. These included the continuation of the Polish Navy as a political and naval force, including the merchant fleet, collecting personnel, organizing military transport in France and consolidating resources. Having become Chief of the Directorate of the Polish Navy in October 1939, in December Sikorski recognized the role played by the Polish Navy in the war and ordered that naval matters be concentrated under the command of its chief, Jerzy ≈öwirski. This meant that for the first time, the Polish Navy became independent of the Army. In 1940 after the fall of France, the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs, evacuated to the United Kingdom which became the war time base of the Polish Government in Exile.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/36166/page/4031/data.pdf Polish-British Naval Agreement On 18 November 1939 the British and Polish governments had signed an Anglo-Polish naval agreement and protocol laying out how their forces would co-operate. Swirki was a co-signatory of the Anglo-Polish military alliance, alongside Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and Ambassador Edward Bernard Raczy≈Ñski. In outline Polish vessels would operate embedded within the Royal Navy, but under their own command. A note dated 6 June 1940 stated that: \\"A detachment of the Polish Navy, consisting at present of three destroyers, two submarines and a depot ship, is operating in conjunction with the Royal Navy. The depot ship ORP Gdynia is stationed at Plymouth; two of the destroyers, ORP B≈Çyskawica and Burza form part of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla and the third ORP Garland will shortly join the Mediterranean, and the two submarines, ORP Orze≈Ç and Wilk form part of the 2nd submarine Flotilla.\\" Unlike the Polish army and air- force, which were largely decimated in the attack on Poland and the survivors thrown into the battle for France in 1940 to suffer further heavy casualties, the Polish Navy, initially had no shortage of manpower. Three destroyers, two submarines and two training ships, all fully manned, reached the UK. In addition Polish merchantmen contained reservists and other seamen who could be conscripted. The training ships included officer instructors and young officer cadets. In all some 800 officers and other ranks commenced naval service based in the UK.http://kresy-siberia.org/hom/element/polish-navy-info-and- photos/kontr-admiral-jerzy-swirski/?lang=pl Bismarck When in 1940 the naval command, under Jerzy ≈öwirski transferred from Paris to London, two administrative divisions were created: The North Command based in Greenock and the South Command based in Devonport. Later, the Mediterranean Command was formed after Polish naval forces had expanded to over 3,000.Hazell, Martin. '‚ÄòPoles Apart: Polish Naval Memories of World War II‚Äô', South West Maritime History Soc. (UK); 2nd edition (2012) In 1941, shortly after his promotion to Vice admiral, differences emerged between ≈öwirski and Sikorski who had decided to stand him down. As a result, both ≈öwirski and his deputy, Commander Karol Korytowski were to lose their posts. The reason for the dismissals was their management and procurement style in the Marines and especially ≈öwirski's tendency towards independent thinking. The pretext was ostensibly the death by suicide of the commander of the submarine, and the submarine flotilla leader, Lieutenant Commander Bogus≈Çaw Krawczyk, who opposed the admiral's management priorities. Commander Tadeusz Morgenstern-Podjazd was called in to replace ≈öwirski, but in the event, ≈öwirski remained in post and Morgenstern was confirmed as his deputy. The reason was the British Admiralty could not see anyone competent enough to replace him. ≈öwirski's loyalty towards the Allies of World War II was to earn him the Order of the Bath.M. Graczyk, p. 245. In October 1942 Morgenstern resigned and Korytowski resumed his previous role.Graczyk, M. p. 247. Following Sikorski's dramatic death in an air accident off Gibraltar in July 1943, ≈öwirski continued in his earlier role. Post-war After the war ≈öwirski did not return to Poland and remained in exile. He was regarded as a distinguished leader of men and as a brilliant strategist. In the history of Polish naval forces he is rated as an exceptional officer and educationalist of the younger officer corps. Among his signal achievements was his three-pronged plan to ensure the sustainability of the Polish Marines as a defence force: 1. A strategy for the establishment of an effective maritime force (1925 ), 2. The concept of Polish Marines closely shadowing and cooperating with the Royal Navy (1939) 3. Preparing the Marines for post-war effectiveness (1943).Nawrot, D. p. 203. He died in June 1959 in London and is buried there in Brompton Cemetery.

The NCR design shares no common architecture with the Pascal MicroEngine designed by Western Digital but both were meant to execute the UCSD p-System.[1,2] P-machine theory Urs Ammann, a student of Niklaus Wirth, originally presented p-code in his PhD thesis (see Urs Ammann, On Code Generation in a Pascal Compiler, Software‚ÄîPractice and Experience, Vol. 7, No. 3, 1977, pp. 391‚Äì423). The central idea is that a complex software system is coded for a non-existent, fictitious, minimal computer or virtual machine and that computer is realized on specific real hardware with an interpreting computer program that is typically small, simple, and quickly developed. The Pascal programming language had to be re-written for every new computer being acquired, so Ammann proposed writing the system one time to a virtual architecture. The successful academic implementation of Pascal was the UCSD p-System developed by Kenneth Bowles, a professor at UCSD, who began the project of developing a universal Pascal programming environment using the P-machine architecture for the multitude of different computing platforms in use at that time. McCormack was part of a team of undergraduates working on the project.[3] He took this familiarity and experience with him to NCR. P-machine Design In 1979 McCormack was employed by NCR right out of college, and they had developed a Bit slicing implementation of the p-code machine using the Am2900 chip set. This CPU had a myriad of timing and performance problems so McCormack proposed a total redesign of the processor using a programmable logic device based Microsequencer. McCormack left NCR to start a company called Volition Systems but continued the work on the CPU as a contractor. The new CPU used an 80-bit wide microword, so parallelism in the microcode was radically enhanced. There were several loops in the microcode that were a single instruction long and many of the simpler p-code ops took 1 or 2 microcode instructions. With the wide microword and the way the busses were carefully arranged, as well as incrementing memory address registers, the cpu could execute operations inside the ALU while transferring a memory word directly to the onboard stack, or feed one source into the ALU while sending a previously computed register to the destination bus in a single microcycle. The cpu ran at three different clock speeds (using delay lines for a selectable clock); two bits in the microword selected the cycle time for that instruction. The clocks around 130, 150, and 175 nanoseconds. Newer parts from AMD would have allowed a faster 98 ns cycle for the fastest instructions, but they didn't come out with a correspondingly faster branch control unit. There was a separate prefetch/instruction formatting unit (again, using stoppable delay line clocks for synchronization...asynchronous logic allows for skewed timings). It had a 32-bit buffer and could deliver up the next data as a signed byte, unsigned byte, 16-bit word, or \\"big\\" operand (the one-or-two byte format where 0..127 was encoded as one byte, and 128..32767 was encoded as two bytes). There was an onboard stack of 1024 16-bit words, so that both scalars and sets could be operated on there. The top of the stack was actually kept in one of the AMD 2901's registers, so that simple operations like integer addition took a single cycle. before we stole the technique of keeping the top word of the stack in one of the AMD 2901 registers. These often resulted in one fewer microinstructions. (The stack doesn't quite operate this way...it decrements before data is written to it, and increments after data is read.) Since next-address control and next microcode location were in each wide microword, there was no penalty for any-order execution of the microcode. Thus, we had a table of 256 labels, and the microcode compiler moved the first instruction at each of those labels to the first 256 locations of microcode memory. The only restriction this placed upon the microcode was that if the p-code required more than one microinstruction, then the first microinstruction couldn't have any flow control specified (as it would be filled in with a \\"goto ). P-machine architecture The CPU used the technique of keeping the top word of the stack in one of the AMD 2901 registers. This often resulted in one fewer microinstructions. For example, here are a few p-codes the way they ended up. tos is a register, and q is a register. \\"\\" means parallel activities in a single cycle. (The stack doesn't quite operate this way...it decrements before data is written to it, and increments after data is read.) Since next-address control and next microcode location were in each wide microword, there was no penalty for any-order execution of the microcode. A table of 256 labels, and the microcode compiler moved the first instruction at each of those labels to the first 256 locations of microcode memory. The only restriction this placed upon the microcode was that if the p-code required more than one microinstruction, then the first microinstruction couldn't have any flow control specified (as it would be filled in with a \\"goto ). \` fetch % Fetch and save in an AMD register the next byte opcode from % the prefetch unit, and go to that location in the microcode. q := ubyte  goto ubyte SLDCI % Short load constant integer (push opcode byte) % Push top-of-stack AMD register onto real stack, load % the top-of-stack register with the fetched opcode that got us here dec(sp)  stack := tos  tos := q  goto fetch LDCI % Load constant integer (push opcode word) % A lot like SLDCI, except fetch 2-byte word and \\"push\\" on stack dec(sp)  stack := tos  tos := word  goto fetch SLDL1 % Short load local variable at offset 1 % mpd0 is a pointer to local data at offset 0. Write appropriate % data address into the byte-addressed memory-address-register mar := mpd0+2 % Push tos, load new tos from memory SLDX dec(sp)  stack := tos  tos := memword  goto fetch LDL % Load local variable at offset specified by \\"big\\" operand r0 := big mar := mpd0 + r0  goto sldx INCR % Increment top-of-stack by big operand tos := tos + big  goto fetch ADI % Add two words on top of stack tos := tos + stack  inc(sp)  goto fetch EQUI % Top two words of stack equal? test tos - stack  inc(sp) tos := 0  if ~zero goto fetch tos := 1  goto fetch \` This architecture should be compared to the original P-code machine specification as proposed by Niklaus Wirth. P-machine performance The end result was a 9\\"x11\\" board for the CPU that ran UCSD p-System faster than anything else, by a wide margin. As much as 35-50 times faster than the LSI-11 interpreter, and 7-9 times faster than the Western Digital Pascal MicroEngine did by replacing the LSI-11 microcode with p-code microcode. It also ran faster than the Niklaus Wirth Lilith machine but lacked the bit-mapped graphics capabilities, and around the same speed as a VAX-11/750 running native code. (But the VAX was hampered by the poor code coming out of the Berkeley Pascal compiler, and was also a 32-bit machine.)

This alkoxide of titanium(IV) is used in organic synthesis and materials science. It is a diamagnetic tetrahedral molecule. Titanium isopropoxide is a component of the Sharpless epoxidation, a Nobel-Prize-winning method for the synthesis of chiral epoxides. The structures of the titanium alkoxides are often complex. Crystalline titanium methoxide is tetrameric with the molecular formula . Alkoxides derived from bulkier alcohols such as isopropylalcohol aggregate less. Titanium isopropoxide is mainly a monomer in nonpolar solvents. Preparation It is prepared by treating titanium tetrachloride with isopropanol. Hydrogen chloride is formed as a coproduct: :TiCl4 \\\\+ 4 (CH3)2CHOH -> Ti{OCH(CH3)2}4 \\\\+ 4 HCl Properties Titanium isopropoxide reacts with water to deposit titanium dioxide: :Ti{OCH(CH3)2}4 \\\\+ 2 H2O -> TiO2 \\\\+ 4 (CH3)2CHOH This reaction is employed in the sol-gel synthesis of TiO2-based materials in the form of powders or thin films. Typically water is added in excess to a solution of the alkoxide in an alcohol. The composition, crystallinity and morphology of the inorganic product are determined by the presence of additives (e.g. acetic acid), the amount of water (hydrolysis ratio), and reaction conditions. The compound is also used as a catalyst in the preparation of certain cyclopropanes in the Kulinkovich reaction.

The city district borders Maykopsky District of Adygea in the north, Mostovsky District of Krasnodar Krai in the east, Abkhazia in the south, and Khostinsky City District in the northwest. In the southwest, it is bordered by the Black Sea. Population: Adlersky District was chosen to host the 2014 Winter Olympics. The historical center of the district is Adler Microdistrict () ‚Äî formerly classified as a town, but today a microdistrict of Adlersky City District‚Äîlocated at the mouth of the Mzymta River. History The settlement was founded by Russians on 18 June 1837 as the fort of Svyatoy Dukh (Holy Spirit). However, this area had been inhabited long before the Russian arrival. During the Middle Ages, it was the site of Liesh, a Sadz Abkhazian village. In the 13th century, the Genoese merchants arrived to establish a factory which became known as Layso. At that time the upland area was controlled by the Sadz princes of Aredba, one of whose principal estates was located within the modern district boundaries. The current name was given to the area by the Ottoman Turks, who called it either Artlar or Artƒ±. Transportation Adler is home to the Sochi International Airport, which serves the whole Greater Sochi area. Adler railway station is also the effective southern terminus of the Russian section of the North Caucasus Railway, which has ceased to carry international traffic to Georgia since hostilities between Russia and Georgia closed the cross-border line in 1992. The summer months see direct train services bringing visitors to Adler from as far away as Berlin in the west (a journey of 3,714 km), Vorkuta in the north (4,286 km away, beyond the Arctic Circle), and Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East, with the 9,816 km of the latter journey taking eight days to complete. Passenger service to Sukhumi starts and stops from time to time. For the 2014 Winter Olympics, new suburban network was put in operation. There is currently infrequent suburban service to Sochi, with most of the trains stopping also in Khosta and Matsesta, both in Khostinsky City District. The service continues in the direction of Abkhazian border, where trains stop at Olympiyskaya Derevnya railway platform. The service terminates at Olympiysky Park train station. Both the station and the platform were constructed for the Olympics. Furthermore, a connection to the airport is open, with regular service to Sochi through Adler railway station. Finally, a new line was constructed between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana, where some of the Olympic competitions were held, with two railway stations, Esto-Sadok and Roza Khutor. Kudepsta railway platform has been disused. Vesyoloye railway station is only in operation when there is passenger traffic to Abkhazia; at this station, customs and border controls take place. Buses connect Adler with other localities of the city of Sochi. Landmarks The district covers an area of and has under its jurisdiction a network of mountain auls, the Estonian colony at Estosadok, and the ski resort of Krasnaya Polyana which hosted the snow events (alpine and Nordic) of the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2014 Winter Paralympics. The Fisht Olympic Stadium and associated facilities are located closer to the shore. The landmarks of the former town of Adler include two Russian Orthodox churches, dedicated to the Holy Trinity and the Holy Ghost, as well as the Armenian Saint Sarkis Cathedral. Apart from a pebbly and narrow beach backed by the railway line, the district also has a municipal historical museum and a dolphinarium, which makes it popular among tourists. It is also possible to visit the largest trout farm in Russia (founded in 1964) and a breeding nursery for great apes. Among the natural wonders of the district are the 70-metre-high Polikarya waterfall and the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter- long cave which contains traces of human habitation about 30,000 years ago.

Over 20,000 visitors come to the sanctuary each year for guided tours, field trips, summer camps, volunteering and corporate work groups. Their mission is saving and protecting wild cats in captivity and in the wild. They work toward a day when wild cats are living in their native habitat and are not exploited by humans. Carolina Tiger Rescue is Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS) and USDA accredited. The Executive Director is Pam Fulk.  History  Carnivore Preservation Trust in 2009 Carolina Tiger Rescue was founded as The Carnivore Evolutionary Research Institute in 1973 by Dr. Michael Bleyman, a geneticist at UNC, as a research facility for carnivores that were vanishing keystone species ‚Äî species critical to the survival of their ecosystem. Bleyman's intent was to keep a viable population of these animals in trust until their home habitats were sufficiently protected to support them again. The Carnivore Evolutionary Research Institute was incorporated in 1981, and changed its name to Carnivore Preservation Trust (CPT). CPT became well known for its success in breeding certain species, particularly servals, ocelots, and binturongs, and was once held the largest population of binturongs in the united states. As the environmental community began to appreciate the plight of these lesser-known carnivores, they began to create species survival plans ‚Äì organized plans for the survival of the species, including a national genetic registry to monitor numbers and breeding. In response, Carnivore Preservation Trust stopped breeding wildcats in 2000, and changed its name to Carolina Tiger Rescue in 2009, refocusing its mission to rescue.  Rescues  Aria was rescued in May 2013, when she was confiscated by the authorities from a family in South Carolina who had kept her as a pet. Aria was about 10 years old and near death. Although she was eating, she had lost weight very rapidly. When she arrived at Carolina Tiger Rescue, she weighed under 200 pounds, about half of what she should have weighed. Within a few months of receiving veterinary intervention, a healthy diet, and proper care, Aria became the healthy, beautiful tiger she was destined to be. Rajah and Kaela Tiger were found wandering a rural county road near Charlotte, North Carolina when they were about six months old. Nitro was a blind tiger who arrived at Carolina Tiger Rescue in 2009, with his enclosure-mate Apache. They had been rescued from a junkyard in Kansas after a lion there attacked a man. The three lions were relocated to the Detroit Zoo, and the search began for a home for the owner's two tigers. Luckily, Carolina Tiger Rescue could take them in. National Geographic Kids wrote a bookfeaturing Nitro.  Educational Program  Carolina Tiger Rescue has a robust educational program and offers educational tours, school field trips, homeschool programs, preschool storytime, group presentations, and internships. One of Carolina Tiger Rescue‚Äôs main goals is educating the public on the dangers of private exotic cat ownership, circuses and wild animal exploitation. Another goal is preserving wild animals in their natural habitats by exposing the dangers of palm oil and its affects on tiger habitat. Summer animal care internships are available for college students.  Safety  Carolina Tiger Rescue is a no-touch facility and meets USDA and US Fish and Wildlife standards for a big cat sanctuary. Guests must be escorted around the sanctuary by a staff member and are kept at least three feet away from the animal enclosures. Employees or trained volunteers may briefly enter lower level enclosures housing animals like caracals for cleaning and maintenance, but are careful not to interact with these wild animals. All employees and volunteers are heavily trained before they can interact with the animals or enter any enclosure.  Partnerships  A tiger at the sanctuary Carolina Tiger engages in a variety of partnerships with the academia/research, environmental, and sanctuary and zoo communities, as well as the corporate world. For almost two decades, Carolina Tiger has provided access to our tigers‚Äô footprints to collect baseline data for the WildTrack Noninvasive Wildlife Monitoring Project. Carolina Tiger was a founding member of the Big Cat Sanctuary Alliance (BCSA) in 2017. BCSA membership is limited to bona fide facilities that meet the federal definition for a wildlife sanctuary. The Alliance is dedicated to eliminating private ownership and the commercial exploitation of wild cats in the US. Carolina Tiger staff also participate in the local American Association of Zoo Keepers (AAZK). Some funding comes from employee donations through workplace giving campaigns via Earth Share of North Carolina. Controversy Sherry Blanchette, owner of a wildlife sanctuary, went under cover with the BBC posing as a veterinarian and toured the CPT in 2000. She later wrote a report to the USDA and county officials, saying that the facility was unsafe because of vegetation on cages, rusting feed bins, and inadequate, rusting fencing. CPT officials refuted those claims. In 1998, Mark Kostich, a CPT volunteer, was mauled by a cougar while cleaning cages and he later sued CPT. In Kostich's lawsuit, Sherry Blanchette was called as an expert witness on cougar behavior. The North Carolina legislature considered an unsuccessful bill in 2004 which would make it illegal for individuals and over thirty other nonprofit zoological entities to own many of the animals housed at the Carolina Tiger Rescue. Carolina Tiger Rescue supported this bill.  Accreditations  Guidestar has awarded Carolina Tiger Rescue and Platinum-level participant in transparency and Great Nonprofits has named them a top nonprofit for 2018.

Colonel Peter Beckford (1643‚Äì1710) was acting Governor of Jamaica in 1702. Life Peter was the son of another Peter Beckford, of Maidenhead, England. Sir Thomas Beckford, Sheriff of London was his uncle, as was Captain Richard Beckford, who was trading in Jamaica from 1659. England had invaded the island in 1655 and the Colony of Jamaica proved a lucrative business proposition for Englishmen who wished to create sugar plantations there. In 1662, Peter Beckford emigrated to the island, taking with him two or three enslaved Africans, and engaged himself as hunter and horse catcher.Jamaica: Description of the Principal Persons there (about 1720, Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor) in Caribbeana Vol. III (1911), edited by Vere Langford Oliver Having served as a seaman, he was granted a thousand acres (4 km¬≤) of land in Clarendon by royal patent on 6 March 1669. He took an active part in island politics, representing St. Catherine in the Assembly in 1675, and was later called to the Council, where he was appointed President. He was appointed Chief Justice of Jamaica in 1703. He was the first Custos of Kingston, and a street was named after him there. He was renowned for being haughty with a strong temper and was involved in many heated debates. Family and legacy Beckford was twice married‚Äîfirst to Bridget, who died in 1691, and then again to Anne Ballard in 1696‚Äîand had two sons, the eldest of whom was also called Peter. When he died suddenly in a fit of passion in 1710, he was the wealthiest planter in Jamaica. Charles Leslie claimed Beckford was \\"in possession of the largest property real and personal of any subject in Europe.\\" This wealth was reputedly in the form of 20 Jamaican estates, 1500 slaves, and ¬£1,500,000 in bank stock.A New History of Jamaica, by Charles Leslie, 1740, p. 267 His death resulted from an accident when he rushed to the defence of his son, who had caused a commotion when the governor, Thomas Handasyd, tried to dissolve the House of Assembly.

She inspired generations of artists and writers, among them and and contributed to a centuries-long debate in Europe on gender and the nature of woman. Her most influential work was a literary dialogue, De pari aut impari Evae atque Adae peccato (trans. Dialogue on the Equal or Unequal Sin of Adam and Eve) written in 1451 in which she discussed the relative sinfulness of Adam and Eve.Nogarola, Isotta, Complete writings: letterbook, dialogue on Adam and Eve, orations, edited and translated by Margaret L. King and Diana Robin, Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 2004 She argued that woman could not be held both to be weaker in nature and to be more culpable in original sin. Therefore, by a reductio ad absurdum argument women's weakness could be disproved. Nogarola also wrote Latin poems, orations, further dialogues, and letters, twenty-six of which survive. Early intellectual life Isotta Nogarola was born in Verona, Italy, the daughter of Leonardo Nogarola and Bianca Borromeo, and the niece of the Latin poet Angela Nogarola. The family were well to-do, and the couple had ten children, four boys and six girls. Isotta's mother, Bianca Borromeo ensured that the children all received fine humanist educations, although she was herself illiterate. Two of her daughters, Isotta and her younger sister Ginevra, became renowned for their classical studies, although Ginevra gave up her humanist writing upon her marriage in 1438. Nogarola's early letters demonstrate her familiarity with Latin and Greek authors, including Cicero, Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius, as well as Petronius and Aulus Gellius.McCallum-Barry, Carmel (2016), 'Learned women of the Renaissance and Early Modern period: the relevance of their scholarship', in Rosie Wyles and Edith Hall (eds.), Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly (Oxford), pp. 30-1 The girls, as were their male counterparts, were taught the rhetoric necessary for public speaking, and many of them delivered Latin speeches in public and conducted debates in Latin in their correspondence with other scholars, as was the practice among well-educated men of that era and necessary for anyone seeking recognition in learned circles. Nogarola's first tutor was Martino Rizzoni, who was himself taught by Guarino da Verona, one of the leading humanists at that time. Nogarola proved an extremely able student, attaining respect for her eloquence in Latin, and by the age of 18, she had become famous.The Religious Retreat of Isotta Nogarola (1418-1466): Sexism and Its Consequences in the Fifteenth Century Margaret L. King Signs , Vol. 3, No. 4 (Summer, 1978), pp. 807‚Äì822 Hostile reception of her humanistic work The reception of her activities was condescending, with her work considered primarily to be that of a woman and not belonging to the intellectual world into which she sought entry: Niccolo Venier thought the whole female sex should rejoice and consecrate statues to Isotta as the ancient Egyptians had to Isis. Giorgio Bevilaqua claimed never before to have met a learned woman. For her own part, Nogarola was concerned that her fame did not come from the sheer volume of intelligence she seemed to possess, but from the novelty of her gender, and despite her erudition had little choice but to defer to the contemporary social norms by deprecating herself as an ignorant woman. Nonetheless, in 1438, after receiving praise from Guarino da Verona, to whom a friend had written the year before, Nogarola wrote herself, calling Guarino a \\"wellspring of virtue and probity,\\" and terming them heroic, she a Cicero to his Cato, she a Socrates to his Plato. This news spread throughout Verona, which inspired much ridicule from women in the city. A year passed without a reply, and she wrote again to Guarino, saying: \\"Why... was I born a woman, to be scorned by men in words and deeds? I ask myself this question in solitude... Your unfairness in not writing to me has caused me much suffering, that there could be no greater suffering... You yourself said there was no goal I could not achieve. But now that nothing has turned out as it should have, my joy has given way to sorrow... For they jeer at me throughout the city, the women mock me.\\" This time, Guarino da Verona replied in a letter saying: \\"I believed and trusted that your soul was manly...But now you seem so humbled, so abject, and so truly a woman, that you demonstrate none of the estimable qualities I thought you possessed.\\" Upon the death of her father the next year she travelled with her family to Venice, year where she remained until 1441. However anonymous accusations were made against her, alleging incest, male and female homosexuality and licentiousness . ‚ÄúAn eloquent woman is never chaste,‚Äù was one such made against her. All such accusations were scandalous for a woman in Venice at that time.  Retreat to her property in Verona and religion  Confronted with this hostile reception Isotta appears to have decided that devoting herself to literary studies meant the sacrifice of friendship, fame, comfort, and sexuality, and in 1441 returned to her property at Verona to live quietly, possibly with the company of her mother. She cut short her career as a secular humanist and turned instead to the study of sacred letter. Here it was that in 1451 that she published her most famous and perhaps most influential work De pari aut impari Evae atque Adae peccato (trans. Dialogue on the Equal or Unequal Sin of Adam and Eve). Isotta died in 1466, aged 48. She was honoured posthumously by two sonnets praising her chastity, but not her learning.  Major works  As well as her famous dialogues her works include a biography of St Jerome, a letter urging a Crusade (1459), and a consolatory letter to a father on the death of his child.

The Swiss cheese model of accident causation is a model used in risk analysis and risk management, including aviation safety, engineering, healthcare, emergency service organizations, and as the principle behind layered security, as used in computer security and defense in depth. It likens human systems to multiple slices of swiss cheese, stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the differing layers and types of defenses which are \\"layered\\" behind each other. Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a single point of failure. The model was originally formally propounded by Dante Orlandella and James T. Reason of the University of Manchester, and has since gained widespread acceptance. It is sometimes called the \\"cumulative act effect\\". Although the Swiss cheese model is respected and considered to be a useful method of relating concepts, it has been subject to criticism that it is used too broadly, and without enough other models or support. Failure domains Reason hypothesized that most accidents can be traced to one or more of four failure domains: organizational influences, supervision, preconditions, and specific acts.1\\\\. J.A. Doran (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.) G.C. van der Graaf (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.)

Unsafe supervision encompasses for example, pairing inexperienced pilots on a night flight into known adverse weather. Organizational influences encompass such things as reduction in expenditure on pilot training in times of financial austerity. Holes and slices In the Swiss cheese model, an organisation's defenses against failure are modeled as a series of barriers, represented as slices of cheese. The holes in the slices represent weaknesses in individual parts of the system and are continually varying in size and position across the slices. The system produces failures when a hole in each slice momentarily aligns, permitting (in Reason's words) \\"a trajectory of accident opportunity\\", so that a hazard passes through holes in all of the slices, leading to a failure. Frosch described Reason's model in mathematical terms as a model in percolation theory, which he analyses as a Bethe lattice. Active and latent failures The model includes active and latent failures. Active failures encompass the unsafe acts that can be directly linked to an accident, such as (in the case of aircraft accidents) a navigation error. Latent failures include contributory factors that may lie dormant for days, weeks, or months until they contribute to the accident. Latent failures span the first three domains of failure in Reason's model. In the early days of the Swiss Cheese model, late 1980 to about 1992, attempts were made to combine two theories: James Reason's multi-layer defence model and Willem Albert Wagenaar's tripod theory of accident causation. This resulted in a period in which the Swiss Cheese diagram was represented with the slices of cheese labels as Active Failures, Preconditions and latent failures. These attempts to combine two theories still causes confusion today. A more correct version of the combined theories is shown with the Active Failures (now called immediate causes) Precondition and Latent Failure (now called underlying causes) shown as the reason each barrier (slice of cheese) has a hole in it and the slices of cheese as the barriers. Applications The same framework can be applicable in some areas of healthcare. For example, a latent failure could be the similar packaging of two drugs that are then stored close to each other in a pharmacy. Such a failure would be a contributory factor in the administration of the wrong drug to a patient. Such research led to the realization that medical error can be the result of \\"system flaws, not character flaws\\", and that greed, ignorance, malice or laziness are not the only causes of error. Lubnau, Lubnau, and Okray apply the model to the engineering of firefighting systems, aiming to reduce human errors by \\"inserting additional layers of cheese into the system\\", namely the techniques of Crew Resource Management. This is one of the many models listed, with references, in Taylor et al (2004). Kamoun and Nicho found the Swiss cheese model to be a useful theoretical model to explain the multifaceted (human, organizational and technological) aspects of healthcare data breaches.

Westrum models latent failures as voids within this envelope, and active failures as factors external to the envelope that are acting to breach it.
