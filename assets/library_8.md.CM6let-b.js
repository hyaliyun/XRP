They have been found in the primary visual cortex where the initial stage of binocular convergence begins. Binocular neurons receive inputs from both the right and left eyes and integrate the signals together to create a perception of depth. History In the 19th century Charles Wheatstone determined that retinal disparity was a large contributor to depth perception. Using a stereoscope, he showed that horizontal disparity is used by the brain to calculate the relative depths of different objects in 3-dimensional space in reference to a fixed point. This process is called stereopsis. Two main classes of cells in visual cortex were identified by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in 1962 through their investigation of the cat's primary visual cortex. These classes were called simple and complex cells, which differ in how their receptive fields respond to light and dark stimuli. Béla Julesz in 1971 used random dot stereograms to find that monocular depth cues, such as shading, are not required for stereoscopic vision. Disparity selective cells were first recorded in the striate cortex (V1) of the cat by Peter Orlebar Bishop and John Douglas Pettigrew in the late 1960s, however this discovery was unexpected and was not published until 1986. These disparity selective cells, also known as binocular neurons, were again found in the awake behaving macaque monkey in 1985. Additionally, population responses of binocular neurons have been found in human ventral and dorsal pathways using fMRI. Neuroanatomy dorsal pathway (green) and ventral pathway (purple) are shown. They originate from the primary visual cortex. Binocular neurons are found throughout both pathways. Both the dorsal and ventral pathways contribute to the perception of depth. Binocular neurons, in the sense of being activated by stimuli in either eye, are first found in the visual cortex in layer 4. Binocular neurons appear in the striate cortex (V1), the prestriate cortex (V2), the ventral extrastriate area (V4), the dorsal extrastriate area (V5/MT), medial superior temporal area, caudal intraparietal area, and a collection of areas in the anterior inferior temporal cortex. Neurons in the prestriate cortex (V2) are more sensitive to different disparities than those in the striate cortex (V1). Binocular neurons in the striate cortex (V1) are only sensitive to absolute disparity, where in other visual cortical areas they are sensitive to relative disparity. In the prestriate cortex (V2) and ventral extrastriate area (V4), binocular neurons respond most readily to a centre-surround stimulus. A centre-surround stimulus consists of a fixed object with another object rotating in a circle around the fixed object. Areas in the anterior inferior temporal cortex respond to surface curvature. Binocular neurons in both the caudal intraparietal area and the dorsal extrastriate area (V5/MT) respond to surface slants. Binocular neurons in both the medial superior temporal area and dorsal extrastriate area (V5/MT) respond to surface depth sparation. On one hand, the anticorrelated response of the binocular neurons in the striate cortex (V1), the prestriate cortex (V2), dorsal extrastriate area (V5/MT), and medial superior temporal area, all show similar responses. On the other hand, binocular neurons in the ventral extrastriate area (V4) show weaker anticorrelated responses in comparison to the other areas. Finally, areas in the anterior inferior temporal cortex do not show any anticorrelated response. Function Binocular neurons create depth perception through computation of relative and absolute disparity created by differences in the distance between the left and right eyes. Binocular neurons in the dorsal and ventral pathways combine to create depth perception, however, the two pathways perform differ in the type of stereo computation they perform. The dorsal pathway generally performs a cross-correlation based upon the region of the different retinal images, while the ventral pathway fixes the multiple matching problem. In combination, the two pathways allow for judgments about stereo depth. In general the ventral pathway is more sensitive to relative disparity. The cells in this pathway are sensitive to the relative depth between different objects or features close to one another in the physical world which is called fine stereopsis. The dorsal pathway contains cells that are more sensitive to coarse stereopsis. This allows for simple computations of depth based upon the different images in both the left and right eyes, but this computation only occurs when the surfaces analyzed contain a gradient of different depths. =Receptive Fields= disparities on planes 1 and 2. Near cells would respond to disparities on planes -1 and -2. Tuned zero cells would respond to disparities on plane 0, or the plane of fixation. Simple cells have separate regions in their receptive field that respond to light and dark stimuli. Unlike simple cells, the receptive field of complex cells have a mix of regions that respond to light and dark stimuli. The prevailing theory of how simple and complex cells interact is that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus stimulate simple cells, and simple cells in turn stimulate complex cells where then a combination of complex cells create depth perception. Three different cell types exist: far cells, near cells, and tuned zero cells. Far cells respond to disparities in planes further away from the plane of fixation, near cells are stimulated by disparities in planes closer than the plane of fixation, and tuned zero cells respond to disparities on the plane of fixation. The plane of fixation is the plane in 3-dimensional space on which the two eyes are focused and is parallel to the coronal plane of the head. =Correspondence Problem= The correspondence problem questions how the visual system determines what features or objects contained within the two retinal images come from the same real world objects. For example, when looking at a picture of a tree, the visual system must determine that the two retinal images of the tree come from the same actual object in space. If the correspondence problem is not overcome in this case, the organism would perceive two trees when there is only one. In order to solve this problem, the visual system must have a way of avoiding false-matches of the two retinal images. A possible way the visual system avoids false-matches is that binocular complex cells have cross-matching patches between their receptive fields, meaning that multiple complex cells would be stimulated by same feature. Simulation of real binocular complex cells involves a hierarchical squared summation of multiple simple cell receptive fields where the simple cells sum the contribution from both the right and left retinal images. =Energy Models= An energy model, a kind of stimulus-response model, of binocular neurons allows for investigation behind the computational function these disparity tuned cells play in the creation of depth perception. Energy models of binocular neurons involve the combination of monocular receptive fields that are either shifted in position or phase. These shifts in either position or phase allow for the simulated binocular neurons to be sensitive to disparity. The relative contributions of phase and position shifts in simple and complex cells combine together in order to create depth perception of an object in 3-dimensional space. Binocular simple cells are modeled as linear neurons. Due to the linear nature of these neurons, positive and negative values are encoded by two neurons where one neuron encodes the positive part and the other the negative part. This results in the neurons being complements of each other where the excitatory region of one binocular simple cell overlaps with the inhibitory region of another. Each neuron's response is limited such that only one may have a non-zero response for any time. This kind of limitation is called halfwave-rectifing. Binocular complex cells are modeled as energy neurons since they do not have discrete on and off regions in their receptive fields. Energy neurons sum the squared responses of two pairs of linear neurons which must be 90 degrees out of phase. Alternatively, they can also be the sum the squared responses of four halfwave-rectified linear neurons. Stereo Model The stereo model is an energy model that integrates both the position-shift model and the phase-difference model. The position-shift model suggests that the receptive fields of left and right simple cells are identical in shape but are shifted horizontally relative to each other. This model was proposed by Bishop and Pettigrew in 1986. According to the phase-difference model the excitatory and inhibitory sub-regions of the left and right receptive fields of simple cells are shifted in phase such that their boundaries overlap. This model was developed by Ohzawa in 1990. The stereo model uses Fourier phase dependence of simple cell responses, and it suggests that the use of the response of only simple cells is not enough to accurately depict the physiological observations found in cat, monkey, and human visual pathways. In order to make the model more representative of physiological observations, the stereo model combines the responses of both simple and complex cells into a single signal. How this combination is done depends on the incoming stimulus. As one example, the model uses independent Fourier phases for some types of stimuli, and finds the preferred disparity of the complex cells equal to the left-right receptive field shift. For other stimuli, the complex cell becomes less phase sensitive than the simple cells alone, and when the complex cells larger receptive field is included in the model, the phase sensitivity is returns to results similar to normal physiological observations. In order to include the larger receptive fields of complex cells, the model averages several pairs of simple cells nearby and overlaps their receptive fields to construct the complex cell model. This allows the complex cell to be phase independent for all stimuli presented while still maintaining an equal receptive field shift to the simple cells it is composed of in the model. The stereo model is then made from a multitude of complex cell models that have differing disparities covering a testable range of disparities. Any individual stimulus is then distinguishable through finding the complex cell in the population with the strongest response to the stimuli. The stereo model accounts for most non-temporal physiological observations of binocular neurons as well as the correspondence problem. An important aspect of the stereo model is it accounts for disparity attraction and repulsion. An example of disparity attraction and repulsion is that at a close distance two objects appear closer in depth than in actuality, and at further distances from each other they appear further in depth than in actuality. Disparity attraction and repulsion is believed to be directly related to the physiological properties of binocular neurons in the visual cortex. Use of the stereo model has allowed for interpretation of the source of differing peak locations found in disparity tuning curves of some cells in visual cortex. These differing peak locations of the disparity tuning curves are called characteristic disparity. Due to the lack of defined disparity tuning curves for simple cells, they cannot have characteristic disparities., but the characteristic disparities can be attributed to complex cells instead. Two limitations of the stereo model is that it does not account for the response of binocular neurons in time, and that it does not give much insight into connectivity of binocular neurons.

J. P. Taylor and was part of \\"The Oxford History of Modern Europe\\", published by the Clarendon Press in Oxford in October 1954. Origins In an article for Time and Tide in November 1942, Taylor wrote that \\"though innumerable books have been written on isolated episodes, the story of the Struggle for the Mastery of Europe has never been attempted\\". He added, \\"German historians cannot do it, because to them the struggle (that is the resistance to German domination) seems merely wrong-headed; American historians cannot do it, because they do not realize what was at stake\\". He concluded, \\"It would be a superb opportunity for an English historian, if one could be found with real standards of scholarship and understanding\\".Burk, pp. 255–256. However Taylor interrupted writing the book to complete The Course of German History, which was published in July 1945. Taylor already knew German and French and could get by with Italian. He decided that learning Russian would be useful in writing the book so he learnt it as well.Burk, p. 262. Between 1941 and 1944, he had written 100,000 words; by September 1952, he had finished 180,000 words; by early 1953, he had nearly completed the book.Burk, p. 262. Contents The book was published in October 1954. Its central theme is the struggle between the Great Powers for the domination of Europe between the revolutions of 1848 and the end of the Great War. As Taylor wrote: > In the state of nature which Hobbes imagined, violence was the only law, and > life was 'nasty, brutish and short'. Though individuals never lived in this > state of nature, the Great Powers of Europe have always done so.... However, > Europe has known almost as much peace as war; and it has owed these periods > of peace to the Balance of Power. No one state has ever been strong enough > to eat up all the rest; and the mutual jealously of the Great Powers has > preserved even the small states, which could not have preserved themselves. > The relations of the Great Powers have determined the history of Europe. > This book deals with them in the last age when Europe was the centre of the > world.Burk, pp. 263–264. Taylor examines the Great Powers' ability to wage war by taking into consideration their population, defence spending per capita, coal and steel production and manufacturing production. He maintained that determining the strength of a state requires an assessment of its economic resources.Burk, pp. 264–265.

Reception Asa Briggs wrote a favourable review that stated one of the most interesting characteristics of the book was its refusal to take at face value German interpretations of history or to rely too much on Die Grosse Politik. He added that \\"sometimes we need to rest and think three times about his brilliant epigrams; sometimes we pine for a closer study of the economic and social background of diplomacy.... But whatever we do will be influenced by what he has done, for he has re-opened the nineteenth century rather than closed it down\\".Burk, p. 275. The American historian Gordon A. Craig praised Taylor: \\"What makes this the best study of European diplomacy since Langer's volumes on the post-1870 period is his ability to keep the major developments of the period clearly before his readers, while at the same time providing them with circumstantial and absorbing accounts of the policies and ambitions of individual powers and statesmen, the changing diplomatic alignments, and the crises and wars which filled the period\\".Burk, p. 275. E. H. Carr, in the Times Literary Supplement, wrote that Taylor \\"has not... written a history of the relations between the European nations: military operations and economic relations are both neglected. His work is diplomatic history in the strictest sense; and such abstraction, while necessary and valuable for the specialist, fits less well into the conception of general history... what perhaps justifies the detachment of diplomacy during this period is that it in some measure corresponds to the realities of the situation\\". However, Taylor's \\"detailed and penetrating analysis... the wealth of detail and... unfailing pertinacity... his sharp critical faculty and vigilant readiness to challenge orthodox opinions makes it certain that his interpretations and conjectures, whether accepted or not, will have to be taken account of by future historians\\".Burk, pp. 275–276. W. E. Mosse, in the English Historical Review lamented the mixing of opinion and fact and said \\"its general tone is iconoclastic rather than authoritative.... All too often, real flashes of insight are marred by Mr. Taylor's straining after effect; time and again commonsense and accuracy are sacrificed on the altar of the neat epigram, the clever paradox or simply the memorable phrase\\".Sisman, p. 223. Similarly, Henry L. Roberts, in Foreign Affairs, complained that the book is \\"too inclined to reverse all previous interpretations\\". In 1995, the Times Literary Supplement printed a list of the 100 most influential books published since 1945 in which The Struggle for Mastery appeared.Burk, p. 277.

Over the past decade, many studies have emerged utilizing fMRI studies to describe the neural correlates associated with how a human processes something that is considered \\"funny\\". Conceptually, humor is subdivided into two elements: cognitive and affective. The cognitive element, known as humor detection, refers to understanding the joke. Usually, this is characterized by the perceiver attempting to comprehend the disparities between the punch line and prior experience. The affective element, otherwise known as humor appreciation, is involved with enjoying the joke and producing visceral, emotional responses depending on the hilarity of the joke. This ability to comprehend and appreciate humor is a vital aspect of social functioning and is a significant part of the human condition that is relevant from a very early age. Humor comprehension develops in parallel with growing cognitive and language skills during childhood, while its content is mostly influenced by social and cultural factors. A further approach is described which refers to humor as an attitude related to strains. Humorous responses when confronted with troubles are discussed as a skill often associated with high social competence. The concept of humor has also been shown to have therapeutic effects, improving physiological systems such as the immune and central nervous system. It also has been shown to help cope with stress and pain. In sum, humor proves to be a personal resource throughout the life span, and helps support the coping of everyday tasks. Development The understanding of humor, humor production, and functionality of humor, evolves in the course of a lifetime and is essentially determined by cognitive, verbal and social abilities. Differences in humor appreciation are seen between individuals and can be attributed to the development of the neural systems underlying humor cognition during early childhood, which can continue through normal aging. Recent investigations have emphasized the importance of the prefrontal cortex for humor processing. Changes to the prefrontal cortex, a consequence of normal aging, can be traced to changes in the ways individuals appreciate humor. =Early age= The cognitive component of humor is clearly exemplified during the years of childhood, which is characterized by evolving cognitive structures. As a child advances from one degree of cognition to the next, what is considered humorous and what is not should also manifest a meaningful progression. Understanding any particular joke may call upon an array of cognitive processes such as condensations, awareness of incongruities (the cognitive component), and the ability to comprehend unusual verbal representations. The intrinsic gratification involved in the brain activity underlying humor is also encountered in mental activities such as solving puzzles and decoding mysteries. Mirth response test In September 1966 a study was conducted concerning the effects of cognition on humor comprehension during the learning years of a child. The experimenters concluded that there was a positive relation between the mirth response and the degree of comprehension. Mirth is defined as any expression that reflects amusement, especially in the form of laughter. This study implied that the human's ability to comprehend text-based and visual information at a higher level resulted in a higher probability of joke or cartoon appreciation. Children from grades 2-5 were the subjects of this study. Results showed a strong positive correlation between grade level and comprehension; however the mirth response nose dives dramatically after fourth grade. This discrepancy can be explained by the principal of cognitive congruency, which states that fewer cognitive demands will elicit a lower mirth response than those that are in keeping with the complexity of the child's cognitive apparatus. Basically, if the cartoon is deemed \\"dumb\\", then they will not give a mirth response. Frontal lobe -- medial cut =Normal aging= The frontal aging hypothesis suggests that the prefrontal cortex is particularly vulnerable to the effects of aging and implies that functions supported by the frontal lobes will be disproportionately impaired. The volume of the frontal cortex and its pronounced age-related alterations in the 5-HT2 and D2 receptor availability are the basis for this hypothesis and point to the impairment of executive functions including working memory, inhibition, and planning. The ways in which executive functions were measured to testify the age-related decreases in frontal lobe activity with humor comprehension included three assessors: inhibition, set shifting, and working memory. It is seen across several studies that older adults have the capability of selecting the proper punchline of a joke in comparison to younger adults, but they are shown to select a lot fewer total selections. Older adults made more choices of logical alternatives and even showed a tendency to select more slapstick humor. =Old age and pathology= Though there are many studies about the developmental aspects of humor, from infancy through adolescence and adulthood, relatively little research is devoted to the study of humor with elderly (65+) populations. The small pool of research out there devoted to the geriatric effect on humor cognition suggests that elderly people enjoy humor more than younger people, but they have increasing difficulties in understanding jokes. In other words, the humor appreciation component for older people is more active, but the mechanisms devoted to detection are lacking. Also, the amount of laughter exhibited by the elderly is smaller compared to young adults. In addition, the older population seems to not enjoy aggressive types of humor as much as the younger ones, and the elderly are especially sensitive to jokes referring to old age. It is interesting to point out the \\"see-saw\\" effect aging has in terms of the brain mechanisms underlying humor. Despite the apparent decreases in the cognitive component of humor understanding, the affective element remains steady, if not more refined and enhanced. The greater bilateral activation older adults have during cognitively demanding tasks may describe the reasons older adults seem to struggle with jokes that are graded at a higher comprehension difficulty. Of course, cohort effects might play a role in an older adult's capacity to understand jokes. Perhaps several cultural factors that remain in the unconscious thinking processes are critical in understanding meaning behind some jokes. Parkinson's disease The neocortex, basal ganglia, diencephalon, and limbic system are affected by Parkinson's disease and are also brain areas underlying the cognitive processes of humor detection and appreciation. A few studies have confirmed that patients with Parkinson's have a lower appreciation for humor as indicated by sense of humor questionnaires. This relationship is seen across multiple presentation styles including video, audio, and cartoon. Primarily, the affective part of humor, otherwise known as humor appreciation, is the main victim of PD-related brain changes. This could be linked to consequential neurological changes in the amygdala, mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system, and basal ganglia. Parkinson's patients demonstrate an inhibited ability to identify emotions of other people from both speech prosody and facial expressions. The neural circuitry during the humor appreciation phase also involves the amygdala and are thought to be used during the recollection of emotional memories. The therapeutic capabilities of humor could prove to be fruitful for patients with Parkinson's disease, so it is important to identify the mechanisms underlying both humor detection and appreciation. Mechanisms Recent fMRI studies have begun to elucidate the cognitive and affective neural correlates associated with humor processing. But these correlates, corresponding to the stages of humor detection and humor appreciation respectively, fail to distinguish between these different logical mechanisms. A medley of studies have started to investigate the differences between these steps in humor processing and the neural circuitry that underlie these mechanisms. The pun-intended phrase \\"the right hemisphere has the last laugh\\" has been adopted by scientists in this field due to its significance during appreciation, but it is widely accepted that humor appreciation and detection rely on neural circuitry from temporal and prefrontal regions from both hemispheres. These brain areas also contribute to humor processing in three distinct spatiotemporal stages: surface level semantic analysis and two phases of the interpretative integrative processes. The surface level semantic analysis is subserved by bilateral anterior temporal and left inferior prefrontal regions. Interpretive integrative processing comprises detection of ambiguity or conflict between the dominant semantic representations of the punch line and the context, which is reflected in semantic, phonological, metaphorical, and other supralinguistic integrations of the punch line with the preceding sentence. In regards to the detection process, the right medial temporal gyrus is active during detection of semantic violations, and the right middle frontal gyrus is active for context monitoring. The three distinct stages of neural activation during the humor process implies that humor detection and appreciation operate as separate entities and engage different brain regions in an ordered fashion. Therefore, the cascade of neural events required to understand and appreciate humor can be functionally separated, and studies have shown this distinction to be consistent across all genres of comedy. During moments of humor detection, significant activation can be seen in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. During moments of humor appreciation, increased activation in bilateral regions of insular cortex and amygdala can be observed. Parahippocampal gyrus animation =Verbal= The verbal medium through which humor can be conveyed elicits a theory separate from the popular incongruity- resolution theory. The comprehension-elaboration theory is not much different from the incongruity-resolution theory, however it accounts for several incongruities found in language that are not considered humorous. Corrected misunderstandings, scientific discoveries, and silent responses to ‘bad jokes’ all present incongruity-resolution characteristics, but do not generate humor. In the comprehension–elaboration theory of humor, comprehension refers to the detection and resolution of incongruities. The elaboration follows comprehension, involves the conscious generation of inferences for features not made explicit during comprehension, and elicits the unconscious or conscious feeling of amusement. Studies utilizing fMRI have shown that, like the incongruity-resolution theory, the comprehension-elaboration theory can be separated into two distinct neurological schedules of activity. During comprehension, greater activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, and left ventral stratum can be seen. During elaboration, the left ventromedial prefrontal gyrus, bilateral amygdala, and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus show greater activity. =Non-verbal= Studies have shown that a wide area around the temporoparietal junction (temporo-occipital junction, posterior superior temporal sulcus, posterior middle temporal gyrus), temporal pole and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is involved in cognitive humor processing of nonverbal cartoons. Studies in recent years have revealed discrete characteristic patterns of cerebral blood- oxygen-level dependent activity induced by non-verbal cartoons with different logical mechanisms. The TPJ is involved in successful incongruity resolution but not in the detection of incongruity. The extrastriate cortex is activated particularly during processing of visual puns, whereas semantic cartoons evoked activity mainly in the TPJ and precuneus. The TPJ and precuneus areas are known to be involved in mentalizing and are more strongly activated during processing of Theory of Mind cartoons compared to visual puns and semantic cartoons.

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece. Christianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes, Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities.

He is best known for his brief service as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the short-lived 1943 World War II-era Italian government headed by Pietro Badoglio. Life =Ambassador= Born in 1889 as heir to the noble Neapolitan family of di Vituso, Guariglia had the connections necessary to make a career in the Italian Foreign Service, which he joined in 1909. During his first 23 years in the service, he occupied a series of diplomatic posts of sub-ambassadorial rank, serving in Paris, London, St. Petersburg, Brussels, and other capitals. Meanwhile the Italian government fell under the domination of Benito Mussolini. Guariglia attained ambassadorial rank in 1932 when he was named Italy's ambassador to Spain. In 1935 he was translated to Buenos Aires and in 1937 to France. In Paris, he achieved close friendship with a person with insider status in the French government, the Countess Hélène de Portes. De Portes had separated from her noble husband and developed a tie as the long-term romantic partner of a rising French politician, Paul Reynaud. In 1938 Reynaud became Minister of Finance. Although Reynaud's own position was that of staunch opposition to Nazi Germany, his partner's growing liaison with Italy, together with Italy's deepening ties to Germany, compromised this opposition. Guariglia's work was complicit in this power shift. In May–June 1940 Reynaud, who had become Prime Minister of France, was leading his country as it fell under blitzkrieg attack. When Italy declared war on a defeated France on 10 June 1940, Guariglia's services as ambassador were no longer appropriate. =Foreign Minister= Guariglia was serving as Italy's ambassador to neutral Turkey in 1943 when Mussolini's government fell. As an Italian patriot who had loyally served the Fascist regime without developing close personal ties to Mussolini, the career diplomat was Badoglio's choice to be the Foreign Minister of what Rome hoped would be a successful neutralist government. Guariglia returned to the Ministry, took on his new responsibilities on 30 July 1943, and almost at once opened indirect negotiations with the Western Allies. Nazi Germany was not interested in a neutral Italy, and its army actually possessed physical control over most of the peninsula. Furthermore, Guariglia soon found that the Allies were demanding the unconditional surrender of Italy. The result of these counter-pressures was such that six days after the hapless foreign minister and his Cabinet colleagues oversaw the signing of an armistice with the Allies on 3 September, the German army physically occupied the peninsula and carried on the war. On 9 September, the Badoglio government disintegrated. The prime minister and many of the members of his government fled to Allied- occupied Brindisi; Guariglia and other members of the government attempted to remain in Rome, but soon found they were not safe and had no power in a capital city under German occupation. The foreign minister, who had earlier served as ambassador to Spain, found himself taking refuge in the Spanish Embassy in Rome, under the protection of the Francisco Franco government. Guariglia had by now ceased to serve as Foreign Minister de facto, but remained in this post de jure until dismissed on a long-distance basis by the fugitive Badoglio on 11 February 1944. =Later life= Guariglia, an Italian baron and supporter of the House of Savoy, was not eligible to serve in cabinet after the abdication of Umberto II in 1946. He did not lose hope for the restoration of the monarchy, and served as national president of the Italian Monarchist Union and as a monarchist member of the Italian Senate. Age 81, he died in Rome in 1970.

These cells share a common ancestor with both Myelinating and Non-Myelinating Schwann Cells called Neural Crest cells. Perisynaptic Schwann Cells (PSCs) contribute to the tripartite synapse organization in combination with the pre-synaptic nerve and the post-synaptic muscle fiber. PSCs are considered to be the glial component of the Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ) and have a similar functionality to that of Astrocytes in the Central Nervous System. The characteristics of PSCs are based on both external synaptic properties and internal glial properties, where the internal characteristics of PSCs develop based on the associated synapse, for example: the PSCs of a fast-twitch muscle fiber differ from the PSCs of a slow-twitch muscle fiber even when removed from their natural synaptic environment. PSCs of fast-twitch muscle fibers have higher Calcium levels in response to synapse innervation when compared to slow-twitch PSCs. This balance between external and internal influences creates a range of PSCs that are present in the many Neuromuscular Junctions of the Peripheral Nervous System. Discovery Louis-Antoine Ranvier Perisynaptic (Terminal) Schwann Cells were first discovered by Louis-Antoine Ranvier in 1878 when he observed branching networks surrounding the motor end plate (neural portion of NMJ). He described PSCs as \\"arborisation nuclei\\" due to their many projections into the synapse seen under the microscope. These cells were distinguished from muscle fibre nuclei and the motor end plate, making the third component of the tripartite synaptic model. It was found that these newly discovered cells were present in nerve degeneration models, showing their non-neural nature. The proximity of PSCs to the motor end plate raised questions about their functionality, but little was known up until the vast research conducted in the past two decades. Development The origin of Perisynaptic (Terminal) Schwann Cells was largely under question in the 1960s as there were arguments on whether the cells were of epithelial or glial descent, but the development of PSCs has been linked to Neural crest origin. As described above, PSCs are a type of non-myelinating Schwann cell, which develop from neural crest cells. The general series of developmental events can be summarized as this: Neural Crest cells develop into Schwann cell precursors which further develop into Immature Schwann cells which then differentiate into Myelinating Schwann cells and non-Myelinating schwann cells of which Perisynaptic Schwann cells are a subset. This is a flowchart of the development of Schwann cells from neural crest cells Neural crest cells are found in the dorsal neural tube from which nerves and glia alike grow and Neural crest cells are the precursors to many various tissue types including enteric neurons and glia. Schwann cell precursors (a first derivative of Neural crest cells) are present as the nerve axon grows from the dorsal neural tube, but it has been shown that these glial precursors are not essential to axonal growth. The transition from neural crest cells to Schwann cell precursors is characterized by Sox10 and generally occurs around embryonic day 12-13 in rats. Schwann cell precursors then differentiate into Immature Schwann cells from which myelinating and non- myelinating Schwann cells are directly descended. These cells generally appear around embryonic day 13-15 in rats. The differentation of Immature Schwann cells occurs after birth and is dependent on the axons in which the glia are associated. This differentation is known to be reversible, as seen in regeneration models. Perisynaptic Schwann cells develop as non-myelinating Schwann cells and encapsulate the NMJ. PSCs can be attributed to glial lineage by the presence of Calcium binding proteins S100, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Protein 0. These proteins are seen in other glial cells such as Myelinating Schwann cells and Neural Crest cells. While the lineage of non-Myelinating Schwann cells is known from neural crest cells, the exact development of PSCs from non-Myelinating Schwann cells is not fully understood. Roles at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) =Synaptogenesis= Synaptogenesis is the formation of a synapse and in this case the Neuromuscular Junction is of interest. In this section, the focus is on the development of the NMJ from the outgrowth of axons during development. As mentioned in the development section, Schwann cell precursors accompany growing axons as they reach their associated muscles. It is now known that these PSC precursors are not essential to axonal growth, but when present they guide growth cones and help with the maintenance of NMJs after they are formed. After the initial nervous-muscle interface is formed, there is a striking growth in the number of PSCs at each newly developed NMJ. If, however, there is a lack of PSCs (for example in an ablated model) once the NMJ is formed, there is a lack of further axonal growth or even a retraction of axons can be observed. This is seen in a study on frog NMJs 8 and 12 days after ablation where there was a 44% retraction rate by the 12th day with no PSCs. This retraction shows that PSCs are not essential for the growth of axons, but are essential for the long-term maintenance of NMJs. Cultures have been developed that simulate the functions of PSCs using various cell-derived factors in vitro. These cultures are used to understand the molecular basis for which PSCs promote synaptogenesis. From these cultures it has been found that TGF-ß1 (transforming growth factor-ß1) is essential for the development of synapses in vitro. This TGF-ß1 appears to stop nerve growth in order to promote the nerve-muscle synapse formation, however its role in vivo is unknown. =NMJ maintenance= It is known that PSCs are essential for the maintenance of NMJs during development, but PSCs are essential for mature NMJ as well. In frog ablation models, there is observable difference in NMJ properties that arise approximately seven days after PSCs were selectively removed. These changes include both structural and functional abnormalities. In ablation models, samples were taken at regular intervals following removal of PSCs. Immediately following ablatio (at 5 hours), there were no noticeable differences in synaptic structure or functionality. Motor-end plate potentials were unaltered in the pre-ablated and the 5 hour ablated models, showing that PSCs are not essential for short-term maintenance of the NMJ. Approximately 13% of ablated NMJ were observed to be retracted partially or entirely one week after ablation and there was a 50% decrease in end plate potential frequency, meaning the NMJs were firing approximately half as often! This same ablation model cannot be performed in mammals, as the antibody mAB sA12 used in the frog model does not ablate mammalian PSCs. The mammalian PSC, when treated with antibodies against gangliosides in Miller-Fisher Syndrome, show not change in NMJ properties in the short-term, but long-term data has not collected. It can be gathered that PSCs play an important role in long-term maintenance of frog NMJ, but it is unknown if the same effects are true in mammalian NMJs. =NMJ transmission= There are two proposed means by which PSCs can interact with the transmission at the NMJ. One means by which this may occur is through detecting and differentiating between synaptic transmissions, or, in a sense, “hearing” the transmission of the NMJ. The other is altering and participating in the transmission at the NMJ, or “talking” into the already existing message. Listening to synaptic transmissions The first evidence that the PSCs may not only serve a supportive role, was the discovery of increased Calcium levels in PSCs during NMJ transmission. This increase in intracellular calcium levels is not observed in the myelinating Schwann cells that line the axon, but only in the PSCs present at the NMJ. This increase in intracellular calcium has since been linked to synaptic neurotransmitter release in the synapse, but the relationship between Calcium release and neurotransmitters present is not perfectly linear but more complex due to a plethora of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. This ability to respond to NMJ activity can be further explored by observing pre-synaptic simulation amplitude recognition, and pattern recognition in PSCs. It is also known that at NMJ with multiple innervations, PSCs are able to detect transmissions from the “competing sources” . This differentiation is observed by various Calcium levels proportional to the simulation amplitude. These calcium changes were different for the two competing sources. The “stronger” impulse seen by the PSCs induced a higher level of intracellular Calcium, meaning PSCs are able to distinguish the stronger of two inputs in the NMJ. Calcium levels also vary based on the pattern in which the stimulation is delivered. A study was performed to observe glial response to both a “burst” and “continuous” impulse and the responses were not seen to be the same. These two patterns were composed of: 1800 pulses of 20 Hz with recovery time, and 1800 pulses at 20 Hz continuously. Calcium levels in response to the “burst” pattern oscillated and the Calcium levels in response to the “continuous” pattern were constant. These findings show that the PSCs are in fact able to “recognize” unique transmissions through the NMJ. These “recognitions” are characterized by the amplitude and duration of the intracellular Calcium increase. Contributing to synaptic transmission As a result of responding to NMJ transmission, it is also seen that PSCs can actually alter synaptic transmissions as well. The observed increase in Calcium seen above is possible due to PSCs protein receptors: ACh receptors, ATP Receptors, G-coupled receptors, and other receptors. Manipulation of PSCs G-coupled protein receptors lead to altered synaptic transmission. If G-coupled receptors were stimulated by GTP-like ligand, the result is seen as a decrease in neurotransmitter release. If a GDP-like ligand is used to stimulate the same G-coupled receptors, it is seen that there is a reduction in synapse depression. These changes show that PSCs are an play an active role in synaptic transmission. While these interactions are measurable, the impact of PSCs activity in the NMJ is not significant in relation to the pre-synaptic motor neuron impulse, meaning the alterations that PSCs make to NMJ activity is not significant. =NMJ regeneration= PSCs have important roles in synaptogenesis during development as well as in the regeneration of nerve axons after nerve injury. If a nerve injury occurs, PSCs form PSC bridges which connect adjacent NMJ sites. The recovering axon grows along a scaffolding of basal lamina left from the damaged Schwann cells and reaches the proximal PSC site (nearest NMJ). PSC bridges connect adjacent NMJ sites and allow axonal growth from one NMJ to the other. This bridge is a shorter distance for axonal growth than the original route. Once the axon has innervated both sites, it continues growing in a retrograde direction (toward the injury site) to innervate other affected NMJs. PSCs have a large role in creating growth scaffolds from one injured NMJ to another. These PSC bridges are seen in vivo following complement-mediated injury in a murine model, showing that this role of PSCs are present in mammalian NMJs. It has also been seen that motor-end plate terminals are unstable without M2 ACh receptors and muscle fiber growth is uncontrolled in the absence of M5 ACh receptors. This shows that in NMJ regeneration, ACh receptors present on PSCs modulate and control growth.

As the first female reporter for the Ethiopian Herald, Sophia was a pioneer in Ethiopian journalism, and rose to occupy important positions in both the Herald and the government. Later, following the Ethiopian Revolution and Civil War, she became a senior leader of the Ethiopian Democratic Party, and is currently its Vice-President. Early and personal life Sophia was born in 1942, in Addis Ababa, the daughter of Elsabeth Workeneh and Yilma Deressa, a member of the Oromo nobility of Welega province. Her father would eventually become one of the leading figures of the Ethiopian government, serving as Finance Minister (1957–1970) and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1958), Ambassador to the United States, and a member of the Ethiopian Senate. Growing up in the United States, to whom her father was ambassador, she attended the Georgetown Day School and the Baldwin School. She returned to Ethiopia to attend Haile Selassie I University, but dropped out to work for Ethiopian Radio, where she was inspired by other women such as broadcaster Romanework Kassahun. She then joined the Ethiopian Herald in 1961, where, at 19, she became both the newspaper's youngest and first female reporter. In 1962 she was appointed as editor of the Women's Page, making her a recognisable figure. She studied journalism for two years at the Free University of Berlin on a scholarship. Afterwards, she married the editor of the Herald, Tegegne Yeteshawork, having a son, Yared Tegegne. She became Public Relations Officer at the Ethiopian Telecommunications Office, producing their in-house magazine and leading both internal and external public relations. Revolution, imprisonment, and career Following the 1974 coup d'état that overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie I and his government, both her father and husband were arrested by the Derg. Her husband was executed along with sixty other imperial officials on November 23, 1974, while her father died of cancer whilst in prison in 1979.Deaths elsewhere: Yilma Derassa, Toledo Blade, 2 February 1979 Sophia herself was arrested in 1976 and, with her mother, held in detention for seven months at the Kerchele Prison (commonly called Alem Bekagn - \\"Farewell to the World\\"), the same prison at which her husband had been executed. Having to support her family, she returned to Ethiopian Telecommunications, working in its public relations and customer service departments, where despite the company's small size it was considered a model even for companies in Europe. She retired in 1997. Following this, she worked for eight years as Public Relations Officer for the Integrated Holistic Approach Urban Development Project founded by Jember Tefere. Politics and opposition In 2005 she founded the short-lived Ethiopian Democratic Action Group (EDAG), a liberal democratic party. She was approached by Lidetu Ayalew to join the Ethiopian Democratic Unity Party, where she became the party's Vice-President. The party was part of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy opposition front, but was one of the few to take their seats in parliament, splitting with the remainder of the coalition. She ran again for parliament in the 2010 elections, but was defeated in the landslide where the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front took 545 out of 547 seats, and the EDUP none. Despite this setback, she worked to rebuild the party, re-branded as the Ethiopian Democratic Party, and has taken an increasingly vocal role in the Ethiopian opposition. She remained Vice President, securing membership in the Africa Liberal Network.

Larry suggests that they play for one night with her against the pot. She throws three queens of four – and loses. At the hotel room he asks why she has thrown the queens and tells that he has seen her cards. He ducks for her shot and draws the rug under her. They hit each other and fight in bed, and then kiss. Afterwards she tells him that no one has touched her before – now they introduce themselves. He says that she is just a one-night whore to him and warns her to gamble in his territory again. She replies that he has not heard the last. Belle looks for him in a saloon and kills four of his men in a duel. Later we see her sing a ballad of love in a saloon. He confronts her for another game. She shoots off his hat and the bells on his boots. He walks towards her and kiss her, and she lowers her gun. She tells him her story which is shown in flash-backs, with a sadistic whip-toting uncle who has killed her parents and want to subdue her. It also involves her relationship the outlaw Cole Harvey, whom she loved: – She steals his gun to fight her uncle. – He rescues her, kills her uncle and takes back the gun. – She tries to steal his gun when he sleeps. They fight; he attempts to rape her and is killed by her Indian friend – whom Belle earlier rescued from her uncle's whip. Larry offers her to join in a jewel robbery. She declines and instead gathers a gang to beat him to it, but he lets his men infiltrate the gang to take the loot. He is caught and tortured by Pinkerton agents to reveal the hiding place of the missing jewels, but he does not know. Belle appears and shoots one man, getting the drop on the others. She leaves with Larry, revealing the hiding place, in a crystal chandelier. The two separate after she has slapped him, kissed him and he has shot off her hat. ”See you the next poker game!” she shouts. Reception In his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Fridlund describes the relationship between Belle Starr and Blackie as a variation on the unstable partnership between two protagonists that became frequent in Spaghetti Westerns in the wake of For a Few Dollars More. In this partnership of mixed gender the plot functions are played out on a code of sexual attraction (expressed mainly by kisses, love-making and slapping), alternating with another code of money- motivated pursuits and gunplay.Fridlund, Bert: The Spaghetti Western.

Although it had been written about as early as the eleventh century AD, the term Circle of Justice was first coined by the sixteenth-century Ottoman writer Kinalizade and has often been used when describing state-societal relationships in the pre-modern era of the Ottoman Empire. Although nineteenth century Tanzimat reforms led to dramatic shifts in these relations, the Circle of Justice is considered to be the baseline for understanding the Ottoman Empire during its Ancien Régime period.  General overview  The first full expression of this concept originates in the tenth century AD, and reads as follows: > \\"The world is a garden, hedged in by sovereignty Sovereignty is lordship, > preserved by law Law is administration, governed by the king The king is a > shepherd, supported by the army The army are soldiers, fed by money Money is > revenue, gathered by the people The people are servants, subjected by > justice Justice is happiness, the well-being of the world.\\"  Essential elements  The most important theoretical underpinning of their efforts, and of Ottoman rule generally, was a philosophy of government known as the Circle of Justice. Adapted from a long tradition of political ideas originated by the Sumerians, the governing principles of the Circle of Justice describe a compact between a sovereign and the populace he rules. In summary form, the Circle of Justice is often expressed in the following way (sometimes elegantly written in a circle): No power without troops, No troops without money, No money without prosperity, No prosperity without justice and good administration. The ultimate success of a ruler thus derives from his ability to recognize the mutually constitutive relationships between political power, military force, prosperity, and justice for his people. With no beginning and no end, the Circle of Justice suggests that power resides in the totality of the whole, not in any one place or person. Every point of the circle is equal and essential. God, of course, stands above all, casting his shadow on earth through the person of the sultan. = The King's Authority = The ultimate authority and sovereignty of the sultan was an essential element of the Circle of Justice, for the sultan was considered to be ruling with divine blessing or even divine appointment. This religious backing meant that the sultan's ultimate authority and power was considered to be an essential element, underscoring the essentiality of religious law in the pre-modern period of the Ottoman Empire. = The army = In order to protect the sultan and the sovereignty of the territory over which he presided, a strong military force was essential. The strength of the army relied upon its ability to conquer lands or obtain new wealth for the kingdom. = The wealth of the state = Funding was essential in order to maintain the strength of the army, for funding was needed not only for the systems that were used to obtain new recruits, such as the devşirme system, but also for the systems that were implemented in order to successfully train these new recruits. = Peasantry = The wealth of the pre-modern Ottoman state was largely dependent upon two factors: taxation and agricultural revenue. Large agricultural success, of course, was dependent upon a large peasant base to cultivate Ottoman lands. = Other elements = The essential role played by the peasantry in the Circle of Justice can perhaps be considered the basis upon which all other elements of the Circle linked back to one another. In order to ensure agricultural productivity, the army had to protect peasants from invasion, banditry and civil strife; the infrastructure of irrigation works, roads and markets had to be maintained; and the provision of justice had to be ensured, including the reduction or remission of tax demands upon peasantry during times of disaster and the curtailing of the exploitation of corrupt landowners and government officials. Additionally, the sultan was often seen as an ally of the peasantry, for it was considered his duty to protect the peasantry from both corrupt elites and outside forces.  Problems  In terms of practical functioning of a state, the Circle of Justice poses problems because of its enormous fragility. Each element of the Circle is dependent upon the success of the other, meaning that the absence or malfunctioning of even one element can cause the collapse of the entire state. For example, if justice were not provided to the peasantry, agricultural and economic productivity would decrease, leading to, firstly, a decrease in revenue; secondly, the state's inability to pay the army and the army's eventual rebellion; and, ultimately, the inability of the sultan to effectively exercise his ultimate power and sovereignty. Thus, the Circle of Justice necessitated some sort of an interactive relationship between the sultan and his subjects, in order to maintain the essential \\"balance\\" and \\"equilibrium\\" of Ottoman states. This interactive relationship is evident through the existence of institutions such as state-supported irrigation systems that helped to ensure fertility and prosperity; laws and revenue surveys that allowed for the just distribution of taxes; and courts of petitioning that allowed for the addressing of complaints made by the peasantry.  Other implications  The use of the Circle of Justice as the basis for the political functioning of the state inherently led to the establishment of four distinct, separate classes that characterized the social sphere of the pre-modern Ottoman Empire. These four classes included the Men of the Pen, or the men involved in legislature who helped to underscore the King's authority; the Men of the Sword, or the military classes; the Men of Transactions, or bureaucrats such as tax collectors and accountants who aided in the collection and distribution of the state's wealth; and the Men of Agriculture, or the peasantry. Any imbalances caused among these classes was indicative of larger imbalances within the Circle of Justice, and thus could be considered precursors to injustice and tyranny. The use of the concept of the Circle of Justice as a method of describing the inner workings of the entire Ottoman Empire can also be helpful in attempting to understand the inner workings of the Ottoman Empire at a more local level. The governors of local provinces were appointed by the state and played a similar role to the sultan as the supposed overseers of all individuals living under their command; local armies in each region were under the command of the governor and were supposed to protect the peasantry; tax collectors were intended to collect revenue; and the peasantry was expected to cultivate the local lands in order to produce agricultural revenue. Highlighting the role of religion as the essential basis for this entire system was the role of the local mufti, who was authorized by the state to make decisions on legal cases based upon his understanding of Islamic law.

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece. Christianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes, Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities. Such were the sees of Thessaloniki, Corinth, Nicopolis, Philippi and Athens.World Council of Churches: Church of Greece. Retrieved: 28 November 2013. By the 4th and 5th century almost the entire Balkan peninsula constituted the Exarchate of Illyricum which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Illyricum was assigned to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor in 732. From then on the Church in Greece remained under Constantinople till the fall of the Byzantine empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. As an integral part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the church remained under its jurisdiction until Greek independence.

The Greek War of Independence of 1821–28 created an independent southern Greece, but created anomalies in ecclesiastical relations since the Ecumenical Patriarch remained under Ottoman tutelage, and in 1850 the Endemousa Synod in Constantinople declared the Church of Greece autocephalous. The cultural roots of both Byzantine and modern Greece cannot be separated from Orthodoxy. Therefore, it was natural that in all Greek Constitutions the Orthodox Church was accorded the status of the prevailing religion.Charalambos K.

Thomas Rhodes Bridge carrying US 17, US 421, and NC 133 over the Cape Fear River NC 133 starts at the intersection of East Oak Island Drive and Country Club Drive in downtown Oak Island. The start of the road is just about from the Oak Island lighthouse, a tourist attraction in the area. NC 133 crosses the Intracoastal Waterway shortly after its southern terminus and crosses the waterway on an elevated road bridge. The road then turns into Long Beach Road SE and passes the Cape Fear Regional Jetport. Then about later it passes NC 211 (Southport-Supply Rd SE). NC 133 continues on Long Beach Road Extension for . It runs concurrently with NC 87 (River Rd SE) for . Near Boiling Spring Lakes, NC 133 bears right from NC 87 and goes toward Wilmington. The border of Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point coincides with the right side of the road (heading north) in this area. NC 133 goes along the side of Boiling Spring Lakes but never goes into the town. Past Boiling Spring Lakes the road goes through a lot of marshy grassland alongside of the Cape Fear River. The road passes over Town Creek. Passing through Belville, NC 133 encounters a historic marker dedicated to Robert Howe. In Leland the road merges with U.S. Route 17 (US 17), US 74, and US 76 to go over the Brunswick River. After going over the Brunswick River, NC 133 heads north again along with US 17, US 74, and US 421 at a trumpet interchange while US 17 Business, US 76, and US 421 south cross into downtown Wilmington via the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge. An intersection north of the trumpet interchange provides access to the USS North Carolina Battleship Memorial. The three routes pass over the Cape Fear River on the S. Thomas Rhodes Bridge. US 74 and NC 133 turn east from the north-south road and cross the Northeast Cape Fear River via the Isabel Holmes Bridge. After an interchange with 3rd Street, the roads run concurrently along the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway until NC 133 exits off the freeway at Castle Hayne Road. The road goes through Wrightsboro, a small town north of downtown Wilmington. NC 133 then meets Interstate 140 and US 17. The highway has an interchange with on and off ramps going to the freeway. NC 133 meets up with US 117 and NC 132 near Skippers Corner, also a small township north of Wilmington. NC 132 ends to the right of the intersection and NC 133 turns left to run with US 117\\\\. NC 133 and US 117 both run through downtown Castle Hayne. NC 133 turns left at Old Blossom Ferry Road. NC 133 ends at an intersection with NC 210 near Castle Hayne. North Carolina Bicycle Route 5 is concurrent along NC 133 from the northernmost US 17 / US 421 intersection, across the Isabel Holmes Bridge, to Third Street in Wilmington. History Established in 1962 as a renumbering of NC 40, from Oak Island to NC 210, at Bells Crossroads. The route has been adjusted over the years as various sections from Belville to and through Wilmington onto freeways. Its biggest adjustment was in December, 2005 when NC 133 was deleted from a section North Front Street, North Fourth Street and Cornelius Harnett Street, creating a gap in the route; it was reestablished in February, 2008 via Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. In 2014, construction began on the Long Beach Road Extension in Brunswick County which removed NC 133 from a concurrency with NC 211 and shortened it concurrency with NC 87. The project was completed on January 10, 2016. =North Carolina Highway 40= The third and final NC 40 that appeared in North Carolina was established in 1957 as a new primary routing, with several multiplexes, from near Southport to Bells Crossroads. By 1960, it was extended southeast to Yaupon Beach, on Oak Island. By 1962, because of the establishment of I-40, NC 40 was renumbered to NC 133\\\\.

Today, Out of the Blue comprises 16 male and female students who arrange and sing songs from an eclectic repertoire of current and classic pop, rock, folk, R&B;, jazz, and techno. Most members join the group as first-years and leave the group at the beginning of their senior year, after a traditional Family Weekend concert featuring the group's newest members. Out of the Blue has a large and enthusiastic community of alumni that often attends the current group's concerts whether they take place at Yale or in various international destinations. The group sings their non-traditional closing song, Steve Winwood's \\"Higher Love,\\" at almost every concert. The group also invites alumni in the audience to sing their traditional closing song, \\"The Irish Blessing,\\" any time they attend a concert. Rush As a member of Yale's Singing Group Council, Out of the Blue follows the standard procedure for Rush, the audition process at Yale. Over the course of two short performances, prospective singers can sample the group, and decide whether or not to sign up for an audition. Rush may take anywhere from two weeks to a month, over the course of which all the a cappella groups associated with the Singing Group Council hold auditions, rush meals, singing desserts, and callbacks. The process culminates in Tap Night, an event in which every a cappella group lines up at High Street Gate on Old Campus and hurries to induct the prospective singers into their group. In 2018, Out of the Blue successfully tapped eight new members from the class of 2022. Tours Out of the Blue has performed in diverse and exotic venues, from the United States Embassy in Singapore to Madison Square Garden in New York City. The group has opened for major recording artists like Ben Folds and Sister Hazel and performed for royalty, diplomats, Nobel Laureates, and U.S. Supreme Court Justices. In addition to performances, OOTB leads master classes for students all over the world, many of which have inspired children to start their own school a cappella groups. The group recorded their first full-length studio album in 1990, entitled \\"No Rough Edges.\\" Each year, the group embarks on two to three regional or international tours.

It stars Eric Tate, Lake Latimer, Lindsay Roberts, John Still, T.C. Sharpe and Wanda Wilson. The film, shot in Memphis, Tennessee, launched Brewer's career as a writer and director. Brewer used the experience of making the film as inspiration for the story in the Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow.  Plot  Car mechanic by day/thief by night, Eli Foote is starting to feel guilty about what he does. His guilt intensifies when he steals a car that belongs to a beautiful cellist named Amanda. Meeting her at the impound yard where she is distraught over her car, Eli strikes up a conversation with Amanda which leads to a romance. Meanwhile, Eli's friend, Harper, a grungy street hustler, is trying to do business with Eli's boss, Mr. Coles. She needs his help in getting a car for a boisterous pimp named Cowboy Urles. Eli wants to leave his criminal past behind, but Harper holds him to their friendship.

Sharpe as Cowboy Urles * Jay Munn as Preacher * Wanda Wilson as Miss Wanda * Karl Chambless as Beale Street Tourist * J. Lazarus Hawk as Dealer  Production  Craig Brewer was inspired to write the film after his assistant Erin Hagee's car was stolen. Seeing her crying at the impound lot got him thinking, \\"What if the guy who stole her car was right here, watching her cry?\\" Brewer had been working as the manager of a local Barnes & Noble and began writing the screenplay for the film at the P&H; Café. When he asked what the P&H; stood for, he was told it stood for many things but it was generally accepted that it was called \\"The Poor & Hungry Café\\". Brewer asked if he could use the title for the film. As he was writing the script, Brewer planned to max-out credit cards and shoot the film on celluloid. His father, Walter, suggested it would be cheaper to film on a Hi8 video camera. Weeks later, Brewer's father died from a heart attack at the age of 49. Brewer used his inheritance of $20,000 to begin working on The Poor & Hungry.  Music  The soundtrack features the music of The Delta Queens, DDT, Riverbluff Clan, Microwave Dave & The Nukes, Jack Oblivian, Blind Mississippi Morris, Al Kapone and Jason Freeman.  Critical reception  The film received positive reviews. According to Film Threat, The Poor & Hungry is \\"a ruggedly moving digital feature; an unlikely love story with a gritty, vaguely melancholic air\\". Awards and nominations ;Hollywood Film Festival * Best Digital Feature: Craig Brewer (Winner) ;Magnolia Independent Film Festival * Best Feature Film: Craig Brewer (Winner) ;Nashville Film Festival * Audience Choice Award: Craig Brewer (Winner) * Dreammaker Award: Craig Brewer (Winner) * Special Award of Merit: Craig Brewer (Winner)  Home media  In its initial release, The Poor & Hungry was only available on VHS in Memphis at a local video store, Black Lodge Video. However, all the copies were eventually stolen from the store. The television rights were sold to the Independent Film Channel. 13 years later, Brewer gave the film a Blu-ray/DVD release after pent-up demand on November 15, 2013 and announced that anyone who wanted a digital copy of the film could get one for free via email. The Blu-ray, up-resed to high definition frame-by-frame, includes a commentary by Brewer, deleted scenes and a newly produced documentary Poor Man's Process: The Making of The Poor & Hungry, directed by Morgan Jon Fox and featuring interviews with Brewer, the cast and crew, John Singleton and Stephanie Allain.

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece. Christianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes, Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities. Such were the sees of Thessaloniki, Corinth, Nicopolis, Philippi and Athens.World Council of Churches: Church of Greece. Retrieved: 28 November 2013. By the 4th century almost the entire Balkan peninsula constituted the Exarchate of Illyricum which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Illyricum was assigned to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor in 732. From then on the Church in Greece remained under Constantinople till the fall of the Byzantine empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. As an integral part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the church remained under its jurisdiction until Greek independence. Under Ottoman rule, up to \\"6,000 Greek clergymen, ca. 100 Bishops, and 11 Patriarchs knew the Ottoman sword\\".Christodoulos (Paraskevaides) of Athens.

The Greek War of Independence of 1821–28 created an independent southern Greece, but created anomalies in ecclesiastical relations since the Ecumenical Patriarch remained under Ottoman tutelage, and in 1850 the Endemousa Synod in Constantinople declared the Church of Greece autocephalous. The cultural roots of both Byzantine and modern Greece cannot be separated from Orthodoxy. Therefore, it was natural that in all Greek Constitutions the Orthodox Church was accorded the status of the prevailing religion.Charalambos K.

That ID card also serves as voter’s registration card . The officers seized her birth certificate and refused to issue her the requested document. The reason given for the rejection was that she had Haitian surnames. She appealed before the Civil and Commercial Court of the First Instance of the Judicial District of Monte Plata. She was rejected. The court justified rejecting her appeal on the basis that she did not supply the original version of her birth certificate but provided photocopies instead. She then appealed to the highest judicial instance in the Dominican Republic, The Constitutional Court.Maismy-Mary Fleurant  The Sweeping Order of the Constitutional Court Against Her and Dominicans in her Category The Constitutional Court acknowledged that the proper venue for her appeal should have been the administrative grievances court but decided to hear the case anyway for the sake of “expediency.” That court also denied her case but, in addition, recommended dramatic actions to be taken with regards to the status of all individuals who fit her profile in the country.

NC 770 is one of the few North Carolina state highways numbered in the 700s. Route description NC 770 begins at NC 704 near Sandy Ridge. The road begins to head to the east from the intersections along a two lane road. The road continues through a very rural area of Stokes County, passing by many farms. The road curves around the foothills of North Carolina until reaching the Stoneville area. It crosses over the Mayo River and has an interchange with US 220 before entering downtown Stoneville. NC 770 passes through Stoneville along Main Street. After leaving Stoneville, the road continues through rural Rockingham County before reaching the community of Providence. Shortly before the highway enters Eden, it turns to the left along a bypass south of downtown Eden. NC 770 then forms a concurrency with US 311 before they cross over the Dan River. The bypass is joined by NC 87 before the right-of-way ends at an intersection with NC 14 southeast of the city. The four roads travel together crossing the Dan River and enter a business district of eastern Eden. At an interchange with Meadow Road, NC 14 and NC 87 continue north while US 311 and NC 770 exit to head east on Meadow Road. At this point, NC 700 begins and travels along US 311 and NC 770 for just over . They head northeast before making a sharp curve to the east at a factory to cross a railroad at-grade. The road soon begins to curve back to the north where NC 770 ends at the Virginia state line; US 311 continues another to Danville. History NC 770 began in 1930 between US 311 in Stoneville and NC 54 in Leaksville. In 1933 NC 770 was extended east to the Virginia State Line, via the town of Draper. In 1934, the road was extended again to the west, running along US 311 for a couple of miles and then continuing to NC 704. In 1966 the road was straightened to run directly into Stoneville. In 2000 the road was routed along its current routing around Eden.

It is found from Washington, Oregon, and California to northern regions of Mexico. Often multiple wasps in different life stages occupy the same gall. Description The adult wasps are small, stout and brown, about 5mm long with clear wings nearly twice the length of the body. The antennae are filiform and about the same length as the legs. Despite their size they are one of the largest species of Cynipid wasps. The gall itself is a typical oak apple gall in appearance, roughly spherical and varies from greenish to reddish or orange depending on host, age and environmental conditions. The galls range in size from a 2–14 centimeters across and often contain multiple larvae as well as parasites and other species that form a mutual relationship by feeding off the galls themselves. The outer galls are hard in texture and are not easy to penetrate. Life cycle Andricus quercuscalifornicus is believed to reproduce strictly by parthenogenesis, and no male specimens have ever been recovered. The adult female lays eggs in the cambium layer of oak twigs during the fall using her ovipositor. More vigorous twigs will have more galls. The eggs overwinter on the twig, and then hatch in the spring, usually in early April. The resulting larvae induce galls immediately, where they can seem to balloon almost overnight onto the tree. This is the point where most of the parasitoids enter the gall, while it is still soft and small enough for their ovipositor to reach the larvae. After anywhere from a few weeks to two months, the gall stops growing and begins to desiccate, turning tan or brown. The larvae pupate and then bore their way out of the gall in late summer or early fall and fly off to lay eggs in other trees. A few larvae overwinter inside the gall and don't emerge until the following fall. The reason for this is unknown. These wasps form an important role in the ecosystem, with more than 20 known species that are parasitoids, inquilines, and hyperparasites that live on its life cycle, while the galls form a persistent shelter for various forms of fungi as well as many other insects. Several birds are also known to feed from the galls and their inhabitants.

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece. Christianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes, Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities. Such were the sees of Thessaloniki, Corinth, Nicopolis, Philippi and Athens.World Council of Churches: Church of Greece. Retrieved: 28 November 2013. By the 4th century almost the entire Balkan peninsula constituted the Exarchate of Illyricum which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Illyricum was assigned to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor in 732. From then on the Church in Greece remained under Constantinople till the fall of the Byzantine empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. As an integral part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the church remained under its jurisdiction until Greek independence.

The Greek War of Independence of 1821–28 created an independent southern Greece, but created anomalies in ecclesiastical relations since the Ecumenical Patriarch remained under Ottoman tutelage, and in 1850 the Endemousa Synod in Constantinople declared the Church of Greece autocephalous. The cultural roots of both Byzantine and modern Greece cannot be separated from Orthodoxy. Therefore, it was natural that in all Greek Constitutions the Orthodox Church was accorded the status of the prevailing religion.Charalambos K.

Buckland was the son of the Rev. John Buckland, Rector of Templeton, Devonshire, and a nephew of Dr. William Buckland, Dean of Westminster. He received his early education from his father at Laleham, and was then sent to Rugby School, of which school his uncle, Dr. Arnold, was at the time head master. At the age of seventeen he went to the University of Oxford, where he held a studentship at Christ Church. After taking his degree Buckland determined to emigrate to the colonies, and sailed for New Zealand, but in consequence of the unsettled state of affairs in that colony he removed to Tasmania, arriving in Hobart in February 1843. He was for a time second master of the Queen's School, of which the Rev. John Philip Gell was head master. On the closing of that school he opened a private school. In 1845 he was ordained. In 1846 the prospectus of a Church of England Grammar School was issued, and on 3 August in that year the school, named \\"The Hutchins School\\" in memory of Archdeacon William Hutchins, was opened at Hobart, with Buckland as head master. It soon became one of the leading schools of the colony, a position which it has ever since maintained, a large number of the most prominent men of Tasmania having received their education at the Hutchins School. Buckland held the post of headmaster for twenty-eight years, until his death, which took place at Hobart on 13 October 1874.

This differentiates them from conditional cash transfers where the government (or a charity) only transfers the money to persons who meet certain criteria. Unconditional cash transfers have developed on the premise that giving cash to citizens allows them to have autonomy over their own lives.  Types  Unconditional cash transfers could vary in a number of ways: * They could be one-off or recurring: One-off unconditional cash transfers involve either a literal one-time transfer or a transfer over a short period of time, intended to provide people money that they could use for long-term expenses. On the other hand, continuing or recurring cash transfers offer a small sum of money periodically, enabling people to save at a greater rate, or to spend more. Generally, unconditional cash transfers are more likely to be one-off than recurring. * They could be means-tested at the individual/household level or given to all individuals/households in a given area. * They could be means- tested at the level of villages or applied to all villages in a given district or region. * The grant could be made at the individual or household level, and its size could be fixed or variable based on the household size.  Programs and organizations involved  = GiveDirectly = The largest organization exclusively devoted to cash transfers is GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly was founded by economics graduate students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with two main inspirations: the growing evidence that cash transfers could work, and the growth of cheap and reliable money transfer technology. GiveDirectly's operations were initially limited to Kenya, where the m-Pesa money transfer system is well-established. In November 2013, the organization expanded to Uganda. Charity evaluator GiveWell first noticed GiveDirectly in July 2011, named it as a standout charity in November 2011, and gave it top charity status starting November 2012. GiveDirectly has been a GiveWell top charity in the years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Largely as a result of GiveWell's recommendation, Good Ventures, the private foundation of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna, that works closely with GiveWell, has donated well over $40 million to GiveDirectly (in grant sizes of $7 million, $5 million, $25 million, and $9.8 million). An impact evaluation of GiveDirectly's cash transfer program was conducted in collaboration with GiveDirectly, with the working paper released in October 2013. The paper attracted commentary from World Bank economist David McKenzie. He praised the robustness of the study's design and the clear disclosure of the study lead's conflict of interest, but raised two concerns: * The use of self-reporting made the results hard to interpret and rely on (this being a feature of any study that attempted to measure consumption). * The subdivision of the sample into so many different groups meant that there was less statistical power that could be used to clearly decide which group had better outcomes. Chris Blattman, a prominent blogger and academic in the area of development economics, with a particular focus on randomized controlled trials, also blogged the study. He expressed two main reservations: * The observer- expectancy effect, where the people being asked questions may be subtly influenced in their answers by the experimenter's expectations. * The lack of clear positive effect on long-term outcomes, as well as the lack of increased spending on health and education. = The Cash Learning Partnership = The Cash Learning Partnership(CaLP) is a partnership of over 150 organizations and over 5000 individuals in the humanitarian sector where they pool knowledge and expertise surrounding cash transfers and their effects. Their website includes a number of studies on unconditional cash transfers, with a particular focus on cash transfers made in the aftermath of natural disasters. Salient examples include: * UNICEF's Alternative Responses for Communities in Crisis Programme, the largest humanitarian multi-purpose unconditional cash transfer partnership in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. * Unconditional cash transfers to reduce food insecurity for displaced households and to assist with repatriation in Niger following a food crisis. * Unconditional cash transfers for relief and recovery in Rizal and Laguna in the Philippines, in the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana. The Electronic Cash Transfer Learning Action Network (ELAN) within CaLP has also worked with Mercy Corps, and Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) on case studies for humanitarian electronic transfer projects in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh. These case studies Examine the extent to which: * recipients used digital financial services (e.g. money transfers, savings, credit, purchases) through mobile money; * the factors that affected recipients' uptake of these financial services; and * considerations for future humanitarian programs aiming to increase the use of digital financial services among recipients. = Other programs = A blog post by Vishnu Prasad for the Institute for Financial Management and Research summarized existing research on unconditional cash transfers, citing studies around the following programs: * South African Old Age Pension Scheme, a means-tested unconditional cash transfer scheme in South Africa to women over the age of 60 and men over the age of 65. * Bono de Desarollo Humano, an unconditional cash transfer scheme in Ecuador * South Africa's mean, unconditional child grant  Reception  = Use as a benchmark = Jeremy Shapiro, a GiveDirectly co-founder and the person who published GiveDirectly's impact evaluation, has argued for using cash transfers (and more specifically, unconditional cash transfers) as a benchmark against which other development interventions should be evaluated, due to the simplicity and scalability of cash transfers. Others who have also endorsed the idea of using cash transfers as a benchmark, citing GiveDirectly, include Innovations for Poverty Action and GiveWell. = Media discussion = Since 2012, there have been a number of media pieces discussing cash transfers, generally in the context of reporting on GiveDirectly. This includes coverage in the New York Times, The Economist, the Freakonomics radio podcast, and Forbes.  Evaluations of intervention impact  A team of the Cochrane Collaboration including researchers from Cornell University, Harvard University, and the Universities of Bremen and Otago conducted the first comprehensive systematic review of the health impact of unconditional cash transfers. The review of 21 studies, including 16 randomized controlled trials, found that unconditional cash transfers may not improve health services use. However, they lead to a large, clinically meaningful reduction in the likelihood of being sick by an estimated 27%. Unconditional cash transfers may also improve food security and dietary diversity. Children in recipient families are more likely to attend school, and the cash transfers may increase money spent on health care.

Most evolution, or changes in allele frequencies from one generation to the next, is the result of drift, or random chance of some alleles getting passed down and others not. Recurrent evolution is when patterns emerge from this stochastic process when looking across populations. These patterns are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists as they can teach people about the underlying forces of evolution. Recurrent evolution is a broad term, but is usually used to describe recurring regimes of selection within or across lineages. While most commonly used to describe recurring patterns of selection, it can also be used to describe recurring patterns of mutation, for example transitions are more common than transversions. It encompasses both convergent evolution and parallel evolution and can be used to describe the observation of similar repeating changes through directional selection as well as the observation of highly conserved phenotypes or genotypes across lineages through continuous purifying selection over large periods of evolutionary time. The changes can be observed at the phenotype level or the genotype level. At the phenotype level recurrent evolution can be observed across a continuum of levels, which for simplicity can be broken down into molecular phenotype, cellular phenotype, and organismal phenotype. At the genotype level recurrent evolution can only be detected using DNA sequencing data. The same or similar changes in the genomes of different lineages indicates recurrent genomic evolution may have taken place. Recurrent genomic evolution can also occur within a lineage. An example of this would include some types of phase variation that involve highly directed changes at the DNA sequence level. The evolution of different forms of phase variation in separate lineages represent convergent and recurrent evolution toward increased evolvability. In organisms with longer generation times, any potential recurrent genomic evolution within a lineage would be difficult to detect. Recurrent evolution has been studied most extensively at the organismic level but with cheaper and faster sequencing technologies more attention is being paid to recurrent genomic evolution. Recurrent evolution can also be described as recurring or repeated evolution. The distinction between convergent and parallel evolution is somewhat unresolved in evolutionary biology. Some authors have claimed it is a false dichotomy while others have argued there are still important distinctions. These debates are important when considering recurrent evolution as their basis is in the degree of phylogenetic relatedness among the organisms being considered and convergent and parallel evolution are the major sources of recurrent evolution. While convergent evolution and parallel evolution are both forms of recurrent evolution they involve multiple lineages whereas recurrent evolution can also take place in a single lineage. As mentioned before, recurrent evolution within a lineage can be difficult to detect in organisms with longer generation times; however paleontological evidence can be used to show recurrent phenotypic evolution within a lineage. The distinction between recurrent evolution across lineages and recurrent evolution within a lineage can be blurred because lineages do not have a set size and convergent or parallel evolution takes place among lineages that are all part of or within the same greater lineage. When speaking of recurrent evolution within a lineage, the simplest example is that given above, of the on-off switch used by bacteria in phase variation, but it can also involve phenotypic swings back and forth over longer periods of evolutionary history. These may be caused by environmental swings, for example the natural fluctuations in the climate or a pathogenic bacteria moving between hosts, and represent the other major source of recurrent evolution. Recurrent evolution caused by convergent and parallel evolution, and recurrent evolution caused by environmental swings, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. If the environmental swings have the same effect on the phenotypes of different species, they could potentially evolve in parallel back and forth together through each swing. Examples of phenotypic recurrent evolution On the island of Bermuda, the shell size of the land snail poecilozonites has increased during glacial periods and shrunk again during warmer periods. This is due to the increased size of the island during glacial periods resulting in more large vertebrate predators creating selection for larger shell size in the snails. In eusocial insects, new colonies are usually formed by a solitary queen; however this is not always the case. Dependent colony formation, when new colonies are formed by more than one individual, has evolved recurrently multiple times in ants, bees, and wasps. Recurrent evolution of polymorphisms in the colonial invertebrate animal cheilostomata bryozoans has given rise to zooid polymorphs and some skeletal structures several times in evolutionary history. Neotropical tanagers, Diglossa and Diglossopis, known as flowerpiercers, have undergone recurrent evolution of divergent bill types. There is evidence for at least 133 transitions between dioecy and hermaphroditism in the sexual systems of bryophytes. Additionally the transition rate from hermaphroditism to dioecy was approximately twice the reverse rate suggesting greater diversification among hermaphrodites and demonstrating the recurrent evolution of dioecy in mosses. C4 photosynthesis has evolved over 60 times in different plants. This has occurred through using genes present in the C3 photosynthetic ancestor, altering levels and patterns of gene expression, and adaptive changes in the protein coding region. Recurrent lateral gene transfer has also played a role in optimizing the C4 pathway by providing better adapted C4 genes to the plant. Examples of genomic recurrent evolution Certain mutations occur with measurable and consistent frequencies. Deleterious and neutral alleles can increase in frequency if the mutation rate to this phenotype is sufficiently higher than the reverse mutation rate, however this appears to be rare. Beyond creating new variation for selection to act upon mutations plays a primary role in evolution when mutations in one direction are \\"weeded out by natural selection\\" and mutations in the other direction are neutral. This is purify selection when it acts to maintain functionally important characters but also results in the loss or diminished size of useless organs as the functional constraint is lifted. An example of this is the diminished size of the Y chromosome in mammals and this can be attributed to recurrent mutations and recurrent evolution. The existence of mutational hotspots within the genome gives rise to recurrent evolution. Hotspots can arise at certain nucleotide sequences because of interactions between the DNA and DNA repair, replication, and modification enzymes. These sequences can act like fingerprints to locate mutational hotspots. Cis-regulatory elements are frequent targets of evolution resulting in varied morphology. When looking at long term evolution mutations in cis-regulatory regions appear to be even more common. In other words, more interspecific morphological differences are caused by mutations in cis- regulatory regions than intraspecific differences. Across drosophila species highly conserved blocks not only in the histone fold domain but also in N-terminal tail of centromeric histone H3 (CenH3) demonstrate recurrent evolution by purifying selection. In fact very similar oligopeptides in the N-terminal tails of CenH3 have also been observed in humans and in mice. Many divergent eukaryotic lineages have recurrently evolved highly AT-rich genomes. GC-rich genomes are rarer among eukaryotes but when they evolve independently in two different species the recurrent evolution of similar preferential codon usages will usually result. \\"Generally, regulatory genes occupying nodal position in gene regulatory networks, and which function as morphogenetic switches, can be anticipated to be prime targets for evolutionary changes and therefore repeated evolution.\\" References Evolutionary biology ","title":"Recurrent evolution"},{"id":"41123644","text":"Tuska Mahallehye Qasemabad (, also as Tuskā; also known as Tuskā Maḩalle) is a village in Owshiyan Rural District, Chaboksar District, Rudsar County, Gilan Province, Iran.

Aegyo literally means behaving in a flirtatious, coquette-ish manner and it is commonly expected for both male and female k-pop idols to behave this way. However, it is not uncommon for everyday people to behave in such a way, and is widely used as an expression of affection to loved ones, families, and friends. Aegyo can also display closeness with others, which can possibly bring people together. The word is often translated as cuteness in English and can be compared to the Chinese concept of sājiāo 撒娇, or the Japanese concept of kawaii or to the Japanese equivalent, . Background Aegyo plays a huge role in South Korean popular culture, especially in idol girl groups. The higher-registered girl voice popular in girl groups in Korea has been dominant since the first successful female k-pop group S.E.S. emerged in 1997. This style has grown in popularity since then. A famous example of that exaggerated cuteness that is aegyo is the Girls' Generation music video for \\"Gee\\", which features much use of hands pointing at, touching and framing the face when showing the girls in turn. The first of their many song and dance videos, many of Gee's dance moves are based on aegyo. Aegyo as a personal trait of Girls' Generation member Sunny was described as \\"cuteness that calls for a punch,\\" not as an actual complaint, but as a recognition of the degree to which aegyo can be taken. Although more common among female idol groups, male groups often perform aegyo as part of their fanservice. The maknae, or youngest member of a group, is often (but not exclusively) the one encouraged to perform aegyo. Another member may get a better response from fans, or be better suited due to physical or emotional characteristics. For some performers, aegyo is merely an extension of their own normal behavior, encouraged by the groups' producers. As performers evolve from \\"youth\\" to \\"young adult\\" images, the aegyo in their performances often evolves, becoming an almost-nostalgic homage to the performers' earlier stage image. They will \\"put on the character\\" briefly for fun and to satisfy fan expectation, in the same way they will sing their earliest hits. Some traces of aegyo will continue as persistent traits. A pro-forma version of aegyo may become tradition for certain circumstances, such as when idols perform the \\"Gwiyomi\\" song, with actions made popular by the South Korean rapper Jung Ilhoon of BtoB. Puzar argues that aegyo in popular culture affects how young South Korean women act, especially in romantic relationships. Using cute hand gestures and expressions in photos, for example, are commonly seen behaviors in many young women in South Korea.Puzar, Aljosa. “Asian Dolls and the Western Gaze: Notes on the Female Dollification in South Korea,” Asian Women 27.2 (2011): 81-111.

History In 1972, on the recommendation of Governor A. Linwood Holton, Jr., the Virginia General Assembly established the Virginia Governor's Cabinet, which included a Secretary of Transportation and Public Safety. On April 12, 1976, the General Assembly established two separate secretariats for transportation and for public safety, effective July 1, 1976. The secretariats were merged again from 1984 to 1990 only to be split up again. The next major change to the office would not be until 2014, when Governor Terry McAuliffe transferred duties related to homeland security from the Virginia Secretary of Veterans Affairs to the Secretary of Public Safety.

She was named for Moresby Island, which in turn is named for Fairfax Moresby, former Commander-in-Chief of Pacific Station at Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard. Prior to her acquisition by Canada, Moresby served as the offshore supply vessel Joyce Tide, built by Allied Shipbuilders of Vancouver, British Columbia. Joyce Tide was acquired by the Canadian Forces for conversion to a minesweeper and as a training ship for naval reservists. With the entry into service of the s, Moresby was sold to commercial interests, returning to her previous career. The ship was renamed several times, most recently Ramco Express in 2007. Design The ship was initially constructed for use as an offshore drill-rig supply vessel by International Offshore Services. As a supply vessel, Jean Tide was with a deadweight tonnage of 1,196 tons. The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The Anticosti class was powered by four NOHAB Polar SF 16RS diesel engines driving two shafts creating and one Gil Jet azimuth bow thruster. This created a maximum speed of and an endurance of at . The vessels were rated as ice class 3 and suitable for employment in light ice. The vessel was purchased in 1988 by Maritime Command (MARCOM) of the Canadian Forces and converted into a minesweeping auxiliary. In military use the vessels had a complement of 5 officers and 18 ratings. The two ships of the class were equipped two Racal Decca navigation radars operating on the I band. For minesweeping purposes, they were provided with mechanical minesweeping equipment and a high frequency, towed side scan variable depth sonar. Service history The ship was laid down as Lady Joyce by Allied Shipbuilders Ltd. of Vancouver with the yard number 180 and launched on 11 November 1972. The ship was completed on 24 April 1973 and was renamed Joyce Tide in 1974. As part of the plan for the Naval Reserve to take over minesweeping and coastal operations, MARCOM began its effort to provide ships for training. MARCOM acquired two ships, one being Joyce Tide in March 1988. The ship was converted at Marystown, Newfoundland to an minesweeping auxiliary and commissioned with the classification MSA 112. The mechanical sweeps, sonar and navigation systems were added in April 1990. In March 1997, the ship transferred to CFB Esquimalt. After the was commissioned, Moresby was identified as surplus and paid off on 10 March 2000 and turned over for disposal. Sold in 2000 for commercial use, her name was changed to Echo Star 2000 to 2002. In 2002 the vessel became Malbun, and later that year, her name was changed back to Echo Star. This name lasted until 2004 when her named was changed again to Silver Star. In 2005 the vessel's name was changed back to Echo Star, then back again to Silver Star, a name she kept until 2007. In 2007, the vessel was renamed Ramco 1 and then again to Ramco Express. Moresby is now a commercial tug in Panama.

March 2002: pg. 5–14.  Socioeconomic factors and prevalence  Indigenous peoples are at a higher risk than non-Indigenous peoples to experience food insecurity. Indigenous people have approximately double the chances of a non-Indigenous person to experience some aspect of food insecurity in their lifetime. Food insecurity is directly linked to being in a low-income household. Indigenous people on average experience lower socioeconomic status than non-Indigenous peoples. Since there is no program to incentivise healthy foods in Canada, there is a greater incentive for Indigenous persons to purchase processed foods, which can lead to serious health problems. Foods purchased in grocery stores have become increasingly important to all people but even more so to remote Indigenous communities. The price of foods in grocery stores is also a focal point in food insecurity for Indigenous peoples. In one community it was the consensus that the price of market foods in a northern community are very high and that there needs to be government-implemented policies that will help lower the cost of food in more remote locations. The prevalence of food insecurity is also higher in Inuit households with as much as 80% of families experiencing food insecurity.Beaumier, Maude, Ford, James D. \\"Feeding the Family During Times of Stress: Experience and determinants of food insecurity in an Inuit community.\\" The Geographical Journal. March 2011: 177(1) pg. 44–61. The high cost of food for Inuit families is also a large concern. In a study conducted it was found that a basket of food for a family of four in Igloolik was $551 and the cost of for the same amount of food for a family in Montreal was $238.  Accessibility and availability  There are many factors that influence the accessibility and availability of food choices. Accessibility and availability of food are the most important aspects of food security. Indigenous food security may be negatively affected by loss of traditional hunting practices. The food supply that comes from hunting and fishing could be declining due to the access to the land and hunting territories. The cost of food is also a determining factor in food availability. The high cost of food maybe a serious issue for low-income families. A talking circle to obtain information firsthand from Indigenous communities about the accessibility to healthy food was conducted in a small northern Ontario community and gives a clearer picture of the reality that these Indigenous families go through to obtain food. The circle concluded there is disconnect with traditional food practices and the younger community that needs to be acknowledged. He stated that the food that the community eats now is causing poor physical and mental health. Other barriers for obtaining a steady diet of traditional food include hunting equipment costs, transportation, and a lack of knowledgeable hunters and fishers are just some of the reasons consumption of traditional food has proven to be difficult. The use of land using non-traditional techniques, such as those found in mining and logging, affect the availability of appropriate food sources. The main concern of the community was the loss of knowledge of traditional food practices between generations. Younger members of the community are not being taught to hunt, fish, gather or prepare the traditional foods that their ancestors ate and that are integral to a strong and healthy community. Increased development also leads to changing animal migration patterns as well as decrease in animal population and this again will influence the amount of land-based food that can be obtained through traditional ways. The location of an Indigenous community has a large impact on the prevalence of food insecurity in that particular place. Northern communities are at a greater disadvantage than Indigenous communities that are located close to urban centers. The price of market food is higher in more remote communities because of transportation costs. Certain Inuit communities are even more disadvantaged than others because climatic changes that affect hunting and fishing have only been recorded in certain communities.Chan, Hing, Wesche, Sonia. \\"Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change on Food Security among Inuit in the Western Canadian Arctic\\". EcoHealth. September 2010: 7(3), pg. 361–373.  Health concerns  In Nunavut the average life span is approximately 12 years lower than the average Canadian. This is for a number of reasons such as access to healthcare, lower average of socioeconomic standing, poor quality of housing, and the quality of basic services such as drinking water and affordable food. The studies done in this area are very limited but there has been some information collected. The project Climate Change and Health in Nunavik and Labrador looked at the impacts on health in these communities due to changing climates and access to land-based food sources such as fish, geese and seals. There is concern for the senior citizens in these communities because they cannot go and hunt for themselves but still rely on land-based sources of food. Food security for urban Indigenous people is also important to look at. Not having proper access to food can lead to a number of health issues such as low birth weights, developmental delays, depression, anxiety and suicide. These issues are already pressing in Indigenous communities and a lot could be done to help with more equal access to food. High rates of diabetes are a large indicator of the food that Indigenous people are ingesting. There has been a change in diet from traditional foods to European foods and medicine. The members of this northern Ontario Indigenous community stated their preference for wild meat and berries because they believe it is healthier than store-bought foods. The cost of food is also high unless the person is purchasing processed \\"junk foods\\". These types of foods can lead to a decline in physical health and this is not the preferred diet of a traditional Indigenous person. There are certain essential nutrients that are especially of concern in Indigenous diets: protein, zinc, vitamin D, iron, omega 3 fatty acids, and selenium. These influence a person's physical health as well as their mental and emotional health. The caribou and other traditional foods are excellent sources of these nutrients.  Impact of climate change  The loss of ice roads is detrimental to hunting patterns of Inuit communities. Climate change is a serious concern in Canada's northern territories. This region has already felt the impacts of the change of environment on their food supply. There are very distinctive Indigenous cultural groups in the north and they are the Yukon First Nation, Dene, Metis, Gwich’in, and Inuit. Approximately 70% of Indigenous adults in the North hunt and fish as a means of sustenance and 96% of those adults rely on the food they receive from natural resources. Climate change has been found to have an impacts on the movement of animals and the hunting conditions. Sea ice travel is a main component of hunting for Inuit people. They must travel across ice roads to gain access to wildlife resources. If the ice is not as strong or does not reach as far than this results in less hunting time and a lesser chance of bringing home a substantial amount of food. The implications of less hunting time have a severe effect on the nutritional value of the Inuit diet. The decreased ice road time also hinders the delivery of market foods and increases the price of these staples when other modes of transportation (such as flying) have to be employed. Other weather conditions such as increased winds, higher rainfall records, decreased snowfall, lack of extreme cold temperatures, increased coastal erosion, decreased animal population growth and lower fresh water levels all contribute to food insecurity in certain northern Inuit communities. Establishing a community based food supply is a viable option for northern and remote Indigenous communities because it ensures that everyone is meeting the nutritional needs that are essential for survival. These communities need to adapt to the changing environment or their food security will decline substantially.

History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1308, but the old stone church was likely built around the year 1150. In 1890, the old church was torn down and replaced on the same site with the present church. The arch from the choir of the old church was saved and is now used as an entrance gate to the church cemetery. Stone from the previous church was used to build the foundation of the present building as well. The new church was consecrated on 9 September 1891 by the Bishop Fredrik W. Hvoslef.

Synopsis The book follows the development of Toronto's earliest professional hockey teams, particularly the Toronto Professional Hockey Club (1906–09) and the Toronto Blueshirts (from 1911). Prior to this, the development of professional teams was fiercely opposed by the Ontario Hockey Association and by Toronto Telegram publisher John Ross Robertson. Publication Harper wrote the book over an eight-year period. It was released on 5 November 2013 by Simon & Schuster. Proceeds from the book's sales support the Canadian Forces Personnel and Family Support Services. The book also covers other aspects of the early- century game such as the development of artificial ice rinks. Reception Perry Lefko's negative review in Quill & Quire deemed that the book \\"reads like a long-winded essay or thesis from a hockey historian\\". Globe and Mail reviewer John Allemang noted that \\"[v]erbal amateurism apart, it's enjoyable to catch traces of a more boyish, playful Stephen Harper\\". The Toronto Star review of the book also noted the academic style of the book but indicated the presentation of early 20th-century hockey provided a \\"historical perspective that has received scant attention among all the books devoted to hockey\\".

It was originally described by Wilhelm Peters in Monatsberichte der Akad. Wiss. Berlin, 1852. This species grows to a maximum length of and can weigh up to . The dorsal fin is more than twice the length of the anal fin. The dorsal origin is nearer to the tip of the snout than to the caudal fin base.  Ecology  It primarily feeds on weeds and insects, but also on small vertebrates, such as small fish and fish eggs. They hunt using electricity and can give a mild electric shock to defend itself. = Range and habit = M. longirostris can be found in abundance across the plains of Africa in freshwater habitats, including the lower and middle Zambezi, lower Sabi and Ludi rivers and in the Luapula-Moero-Bangwelo (Zambian Congo system). It inhabits the Ruvuma and Rufiji rivers in Tanzania, lakes Malawi, Tanganyika and Rukwa and other eastward-flowing rivers in Tanzania. The species lives in caves and muddy areas with soft bottoms. It hides in weeds and characteristically forms small shoals.  Life history/behavior  Active mostly at night, it breeds during the summer rainy season, moving upstream in rivers after water has receded, with migrations at irregular intervals. Females carry 10,000–70,000 eggs at a time.  Relationship to humans  The fish is harvested for food with bait and hook.  Status  The eastern bottlenose mormyrid is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

With the Falcon and a few other models, Gibson was ahead of Fender in bringing an amplifier with reverb on the market. In addition, the Falcon also had tremolo. The Falcon got 14 watts out of two 6V6 tubes (the same tubes used in the comparable Fender Deluxe), and had a Jensen 12\\" speaker. The pre-amp was powered by three 6EU7 tubes, and a 7199 for the reverb circuit. Unlike Fender's later reverb amps (such as the Princeton Reverb), the Falcon had a fairly unusual placement of the reverb circuit: rather than being placed after the pre-amp section and having the wet signal mixed with the dry, the Falcon's reverb circuit taps the signal before the volume and tone control, and mixes it with the dry signal via independent volume controls. In addition, the Falcon had a separate monitor output at line level, to connect the amp to a separate \\"Regular Amplifier\\" (the Falcon being referred to in the brochures as \\"Reverb Amplifier\\") and create a stereo effect. The Falcon's sound is described as \\"full, rich\\" and \\"sweet-sounding\\", with a \\"raw, gnarly, compressed tone\\" at higher volumes. It is relatively rare: according to Gibson's records 204 were sold in 1961; the next year, the Crestline design was introduced, involving a redesign of the control panel as well as the circuit. References There were three variants of the Crestline version of the Falcon, all with similar specs that lasted until 1965-1966. The next version of the Falcon, and the last tube version was released in 1967-1968. This last version was similar in specs to the previous versions but had different cosmetics, with a taller cabinet sporting a larger front mounted control panel with two rows of knobs. This version used 4x 12ax7, and 2x 68q5 tubes, with a solid state rectifier. Few of this version were made. There was also a solid state version of the Falcon released in the early 1970s.

Hydrofuramide is a crystalline solid with a melting point of 118-119 °C. The molecule may be described as a diimine with three pendant furanyl rings. Hydrofuramide is a versatile specialty chemical with applications in diverse areas, including rubber additives, pharmaceutical intermediates, preservatives and rodenticides.  Synthesis  Hydrofuramide was prepared in 1960 by Kapur via the reaction of furfural with aqueous ammonia in chilled ethanol solution.  Reactions  The reactive imine double bonds of hydrofuramide are easily reduced. Reduction with aqueous sodium borohydride yields N,N-bisfurfuryl-2-furylmethanediamine, useful as an antihypertensive drug compound.Gustav Sotek, “N,N-bisfurfuryl-2-furylmethanediamine, its production and use in pharmaceuticals”, World Patent 8704160 (1987) Catalytic hydrogenation of hydrofuramide with Raney nickel in the presence of ammonia in ethanol yields mixtures of furfurylamine and difurfurylamine. By contrast, hydrogenation in acetic acid-ethanol, employing platinum oxide catalyst yielded the tertiary amine tri-furfurylamine after neutralization. Furthermore, lithium aluminium hydride reduction of hydrofuramide yields furfurin, a tetracyclic compound.  Applications  =Rubber vulcanization= Hydrofuramide has shown effectiveness as a synergist with zinc stearate, in enhancing the rate of vulcanization of styrene-butadiene rubber. Similar synergistic effect was seen in the vulcanization of natural rubber with hydrofuramide-sulfenamide activator, where introduction of hydrofuramide reduced induction time, scorch time and optimum cure time. =Raticide= Hydrofuramide has been found to be selectively toxic to rats. For all types of rats the lethal dose is 1 g/kg body weight. The chemical is less toxic to guinea pigs and has little or no toxicity to swine, dogs, cats or birds. =Food technology= Development of a pink color in a modified Badouin test, employing hydrofuramide, is diagnostic for adulteration of butter with cheap hydrogenated vegetable oil.

Bhrigu was one of the mind-born sons of Brahma the creator who was given the honorific of Bramharishi. She was a very virtuous and devoted wife. When she was pregnant with his child, Bhrigu on his morning ablution visit (it is also said that he went out to perform religious rites) to the river had entrusted her to the care of Agni (the fire god). However, at that time a demon named Puloman came to the ashrama (hermitage) of Bhrigu and saw Puloma who had been betrothed to her in the past. He then made an attempt on her modesty and claimed that he had the right to marry her and carry her away as he had asked for her hand in marriage from her father but her father instead had married her off to Bhrigu. He tried to abduct her, after Agni had confirmed to him that she was Bhrigu's wife who had married her as per Hindu scriptural rites in his presence. Hearing this, Puloman, who was besotted with Puloma's beauty, switched his form in to a boar and abducted her. Frightened by this development, Puloma gave birth to her son who fell on the ground. In other versions of the legend, the child removes himself from the womb. This son was named Chyavana meaning the \\"fallen from the womb\\". The child was shining very bright like the Sun and looking at the baby Puloman was scorched to death leaving behind Puloma and her son. In Mahabharata Chyavana son of Bhrigu and Puloma In Mahabharata, as narrated by the bard Sauti, Puloma was the wife of sage Bhrigu and they were staying in a hermitage. She became pregnant. One day Bhrigu went for his morning ablutions in the river leaving his wife in the ashram at the care of Agni. At that time a rakshasa by name Puloman, who had earlier loved Puloma and had been betrothed to her, came to the ashram and saw Puloma and he was besotted by her beauty. Puloma, as a virtuous wife of Brighu and a host, treated him like a guest and offered him refreshments in spite of his lustful glaring at her. But Puloman enamoured by her beauty wished to abduct and marry her. He then saw Agni, the flames of the sacrificial fire burning in a chamber in the hermitage. Puloman then asked Agni to tell him truthfully the status of Puloma whom he had accepted as his spiritual wife. But Agni was reluctant to reveal the truth as he was scared that Bhrigu would curse him if he told the truth. But on Puloman's insistence, Agni told him the truth that Brighu had married Puloma as per Vedic scriptural rites in his presence as she had only been betrothed to him (rakshasa) and not formally married to her. Hearing this Puloman changed his form to a boar and abducted Puloma. Frightened by this development, Puloma gave birth to her son who fell on the ground. This son was named Chavana also spelt Cyvana meaning the \\"fallen from the womb\\". The child was shining very bright like the Sun and looking at the baby Puloman was scorched to death leaving behind Puloma and her son. (in another version it is said that he was terrified by looking at the child and ran away dropping Puloma on the ground) Puloma, overcome by her plight, cried intensely to the extent that the tears she shed created a river called Vadhusaras which later became the location of the hermitage of her son Chavana when he had become a sage with immense ascetic achievement. Brahma consoled her. Puloma then came to her ashram and appraised Bhrigu of the events that had happened with her and her son. While Bhrigu was happy to see his son, he was enraged to know from Puloma that it was Agni who had revealed her true identity as Bhrigu's wife to Puloman who was now dead, turned into ashes by their son's brightness. In a fit of rage he cursed Agni saying \\"Thou shalt eat of all things\\", meaning to become \\"omnivorous\\" or “May you be consumer of all things \\"Sarva Bhahshaka on this Earth\\". Agni also became furious to hear this curse and told Bhrigu that his curse was not just as he only spoke the truth. Agni told that he was omnipresent and through his mouth both the gods and the ancestors (pitrus) accept the clean oblations of clarified butter offered to him and hence any offering of unclean things to him would be improper. He also told Bhrigu that he could also curse him but he refrained from doing so as he was a rishi and a Brahmin. With these words Agni went incognito. Brahma then summoned Agni to his presence and recounted Agni's role in the universe and told him that the curse stands modified as his flames would only consume everything offered to him but his physical body would remain pure. Then Agni reappeared in the universe to perform his natural duties. In Padma Purana In another version in Padma Purana (pa 14) it is said that when Bhrigu was searching for samidhas (firewood) for offering to the fire god, the demon Damana went to Bhrigu’s ashram looking for the rishi’s wife. Agni, seeing Damana, became frightened and disclosed Puloma’s hideout in the ashram. When Bhrigu came back and came to know of Agni’s action, he cursed him but later agreed to reduce its effect to some extent.

He made his American debut at the Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia in 1792, played the role of Belcour in The West Indian.The Oxford Companion to American Theatre, p. 312 (3d ed. 2004) Hodgkinson was \\"certainly the finest actor who had appeared in America up to his day.\\"Highfill, Philip H, et al. A Biographical Dictionary of Actors ... Volume 7, p. 351 (1982) He became the leading performer in America for the next ten years, and in 1800, he and his wife became the highest paid actors in the country ($70 to him a week, and $50 to his wife).Harbin, Billy J. Hodgkinson's Last Years: At the Charleston Theatre, 1803–05, Theatre Survey, (November 1972, Vol. 13, Issue 2) Hodgkinson had a ruthless reputation on the business side, eventually forcing Henry and Hallam out of their theatre management positions. Frances died of tuberculosis in Philadelphia on 27 September 1803, and was buried at St. John's cemetery in Manhattan next to her sister Arabella. John acted two season in Charleston, South Carolina, and died of yellow fever in Bladensburg, Maryland on 12 September 1805.  Career  John Hodgkinson, formally known as John Meadowcroft, was an American actor/singer who began work at 15 years old. He started as an acting apprentice in the English provinces in the year 1781. After discovering his interests in the arts, he decided to move to America and make a career out of acting. In September 1792, he moved to New York and began work. He quickly became known as one of the most versatile actors in the business. By 1794, he became a co-manager of New York's Old American Company and worked along with Lewis Hallam. In 1796, William Dunlap bought a quarter of the company and began to work alongside Hallam and Hodgkinson. In 1797, Hallam resigned and left the business to Hodgkinson and Dunlap. William Dunlap worked as Hodgkinson's partner for the next 5 years. In 1798, Hodgkinson began to additionally manage the Boston Federal Street Theater. The roles he played would vary between tragedy, comedy, and even opera. He was praised for his powerful voice and began his career as a singer as well. A year later, he withdrew from co-managing and began working under Dunlap at the Old American Company. In July 1800, Hodgkinson began to perform alongside his wife and Mrs. Hallam at the Summer Theater. Owned by Joseph Coree, the theater was located on the Leonard street corner of Broadway. In this theater, Hodgkinson performed in many plays; such as \\"Five Hundred a Year\\" and \\"Columbus's Daughter.\\" Hodgkinson died shortly after in the year 1805.

Launched in 1978, this highly affordable product delivered a good quality sound, which acquired a reputation as an audiophile amplifier of exceptional value. By 1998, the NAD 3020 had become the most well known and best-selling audio amplifier in history.  History  Launched in 1978 when the principal preoccupation of hi-fi manufacturers was power output, the sub-£80 (US$135) low-powered solid state amplifier, created and marketed by a then little-known manufacturer, gained a reputation for excellent sound quality and exceptional value. Stereophile magazine called the \\"ridiculously inexpensive\\". It was the first integrated amplifier built with convincing ability to drive difficult loudspeaker loads, and a sound quality that far exceeded other integrated amplifiers at its price point for the time. In an era when the NAD's rated power output of 20 watts per channel continuous into 8 ohms was considered anaemic, the manufacturer claimed it could deliver much stronger power output into lower impedances under dynamic conditions (music or peak power output). Indeed, it is capable of delivering 40 watts into 8 ohm, 58 watts into 4 ohm, and 72 watts into 2 ohm loads for a limited time if pushed. The amplifier's main appeal was its inherent musicality, its ability to drive difficult speaker loads, and to allow audiophile grade source components to excel. Launching the product in the US at the Consumer Electronics Show, the company wired up a battery of loudspeakers in a way which presented an impedance of 1.1 ohm, and the amplifier experienced no problems. Similarly, at its London launch, NAD successfully demonstrated it driving the Linn Isobarik, whose impedance characteristics are known to be very challenging for amplifiers. It was the best-known and best-selling amplifier in the annals of hi-fi. The revolutionised the amplifier segment of the hi-fi industry. = Design principles = Bjørn Erik Edvardsen, NAD's director of advanced development, set out to create an \\"inexpensive amplifier ... easily capable of driving the very best loudspeakers\\". NAD eschewed the laboratory test equipment thinking, which was prevalent at the time, and instead aimed to make their amplifiers capable of properly driving \\"real loudspeakers\\" under realistic conditions. This paradigm shift gave rise to an amplifier that cost less and sounded better. NAD was able to achieve a low cost base by foreign manufacture. The company designed the product in Europe and had it produced in factories in Taiwan – it was one of the first manufacturers to de-localise production to Asia. The design, and models following it, included \\"soft-clipping circuitry\\" that protects against over- driven signals, connections that allow splitting of the power amplifier section from the preamplifier, and \\"Full Disclosure\\" power ratings measuring output power under real-world loads.  Audio circuitry  The has four inputs that can be switched via the front panel – Aux, Tuner, Phono, Tape. The manufacturer claims the phono input, which can also be used with high-output moving coil cartridges, contains a 6-transistor circuit \\"engineered for extremely low noise and nearly distortion-free performance\\". Reviewers note the pre-amplifier's \\"decent moving-magnet phono stage\\". The amplifier is bandwidth-limited, incorporating infrasonic and ultrasonic filters to supposedly reduce the effects of non-musical signals such as acoustic feedback, disc warps and electromagnetic interference on the musical signals. The amplifier has bass and treble tone controls which, according to the manufacturer, are \\"tailored for musically effective response in the high and low frequencies without altering the critical mid-range tonal balance\\". A loudness switch – de rigueur in that era – boosts upper and lower frequencies; a \\"mute\\" switch reduces volume by 20 dB for low-level listening. There is also a headphone socket mounted onto the front panel. According to the manufacturer, the is a high voltage design that uses the same large powerful output transistors (2N3055 and MJ2955) that \\"other manufacturers employ in their '60-watt' amplifiers\\", enabling the amplifier to deliver power headroom for musical transients. The \\"Soft Clipping\\" circuitry is intended to limit the output voltage so that the transistors do not distort when driven beyond its rated power. The innovative split of pre- and power-amplifier sections allows the use of the pre-amp stage to drive multiple power amplifiers in parallel, or use long signal cables to connect to remote power amplifiers or powered speakers. This facility became hugely popular with audiophiles, who would seek to isolate this \\"remarkably fine-sounding preamp section\\", to use with one or more external power amplifiers.  Power source  The amplifier has what the manufacturer calls a \\"dual-mode power supply\\", where the output stage is only loosely regulated, so it is free to supply the high voltages needed for musical transients and the large currents at lower voltages needed for driving low-impedance loads in the power amplifier circuitry. The design also incorporates a separate regulated power supply circuit, fed from a secondary winding on the transformer, dedicated to the pre-amplifier and tone control stages. It is thus claimed that intermodulation distortion and blurring of the stereo image due to power supply functioning cannot occur.  Styling  The styling of the resembled that of other budget amplifiers of the time, and it was available in charcoal grey or a much rarer silver. Stereophile commented that it was \\"inexpensive and looked it\\".. = Reception = The highly popular is considered one of the most important hi-fi components in the history of home audio. Sonically, it benefited from a design error where crosstalk between left and right channels presented better detail and more ambiance; the error was corrected in a later guise. Its sound is described by reviewers as dark and warm, with a \\"sweet and sensual midrange\\"; some reviewers observed a very noticeable rolling off at frequency extremes that may detract from sonic neutrality, and that its soundstage lacked precision but it was universally praised for its value for money. The amplifier was a hot seller, and the alone achieved a record 1.1 million units in its lifetime. The figure would be much higher if the sales of other amplifiers derived directly from its design are included. The quality made possible at a £79 (US$133) price tag opened up the market for budget yet quality amplifiers, and spawned similarly low-priced competitors such as ARCAM Alpha, Rotel 840, Mission , Pioneer A400, Denon and Marantz . In 2002 it ranked No. 19 in list of \\"The Hot 100 Products\\" by Stereophile. In 2011, The Absolute Sound placed it at No. 9 in their list of \\"The Ten Most Significant Amplifiers of All Time\\". The Absolute Sound remarked that this \\"iconic gem could embarrass amplifiers costing 10 times more with its big, warm and detailed sound and best of all, its affordable price made it available to a wider audience.\\" A retrospective review by Chris Martens said that the 3020 was not perfect, and while it may have been surpassed by other components according to other performance criteria individually, it was \\"better than any $200 integrated amp had any right to be\\". Martens complimented the quality of the electronic circuit design, noting in particular that the phono stage \\"sounded clearer and better balanced than many dedicated phonostages of the day\\". = Spin-offs and legacy = The newly launched NAD D 3020 hybrid digital amplifier in a shop in 2013 The sold half a million units in the first three years of its life, and the second-generation replacing it, which corrected some minor design errors, proved even more popular than its predecessor. Variants included the with high quality loudspeaker binding posts, , and an \\"almost identical\\" audiophile version dubbed , stripped of tone controls and with higher quality loudspeaker binding posts. The is an \\"improved\\" version of the that retailed at £149 (US$250) when it was launched in 1991. The receiver (tuner-amplifier), that included the amplification circuitry of the , received a mixed reception due to severe reliability issues. Following its release, and upon realisation that the product was much sought after for its pre-amplifier section, a preamp version of the was released under the name . The 3220PE and 3225PE (PE being 'Power Envelope') are further improved versions of the 3020E and 3020i respectively, sharing circuit boards with the 3020 models, the main change being a different \\"dual voltage\\" transformer and improved power supply design.NAD document relating to C316 model that has a minor text reference to the dual voltage design of the 3225PE. In 2013, the 40th year of the company, NAD launched a range of digital products, including a digital amplifier bearing the name .

The law is broken into 52 articles providing different institutions that enforce the law, as well as defining the various types of land to be redistributed, and how much is to be redistributed. Although there were land reform laws passed before, the 1970 Agrarian Land Reform Law took it further. This law reduced the maximum amount of holdings of land to between 10 and 150 hectares (1 hectare= 2.471 acres) of irrigated land and to between 250 and 500 hectares of non- irrigated land. The government also reserved the right to lower the holding ceiling and to get rid of old and new landowners through eminent domain.http://countrystudies.us/iraq/59.htm Article 1 Sets up the Supreme Agricultural Council, which will be responsible for redistributing state owned land. A cultivator is defined as someone who was assigned to cultivate an agricultural unit under the abolished Sirf-Miri Land Law No. 43 of 1951. A \\"tenant\\" is defined as the person with whom the owner of the land agrees on reclaiming and planting trees in a specific area for a specific period and under specific terms. A \\"peasant\\" is defined as any person that took up farming as a profession and who carries out land work in return for a certain share of the crop. An \\"agricultural laborer\\" is someone who works the land in return for wages. A \\"Landlord\\" is someone who owns the land as registered with the Tapu (Land Registration Department) or to whom the land is leased by Lezma. Article 2 Article 2 establishes the amounts given to areas that are considered \\"Rain-Irrigated Land\\" and \\"Irrigated Areas.\\" The areas of agricultural land possessed by a person Tapu-authorized or granted under long lease (rain-irrigated land, irrigated areas) shall not exceed the limits defined in article 2. Article 3 Establishes the regulations regarding how much land can be owned via inheritance and how the amount of land can change in cooperation with state activities. Article 4-6 Gives specifications regarding ownership and the control of land by the state if it goes over the stipulations in Article 2. http://faolex.fao.org/cgi- bin/faolex.exe?database=faolex&search;_type=query&table;=result&query;=ID:LEX- FAOC038269&format;_name=ERALL⟨=eng Results The Agrarian Reform Law of 1970 placed more limitations on the size of land holdings \\"and authorized the government to expropriate additional acreage from large landowners.\\" Cleveland, Bunton (2013). A History of the Modern Middle East. Boulder: Westview Press. The government redistributed most of the land seized under the law and gave it to landless peasants and small land owners, although some of the land was rented out. The redistribution was huge; \\"Between 1970 and 1982, 264,400 farmers received grants of land.\\" Although the original purpose of the land reform law had been to do away with large estates and to establish small owner operated farms, fragmentation of the farms occurred and this made mechanization of farms difficult to achieve. Therefore, in the 1970s, the government turned to collectivization and by 1981 the government established 28 collective state farms that employed 1,346 people and utilized 180,000 hectares of land. \\"In the 1980s, however, the government expressed disappointment at the slow pace of agricultural development, conceding that collectivized state farms were not profitable.\\" http://countrystudies.us/iraq/59.htm References Cleveland, Bunton (2013).

It links the suburb of Onerahi with the city of Whangarei and is approximately 5 km long. The causeway is built across the marshes and seabed of the upper Whangarei Harbour. It carries approximately 20,000 vehicles a day on Riverside Drive and is one of the regions busiest roads.http://www.wdc.govt.nz/TRAFFICANDTRANSPORT/ROADINGNETWORK/Pages/default.aspx History The Onerahi causeway was built between 1950 and 1953 by the Whangarei County due to a better link being needed between Whangarei and the areas of Onerahi, Parua Bay, Whangarei Heads and Whangarei Airport. The road that was existing at the time followed the northern shores of the Whangarei Harbour, with a series of small one lane bridges crossing the streams that entered the harbour, such as the Awaroa River, and Mackesy Stream. The old piles are still present today. The construction involved draining areas of the harbour, such as the area inland of Kissing Point, and building up the road surface to avoid flooding during Spring Tides. This resulted in the new road being straight, very flat and requiring 3 bridges to be built. The construction of the causeway also included the laying of council infrastructure, such as sewerage and water supplies to Onerahi, and the eventual closure of the waste treatment works at Onerahi. The completed works greatly improved travel to Onerahi, which was neglected when the Onerahi Branch Railway was closed in 1933. In 2016, a cycleway was constructed along the causeway and involved some widening of the reclamation. The 6km cycleway was built to link the Waimahanga Walkway and Hatea Loop, and reduce hazards to people walking and cycling from Onerahi to central Whangarei. http://www.wdc.govt.nz/TrafficandTransport/PublicTransport/Cycling/Pages/Onerahi- Shared-Path.aspx Future The causeway carrying Riverside Drive is a major arterial route, linking the growing populations of Onerahi and Whangarei Heads to Whangarei. Provisions are set aside to four-lane the road by 2025,http://www.wdc.govt.nz/TrafficandTransport/RoadingNetwork/RoadingProjects/Pages/default.aspx as it can become congested at peak times.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern- advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&objectid;=11098810 It is likely to be included into the planned Onerahi Bypass, when it is constructed.

House The house was built in stages, with the earliest log building portion constructed ca1790 by Robert Cooke. A two-story addition was completed ca1840 which included an entrance hallway. A detached kitchen with a stone chimney was built behind the house at the same time. Additional later alterations created a new room on the northeast side the house by enclosing a porch and connection the kitchen to the main house.

He has traveled extensively throughout the world documenting these art forms, and his personal archive of 100,000 slides may well be the most comprehensive of any individual mural and graffiti documentarian.  Early life  Prigoff was born in New York City, and graduated high school in 1944 at age 16, was an Honorable Mention Westinghouse Science Talent Search Winner, and was accepted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was an honor student all eight terms and an outstanding athlete in Track and Field. He received a \\"STRAIGHT T\\", the school’s highest athletic award. Graduating MIT in 1947, Prigoff moved into the business world and also took up squash, achieving many National rankings. He was National Champion of Squash Tennis seven times in the 1960s. Prigoff was elected to the Explorer's Club in New York City in 1967. In 1975 his name was included in a listing of 250 outstanding graduates of M.I.T. In the late 1970s, he worked with Mark Rogovin and Marjorie Benton, founders of the Peace Museum in Chicago and was an original Board Member for many years.  Corporate career  In 1947 Prigoff was employed in the factories of Shawmut Inc. in Stoughton, Massachusetts. He moved into sales in New York City, and later become President of his division, which was sold to Genesco. He was employed by Genesco for two years before being recruited as Executive Vice-President of Rosenau Bros. in Philadelphia. In 1970, he was recruited to be President of the Sportco Division of US Industries, and in 1975, he was recruited to become Senior Vice President of the Sara Lee Corporation in Chicago. At both USI and Sara Lee, his challenge was to restore profitability to companies purchased by conglomerates that had little experience in the businesses they had purchased. After five successful years with Sara Lee, Prigoff was recruited to join Levi Strauss in San Francisco as President of one of their divisions. The task was the same: To bring profitability and stability to a division that had grown too fast. After three years with Levi’s, Prigoff retired in 1984 at the age of 57.  Historian, author, photography career  In the early 1970s, Prigoff became interested in documenting public murals. He was intrigued by the community nature of the murals, their artistic merit, and their ability to address issues that were not normally found in newspapers, television, and other media. He travelled extensively amassing one of the largest documentations of this art form photographed by a single individual. Along the way, he could not help but notice the appearance of graffiti in New York City and Philadelphia. He began to document that as well. Prigoff noted the emergence of subway graffiti appearing \\"above ground\\", and was interested to see how it had spread across the country, and eventually worldwide. He wrote to his friend Henry Chalfant and suggested that Henry join Prigoff in tracking the art form around the world. Together they produced Spraycan Art, published in 1987. The book sold well over 250,000 copies and is now considered one of the seminal books in the study of modern-day graffiti. Many graffiti writers learned about the art form from reading Spraycan Art, and initially perfected their skills by studying styles found in the book. Prigoff later co-authored two books on traditional mural art with Robin Dunitz: Painting the Towns – Murals of California, and Walls of Heritage – Walls of Pride – History of African American Murals. Prigoff has written forewords and assisted in the publication of several books on the subject of graffiti art.Graffiti LA (2007 - Steve Grody) Harry N.

Walker discusses the history of the Objectivist movement started by novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, which he describes as a cult. Background The Objectivist movement began with a small group of Rand's confidants and students who supported her philosophy of Objectivism. This group was at first known informally as \\"The Collective\\", and later gained more structure in the form of the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), named after Rand's protege Nathaniel Branden, and a magazine that Rand and Branden co-edited. From its early days, Rand's following was sometimes criticized as a \\"cult\\". Gladstein cites articles titled \\"The Curious Cult of Ayn Rand,\\" \\"The Cult of Ayn Rand,\\" and \\"The Cult of Angry Ayn Rand,\\" and comparisons of Rand to Joan of Arc and Aimee McPherson. or \\"religion\\". Walker's book is another entry in this vein of criticism, and the first full-length book to focus entirely on the \\"cult\\" allegation. Walker worked on a two-hour radio program about Rand for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The program was called Ideas: The Legacy of Ayn Rand and aired in 1992. Walker used the interviews he conducted for that program when writing his book. Contents After Walker's introduction, the opening chapter discusses the dynamics of the movement during Rand's lifetime, including her behavior at NBI events and her relationships with her followers. The second chapter tackles directly the question of whether Objectivism is a cult, arguing that it displays elements of thought control and meets many criteria for a \\"destructive cult\\". The third chapter discusses the development of the movement since Rand's death, including the founding of the Ayn Rand Institute by Leonard Peikoff, and Peikoff's disputes with other movement figures. The fourth covers Rand's views on subjects such as art and human sexuality, and how these impacted her followers. Three chapters focus on individuals other than Rand. The first discusses her former protege and lover, Branden. The next covers her heir, Peikoff. The last of these chapters is about the most famous member of the Collective, former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan. Walker then turns to Rand's ideas, accusing her of dogmatism, ignorance, and flawed thinking. A chapter about her \\"dark side\\" describes her as hostile and domineering. Two chapters discuss Walker's theories about the origin of Rand's ideas. The first, \\"The Roots of Objectivism\\", discusses various influences and precursors that Walker believes contributed to Rand's ideas. The other discusses possible influences on Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged. The final chapter discusses Rand's legacy. Reception Kirkus Reviews says Walker is \\"too shrill, repetitive, and even snide\\", but nonetheless the book \\"does convey vividly the frightful mess that was Ayn Rand.\\" A reviewer for The Globe and Mail said the book is \\"often clumsily written\\", but nonetheless provides \\"an absorbing portrait\\" of the movement that offers \\"striking glimpses\\" of its participants. In a review for Liberty magazine, R.W. Bradford describes the book as overly one-sided in its hostility and accuses Walker of hyperbole, fallacies and factual errors. In The Guardian, David Cohen said Walker's book \\"may be even more hysterical than the movement he seeks to disparage\\". An overview of Rand's ideas aimed at businesspeople says the book \\"deserves a read, if only for its unremittingly negative interpretation of every facet of its topic.\\" In a bibliographical guide to Rand's works and the literature about her, Mimi Reisel Gladstein says Walker \\"often depends on innuendo, rather than logic\\" and concludes, \\"There is material of interest here, but one has to pick through a lot of muck to get at it.\\" In a review for the Objectivist magazine Full Context, Chris Matthew Sciabarra says that Walker has some \\"valuable insights\\" and \\"theoretical points [that] need to be grappled with\\", but his book \\"ultimately disappoints\\" because Walker \\"exhibits the characteristics of a tabloid journalist\\" and engages in \\"endless tirades, strung together in a rather disorganized fashion, amounting to a series of vitriolic ad hominems directed toward most of the major figures in Objectivism.\\" References =Works cited= 1999 non-fiction books Books about Ayn Rand Canadian non-fiction books English-language books Works about Objectivism (Ayn Rand) ","title":"The Ayn Rand Cult"},{"id":"41125189","text":"Invisible Chains: Canada's Underground World of Human Trafficking is a 2010 book about human trafficking by Benjamin Perrin.

The book was timed to be published within three weeks of the release of Joy Smith's proposal for the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. Perrin advocated adopting Smith's proposal, saying that Invisible Chains \\"shows that while traffickers have a plan, Canada doesn't,\\" and that the victims are the ones who suffer from the lack of a national action plan. Perrin promoted the book in Winnipeg, Manitoba in October 2010. Mark Milke of the Calgary Herald said that Perrin's book is \\"not an enjoyable read.

It focused on the struggle for the Polish throne between King Stanisław I supported by his Warsaw Confederation and Sweden, and the Russian-backed Sandomierz Confederation of Augustus II the Strong. The war ended with Stanisław's victory and the Treaty of Altranstädt in 1706 in which August II renounced his claims to the Polish throne. Stanisław's triumph would be short-lived, however, as by 1709 he would be forced to give up the throne to Augustus II once again. Background At the onset of the Great Northern War, Augustus the Strong was king of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony, having been elected in 1697. In 1699, he allied with the Russian tsar Peter the Great in the Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye and with Frederik IV of Denmark-Norway in the Treaty of Dresden, and joined their war with the Swedish Empire that followed in 1700 Soon, however, their alliance suffered a number of defeats, and led to Charles XII of Sweden invasion of Poland. Civil war The battle of Fraustadt 1706 Swedish successes (in particular, the Battle of Klissow) led to a growing number of Polish- Lithuanian magnates switching sides, culminating in the formation of Warsaw Confederation on 16 February 1704 and the election of Swedish-endorsed voivode of Poznań, Stanisław I, as the new Polish king on 12 July 1704. Augustus the Strong still enjoyed support of a Polish faction, the Sandomierz Confederation (formed on 20 May 1704), and about 75% of the Polish army. Augustus and his supporters declared war on Sweden, and joined the anti-Swedish Russian coalition at Narva on 30 August 1704. By October 1703 Augustus had to abandon Warsaw. A Russo-Saxo-Polish-Lithuanian army was then assembled at Polotsk (Polatsk, Połock, Polockas), another allied army in Saxony, and a third allied force commanded by General Otto Arnold von Paykull (Pajkul) advanced towards Warsaw, where Charles XII and Stanisław sojourned. Pajkul's Saxo-Polish- Lithuanian forces reached the outskirts of Warsaw on 31 July 1705, where they were defeated. The army at Polotsk was denied westward advance by Swedish forces under Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt. Thus, Stanisław was crowned king of Poland in Warsaw on 4 October 1705 soon afterward he and his supporters concluded an alliance with the Swedish Empire in the Treaty of Warsaw in November 1705. Augustus was not done yet. In early 1706 he approached Warsaw with a cavalry force and ordered Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg to move the army assembled in Saxony into Poland-Lithuania. Schulenburg was intercepted and defeated by Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld in the Battle of Fraustadt (Wschowa) on 13 February 1706. The army assembled in Polotsk had been moved to Grodno where it was tactically defeated and forced to withdraw eastwards around the same time. Charles XII then occupied Saxony, forcing Augustus to abandon both the Polish crown and his allies in the Treaty of Altranstädt on 13 October 1706 in which Augustus was forced to give up his claims to the Polish crown. Aftermath Stanisław's reign was short; in 1709 the Russians decisive victory at the Battle of Poltava undermined his position in Poland. Soon after the Swedish defeat, Stanisław I abandoned Poland, and Augustus resumed his position as the Polish king. Augustus position was backed up by the Russians, who would assume an increasingly dominating role in Polish internal politics following this conflict. In popular culture The civil war, together with a later War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738) in which Leszczyński challenged Augustus' son, was immortalized in a Polish saying \\"Jedni do Sasa, drudzy do Lasa\\" (lit. \\"Some to Sas, other to Las\\"; with \\"Sas\\" being Augustus nickname, and \\"Las\\", Stanisław's family name), denoting a state of division, disorder and anarchy. Another variant of the saying is \\"Od Sasa do Lasa\\" (lit. \\"From Sas to Las\\").

It stands near the junction of two ancient roads of eastern and southern Lyon, on the border between the Dauphiné and Lyonnais. It occupies a small hill (hence the name) created in Gallo-Roman times for flood protection and because of good visibility. The main buildings are flanked by towers and a round tower around an irregular quadrangle courtyard. The entrance to the south, has preserved battlements. In the eighteenth century, the western wall was replaced by a terrace and a chapel was still visible in the nineteenth century. The first records of the castle date back to 1476, when it was inhabited by Lord Jean de Villeneuve. The grandson of Jean de Villeneuve sold the castle in 1530 to Hugues Dupuy, who became known as seigneur de la Motte (Lord of La Motte) in 1554. The castle hosted several famous guests during the 1500s, including Louis XII and Marie de Médicis.

It is located within the Pantai Ria amusement park and has become a tourist destination, even though it is originally a worship place for Tridharma followers. The name of Sanggar Agung is derived from Indonesian language which can be translated as Great Hall. The main icon of this temple is a 20 meters tall statue of Guan Yin on the waterfront, as a symbol that this temple is dedicated to Nan Hai Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa or Guan Yin Bodhisattva of the South Sea. The giant statue was built after one of its employees saw a woman dressed in white walking on the sea as she was about closing the temple at night, believed as the appearance of Guan Yin herself. The other icon is the giant Phra Phrom statue covered with gold. History =Kwan Kong Bio= In the Moon Festival of 1978, on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese Calendar, a temple was built about 500 meters to the south of the current location of Sanggar Agung. The temple's name was Kwang Kong Bio (lit. Temple of Guan Gong). The location of this temple had been moved three times since, until Sanggar Agung was built in its current place.Quoted from Sanggar Agung's brochure. In 1999, the temple was officially moved to its present location as Sanggar Agung Temple. Some of the deities’ figurines at Sanggar Agung Temple was already placed in the older temple for some decades. =Construction of Sanggar Agung= Sanggar Agung Temple was built by the family of Soetiadji Yudho and was inaugurated by the time of Chinese New Year in 1999.

The giant statue of Guan Yin was built two years later. Architecture Yin force, female, negative, take, carry a cub. Yang force, male, positive, bring, carry a ball. The uniqueness of Sanggar Agung Temple is that this temple is built over the sea and shaped like a bay which is surrounded by mangroves. This temple occupies an area of approximately 4000 square meters with Bali-style building design combined with Javanese culture. Freddy H. Istanto, the Dean of the Faculty of Technology and Design of Ciputra University, said that the worship complex of Sanggar Agung is very interesting to be studied because its exterior design has unique multi-cultural charges. The roof of Sanggar Agung uses a strong blend of Javanese style despite the general character of the building is Balinese style. According to him, there is an impression that Sanggar Agung is deliberately brought the image of Indonesian traditional buildings so as not to get stuck with the common style of Chinese temple or vihara, moreover the architecture style of traditional Chinese. Nevertheless, the tradition of Chinese temple still visible at Sanggar Agung, the example is the round holes in the wall. Mr. Istanto stressed that Sanggar Agung can be regarded as \\"the representation of psychological and cultural harmony conditions of indigenous communities with Tri Dharma peoples\\". =Giant Guan Yin statue= The ocean gate of Sanggar Agung decorated with giant Guan Yin statue with Long Nu and Sancai, Four Heavenly Kings, and a couple of Chinese dragons Officially, Sanggar Agung claims that the Guan Yin statue that just stand on the east side of the temple has a height of 18 meters.

The land size is about 1.5 acres, while the main stupa building in the centre is 81 square meters. The construction of the stupa mostly used number nine, for it has its own meaning and to adjust the reference from the similar statue in Thailand. The Maha Brahma Stupa is surrounded by park with trees and four white elephant statues of four meters high in every corner of its yard.

It is on the left bank of the Seine and has been open to the public since 1978. The château is managed by the Centre des monuments nationaux. The old castle, was first recorded in 1369. It was surrounded by a moat (which is still visible) and belonged to the lords of Trainel, then to the Raguier family, followed by the Elbeyne and Bournonville families. Finally in 1710 Louis XIV gave it to Marshal Duke Adrien Maurice de Noailles. The old castle was demolished and a new manor house was built in 1754 according to a design by the architect François-Nicolas Lancret. The new structure was intended to be a hunting lodge. Notwithstanding that La Motte-Tilly was (and is) still described as a \\"château\\", the current building is in fact a house in the French baroque style, and is not fortified. In this it is similar to many other French country houses (for example the Château de Cheverny), and indeed houses elsewhere in Europe (such as Castle Howard in England, which is an unfortified stately home), where the nomenclature has expanded beyond the strictly accurate.

AFL career McDonald played VFL for North Melbourne affiliate Werribee during the 2013 season and attended North's preseason training camp in Utah. He made his debut in the opening round of 2014 against Essendon and played in all but 1 game of that season including the finals campaign. He was voted 3rd in Rising Star award behind Western Bulldogs' Marcus Bontempelli and Brisbane Lions' Lewis Taylor. McDonald played in the 2014 AFL finals series including North's elimination final win against Essendon, semi final win against Geelong where he was named in the bests picking up 20 disposals. McDonald also participated in North's heavy preliminary final defeat to the Sydney Swans at ANZ Stadium. In February 2015, McDonald revealed that he had suffered a stress fracture to his back during a match against the Brisbane Lions in Round 15 of the previous season. The injury threatened to develop into a fracture-proper and McDonald was unable to train between games. Despite his injury concerns, he was noted in the media for several acts of courage on the field especially a tendency to 'go back with the flight of the ball'. During North Melbourne's 2015 season McDonald played 14 games, kicking his first goal in North's Semi Final win over the Sydney Swans at ANZ Stadium. While many commentators called McDonald's 2015 season disappointing including McDonald himself, in 2016 he regained form as well as his place in the team's best 22. In a round 13 Friday night game however, during a chase-down run of Hawthorn's small forward Cyril Rioli, McDonald injured his hamstring sidelining him for 10 weeks.

It is called “Golap Shah’s Shrine”. Thousands of people show their devotion to this shrine everyday and make donations so that their desire can be fulfilled. There is one major bus stand situated in Gulistan, called the Gulistan (Fulbaria) Bus Station. Most of the buses here are public and the number of buses is very few according to the number of passengers. People often get on top of the bus as there are no longer spaces inside the bus.

Early career In 1996 Apiwan entered politics as a New Aspiration Party MP for the province of his birth. A close confidante of provincial godfather Sanoh Thienthong, Apiwan followed his mentor into the Thai Rak Thai Party and became the party's MP for Nonthaburi in the 2001 general election, a seat he would hold through all subsequent elections. He served as chief of staff to the defence minister from 2002 to 2004. Following Sanoh's resignation from Thai Rak Thai, Apiwan gravitated towards Thaksin Shinawatra's inner circle. Political career Following Pheu Thai's 2011 electoral victory Apiwan was at one point tipped to become the speaker of the house, but his close association with the UDD eventually forced the party to pick Somsak Kiatsuranont instead. In October 2012 Apiwan proposed that Charupong Ruangsuwan serve as leader of the Pheu Thai Party. His nomination went unchallenged. In early November 2013 Apiwan was among the seven Red Shirt MPs who voted to pass a controversial amnesty bill that would have pardoned those responsible for the army's massacre of UDD protesters in 2010. The bill met widespread opposition from both the UDD and the opposition, prompting the government to abandon it. The bill's retraction did not save the government, however. The opposition coalesced into the People's Democratic Reform Committee protest movement which proceeded to paralyse Yingluck Shinawatra's government and ultimately pave the way for a military coup on May 22, 2014. A lèse-majesté charge was filed against Apiwan in the immediate aftermath of the army's seizure of power, prompting him to flee to the Philippines, where he died of a lung infection on October 6. Controversies Apiwan believed that the legitimacy of the monarchy rests on the faith and goodwill of the populace, and was an opponent of Thailand's draconian lèse-majesté law, which, in his view, has been used without the king's consent. Apiwan was explicit in his approval of several known republicans or critics of the prevalent ultraroyalism, ranging from Red Shirt activist Sombat Boonngam-anong to the Nitirat Group, and had also praised Somsak Jeamteerasakul, the most brazen academic critic of King Bhumibol's monarchy, as a man of \\"consistent morality.\\" Such statements provoked calls for Apiwan to be investigated on charges of holding the monarchy in contempt, and ultimately brought about his arrest warrant. Apiwan believed that privy council president Prem Tinsulanonda was the chief architect of the 2006 coup. He alleged that Prem had cajoled General Sonthi Boonyaratglin into overthrowing Thaksin by deceitfully invoking the king's authority. Death Apiwan died with a lung infection on 6 October 2014 at Philippines with 65 year old.https://www.isranews.org/isranews- scoop/33419-%E0%B8%B7news_33419.html References Pheu Thai Party politicians 1949 births 2014 deaths United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship activists Thai politicians Deaths from lung disease ","title":"Apiwan Wiriyachai"},{"id":"41125667","text":"Sir William Norris (6 July 1795 – 7 September 1859) was the seventh Chief Justice of Ceylon and seventh Advocate Fiscal of Ceylon.

Grodno was a city of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at this time. The battle During the start of the Swedish invasion of Russia, Charles XII of Sweden was informed of Peter I's presence at the town of Grodno and immediately marched there with his vanguard of approx 800 men. While awaiting the rest of his army, Peter had 9,000 men for use in Grodno. 2,000 of these had been stationed near the bridge leading to the town. On his arrival, the Swedish king charged with his cavalry in a surprise to drive the Russians away. After a short but fierce fight, the Russians guarding the bridge retreated into the town. Shocked by the news of a sudden Swedish attack, Peter I, who was said to have been in danger of capture, ordered a retreat to Berezina with his army, leaving Grodno defenseless for Charles to enter only two hours later. Thus, the Swedish king, with his smaller army, forced a much larger Russian force away from their advantageous position. However, while discovering the numbers of the Swedish vanguard, Peter I immediately ordered 3,000 of his troops back in an attempt to recapture the town and possibly the Swedish king himself. As night fell and the soldiers were sleeping, the Russians reached the gates of Grodno, but were halted by the 30 men guarding there. As fighting arose, Charles and his men were alerted and a new fight took place inside the town which forced the Russian army back, once again, leaving many dead and wounded behind.Peter From, Katastrofen vid Poltava (2007), Lund, Historiska media. pp. 77.

Based on the play Concealment by Leonard Ide, the film is about governor's daughter and a state attorney general who are forced to keep their marriage secret after the governor is accused of a crime. Plot Attorney General Robert Sheldon and Ruth, the daughter of Governor W.H. Vincent have to keep their marriage a secret when investigator, Daniel Breeden, uncovers evidence that may show that the governor took a bribe from John F. Holdstock, an embezzling financier he pardoned. John's private secretary, Willis Martin, who deposited the bribe money in the governor's private bank account, tells Robert and Daniel that he knows of no business between John and the governor that would explain the money. Sheldon goes to the Governor's Residence to tell Ruth about the situation, and that he is obligated to present the evidence to a legislative investigation committee. Ruth is certain that her father did not take a bribe, and that John can explain everything, but they learn by phone from Daniel that John has committed suicide. The Governor is concerned about the allegations, but his financial backer, Jim Lansdale, calms him down, and takes him to lunch. Before he does he makes a phone call in which he learns that Sheldon is at the Governor's residence, but he does not tell the Governor this. In John's papers, Robert finds a typed note which apparently provides a motive for the bribe: \\"My dear friend John ... the expense of maintaining my sockfarm has exceeded the income during the year ... the time for the matter we discussed has come. W.H.V.\\" Robert rushes to show it to Ruth, and they decide to take it to police headquarters to be compared with a sample from the governor's personal typewriter. Lt. Tom Nigard shows them the comparison: both samples are definitely from the same machine. Ruth returns home to tell her father about the evidence, and he adamantly denies that he wrote the note, giving her his word of honor. That night, Daniel goes to John's office, where a very spooked Willis is still working. Daniel tries to calm him down, telling him \\"You have nothing to worry about, it's almost over. I've seen you through today as I promised, haven't I? ... You were splendid today in Robert's office. You just stick to your story and remember that I'm taking care of you.\\" Ruth goes to Robert's apartment to tell him that she's absolutely certain her father is innocent. While she is there, Sheldon's secretary, Hazel Normandie leaves for the day, planning to meet Daniel, her boyfriend, outside the building. As he walks up to her, Daniel is shot dead. Ruth has seen everything from the window, and knows that Hazel didn't fire the shot, but cannot tell the police because of her secret marriage to Robert: if it was learned that she was in his apartment at night, she fears that their marriage will be discovered. The police investigation of Daniel's murder determines that the gun used to kill him belonged to Hazel, the same gun that Daniel took from her earlier in the day, saying that he was all the protection she needed. At a raucous session of the legislature, Representative McPherson, from the party opposing the Governor, accuses both the governor and Attorney General Sheldon of withholding evidence from the investigative committee. They are staunchly defended by Representative Grosvenor, but McPherson demands articles of impeachment against the governor and intensive investigation of Robert. Ruth observes it all from the gallery. Hazel is standing trial for the murder of Daniel, with the case about to go to the jury, but Ruth still refuses to testify, knowing that the revelation of her secret marriage with Robert would end his career. With little time to waste, Ruth goes to the apartment of Willis, who appears to be cracking up. Willis admits to her that John didn't commit suicide, he was murdered, and says that he is willing to tell Robert so, but once at Robert's office he runs away; Sheldon puts out an alert for the police to pick him up. Now, with no other choice, he and Ruth head to the courthouse, where the jury is voting, and find Hazel's attorney. The judge reopens the case to allow Ruth to testify, and Hazel is acquitted. The next morning, Governor Vincent is annoyed that Ruth didn't tell him about the marriage, but understands that the circumstances necessitated it. With the governor's impeachment trial due to start soon, Jim Lansdale counsels the governor to resign, but he refuses. Meanwhile, the legislature demands that Attorney General Sheldon resign, but he, too, refuses. The police find Willis and bring him to Robert. Representative McPherson issues subpoenas for Willis and Robert to testify before the committee, where the existence of the typed letter apparently from the governor to John comes out. Willis admits that Daniel made him put the letter into John's files, and then sent him to John to demand the money he lost in John's crash. When John denied he had any money, Willis shot and killed him, and Daniel fixed it to look like suicide. The whole frame-up, according to Willia, is the work of Jim Lansdale, supposedly the governor's friend and financial backer: ever since the governor vetoed a highway bill that would have made him millions, Lansdale had been working to bring down his old friend. It was Lansdale who typed the letter on the typewriter in the governor's study. As the committee votes to drop the charges against the governor, Lansdale slowly leaves the room and kills himself. Afterwards, the governor gives his blessing to the marriage of his daughter and Robert, and they kiss.

Juuso Walfrid Walden (5 April 1907 – 19 November 1972) was a Finnish industrial leader and entrepreneur, long term CEO of Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat, the predecessor of United Paper Mills.  Early life and upbringing  Juuso Walden was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1907. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1925 from the Helsinki School of Economics and completed his studies later in England on paper marketing. Since his early years, Juuso Walden worked at the mills of United Paper Mills founded by his father, general Rudolf Walden. Juuso started as a trainee, soon rose to become Office Manager and later Corporate Sales Manager. In 1940 During the Winter War, Juuso Walden was appointed President and CEO when his father was nominated Minister of Defence of Finland.Viritual Museum of Jämsä river valley Juuso Walden 1907 - 1971Paper Industry Hall of Fame. Juuso Walden 2012 Inductee - Technology / Inventor Juuso Walden 1907 - 1971  Diffusion of United Paper Mills  After the death of Rudolf Walden in 1946, Juuso Walden was the head of the Walden family which was one of the two main shareholders of United Paper Mills together with the Björnberg family. The heads of the two families had differing views with regard to the development of the company and thus it was decided to divide the company into two halves early in 1952. The Björnberg's part, Myllykoski Oy, parted from United Paper Mills.  Juuso Walden’s era 1952–1970  Walden with Nikita Khrushchev at the Kaipola paper mill in 1957. Walden immediately began a major expansion of the new United Paper Mills (now UPM) because he expected strong growth in the global paper demand. The most important mill was the Kaipola newsprint and magazine paper mill, which became, in the early 1960s, the largest of its kind outside the North American continent. Gradually Kaipola mill concentrated on producing super calendared magazine papers. Under Walden's leadership, UPM was transformed into a multi-business company adding a wide and diversified paper and board converting business for export to the Soviet Union. Later, engineering works and a chemical factory were added to produce equipment and materials for the paper industry. The company also acquired some small mills in other countries, especially in Italy. These acquisitions were, however, not always economically feasible. Walden was especially interested in the welfare of the personnel. He became a very popular Big Boss when he got involved into building houses so that employees could live in homes of their own. He was also greatly interested in all kinds of sportsm especially football (soccer). Juuso Walden was a long time chairman of the Football Association of Finland. He hired several top-level athletes like Olympic Gold Medal Winners and World Champions to work for UPM. Juuso Walden was one of the most important and visible industrial leaders in Finland. Due to his activities, the paper mill towns of UPM such as Jämsänkoski, Kaipola and Valkeakoski became models for Finnish industry. Juuso Walden retired in 1970 and died in 1972 in Valkeakoski.  Personnel management in the factory communities in the era of Juuso Walden  Personnel management in the Valkeakoski paper mills community around 1924–1969 was dominated by Rudolf and Juuso Walden. This industrial community was managed in industrial paternalistic way. Although industrial paternalism had been abandoned in major part of the industry in the early 1900s. The central argument of this study is that Rudolf and Juuso Walden created a paternalist hold on the Valkeakoski industrial community, even if other industrial plants had already abandoned this idea. Walden's genuine goal was to create vibrant ideal communities around the factories. The problem was that the independent Finland was in its early stages and the nation was divided. After the Civil War of Finland the idea of ideal plant community was buried. United Paper Mills solution in this problem was to increase the satisfaction of the employees and give fatherly guidance to them. Rudolf Walden upheld a strong patriarchal tradition and Juuso Walden continued in his footsteps until he resigned.University of Jyväskylä Väitös: 14.12.

He is one of the founding fathers of the Biozentrum of the University of Basel.  Life  Joachim Seelig studied chemistry and physics from 1961 till 1966 at the University of Cologne. In 1968 he graduated with a doctorate under the guidance of Manfred Eigen at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen. As a postdoc he conducted research on electron spin resonance at Stanford University in 1968/69. In 1970 he moved as a postdoc to the Institute of Physical Chemistry at the University of Basel where he became a group leader and assistant professor in 1972. He became full professor in 1974 and in 1982 Professor of Structural Biology at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel.  Work  Joachim Seelig developed biophysical methods for studying the structure and thermodynamic properties of biological cell membranes. He investigated the interactions of proteins and lipids by EPR-spectroscopy, deuterium and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance, neutron diffraction and calorimetric methods. The quantitative characterization of the biological membrane became the international standard for further theoretical studies. His second field of research was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the human and animals. With C-13 NMR the metabolism in the human and animal brain could be traced in a non-invasive manner. With faster MRI imaging techniques the tonotopy of the human brain has been described.

Ferreira, formerly Milo (often stylized as milo) and Scallops Hotel, is an American rapper and producer from Kenosha, Wisconsin. He is currently based in Biddeford, Maine. Ferreira received modest popularity and a cult fanbase following the release of his first two projects, I Wish My Brother Rob Was Here and Milo Takes Baths, both of which received attention on Forbes. The recognition led to Ferreira being noticed by rappers Busdriver and Open Mike Eagle, later going on his first tour with them and signing to their label, Hellfyre Club. Ferreira's debut studio album, A Toothpaste Suburb was announced in March 2014 though it underwent numerous hiccups during rollout and problems with its release, eventually getting released in September 2014. The issues around release resulted with Milo founding his own label, Ruby Yacht (stylized RBYT), which he currently runs out of his record store, Soulfolks Records in Biddeford, Maine.  Early life  Ferreira was born in Chicago, Illinois on February 3, 1992 to parents under 21 who were high school dropouts and married. His parents were both from South Side, Chicago and shortly after his birth, got divorced. Ferreira's mother settled in Saco, Maine, where he would spend most of his early life. He was introduced to hip hop through his uncle, a battle rapper who goes under the name NIZM who showed him Nas. For high school, Ferreira moved with his father to Kenosha, Wisconsin. He participated in theatre in school and was always working on hip hop out of school. His father was often not home and at work so Ferreira frequented online forums to make friends, often on ProBoards. By the time he got to college, Milo had been to 13 different schools. He first began rapping as part of the Kenosha and a Wisconsin hip-hop trio Nom de Rap, which additionally consisted of rappers Nicholas J and AD the Architect. Following high school, he attended St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin for Philosophy. Milo has said he came up with his name at age 16 after reading the book The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster, although in a separate interview with everydejavu he states that his name is an acronym for \\"maybe i like owls\\", in reference to his first rap name being \\"wise owl, himself\\".  Musical career  In 2010, Nom de Rap released their first joint mixtape, Greatest Hits Vol. 1. Milo released his first solo mixtape, I Wish My Brother Rob Was Here in 2011. According to Ferreira, the project was recorded in his bedroom with gear he got over time and he called the quality of the recordings \\"rubbish.\\" The mixtape, which title is a reference to Del the Funky Sapien's I Wish My Brother George Was Here and Ferreira's deceased friend Robert Espinosa. The mixtape got attention from Forbes. Milo Takes Baths was released on February 2, 2012. Released three months after I Wish My Brother Rob Was Here and was a lot more refined than the mixtape, spending more time crafting it and attempting to stray from the nerdcore lane he had established himself into with his first project. The EP was once again praised byForbes. The song \\"Kenosha, WI\\" was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in a 2012 issue of the journal Postmodern Culture. Milo released two EPs, Things That Happen at Day and Things That Happen at Night, in January 2013. Following the release, Ferreira caught the attention of rapper Nocando and his label Hellfyre Club which included Ferreira's role-model's Busdriver and Open Mike Eagle. Ferreira had been talking to Busdriver and Open Mike Eagle since 2012 and they had notified Nocando of his presence when he was considering quitting rap music. He later signed and was taken on his first tour, which had Ferreira going to 25 cities. The Cavalcade mixtape followed in July 2013. In November 2013, he appeared on Hellfyre Club's compilation Dorner vs. Tookie. He released Poplar Grove (or How to Rap with a Hammer) under the moniker Scallops Hotel in November 2013. In June 2014, Ferreira moved with his friends Nedarb Nagrom and Safari Al to Los Angeles to be with his label and collective Hellfyre club. Upon arriving in the state, the \\"Moving to LA\\" tour was commenced, starting in St. Louis and ending in Sacramento. His first official album, A Toothpaste Suburb, was released on Hellfyre Club on September 23, 2014. Ferreira left Hellfyre Club shortly afterwards, stating his dissatisfaction with the rollout of his debut studio album A Toothpaste Suburb which led to him not getting paid from the preorder. After leaving Hellfyre Club, Ferreira had the choice to try to convince major label interest but decided to start his own imprint, Ruby Yacht which name comes from the Persian word for a collection of poems, rubaiyat. He later said, \\"I don’t have another option. No one wants to invest money in the art that I’m making, no one out here, except listeners, and that’s really dope.\\" After leaving Hellfyre Club, Ferreira remained in Los Angeles, moving from his previous apartment to a storage shed in Echo Park with friend Safari Al. The two spent seven days recording (Boyle) and Piles, an EP they finally mixed on the seventh day and released on December 17, 2015 under the name Red Wall. The two used the sales from (Boyle) and Piles to move to Oakland swiftly and then the full week sales to move back to Milwaukee to start working on his second album, So the Flies Don't Come, mainly due to the cheapness of Milwaukee and Los Angeles \\"[breaking] my spirit\\". So The Flies Don't Come was released on September 25, 2015 and was entirely produced by Kenny Segal. So The Flies Don't Come was followed with his first headling tour. The album was included on the year-end lists by Rolling Stone, Spin, The New York Observer, The Boston Globe, and Impose. In 2017, Ferreira announced his third studio album, titled Who Told You to Think??!!?!?!. The project was slated with an August 11 release date and was subsequently called one of the most anticipated albums of 2017 by Rolling Stone. As slated, the album was released through the Ruby Yacht label on 11 August 2017. Pitchfork placed it at number 19 on the \\"20 Best Rap Albums of 2017\\" list. His fourth studio album, Budding Ornithologists Are Weary of Tired Analogies, was released on September 21, 2018. On October 1, 2018, Ferreira announced that Budding Ornithologists Are Weary of Tired Analogies would be his final rap album as Milo. In that year, he also released a collaborative studio album with fellow underground rapper Elucid, titled Nostrum Grocers, under the group moniker Nostrum Grocers. On May 31, 2019, he released \\"Respectdue\\" under the new stage name R.A.P. Ferreira. His first studio album as R.A.P. Ferreira, titled Purple Moonlight Pages, released on March 6, 2020. Ferreira received praise from Pitchfork, with the publication giving the project a 7.7 rating out of 10. The rapper looked to take this project on the road, however the tour was cancelled on March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the announcement, Ferreira's team concluded, \\"take care of each other, all we got is us.\\" = Ruby Yacht = Ferreira founded his label, Ruby Yacht (stylized as RBYT) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Named after the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and Ferreira's grandmother, it is entirely self-owned by Ferreira and self-financed. Ruby Yacht is currently operated from Ferreira's record store, Soulfolks Records in Biddeford, Maine, which opened in April 2018. The store sells cassettes, vinyls, and CDs and mainly sells independent rap music. It is also the only record store in Biddeford, Maine. There are two other artists signed to Ruby Yacht, Ferreira's childhood friend and musician Safari Al and renowned Los Angeles recorder producer Kenny Segal. Ferreira hasn't signed any other artist, mainly due to indie rap's lack of numerous album deals and his personal beliefs.  Personal life  Ferreira is a vegetarian and currently lives in Biddeford, Maine. He moved to Los Angeles with his friends and frequent collaborators Safari Al and Nedarb Nagrom in 2014 to be closer to his then-label Hellfyre Club and moved to Boyle Heights and later, a storage shed in Echo Park following the break-down of the collective and the label being made defunct. Ferreira moved back to Wisconsin before deciding on Maine after his first headline tour. Speaking on his move to Maine, Ferreira said, \\"It's far away from everything. I'm a bit of a wild person. I like to be free, run around, holler, do weird shit. I don't like people looking at me. I need space.\\" He also said in an interview with Vulture that his marriage and his wife's pregnancy were big reasons for the move to Maine. Ferreira attended St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin, a liberal arts institution, studying philosophy. Ferreira dropped out of college after moving to Los Angeles, saying he was \\"trapped in college\\" to LA Weekly in 2013. Ferreira was married in 2016. In July 2017, Ferreira announced on social media that he had a son who was born in December 2016, later confirming in an interview with Vice.

Located in Bethesda, MD, the FNIH is an independent organization that raises private-sector funds, and creates and manages alliances with public and private institutions in support of the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The FNIH organizes and administers research programs, supports education and training of new researchers, manages educational events and symposia and provides support to patient care activities with the purpose of accelerating biomedical research and strategies against diseases and health concerns in the United States and around the globe.  Research Programs  The FNIH collaborates with government experts, industry, academia and not-for- profits on biomedical research programs to advance breakthrough scientific discoveries and to improve the quality of people's lives. Key research partnerships include: * Accelerating Medicines Partnership: The Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) brings together the resources of the NIH and industry to improve the understanding of disease pathways and facilitate better selection of targets for treatment. Through the partnership, research programs have been established across major disease areas including Alzheimer's disease, Type 2 diabetes and immune-mediated disorders (rheumatoid arthritis/lupus). One example is the AMP Type 2 Diabetes initiative, which enables researchers everywhere to search and analyze genetic and clinical information of individuals with Type 2 diabetes through a public portal. This open-source platform is intended to generate new understanding of the disease. * Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): The FNIH helps manage the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a public-private partnership that has profoundly influenced the understanding of Alzheimer's disease by identifying and validating biological markers that indicate its onset and progression. The study tracks volunteers at clinical sites with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease to create a widely-available database of imaging, biochemical and genetic data, which can lay the groundwork for Alzheimer's discoveries. By standardizing technologies and protocols, the study has improved clinical trial design and the understanding of the disease and its progression. Furthermore, ADNI's open-access data policy continues to be a model of successful data sharing in a pre-competitive environment. * Biomarkers Consortium: The Biomarkers Consortium (BC) is a public-private biomedical research partnership managed by the FNIH. Launched in 2006, the BC seeks to discover, develop and gain regulatory approval for biological markers to support new drug development, preventive medicine and medical diagnostics. The BC develops precompetitive, collaborative projects that include participants from the NIH, FDA, not-for- profit organizations, academic research organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In its first decade, the BC launched projects in 13 different disease areas, which has supported the advancement of six therapeutics in the drug development process and helped generate four separate FDA Guidance documents. * Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative & Continued Vector Research: The FNIH combats mosquito-borne disease through an extension of the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, which was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In ongoing partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the FNIH continues work through programs such as Vector-based Control of Transmission: Discovery Research (VCTR) and Support Functions for Development of New Technologies for Controlling Transmission of Mosquito-Borne Diseases. The FNIH helps conduct risk assessments, build infrastructure and develop business and governance plans to further research technologies to stop the spread of diseases such as dengue, malaria and the Zika virus. It also helps the scientific community explore the complex regulatory and ethical issues surrounding mosquito modification technology.  Education and Training Programs  The FNIH supports education and training programs by raising funds for fellows and early-career researchers who are working to advance biomedical science. An example of this is the Medical Research Scholars Program (MRSP), which provides one-year of intensive training for medical, dental and veterinary students on the NIH campus with mentorship from top scientists.  Awards and Events  The FNIH organizes lectures, awards and events to promote innovative thinking and develop a broader public understanding of biomedical science. The Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences is one example. This $100,000 award, made possible by a generous gift by Ann Lurie, President of Lurie Holdings and President and Treasurer of the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Foundation, recognizes outstanding achievement by a young scientist in biomedical research.  Patient Support Programs  The FNIH supports programs that provide comfort and assistance to patients receiving treatment at the NIH Clinical Center and their families. For example, the FNIH supports the Edmond J. Safra Family Lodge, which offers accommodations to adult patients receiving care at the NIH Clinical Center and their families at no cost to them.  Leadership  The FNIH is led by President and Executive Director, Maria C. Freire. It is overseen by a Board of Directors composed of prestigious individuals from various disciplines.

Despite its longer wing the Nibio II was lighter. The Nibio II was a high-wing monoplane with its wing braced by a single faired strut on each side, joining the lower fuselage to the outer end of the central panel at about one third span. This central panel was rectangular in plan and was without dihedral. The outer panels were straight tapered to blunt tips, the wing becoming thinner and thus acquiring dihedral though retaining a horizontal upper surface. Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels; there were no inboard flaps or air brakes. Its wood framed, plywood skinned fuselage was hexagonal in cross section, tapering markedly on its underside towards the tail. The wing was mounted on a pedestal which sloped away aft into the upper fuselage. The pilot's cockpit, open behind a small windscreen, was immediately ahead of the pedestal and below the wing leading edge. The tail surfaces were straight tapered and straight tipped, with the tailplane mounted on the fuselage. The rudder extended down to the keel, operating within a small cut-out between the elevators and protected from the ground by a small underfin which served as a tail bumper. There was a short landing skid running from near the nose to just aft of the wing strut. Variants ;Nibio I: Training glider, flown 1929.

History  = Construction = The construction of the section from Nuttlar to Winterberg was authorised on 20 May 1898 by a law of the Prussian parliament. The Nuttlar (Westfalen)–Steinhelle section was opened on 1 May 1902. On the same day the first section of the Steinhelle–Medebach Light Railway () was opened. The continuation of the line from Steinhelle to Winterberg was opened on 1 October 1906. The route to connect with the Hessian rail network was already determined by this time. Numerous engineering structures were required between Winterberg and Bromskirchen, including three tunnels and a viaduct, with a grade of up to 2.5%. The whole line was opened to Frankenberg on 1 December 1908. Frankenberg was connected to the Warburg–Sarnau railway. From 1910/1911 it was possible to continue the journey over the Upper Eder Valley Railway from Allendorf to Bad Berleburg. = Operations = In addition to extensive passenger services, freight traffic was handled on the line. In addition to the stations at the ends of the line there were eleven stations and five halts (Haltepunkte). Several pairs of trains ran over the whole line each day. Special trains often ran between the Ruhr area and Winterberg for winter sports traffic. Operations incurred growing deficits in the 1960s, especially on the middle section. Since there was only minimal investment on the line, this eventually led to the closing of passenger services between Winterberg and Allendorf for safety reasons and freight traffic between Hallenberg and Allendorf on 14 November 1966. This section was shut down on 28 May 1967 and subsequently dismantled. The line between Frankenberg and Allendorf was still used until 1981 for services continuing to Bad Berleburg. On 30 May 1992, the transport of freight between Winterberg and Hallenberg was also closed and the section was dismantled, so the operation of winter sports services from Winterberg to Hallenberg was no longer possible. The tracks have been removed on the section between Winterberg and Allendorf. The Winterberg Tunnel 1 has been demolished and the Winterberg Tunnel 2 is closed. A cycle path has run through the Bromskirchen Tunnel since mid-2006. Rail services RE to Winterberg in Dortmund Hbf Regional-Express service RE 57 (Dortmund-Sauerland-Express) from/to Dortmund runs between Bestwig and Winterberg every two hours, and hourly on weekends, operated with Alstom Coradia LINT 41 (class 648) diesel rail cars, partly in multiple, often mixed with LINT 27 (class 640) rail cars. It also stops in Siedlinghausen and when required in Silbach and Bigge. There are generally no passenger services on the remaining section from Frankenberg to Allendorf (continuing to Battenberg (Eder) and Auhammer on the Upper Eder Valley Railway) since the services that existed on summer weekends up to 2005 had been abandoned. This service was aimed mainly at cyclists and hikers. Since then, passenger services have been only operated sporadically, mostly at various events such as the Eder-Bike-Tour. Freight traffic continues on the remaining two sections.

It stars James Spader, Megan Boone, Diego Klattenhoff, Ryan Eggold, and Harry Lennix. Raymond \\"Red\\" Reddington (James Spader), one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, surrenders at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. He claims that he and the FBI have similar interests in getting rid of dangerous criminals and terrorists. Reddington will cooperate only with Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone), a rookie FBI profiler who we see in the first episode, has trouble profiling just herself. However, Keen is not too keen on the idea. Over the course of his own criminal career, Reddington has made a list of global criminals who he believes are acting liabilities to his own interests or to society, most of whom are unknown to the FBI, and not on the \\"Most Wanted\\" list. He calls it \\"The Blacklist\\". As the series progresses, Reddington uses the FBI to apprehend enemies and strategic interests for his own personal gain. Executive producers for the series include Bokenkamp, John Eisendrath, and John Davis for Sony Pictures Television, Universal Television and Davis Entertainment.
