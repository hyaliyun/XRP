The adult beetles are relatively large, ranging between two and four centimeters long, and vary from a rusty red colour to almost entirely black; many colour variants exist and have led to considerable confusion with other species (e.g., Rhynchophorus ferrugineus). Weevil larvae of these species can excavate holes in the trunk of a palm trees up to a metre long, thereby weakening and eventually killing the host plant. As a result, these weevils are considered major pests in palm plantations, including the coconut palm, date palm and oil palm.Rhynchophorus ferrugineus at North American Plant Protection Organization (NAPPO) Originally from tropical Asia, this palm weevil has been recorded in the United States at Laguna Beach, CA late in 2010 Orange County Register, \\"Destructive exotic beetle found in Laguna Beach.\\" CDFA; Red Palm Weevil, Worst Known Pest of Palm Trees Detected in Laguna Beach but it was initially misidentified as the closely related species, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, and it did not become established.Hoddle et al. (2017) The palm weevil Rhynchophorus vulneratus is eradicated from Laguna Beach. California Agriculture 71(1): 25-29 Distribution The native range of this species is considered to include Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand; outside its native range it has been reported and confirmed only from the United States. Taxonomy Primarily due to the existence of numerous color forms across their ranges, the taxonomy and classification of red palm weevils has undergone a number of changes in understanding and circumscription. As such, the information in the literature should be viewed as a compilation of data which may apply to both species, depending primarily upon the biogeography. The most recent genus-level revision in 1966Wattanapongsiri, A. 1966. A revision of the genera Rhynchophorus and Dynamis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Department of Agriculture Science Bulletin 1: 1-328 recognized two species of red palm weevils, ferrugineus and vulneratus, and for decades these were interpreted as separate taxa. A genetic study in 2004Hallett, R.H., Crespi, B.J., Borden, J.H. 2004. Synonymy of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier), 1790 and R. vulneratus (Panzer), 1798 (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Rhynchophorinae). J. Nat. Hist. 38:2863-2882 concluded that vulneratus was not distinct from ferrugineus, and treated them as synonyms, a view that was accepted until 2013, when yet another genetic studyRugman-Jones, P.F., C.D. Hoddle, M.S. Hoddle, R. Stouthamer. 2013. The Lesser of Two Weevils: Molecular-genetics of pest palm weevil populations confirm Rhynchophorus vulneratus (Panzer 1798) as a valid species distinct from R. ferrugineus (Olivier 1790), and reveal the global extent of both. PLoS One. 2013; 8(10): e78379. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078379 came to the opposite conclusion, based on more comprehensive geographic sampling. Accordingly, the \\"red palm weevil\\" species that appeared in the US was vulneratus rather than ferrugineus, though the latter is the invading species in all of the other global introductions. =Hosts= Red palm weevils are reported to attack 19 palm species worldwide; due to the taxonomic confusion, it is unclear whether R. vulneratus and R. ferrugineus favor different hosts, though nearly all of the invasive populations known are of ferrugineus, so one of the only confirmed hosts for vulneratus outside of Asia is the Canary Island date palm, Phoenix canariensis. Culinary uses A fried sago larvae dish in Sarawak, Malaysia. The larval grub is considered a delicacy in Southeast Asian countries, including Brunei, and Malaysian Borneo. Sago grubs have been described as creamy tasting when raw, and like bacon or meat when cooked. They are often prepared with sago flour. The larvae are also eaten either raw or roasted in Malaysian Bornean states of Sabah and Sarawak, and regarded as a special high-nutrient meal among the natives there like the Kadazan-Dusun, Melanau and the Dayak. In Sabah the dish is called butod.

In 1910, he was one of the founders of Den frie Architektforening, an alternative architects' association, and headed it for the nine years it existed. Early life and education Baumann was born on 9 November 1878 in Copenhagen, the son of translator Heinrich Johann Raimund Baumann and Julie Augusta née Riise. He first enrolled at the College of Advanced Technology to become a building engineer but in 1888 discontinued his studies after just three semesters. Instead he took classes at a technical school from 1899 to 1901 while at the same time apprenticing as a mason. He was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1900 but dissatisfied with the teachings, left just two years later and was instead articled to Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint. He participated in an archaeological expedition to Rhodes from 1803 to 1805. He won a scholarship from the Art Academy in 1907. Career =First independent works= In 1908 to 1910, he worked in the offices of Jensen-Klint, Axel Preisler, Ulrik Plesner, and professor Heinrich Wenck at the design office of the Danish State Railways from 1908 to 1910. At Hensen-klint's and Wenck's office, he was part of a group of young like-minded architects which also included Ivar Bentsen, Carl Petersen, Hans Koch and Thorkild Henningsen and with whom he founded Den Frie Arkitektforening in 1909. Rågegården, Rågeleje (1015) Baumann's first independent work was the house Jenle for Jeppe and Nanna Aakjær in 1907-07. His sister knew Nanna Aakjær, through Richardt's Sløid School where they had both worked. In 1910, Baumann set up his own practice. Over the next years, he designed a number of large villas and country houses, mostly in Copenhagen's affluent northern suburbs or in North Zealand. These included Rågegården in Rågeleje and Mikkelgård in Hørsholm, both of which have been listed in the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places.. Other early works included a church on Saint Croix and a tobacco shop for A.M. Hirschsprung & Sønner. =Collaborations and larger commissions= Brick work of the Linoleum House, so nicknamed because the pattern resembles an old-fashioned linoleum floor. In the late 1910s, Baumann began to receive large commissions which were often created in collaboration with other architects. A housing estate designed in collaboration with Ivar Benzon in 1914 was completed on Vestergårdsvej in 1917. It was followed by an apartment block for Copenhagen Municipality at Struenseegade/Hans Tavsens Gade in 1919-20. Both these buildings received annual awards from the city. They were followed by a number of other housing estates, including Møllegården at Amager Boulevard, Grønnegaarden at Borups ALllé, Classens Have on Classensgade and Linoleumshuset in Åboulevard. These early apartment buildings were all designed in the Neoclassical style. =1930s-; Modernist period= From around 1930, Baumann's work was increasingly influenced by the Modernist trends of the time, This was for instance the case with the office building Ved Vesterport, designed in collaboration with Ole Falkentorp in 1930-31. Later examples are the housing estates Storgården and Klerkegården on Tomsgårdsvej. Personal life Baumann married Elisabeth Christine Roerup (18 September 1888 – 15 May1971), a daughter of organist Otto R. (1855–1939) and Anna Christine Elisabeth Jensen (1856–1935), on 25 November 1913. They owned a house at Tibirke.

It is believed that if the girl's husband dies later in her life, she is not considered a widow because she is married to Vishnu, and so already has a husband that is believed to be still alive. This ritual has been in practice since hundreds of years. It is very sacred ritual and a real kanyaadaan as a virgin girl is handed over to the God. Actually, in Ihi girl is married to a golden statue of lord Vishnu known as Suvarna Kumar and Bel fruit is given as its witness. As bel fruit (wood apple) has a peculiar quality of not getting rotten and remaining fresh forever, it is sometimes considered as Divya Purusha (divine male) or incarnation of the god. This ceremony lasts for two days. All the rituals of a Hindu marriage are performed in this ceremony. So, these rituals need not be performed again while getting married with a man. That's why in Newars it is not necessary for a Groom to go in wedding procession [janti (nep.), Baraat (Hindi)]. The family members and friends bring the bride to groom's house where few rituals are performed. But nowadays newar grooms take part in their wedding procession hence the wedding in this community has become a bit lengthy as compared before.

Wanchese was the last known ruler of the Roanoke Native American tribe encountered by English colonists in the late sixteenth century. Along with Chief Manteo, he traveled to London in 1584. Unlike Manteo, Wanchese remained suspicious of English motives in the New World. In April 1586, having returned to Roanoke, he finally ended his relationship with the English. Roanoke people The Roanoke, also spelled Roanoac, were a Carolina Algonquian-speaking people whose territory comprised present-day Dare County, Roanoke Island and part of the mainland at the time of English exploration and colonization. They were one of the numerous Carolina Algonquian tribes, which may have numbered 5,000-10,000 people in total in eastern North Carolina at the time of their first encounter with the English.\\"Indian Towns and Buildings of Eastern North Carolina\\", Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, National Park Service, 2008, accessed 24 Apr 2010 The smaller Croatan people may have been a branch of the Roanoke or a separate tribe allied with them. The Roanoke may have had their capital on the western shore of Croatan Sound, at Dasamonguepeuk. This was one of the significant towns noted by the English colonists in the sixteenth century. Journey to England Sir Walter Raleigh hosted Wanchese at his London residence, Durham House. Thomas Harriot, who translated and learned the Algonkin language from Wanchese and Manteo. Wanchese was among the first Native Americans to travel to England. In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh had dispatched the first of a number of expeditions to Roanoke island to explore and eventually colonize the New World. Early encounters with the natives were friendly, and, despite the difficulties in communication, the explorers were able to persuade \\"two of the savages, being lustie men, whose names were Wanchese and Manteo\\" to accompany them on the return voyage to LondonMilton, p.63 to help describe the conditions in the New World.Mancall, Peter C.

Once safely delivered to England in September 1584,Milton, p.64 the two Indians quickly caused a sensation at court. Raleigh's priority, however, was not publicity but intelligence about his new land of Virginia, and he restricted access to the exotic newcomers, assigning the scientist Thomas Harriot the job of deciphering and learning the Carolina Algonquian languageMilton, p.70 using a phonetic alphabet of his own invention. Both Wanchese and Manteo were hosted at Raleigh's London residence, Durham House. Unlike Manteo, Wanchese evinced little interest in learning English, and did not befriend his hosts, remaining suspicious of English motives in the New World. He soon came to view himself as a captive of the English rather than as their guest. By Christmas of 1584, Harriot was able to converse successfully in the Algonquin language with the two Native Americans, although Manteo was far more communicative than Wanchese. Harriot recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology: > Many things they sawe with us...as mathematical instruments, sea > compasses...[and] spring clocks that seemed to goe of themselves - and many > other things we had - were so strange unto them, and so farre exceeded their > capacities to comprehend the reason and meanes how they should be made and > done, that they thought they were rather the works of gods than men.Milton, > p.73 Wanchese and Manteo also performed a commercial function for Raleigh, attracting wealthy Britons to invest in Raleigh's schemes. One investor later complained that the 1585 expedition (which was a failure) might have succeeded: > Yf the Report had beene true which was geven out by twoe straungers, > Inhabitauntes of the same foreyne Nation.Vaughan (2008), p.23 Retrieved > January 2013 Raleigh was, however, successful in raising funds, and a new expedition was raised to depart in 1585. =Return to Roanoke= Manteo and Wanchese returned to the New World in April 1585, sailing with Sir Richard Grenville's expedition in The Tyger, reaching the warm waters of the Caribbean in just 21 days.Milton, p.98 During this voyage, Wanchese and Manteo observed the English plunder Spanish shipping and, by way of \\"trucke and exchange\\", obtain supplies from the reluctant Spanish.Oberg, p.60 Retrieved January 2013 Much, however, was lost on the return to the treacherous waters of Roanoke. The Tyger was saved from destruction, but at the cost of most of her supplies, which were spoiled by salt water. On July 3, 1585, Grenville sent a party to \\"send word of our arriving at Wococon, to Wingino at Roanocke\\", led by Wanchese.Oberg, p.61 Retrieved January 2013 At this point, Wanchese slipped away from the English and returned to Dasamongueponke, urging resistance against the newcomers. By July 6, Grenville was worried enough to send John Arundell with Manteo as guide and interpreter to recover Wanchese, but the villagers at Dasamongueponke could not be persuaded to give him up. Records indicate that Manteo and Wanchese also went on a voyage from the New World to England sometime later in the same decade .

The town of Namsos lies just to the north, across the river Namsen. The museum opened in 1991 at the site of the former sawmill operated by Spillum Sawmill & Planing (). History Spillum Dampsag & Hovleri The Norwegian sawmill industry was, around the start of the 19th century, one of Norway's largest industries with several hundred steam powered sawmills. Spillum Sawmill and Planing is the last preserved sawmill from this period and tells the story about the national sawmill history. The Sawmill Museum is today one out of four departments at the regional museum, ”Museet Midt”. The three other departments are The Coast Museum in northern Trøndelag, Namdal Museum, and Nord-Trøndelag County Gallery. As well as the technical-industrial cultural environment at Spillum Sawmill & Planing, The Norwegian Sawmill Museum manages the tugboats ”MB Hauka” and \\"MB Oter\\" and a collection of objects from the national history of sawmills, displaying sawmill equipment from most of the country's regions. The Norwegian Sawmill Museum has a staff of about 11 employees. The staff run the museum from the facilities at the sawmill. Spillum Sawmill & Planing The Norwegian Sawmill Museum is situated just south of Namsos, Norway Spillum Sawmill & Planing (Spillum Dampsag & Høvleri) was founded in 1884, as one of the first steam powered sawmills in Norway. Until then the sawmill industry had been powered by water-driven vertical saws. Still it had been one of the country's largest export industries since the 16th century. Towards the end of the 19th century, the export greatly diminished. However, the export was largely replaced by production to growing domestic markets. A burgeoning industrialization and urban development in the beginning of the 20th century led to the emergence of the modern day Norwegian society. These trends gave rise to a new and growing demand for lumber for the construction of housing and other buildings in Norway, particularly in the cities. A booming sawmill industry emerged. As a medium-sized sawmill, Spillum Sawmill & Planing predominantly produced for the northern regions of Norway. The products ranged from sawn timber and unplaned cladding to mouldings and panels. The sawmill even produced prefabricated homes, interiors included. Houses for workmen and beach cabins were produced based on standardized designs. In the 1940s, the sawmill was modernized. Electric motors were mounted on the saws and the planer. From this point onwards, the steam engine was left inoperative, except for the fact that the sawmill still continued to use the steam engine's boiler to generate steam for the process of drying sawn timber in a new building raised for this purpose adjacent to the production facilities. In total, the production facility and the newer drying building have a ground area of about , which makes this building one of the largest wooden buildings in the Nordic countries. In 1986, the production at the saw mill ceased. At the time, The Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology was conducting a process to find a steam-powered saw mill that could be preserved as a technical-industrial cultural heritage site. Spillum Sawmill turned out to be the best preserved sawmill of its kind in the country. The foundation Spillum Sawmill & Planing was subsequently formed. The foundation bought the sawmill, including the buildings, machines and the inventory. The acquisition was financially supported by the Directorate for Cultural Heritage. The sawmill was then extensively restored and refurbished before it was opened to the public in summer of 1991 as The Norwegian Sawmill Museum. In 1994, Spillum Sawmill & Planing was selected as one cultural memorial site to give priority in the conservation plan of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage. The conservation of craftsmanship knowledge has been a key priority area at the museum. The saw mill has been able to maintain low scale production on the old saws and the planer. Consequently, a “living museum” has been achieved. The saw mill produces among other things high quality replicas for restoration projects. The entirety of the saw mill site, with the buildings, machines and other objects, including an all but complete corporate archive from 1884 onwards, constitutes a time capsule from the early industrialization in Norway. M/B Hauka M/B Hauka M/B “Hauka” is a long vessel drawn by the engineer Richard G. Furuholmen and built at Moen Yard in Risør in 1934. The vessel was ordered by the company Albert Collett, and assigned to Salsbruket Pulp Mill where it was operative until 1985 except for the duration of World War II. The Germans then requisitioned it for their military base in Rørvik. The vessel was mainly used for towing of raw material to the pulp mill. In winter it could also be used for ice breaking whenever needed. Moreover, it was used to transport the owners and their families when they left the capital to come on a visit. The boat then looked glamorous, neatly cleaned and shined up for the occasion. As Salsbruket was cut off from the mainland, the boat came to play a greater role than initially intended for the growing society which derived their livelihood from the pulp mill. Salsbruket was first connected to the mainland in 1968, when a regular ferry transport was opened. Before that, whenever there was a medical emergency, Hauka and its crew often played a crucial role. On several occasions their effort was life-saving. The fact that three births took place on Hauka is a case in point. When the pulp mill at Salsbruket burnt down in 1985, the vessel was sold to a buyer outside Namdalen. In 1991, Hauka was brought back to the region and was subsequently taken over by a joint ownership, registered as “MB Hauka BA”. Its main objective was to restore Hauka and make sure it stayed in Namdalen. In 1994, The Directorate for Cultural Heritage gave Hauka status as “protected” and has considerably supported the restoration of the vessel financially. On 1 January 2004, the ownership was transferred to The Norwegian Sawmill Museum. As of 2011, M/B Hauka has in recent years been refurbished for a total worth of close to . However, there still remains a lot of restoration work to be done before the vessel can again be seen on the Namsenfjord.

The tower is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It has also been known as Newton Tower and King Charles' Tower. History Photograph when it was called King Charles' Tower, 1892 The structure probably originated in the 13th century. During the later part of the 16th century the tower was leased to two city guilds, the Painters and Stationers, and the Barbers and Chandlers, who sublet it to other guilds. By 1612 the fabric of the tower was in a poor condition, and the lead had been lost from its roof. It was restored by the two guilds, and above the door they placed a plaque containing the date 1613 and a carving of a phoenix, the emblem of the Painters. In the Civil War, during the Siege of Chester in 1645, the tower had a gun in each storey, and it was damaged in the conflict. A plaque on the tower states that King Charles I stood on the tower on 24 September 1645 as he watched his soldiers being defeated at the Battle of Rowton Heath. The historian Simon Ward has expressed doubts about this and has suggested that the king may have stood instead on a tower of Chester Cathedral, which he considers is confirmed by evidence that a captain standing beside him was killed by a stray shot. The guilds resumed possession of the tower in 1658, and repaired it. They ceased possession by about 1773, after which the city carried out repairs. However, by 1838, the tower was described as being in a dilapidated condition. By this time, the city was promoting it as a tourist attraction because of its reputed connection with King Charles. In the late 1850s, the lower chamber was being used by a print-seller, and later in the century the tower was made a private museum. Architecture Phoenix Tower on Chester city walls, where Charles is said to have watched his army lose. The tower is constructed in red coursed sandstone, with a pyramidal slate roof. It stands about high and is semicircular in plan. The tower is in four stages, the lower two of which are below the walkway on the wall. Each of the upper stages contains a chamber. At the level of the walkway, in the third stage, is a round-headed doorway. Above the doorway is a plaque dated 1613 containing the carved image of a phoenix. An external stairway leads to the upper storey. Internally, the lower chamber is octagonal in plan, with a diameter of about , and it contains five slit windows. Externally, between the upper two stages, is a string course. In the upper stage is a doorway and four three-light leaded casement windows. The top of the tower has a battlemented parapet, lead hip roofs and an ornate weathervane.

He has been actively involved in promoting and popularizing renewable energy since the mid-1970s. Early life and inspiration While attending the University of California at Berkeley in the late 1960s, Schaeffer was inspired by Stewart Brand and his colleagues who published the Whole Earth Catalog, particularly by the cover of the issue that featured a 1968 image of Earth taken from space by Apollo 8 Astronaut William Anders.Morris, Stephen. \\"30 Years of Solar: How Real Goods and the Solar Industry Have Grown Together Over Three Decades\\".

Schaeffer became one of many young people rejecting the established values of the 1950s in favor of the communal living practices associated with the back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The Whole Earth Catalog, which promoted access to tools, became the bible of this movement and the inspiration for Schaeffer's own catalog, the Real Goods catalog, which sold products useful for independent life in the commune. By the 1980s the Real Goods catalog had become the successor to the Whole Earth Catalog.Morris, Stephen. \\"30 Years of Solar: How Real Goods and the Solar Industry Have Grown Together Over Three Decades\\".

Biography Born in Hörde, Westphalia (today part of Dortmund) the son of a merchant, his family moved to Hildesheim three years later. Rudolf left school at the age of 16 to take acting lessons, making his debut in 1925 as Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice in Düsseldorf. Two years later he moved to Berlin, where he together with Werner Finck and Hans Deppe founded the cabaret Die Katakombe. From 1929 onwards, Platte performed in more than 200 film roles, embodying the shy and underestimated, likeable \\"Little Man\\". In 1940 he succeeded Ralph Arthur Roberts as director of the Theater in der Behrenstraße in Berlin (right beside the present-day Komische Oper) until its final closure in 1944. From 1945 to 1947 he directed the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, which in 1954 became home of the Berliner Ensemble theatre company. After World War II, Platte could continue his film career in West Germany, performing in numerous comedies as well as in literary film adaptions, later also on television, and still successfully appeared on stage in Berlin. In 1942 he had married the actress Georgia Lind (his second wife). The couple divorced shortly afterwards, but remarried in 1954. In the intervening year he was married to another actress Marina Ried. Both are buried in an ehrengrab in the Berlin Wilmersdorf cemetery.

These assays measure the existence of pain through behaviors such as withdrawal, licking, immobility, and vocalization. The sensation of pain is not a unitary concept; therefore, a researcher must be conscious as to which nociception assay to use. Formalin The formalin assay is the most popular chemical assay of nociception. It entails the injection of a dilute solution of formalin into the surface of the rodent's hindpaw, followed by the scoring of stereotypical behaviors such as flinching, licking, and biting of the affected hindpaw. The behaviors last for approximately 1 hour, with the early or acute stage (directly after injection) reflecting direct activation of nociceptors and the late or tonic phase (15 to 20 minutes after the injection) reflecting inflammation. Typically, the formalin assay is used on rats; however, formalin concentrations and scoring methods can be modified as to suit mice. One major advantage of the formalin assay over other models of inflammatory pain is the limited duration (approximately 1 hour) of the response. Additionally, as described before, this assay produces a response in two discrete stages, allowing researchers to model both acute and tonic pain using a single noxious chemical. Writhing In the writhing test, the peripheral nociceptive activity of a test compound is determined by the number of abdominal writhes induced by the intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid. Von Frey The Von Frey assay, introduced by Maximilian von Frey and modified by Weinstein, uses Von Frey hair or fibers, which are small pieces of nylon rod, approximately 50 mm in length, and of varying diameters, to test a rodent's sensitivity to a mechanical stimulus. It is unclear whether the process is really considered noxious versus simply annoying, so this assay is a test of mechanical nociception or simply mechanical sensibility. In this test, the animal stands on an elevated mesh platform, and the Von Frey hairs are inserted through the mesh to poke the animal’s hindpaw. Normal reactions for the animal include withdrawing or licking or shaking the paw, and possible vocalization, but these can depend on variability within the experiment. For example, the tarsal surface of the hind paw is typically associated with lower withdrawal thresholds compared to the dorsal surface, and the exact force of the fiber is determined by its thickness. It is also important to note that thresholds usually are initially decreasing during successive tests, but do become stable after about 3 sessions. Algorithms such as up-down or Bruceton analysis are available to concentrate testing into the most dynamic part of the range, and subsequent curve fitting and parameter estimation can be similarly standardised. Alternatively, automated von Frey systems have recently been discovered that gradually increase the force of a single probe so that a researcher can observe when withdrawal responses occur. Thermal assays Sensitivity to acute thermal stimulation is the most common test used in live species pain research. The behavioral reflex evoked by noxious heat stimuli is a relatively good predictor of pain sensitivity and its reduction through various analgesics. One significant limitation of thermal assays lies in the specificity and validity of results in animals as models of human pain. Very little is known about the functional mechanics of nociceptive afferents in murine subjects, thus the translation of any pain response observed from these animals to humans is questionable. =Tail withdrawal= Two versions of the tail withdrawal assay are commonly employed in pain sensitivity testing. In the classic radiant heat test, a heat source is targeted onto a small area of the tail, and the latency to withdraw the tail away from the heat source is measured. In the tail-immersion test, a container of liquid is heated or cooled to a nociceptive temperature – normally 50–55 °C or below 0 °C. The animal subject is then placed with its tail immersed in the liquid, and the latency to withdraw the tail from the liquid is measured. Animal subjects used must be restrained to a fairly high degree when performing the tail withdrawal test due to the exact positioning necessary to direct the noxious stimuli. Restraint is usually accomplished by placing the subjects in small Plexiglas tubes or cloth/cardboard pockets that the subjects can either be habituated to or voluntarily enter. The primary advantage of tail withdrawal assays to other forms of thermal nociception testing, such as the hot-plate test or Hargreaves test, is the relative stability of results with repeated observations. Pain- reflex latency observations from other tests are usually much more variable both across and within subjects than those obtained from the tail withdrawal assay. =Hot plate= Example of a hot plate assay performed on a rat A heat- conductive surface, such as porcelain or metal, is heated to a temperature that will induce a nociceptive response in an animal subject – normally 50–56 °C. The subject is then placed onto the surface and prevented from leaving the platform by blockades. The latency to pain-reflex behavior is measured. One complication of this assay is its unsuitability for repeated testing. Animals that have been subjected to the hot-plate test in the past display a behavioral tolerance phenomenon, which is characterized by decreased latencies and reduced sensitivities to antinociceptive agents. Another complication of the hot-plate test is determining what constitutes a behavioral pain response; is it the lifting/licking of paws, vocalization, attempting to climb out of the cylinder, etc. Also, delivering the heat stimulus in a controlled fashion presents difficulties due to each section having varying temperatures based upon surface area exposure and whether the animal is moving or not. =Tail flick= Example of a traditional set-up for the tail flick assay The tail flick assay or tail flick test uses a high-intensity beam of light aimed at a rodent's tail to detect nociception. In normal rodents, the noxious heat sensation induced by the beam of light causes a prototypical movement of the tail via the flexor withdrawal reflex. An investigator normally measures the time it takes for the reflex to be induced, a factor influenced by a rodent's sex, age and body weight. The most critical parameter for the tail flick assay is the beam intensity; stimuli producing latencies of larger than 3–4 seconds generally create more variable results. Another important factor to consider is the level of restraint used; rodents held too tightly may exhibit greater tail flick latencies due to heightened stress levels. Hargreaves The Hargreaves assay uses a high-intensity beam of light directed at the hindpaw rather than the tail to induce pain; an investigator then measures the time it takes for the animal to withdraw its hindpaw. In contrast to the tail flick assay, rodents are often unrestrained while the radiant heat source is focused on the hindpaw. Cut-off latency for the Hargreaves assay is commonly set at 10 seconds. The main advantage of this test over the tail flick assay is that it allows independent assessment of treatment effects on both sides of the body. Applications One of the most common applications of nociception assays is to test the effectiveness of new pain medications and drugs of the like. One can then perform comparative tests to measure the differences in the effects of the drug on varying populations, such as men versus women, or young versus old. These tests can also identify certain harmful diseases or abnormalities in subjects if they display atypical nociception test responses. Additionally, nociception tests can be used to test the heritability of nociception itself. One can also use nociception assays to assess the physiology of the \\"pain\\" pathways. The role capsaicin receptors play in the pain pathways has been measured by comparing results from nociception assays in mice with and without the receptor. In addition, they are useful in other tests to make sure control subjects have normal nociception responses.

Retrieved January 21, 2015. Fire By 1910, Brady had added a high-rise annex, connected to the original hotel by a wooden passageway. The annex, advertised as fireproof, was constructed of steel and concrete. Unfortunately, a fire that broke out in the original building on January 23, 1935 also burned through the passageway and ignited the furnishings of the annex, which were not fireproof. Demolition After the fire had been extinguished, nothing was left except the gutted annex. No attempt was made to rebuild the hotel. By that time, its location was no longer advantageous. The center of Tulsa's business district had already moved farther south, away from Union Depot, and businessmen increasingly traveled more by air than by railroad. Other hotels (e.g., Mayo, Adams, Tulsa) had been built that catered to the needs of these travelers and were more conveniently located. According to the Tulsa World, Goodwill Industries bought the Brady building in 1943 and used it for some operations for 30 years. The derelict structure remained until it was demolished in 1975 as part of the Tulsa Urban Renewal project. It had stood more years (40) as a wreck than it had as a useful building.

The measure would have placed a $1 excise on tobacco products into a protected fund to finance medical research on smoking-related illnesses, strengthen California’s smoking prevention and cessation programs, and enforce the state’s existing tobacco laws. The independent California Legislative Analyst's Office projected that the measure would have generated approximately $855 million in first year, declining slightly but predictably (about 3% annually due to decrease in the number of smokers) every year thereafter.California Legislative Analyst’s Office, January 15, 2010 The measure would have created a nine-member committee charged with administering direct revenues. This oversight committee was to be composed of cancer- research medical professionals, University of California Chancellors, and representatives of national disease advocacy groups. The measure restricted administration costs to no more than 2% of its direct tax revenues. The California Cancer Research Act was widely supported by cancer advocates, including cancer survivor Lance Armstrong and the American Cancer Society. The measure failed by a small margin of .4 percentage points. Later, in 2016, the cigarette tax was increased by the successful passage of California Proposition 56. Detail =How CCRA revenue would have been spent= According to the independent California Legislative Analyst's Office, revenue raised by the measure would have been spent as follows: * Approximately $75 million annually: Maintaining existing tobacco tax revenue streams to ensure that the California Proposition 99 (1988), California Proposition 10 (1998), General Fund and Breast Cancer programs funded by existing tobacco taxes are not negatively impacted by the excise tax increase; * 60% (approximately $468 million annually): Research of cancer and tobacco-related disease \\"for the purpose of grants and loans to support research into the prevention, early detection, treatments, complementary treatments and potential cures of lung cancer and other types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, emphysema and other tobacco related diseases, including but not limited to coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease\\"; * 15% (approximately $117 million annually): Facilities and capital equipment for research \\"for the purposes of grants and loans to provide facilities, including but not limited to those building, building leases and capital equipment as may be found necessary and appropriate by the Committee, to further biomedical, epidemiological, behavioral, health services, and other research whose primary focus is to identify and refine promising prevention, early detection, treatments, complementary treatments, rehabilitation and potential cures of lung cancer and other types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, emphysema and other tobacco related diseases\\"; * 20% (approximately $156 million annually): Tobacco prevention and cessation to the state’s existing tobacco control program. These funds would be divided between the California Department of Public Health (80%) and the California Department of Education (20%) for their existing programs to prevent and reduce the use of tobacco. * 3% (approximately $23 million annually): Tobacco law enforcement \\"to support law enforcement efforts to reduce cigarette smuggling, tobacco tax evasion, and counterfeit tobacco products, to reduce illegal sales of tobacco products to minors, and to enforce legal settlement provisions and conduct law enforcement training and technical assistance activities for tobacco related statues\\". * No more than 2% (approximately $16 million annually): Administration. =Oversight= The measure would have created a 9-member governing committee charged with administering the fund.

Bailey (1820-1917) Bailey Library in 1922 The Winthrop Public Library was originally opened on July 8, 1889. The library location was referred to as \\"Packard Block\\" in early Town Reports. The original library contained 1,322 volumes at the time of opening and featured a reading room. The collection had grown to 2,700 volumes by 1904.https://archive.org/stream/winthropregister00lcmitc/winthropregister00lcmitc_djvu.txt The cost to use the original library was $1 per year, and the original library construction was funded through a combination of private fundraising and a Town grant. In November 1916, Charles M. Bailey of Winthrop, Maine entered into an agreement with the Town of Winthrop to give a new building to be used for library and reading room purposes. The new library was opened to the public on December 2, 1916 in a dedication ceremony that featured president of Colby College, Arthur J. Roberts, and Dennis' Orchestra of Augusta, Maine. Charles M. Bailey was the best known member of the Society of Friends in Winthrop, and was known for his \\"Bailey's Praying Band\\", who conducted evangelistic services. Bailey also owned one of the largest oilcloth manufacturers in America at the time, and employed two hundred individuals in Winthrop in the early 1900s. The 1916 structure of rock faced and chiseled granite is still in use today. Charles Irving Bailey (the elder son of Charles M. Bailey) was the first person to serve as Chair of the newly formed Board of Trustees.Records of the Meetings of the Trustees 1918-1974 Lula A. Clifford was the first head librarian to serve in the new Bailey building, and served to the time of her death in 1940. Clifford's starting salary was $1 for each afternoon and evening the library was open to the public, and in 1920 was set at $25 per month. Mr. John Stanley served as Town Librarian for twenty-five years (at the Packard Block location) before Charles M. Bailey donated the Bowdoin St. building. John Stanley continued serving on the Board of Trustees and Book Committee after Clifford was hired in 1916. Lula A. Clifford was noted as being Stanley's assistant librarian prior to 1916. The first book replacement notice was sent out to C.S. Fowle on January 17, 1920. Expansion Expanded Bailey Library in 2015 The library Building Committee first encouraged the Board of Trustees to start thinking in terms of future expansion and acquisition of adjacent land in 1966, and in 1972 the Board of Trustees hired architect George Royal to establish a plan for library expansion. The Winthrop Masonic Hall (occupying the adjacent land necessary for expansion) was put on the market in 1973, and the library Building Committee requested right of first refusal of the property. Further, a 1973 Maine State Evaluation of the library reported that \\"additional space is much needed and...the library shows a definite need for expansion...\\". In 1974 the library began renovating the basement to be used as a Children's Room. In 2005, the Town of Winthrop purchased the adjacent land necessary for library expansion, and the Board of Trustees hired architect Phil Locashio and began planning. In 2012, the Library Trustees announced the capital fundraising campaign chairpersons, and in 2014 Library and Winthrop Town officials announced plans to begin construction on a one-story addition in September, 2014.http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/06/22/winthrop-library-expansion-could- start-this-fall/ The expanded library opened on June 1, 2015.http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/05/06/winthrop-library-prepares-to-go- home 2009 Fire The library closed on March 6, 2009 when a 16-year-old boy pushed a flaming roll of paper towels into the building's boiler room through a basement window, causing extensive damage.

On March 10, 1967, it crashed shortly after takeoff at Klamath Falls, killing all four aboard.  Synopsis  West Coast Airlines Flight 720 was operated on March 10, 1967 by one of the company's Fairchild F-27 aircraft, registered N2712. On the morning of the flight, the aircraft was parked in West Coast's hangar at the airport for routine maintenance. Due to the falling snow that morning, instead of loading at the terminal, as was standard procedure, the aircraft was loaded in the hangar with the passenger and crew members. Both pilots did a pre-flight check of the plane, and reported nothing unusual. Once boarding was completed at 4:46 AM, the plane was pushed out of the hangar. Snow mixed with rain was falling. During push back from the hangar, the tractor tug was observed to have gotten stuck in the snow, and ground personnel spent 11 minutes freeing it, during which time the airplane was exposed to the weather. No attempt was made to clear the wings or control surfaces of snow. Once freed from the snow, the aircraft taxied to Runway 14 and was given takeoff clearance at 4:57 AM. The aircraft took off at 5:01 AM, and at 5:02:43 the flight contacted the tower to check if they were on radar. This was the last communication from the aircraft. The controller reported to Flight 720 that they were on radar. The controller witnessed a target on his screen drift to the left of the runway centerline and head towards Stukel Mountain 6 miles from the airport. At 5:02:49 the flight impacted Stukel Mountain, after failing to get airborne high enough to clear the mountain.  Cause and investigation  At 5:09 AM a report came into the tower that an aircraft had crashed on Stukel Mountain. It was observed that the runway tracks were in heavy snow, and the plane swerved to the left on the runway before becoming airborne. By takeoff, the left gear was 12 feet off the runway. Several witnesses in the vicinity saw the airplane flying low, followed by seeing or hearing a large explosion. All reported snow at the time of the crash.Klamath Falls, OR West Coast Airline Plane Crashes, Mar 1967 http://www3.gendisasters.com/node/3623 The aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder. Although damaged in the crash, the recording medium was able to be read. The aircraft was reported to have climbed to approximately 1 minute after takeoff. Throughout the flight the aircraft was recorded to have continued a turn to the left of the assigned heading. Shortly before impact the aircraft began a sharp turn to the left, towards the mountain, at heading of 042 degrees. The aircraft was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder, which, although damaged, was able to be read. The crew reported a loss of control before impact, along with a report of not being able to see the mountain. An expletive was uttered right before impact. The aircraft was observed to have been accumulating ice and snow on its control surfaces prior to takeoff and when moved out of the hangar. No action was taken by the crew to have the aircraft deiced, and it was believed by the investigation that this was responsible for the accident.http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1967/1967-20.htm Due to the crew's short turnaround schedule, fatigue was suggested as a contributing factor in the accident.

Biography Coffinières's student record at the École Polytechnique Grégoire Coffinières was the son of Alexandre Coffinières, a lawyer in Castelnaudary in the Aude department, and of Paule Adélaïde Marquier.Website of the library of the École polytechnique, biographical note in Coffinières, Grégoire Gaspard Félix In 1829 he passed the entry exam of the École polytechnique, where as a student he took part in the Three Glorious Days of the revolution of July 1830. Graduating in 1831, 49th in a class of 113, he chose to become a combat engineer. He attended the École d’application du Génie at Metz, and was then sent to Algeria. Returning to France in 1837, he embarked on the 1844 expedition to Morocco. Appointed head of engineers at Auch in 1845, Coffinières returned to Morocco in 1849. He then left for Argentina, he created the first map of the La Plata Basin in 1850. Then a lieutenant colonel, he based the map on \\"documents collected in situ and the best partial plans of that region\\".Bibliothèque nationale de France, Catalogue général, bibliographic notice on the Carte générale du Bassin de la Plata, drawn in 1850 and published in 1853. In 1855, he participated in the Crimean War, where he took part in the siege of Sevastopol and was promoted to Brigadier General. Coffinières succeeded General Charles Eblé in the command of the École polytechnique from 1860 to 1865, in which year he was promoted to Divisional General. During the Franco-Prussian War, he served as superior commander of the fortifications of Metz. His conduct in this command is controversial, and he was later accused of surrendering the position without defending it. Coffinières sought to shift his responsibility on General François Achille Bazaine, although he had sole responsibility for the fortifications of Metz.Georges Cavalier, Jean-Jacques Lefrère, Les mémoires de Pipe-en-Bois, Champ Vallon, 1992, p. 235. When Bazaine was later tried for treason, the name of Coffinières was often cited at his trial.Gazette anecdotique, littéraire, artistique et bibliographique, volume 1, 1887, p. 32. Coffinières was captured and interned at Hamburg. Freed after the war, he left active duty in 1876 and retired in 1881. He died in 1887. By imperial decree of 2 November 1864, Coffinières was authorized to add de Nordeck, a name from his family's maternal branch, to his last name.André Borel d'Hauterive, Albert Révérend, Annuaire de la noblesse de France et des maisons souveraines..., volume 22, Champion, 1865, p. 329.

After going into business after World War I, he returned to military service during World War II, and served until 1954. Early life Charles Midgley Maud was the son of Charles Joseph Maud and his wife Lilian, of \\"The Rookery\\", Rodley, Yorkshire. In Charles Midgley's, and his sister Winnifred's (b. 1896), baptismal records at St. Andrews Church in Rodley, his father described his profession as \\"gentleman\\". He was educated at Shrewsbury School. World War I Maud was first commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 5 August 1915. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in July 1917, receiving a weeks preliminary classroom based training at the No 1 School of Military Aeronautics at Reading, before being posted to No. 13 Training Squadron for his basic flight training. He was appointed a flying officer on 23 December, and on 3 January 1918 was posted to No. 201 Training Squadron for advanced flying training, followed by a final two-week course at the No. 2 School of Aerial Fighting and Gunnery at RFC Marske from 26 February. Maud was posted to No. 66 Squadron based at San Pietro in Gu in northern Italy, flying the Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter, on 8 March 1918, and soon after was promoted to lieutenant, backdated to 1 July 1917. His squadron was tasked with flying offensive patrols and bombing and strafing enemy aerodromes, but poor weather prevented flying throughout most of April, so it was not until 1 May that Maud gained his first aerial victory, when he destroyed an Albatros D.III south-west of Conegliano. He then destroyed an LVG C south of Oderzo the next day. He went on to drive down 'out of control' an Albatros D.V south-west of Caldonazzo on 10 May, destroyed an Albatros D.III over the Centa Valley on 18 May, and drove down another D.V over Alano di Piave on 20 May, to gain his flying ace status. Maud went on to destroy an Albatros D.III south of San Stino di Livenza on 8 June, and an LVG C south- west of Belluno on 10 July. He gained three further victories in August, destroying LVG Cs west of Feltre, and over Vittorio, on the 5th and 22nd, and a DFW C on the 23rd over Vidor. He was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 1 September, and gained his eleventh and final victory on 7 October, by driving down another Albatros D.V over Oderzo. His tally amounted to five enemy reconnaissance aircraft and three fighters destroyed, with another three enemy aircraft driven down out of control. His feats earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 7 November 1918. His citation read: :Lieutenant Charles Midgley Maud. ::\\"A bold Scout Pilot, who possesses in a high degree the true fighting spirit. He has shot down seven enemy machines.\\" In early February 1919 the Government of Italy conferred on him the Croce di Guerra al Valor Militare, and on 24 February Maud left No. 66 Squadron to return to England. Post World War I Maud was transferred to unemployed list on 8 April 1919, finally relinquishing his commission on 22 July 1921 on accepting an appointment in the Territorial Force, serving as a lieutenant in the 70th (West Riding) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, until 22 August 1923. On 31 December 1929, he broke up his partnership as a wool broker and left the family firm. World War II and beyond At the beginning of World War II, Maud returned to military service, being granted a commission as a pilot officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 14 February 1939. On either 12 August or 5 September 1939, he was confirmed in his appointment, and promoted to flying officer. When Maud received a mention in despatches on 1 January 1940 he held the rank of acting- squadron leader, but it was not until 22 October 1943 that he was promoted to the war substantive rank from flight lieutenant. He would serve until 10 February 1954, when he resigned his commission as a squadron leader in the RAF Volunteer Reserve. He was allowed to retain the rank of wing commander on his retirement. Aside from the medals already noted Maud also received the 1914–15 Star, the War and Victory Medals for World War I, and the Defence and War Medals for World War II, and also the Special Constabulary Long Service Medal awarded during the inter-war period.

Many of the city's departments and officials are located in City Hall North, which is one block west of City Hall South. History During the California agricultural strikes of 1933, in which mostly Mexican and Filipino agricultural strikers organized with the Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union (CAWIU) for an increase in pay and an end to contract labor, Pedro Subia, a Mexican striker, was murdered. His funeral was held at the old Bakersfield City Hall building. As described by Chicano historian Rodolfo Acuña, \\"workers came from all the camps around Bakersfield to gather in his honor in front of the Bakersfield City Hall. They included 'Whites, Mexicans, and Negroes, some of them once farmers in their own right, tall fair men from the mountains of the South and their wives leading little children, some desperate, many hopeless.'\\" The current City Hall was completed in 1954, after the old structure was destroyed in the 1952 Kern County earthquake.Hoover, Mildred, Kyle, Douglas. Historic Spots in California. Stanford University Press. Stanford, California: 1990. . Page 134. The old City Hall was too small and the city had started planning a new structure one year earlier.

A new building downtown was estimated to cost $18 million. Because the city was already committed to a variety of construction projects, it was decided to purchase an existing building nearby and remodel it for the city's needs. The Borton, Petrini & Conron building, constructed in 1995, was purchased for $4.5 million, and cost $1.4 million to remodel. Its name was changed to City Hall North. Many of the city's departments and officials (including the City Manager) were moved into it. The old City Hall was renamed City Hall South, although it is still the official seat of power for the city.

The manga officially ended on August 20, 2013, with a total of 222 chapters, and 23 volumes.  Plot  Utsuho’s truthfulness as a child resulted in an enormous catastrophe, and he decided to lie from that day forward. Raised in a village of orphans by a monk, Utsuho is an unrepentant troublemaker. The monk eventually inspires him to help people, but there’s no way Utsuho’s going to lead an honest life! Instead, he’s going to use his talents for mischief and deception for good! As he travels, he meets Pochi, an innocent tanuki, Yakuma, a serious, skilled young doctor, and Neya, an elegant teenaged girl who is an itsuwaribito with an innocent personality. With these 3 main companions, Utsuho travels Japan to increase the numbers of his family and save people with his lies.  Characters  The main characters of Itsuwaribito. Counter- clockwise from bottom center: Utsuho (with Pochi in front of him), Neya, Iwashi, Hikae, Uzume, Minamo, Chouza, Yakuma. ; : Utsuho is the trouble-making protagonist of \\"Itsuwaribito\\". An itsuwaribito with the motto of \\"karma\\". Utsuho is a white-haired teen-aged boy, his hair spiked straight up with a headband. Early in the series, he never let his hair down, however, later on, he often has it let down. It is unknown where he originally comes from, but he speaks with a Kansai dialect. Originally the son of a government official, he is an orphan due to the murder of his parents by thieves as a child. He knows that since he could only tell the truth when he was a child and told the thieves the entire layout of the house, it is his fault that his parents and servants were killed so easily. As such, as a teenager, he believed telling the truth was for idiots, and always lied as an Itswarubito. However, the priest who took him in told Utsuho on his deathbed that he wanted Utsuho to believe in people, and not always rely on lies. Taking the priest's final wish of wanting to save 1,000 people, Utsuho decides to go on a journey to complete this goal as an Itsuwaribito. He has skills in fishing, bomb making, weapon wielding, minor medical aid and quick disguises, and fights through his cleverness. He did have a butterfly blade hidden in his sleeve for close combat, but it was broken by the enemy in chapter 39. After this, he obtains dual blades, and he now often uses these. He wields his weapons and battle strategies aloofly, and has confidence in his ability to not be tricked. He loves playing pranks and tricking people with his lies, and often has the most fun tricking Yakuma, but does not try and trick Uzume or Pochi as often. On the other hand, he absolutely hates to be tricked, and also hates troublesome things. He is quite studied and has knowledge on many things, but that knowledge was all learned from books in the village of the orphans, so when he experiences something he's never seen before, he has a tendency of getting excited. His catchphrases are \\"That's uncool,\\" and \\"I was lying about lying\\". ; : A tanuki who can speak the human language. It speaks about himself in the first person in the Japanese manga. Its gender is unknown, and when it met with Utsuho, it was around eight months old. Pochi puts \\"san\\" (a rough equivalent of Mr. or Ms.) at the end of everyone's name he meets, and speaks in polite speech. Its mother was killed by a cruel trapper, and was saved by Utsuho when it seemed Pochi was going to be captured as well. It then becomes \\"family\\" with Utsuho, and goes on his journey to save 1,000 people with him as the first member of his party. It has a very strong bond with Utsuho, and likely has the most amount of trust with him. It is very polite and has very good manners, but has some faults in its thinking, and is quite an optimistic airhead. Because of this, Pochi often causes trouble for the other members of the party. When Pochi's heart is moved by something, it has a habit of clapping its hands in applause. Pochi is the opposite of Utsho, as it has no skills in lying in the least, and is quite simple. However, thanks to that simpleness, Pochi was able to obtain one of the 9 Treasures, the \\"Seven- Colored Rainbow\\" very easily, which the others could not do. At the beginning of the series, Pochi was very weak-willed, but in later developments Pochi has gained the courage to draw on the enemy's faces or try to save Utsuho from danger. As Pochi has been \\"raised\\" by Utsuho, Pochi has come to not know fear. Pochi has a tendency to draw out his sentences, adding \\"～\\" marks to the end of his speech to show his slow-speaking personality. ; : An 18-year-old stellar doctor who is looking for a remedy for one of his patients in the capital. He plays the tsukkomi role in the series. He is a very serious (if not too serious) young man with long black hair and sharp, blue eyes. However, in the battle against Chouza, his hair got cut in one of his attacks, and is now a little above his shoulders as a semi-long cut. He does not use weapons, but can take many hits, and has the power that can take down even a large man with a single attack. Utsuho recognizes that skill and his seriousness, and he is one of the allies he relies on the most, along with Pochi and Neya. Although his sense of responsibility and power of judgement are very strong, he often gets tricked, and to this there are many times that Utsuho chides him for it. His power of analysis is very high, as he was able to know the identity of a cross-dressing man, and was able to notice the feelings of love Neya holds for Utsuho. : He hates Itsuwaribito, and at first, Utsuho was no exception and Yakuma distrusted him. However, after working with him and Pochi for a while, he was able to trust him very much. At the same time, he gets a tendency to always worry about the big-mouthed Utsuho and Pochi, and gets called \\"Mom\\" or \\"sister-in-law\\" by them for it. As the elder member of the group, he often cheers up Neya, and also cheers on her love towards Utsuho. He is in fact a foreigner, which is proved by his knowledge of foreign surgeries, knowing foreign stories the others do not know, and also not knowing Japanese tales which all the others do. : In fact, in order to save the emperor, he was called to the imperial palace directly by the emperor, and has long aquainatances within the palace. He has feelings more than obligation towards the empress, and in order to receive favor from her, he is determined to find a cure for the emperor. ; : A 16-year-old female Itsuwaribito who was exiled to Nadeshiko Island who is not related to any crimes. She speaks in a royal, high-class lady speak in the Japanese version. She has crimson eyes and hair that is lightly colored with a cherry blossom pink. She used to wear her hair in joined pigtails, but since her hair ornaments she always wore were discovered to be one of the 9 treasures, the ornate hairpin, \\"Peacock Feather\\", she now wears her hair in a ponytail. She is very good with lies, so good that she was able to trick Utsuho once. She is quite down-to-earth and has it together, but there are times that she is very clumsy, and often causes many mistakes that cannot even be joked about. Chouza even says, \\"She doesn't look like she'd be any help in battle\\". Her main weapon is a bow and arrow, but in fact, it is a tool to help hide her true weapon of kunai. Her prison time on Nadeshiko Island was in fact far over, but she stayed on the island and helped to take care of the island's many children. However, the people of the island wished for Neya to be free and go to the mainland, and with their plans, they tricked Neya to go with Utsuho. At the same time, she received the villager's sincerity, and became determined to create a village on the mainland for all of them. She continues to aim to recruit Yakuma as the village's doctor. She is in love with Utsuho, and always tries to help him, but these efforts often end up with no results. Utsuho has shown some slight signs of affection towards her. : An orphan, Neya was taken in by a princess who was called \\"Oni-hime\\" (lit. Ogre Princess), and became her body double due to her striking similarity in appearance. Due to this, her speech changed to one of a high-class lady. She and the princess were best friends, and had a relationship similar to sisters. However, when the castle was under attack and all the guards were killed, the princess wanted Neya to live, so she gave her hair ornament (Which was actually one of the nine treasures, \\"Peacock Feather\\" (孔雀の羽; Kujaku no Hane) and entrusted her with it. The princess was killed in place of Neya, and in order to hide away, Neya went to Nadeshiko Island. ; : A man who is the guard to one of the 9 Treasures, the jewel, \\"Eye Stone\\" (JP: 瞳石;Hitomi Ishi). He has hanging eyes like a beast, and short, green spiky hair with a long bandana headband tied on his forehead. He is an itsuwaribito, and Hikae himself says that he has lived at least 500 years, which is actually quite possible, as there is much evidence that he is in fact immortal. Poisons and hallucinogens do not work on him, and if he is injured, it will cure within a moment. This is the same even if he receives a wound that should be fatal, and he takes fatal wounds quite calmly. He is quite an enigma to the entire party, including even Utsuho. He acts very aloof and never shows his true intentions to the party, quite similar to Utsuho. He has the thinking process of, \\"Life isn't worth anything if there's nothing interesting in it,\\" and as such, if things are interesting, he doesn't care about common sense or morals. He hates anything boring, and also hates Neya and Yakuma. On the other hand, he likes Utsuho and Pochi. Later, when she joins their party, he gets along very well with Iwashi, and their ways of thinking often match. After travelling for a time with Neya, he comes to hold her dear, but still hates Yakuma, who is very serious. In a trial in which the group had to hand over a treasure, he suffered a mental breakdown along with Utsuho, and after Utsuho completed the trial and received the treasure, Utsuho told him, \\"If you're free, come with us.\\", and so Hikae became one of their allies. Because Hikae is a guardsman of one of the 9 Treasures, he is quite knowledgeable on them, and as such, many times the destinations of the party is decided on this information, and he is a vital asset. However, there are many times when he says inappropriate things, and often has falling-outs with members of the party. His weapons are tekko kagi, which are gloves with blades like claws. He has fighting strength that is even recognized by Chouza, and with this he easily defeated Manta. He has become a being that has no need for food intake or sleep, and because of this he is always on lookout at night. ; : A 20-year- old princess who was enthroned after she took over the village that banned men and elderly, \\"Yome Mura\\" (lit. Bride Village). A beautiful woman with black short-cut hair. She ends her sentences with the inflection \\"~n\\" in the Japanese version, which is very rare. She has one of the 9 Treasures, the face powder, \\"Cherry Blossom Rouge\\" in her possession. Her skin, which is praised as the most beautiful in Japan, is her pride, and she holds quite a bit of confidence when it comes to her physique, and as such wears many clothes that expose her body. When she was in her village, she hated filthy and ugly things. Because of this hate, she demolished and rebuilt the entire village, and exiled animals, human males, the sick and such other people from the village. When she met Utsuho for the first time at the Hydrangea Flower Mansion, they were met with grave danger when Iriya incited a raid, and she saved Utsuho from a dangerous situation. :In return for \\"The most beautiful thing in this world\\", she promises to hand over her treasure to Utsuho and his party. To meet this request, Utsuho gave her a mirror, telling her that the most beautiful thing in the world could be seen in it when she held it. Touched, she now calls Utsuho \\"Utsuho-sama\\" or \\"My lord\\", and decides to continue on their journey along with them. She also allowed the people she had kicked out of the village to return. She is unexpectedly quite a hard worker and her heart is very kind. So kind, that she even gets along very well with her rival in love, Neya, saying \\"It is a wonderful thing when the amount of beautiful things increases in the world,\\" and even helps her with her fashion. She is not affected by formality, and is a very flexible type of person. She is also very good with her hands, and because of this is a very reliable person. There are times when she uses seduction in order to get enemies to let down their guard. ; : A 19-year-old warrior who is one of Kuroha's allies. He is a peppy, simple man, and is quite stupid. He often says saying and difficult words incorrectly, making him mostly comic relief. He is most often seen smiling with a wide open mouth. His weapon is a three-section staff with a small sickle attached, and has such power to the weapon that it does not matter if he is close or far in range to his opponent. He once told Utsuho, \\"My head's empty, but I get pissed.\\" What he lacks in brains, he makes up with fighting power, which is top-class. It might be because he is quite honest, but his mouth more than often slips, letting out vital information. As an enemy, Utsuho called him \\"Bird brain\\", but once they became allies, Utsuho began calling him by his name. : Ever since the time Uzume was born, he was not treated like a human and was ostracized. Possibly due him receiving irrational violence and abuse, he came to think that it would be best to break anything he hated as he lived his life. On the other hand, he is quite friendly, and there are times when he gets lonely like a child. He also holds feelings that Kuroha and Chouza, who he likes, are precious to him. There was a time when he was being chased by Iriya and Utsuho proposed that they fight together, but thinking about Kuroha, he turned him down. He likes Utsuho and has a crush on Neya (apparently, she's exactly his type), and thinks of them both as his friends. At the Black Fortress, when he talked to Utsuho, he decided that he wanted to live a life without killing people. However, this decision led to a wall being made between himself and Kuroha, who he held dearly. :In the battle against Iriya at Bride Village, he saves his allies, but knowing that he was not trusted by Kuroha, he left Kuroha's group along with Chouza and Minamo to act with just the three of them. In the capital, Kuroha says some parting words, but Uzume wasn't satisfied, confirms Kuroha's real intentions, and travels with her once again. :Deeply hurt at the death of Kuroha and Saiha, he fights Iriya and wins, getting revenge for the two. After he learned the importance of people's lives, he swears in his heart to never kill another person ever again, and in order to make a world where no one suffers, he decides to join Utsuho's group along with Chouza and Minamo. Glossary =Terminology= ; : The title for a person who has successfully mastered all arts of thievery, swindling, and mugging. :There are many kinds of Itsuwaribito, but many are bad, using their skills of lies for themselves. ; : :The 9 treasures gifted to an honest young person by God, who also granted him a magical ship. Since no one could get near the ship where the person lived in happiness, a liar tricked the honest person to coming down, killed the person, and took the treasures. Later, Neya learns from Minamo that the liar was, in fact, God. Since this ship can still be seen hanging upside down, floating from the ceiling in the cave on Tsukushi Island, this old story is considered true by most all. :Since the young honest person who is spoken of in the story is in fact a woman (previously unknown to Utsuho's group), most of the 9 Treasures are women's accessories. =Places= ; : :A village in which orphans are taken in and raised. There are only six adults in the entire village. There are mines near the village, which is how they gain the money to raise the children. ; : :An island of exile for Itsuwaribito.

For the exiled who have committed exceptionally heinous crimes, they are marked with a tattoo around one side of their mouths. The name of the island comes from the nadeshiko flower. ; : :A village famous for its dolls.

Despite her maiden name, Garcia, she is not related to Jerry Garcia, an incorrect assumption made by some because of her involvement with Furthur, a post-Garcia incarnation of the Grateful Dead. Similarly, despite her first name, Sunshine, she is not to be confused with Sunshine Kesey, daughter of Ken Kesey and Carolyn Adams (aka Mountain Girl or MG), Jerry Garcia's second wife. Early life Sunshine was born in Oakland, California, to Gabriel Garcia and Juddee Kawaiola (née Watrous). Her father, who is of Hispanic descent, is from New Mexico and is a musician, playing primarily tenor saxophone, but also double bass, piano, and drums. Her mother, who is of Dutch, French, and English descent, is from San Francisco, and studied theater in college. Sunshine's parents met and married in Oakland, CA. She has a brother, Sean Gabriel Garcia, who is 4 years older, and who selected the middle name, Flower, for her when she was born. She grew up in the East Bay area in Oakland, CA and Hayward, CA and attended James Logan High School in Union City, CA, where she graduated in 1990. Musical career Sunshine performing with Furthur at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia on July 23, 2011. In the sixth grade, at 11 years of age, Sunshine learned to play the recorder and flute. As a freshman in high school, she joined the school's prestigious marching band, eventually becoming the flute/woodwind section leader and in 1988, they won a competition at the Fiesta Bowl. Following high school, Sunshine attended California State University in Hayward, CA from 1990 to 1992, majoring in Expressive Arts. Having left Cal State, she moved into a house in San Francisco with several other aspiring musicians, including Jeff Pehrson, Jim Brunberg (of Box Set) and Jay Shaffer (of Passenger). Over the next few years, Sunshine worked variously as a vocalist with Oakland Youth Chorus' touring a cappella ensemble Vocal Motion, jam bands Passenger and Box Set, the funky drummer Ziggy Modeliste, and as a studio session singer. She ultimately concentrated her efforts in 1995 with SoVoSó (meaning \\"from the SOul to the VOice to the SOng\\"), a highly acclaimed improvisational a cappella group which evolved from Bobby McFerrin's vocal ensemble, Voicestra. She remains very active with SoVoSó and continues to perform on occasion with Passenger. She also functions as an instructor for Young Performers International, a nonprofit children's performing arts company in San Francisco, leads ongoing workshops teaching the art-form of CircleSinging, and provides private vocal coaching. In late 2009, Furthur decided to add backing vocals to their newly formed band. Zoe Ellis, a well-known Bay Area vocalist who has been a member of SoVoSó since 2005, was initially approached by the band, as she had previously been a backing vocalist for Phil Lesh and Friends, having performed on the 1999 album, Love Will See You Through. Zoe, who is the sister of Dave Ellis, former saxophonist for Bob Weir's RatDog, accepted the offer to join Furthur. However, her friend and former singing partner, Caitlin Cornwell, who was also approached by Furthur (and who also provided backing vocals for Phil and Friends and who is a former member of SoVoSó), was not able to commit. As an alternative choice, Zoe recommended Sunshine, her friend and singing partner from SoVoSó (and a longtime fan of the Grateful Dead), who readily accepted. Sunshine's and Zoe's audition for Furthur occurred at the Philharmonia benefit concert in San Francisco on December 20, 2009, where they performed with Lesh, Weir, and Jackie Greene. The backup vocalists' debut Furthur show was on December 30, 2009 (although they also performed at the live rehearsal sessions at the Mill Valley Masonic Center on December 27 and 28). Zoe toured with Furthur until March 12, 2010; Jeff Pehrson subsequently joined Furthur as a backing vocalist on May 24, 2010. On November 21, 2008, December 26, 2009, and January 28, 2011, Sunshine sang the national anthem before the Oakland Golden State Warriors basketball games, and on April 6, 2010, before the Oakland Athletics baseball game. On December 12, 2010, she performed, along with Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Jackie Greene, and Jeff Pehrson, at the annual Philharmonia benefit concert in San Francisco. She also appeared on December 3, 2011 at Run for the Roses: A One-of-a-Kind Musical Evening, a Rex Foundation benefit show, where she, along with John Kadlecik, Melvin Seals, Greg Anton and Robin Sylvester, performed a Jerry Garcia Band tribute set. Personal life Sunshine attended her first Grateful Dead show on May 25, 1992 at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CA. She first met her future husband, bass player-turned- executive salesman Bill Becker (who played in Passenger), that same year, and then reconnected with him in 1999. They married in September 29, 2001 and had a son, Geddy Becker (named after Rush bass player, Geddy Lee), on June 8, 2009. When not singing, touring, and teaching, Sunshine spends her time writing her own songs, exploring the outdoors, experiencing live music, and enjoying her family at home in the Bay Area.

It was part of the 27th Special Operations Group, the flying component of the 27th Special Operations Wing at Cannon Air Force Base. It was the first to operate the MC-130J Commando II. The 522d was originally organized in 1940 as the 16th Bombardment Squadron. When the United States entered World War II the squadron was deploying to the Philippines. Its ground echelon fought as infantry, with most members surrendering at Bataan, while the air echelon fought in the Netherlands East Indies, earning the squadron three Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC)s. In May 1942, the squadron reformed at Hunter Field, Georgia. It deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, where it was redesignated the 522d Fighter-Bomber Squadron and was awarded an additional three DUCs. Following V-E Day, the squadron served in the occupation forces in Germany until the fall of 1945, when it returned to the United States and was inactivated. The 522d was reactivated in 1946 and assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC) as a fighter escort unit. During the Korean War, the squadron deployed to Japan and Korea and was awarded its seventh DUC. In 1957, SAC transferred its fighter squadrons to Tactical Air Command and the squadron became the 522d Tactical Fighter Squadron the following year. It conducted numerous deployments to bases in Europe and the Pacific, including one to Thailand, where it again saw combat during the Vietnam War. The squadron was inactivated in 2007, when its parent wing converted from the fighter to the special operations mission. The squadron was reactivated in 2012 as a special operations unit, but was inactivated in 2014 and its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the 9th Special Operations Squadron. History =World War II= The 522d was originally constituted in 1939 as the 16th Bombardment Squadron (Light) and activated on 1 February 1940. It was stationed at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, and later at Hunter Field, Georgia, before moving to Luzon in the Philippines in 1941. After war began between the United States and Japan, the unit's air echelon operated in Australia. When American units in the Philippines surrendered, ground elements of the unit were part of the Bataan Death March. The unit was redesignated the 522d Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 23 August 1943 and then the 522d Fighter Squadron, Single Engine, on 30 May 1944. During World War II, it was one of the most decorated U.S. Army Air Force units. The unit later served in conflicts such as the Korean and Vietnam wars, and flew almost a dozen different aircraft in support of various missions. =Strategic Air Command= 522d Fighter-Escort Squadron F-84Gs, Bergstrom AFB, Texas, 1952 =Tactical Air Command= 522d TFS F-100D Super Sabre – 56-3150 about 1960 =Air Combat Command= 522d F-16C Block 50P 92-3921 The 522d Fighter Squadron inactivated in 2007 when the 27th Fighter Wing became the 27th Special Operations Wing. =Special operations= The 522d Special Operations Squadron was reactivated at Cannon Air Force Base on 7 April 2011. The first to be equipped with the Lockheed MC-130J Commando II special operations aircraft, it was tasked with supporting special operations commanders through day and night low-level infiltration, exfiltration, resupply, and air refueling of helicopters. In 2012, it achieved initial operational capability. The unit was inactivated and a ceremony marking this was held on 9 December 2014. The squadron's personnel, aircraft, and equipment were transferred to the 9th Special Operations Squadron, which moved to Cannon without personnel or equipment from Hurlburt Field.

An enhanced version titled Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen was released for the game's original consoles in 2013, then later ported to Microsoft Windows in 2016, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2017, and Nintendo Switch in 2019. Set in the high fantasy world of Gransys, the player takes on the role of a human protagonist dubbed the Arisen on a quest to defeat the dragon Grigori, a being said to herald the world's end, while uncovering a deeper conspiracy along the way. The gameplay focuses on the Arisen—a customizable avatar—exploring Gransys completing quests and fighting monsters in real-time combat. The protagonist is accompanied by Pawns, characters who provide combat support and advice; the protagonist has one customized Pawn, and two additional Pawns either pre-set within the game or other customized Pawns shared by other players through an online lobby. Both standard combat and boss battles involve grappling with or climbing on enemies. The design document for Dragon's Dogma was created by director Hideaki Itsuno in 2000 prior to working on Devil May Cry 2. Itsuno successfully pitched the project and production began in 2008. The 150-strong staff took inspiration from Western RPGs including The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fable II. The music, led by Tadayoshi Makino and including contributions from Western composer Inon Zur, used on a full orchestra and focused on ambiance. Dark Arisen was designed to incorporate fan feedback and offer a complete experience for both old and new players. The original version of Dragon's Dogma was praised by critics. Praise was given to the gameplay and the Pawn system, while the narrative was generally criticized as lacking. The Dark Arisen version was praised for its technical improvements and additional content. The original Dragon's Dogma sold over one million copies worldwide, and the different versions of Dark Arisen also met with positive sales. A Japan-exclusive massively multiplayer online role-playing game titled Dragon's Dogma Online released in 2015. An original net animation adaptation was globally released on September 17, 2020, on Netflix.  Gameplay  The player-created protagonist explores the open world environment of Gransys with their Pawn companions. Dragon's Dogma is an action role- playing game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The player is able to select between various vocations: Fighter, Strider, Mage, Warrior, Mystic Knight, Ranger, Assassin, Sorcerer and Magic Archer. Gender choice and appearance settings are also available. The vocation, or class system, changes gameplay and tactical options available to the player. For example, the Fighter has abilities that focus on hack and slash combat and the Strider is skilled at climbing large enemies. The game was designed to be playable even by those who are not skilled at action games. One of the game's main innovations is the \\"pawn\\" system. While the player's party is exploring the world, the three party members who accompany the main character are controlled by artificial intelligence, but the player can issue orders to them, including \\"Go,\\" \\"Help\\" and \\"Come.\\" One of the party members is a non-playable character (NPC) and belongs to the main character's world, while the other two party members are NPCs borrowed from other players by connecting online or are locally generated by the game. The party members, referred to as pawns, can talk, seek the main character's help, and provide information about enemies. The player must work on strengthening the main character and the party members. The pawns are vocal, yelling out useful hints and strategies, which are often vitally important to surviving tough boss encounters and dungeons. The pawn system also features social networking features. The game features a \\"grab\\" action, where the main character can grab or cling to enemies, objects, or NPCs. The player can use this feature for more advanced attacks. For example, the main character can either grab on to a griffin's legs and attack it directly, or climb up to reach its head for a more lethal blow. \\"In a lot of action games, with big enemies the tendency is just to have you hacking away at the shins. You don't get the full effect of fighting a giant boss,\\" Hideaki Itsuno, the director of Dragon's Dogma, said. \\"With this game you can climb all over it. If it has a body part, you can attack it.\\" The ability to climb enemies has drawn comparisons to Shadow of the Colossus. The game's large open world environments have drawn comparisons to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. In addition to the large open world, Dragon's Dogma features a large city environment with over 200 non-player characters (NPCs) who move about according to their own schedules. The player is able to communicate with the residents in full voice. The game also features a persistent world with a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle. The game's hack and slash combat elements have been compared to their own Devil May Cry series and Dark Souls. Some of the fantasy elements are reminiscent of Breath of Fire, and the combat and party systems have been compared to Monster Hunter. = Multiplayer = Although Dragon's Dogma does not feature a direct multiplayer mode, the developers have revealed that players can compete online with asynchronous encounters called Events via Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network. One such event includes the 'Ur-Dragon' in which the effect of each party's attacks will be combined until the Ur-Dragon finally falls. Players that deal the fatal blow will receive the maximum reward, but all players can still obtain both common and rare items dropped by the Ur-Dragon when they inflict damage. Synopsis The game opens with a group led by a knight named Savan nearing the end of a quest to defeat the Dragon, a being which signals the end of days. An unknown time later in the present day Duchy of Gransys, the protagonist's village of Cassardis is attacked by the newly-arrived Dragon. When the protagonist attacks the Dragon, the Dragon takes his/her heart. The protagonist remains alive after this, marking him/her as the \\"Arisen\\", a figure destined to face the Dragon and stop the coming apocalypse; the Arisen is served by Pawns, human-like beings who live to fight the Dragon, and the Arisen creates a new Pawn shortly after beginning their quest. Heading to a nearby encampment, the protagonist defends an encampment of soldiers from a Hydra attack, taking one of its heads before driving it back; this is witnessed by Mercedes Marten, a soldier sent from a neighbouring nation to support Gransys's Duke Edmun Dragonsbane against the Dragon. Mercedes helps the Arisen escort the Hydra head to the Duke's capital of Gran Soren; upon completing quests for the local Wyrm Hunter guild, the Arisen is granted an audience with the Duke, who has held the position for over a century without ageing after claiming victory against the Dragon. During his/her quest, the Arisen finds aid from a former Arisen dubbed the Dragonforged; investigates an underground tower dubbed the Everfall by the local Pawn guild; confronts Salvation, a nihilistic cult led by a man named Elysion which seeks the Dragon's victory; and learns of Mercedes's role as a token ally as other nations have come to fear Gransys becoming too powerful should the Duke defeat a second Dragon. The Arisen eventually confronts Elysion, who turns his followers into undead to kill the Arisen. The Arisen defeats them, but the Dragon arrives and kills Elysion. The Dragon challenges the Arisen to find him and stop the apocalypse. Confronting the Dragon, the Dragon offers the Arisen a choice; fight and kill it, or sacrifice their beloved—a character the Arisen has grown close to during the game—in exchange for replacing the Duke as ruler of Gransys, the same bargain the Duke took when he faced the Dragon. Upon defeating the Dragon, the Arisen and all those connected to the Dragon—including the Duke and the Dragonforged—lose their immortality, and the Everfall becomes a bottomless pit which swallows part of Gran Soren. Returning to Gran Soren, the Arisen is attacked by the aged Duke and flees upon being accused of cursing him. While fleeing, the Arisen and their Pawns are swallowed by the Everfall. Passing into a higher plane after opening a portal within the Everfall, the Arisen faces the Seneschal, the being which sustains the world and the current form of the knight Savan. The Arisen is offered a choice; fight the Seneschal or return to Gransys and live a quiet life. Should the Arisen lose the fight with the Seneschal, they are reborn as the next Dragon. Besting the Seneschal results in the Arisen taking their place, unable to interact with the world below. The Arisen then kills themselves to break the cycle, falling back towards Gransys with their Pawn. The game ends with the Pawn awakening within the Arisen's body in their village to be met by their beloved. Production =Development and release= The concept for Dragon's Dogma was created by Hideaki Itsuno. He created the initial concepts of an RPG title and the Pawn system in 2000, before he was brought on board the staff of Devil May Cry 2. Itsuno had a chance to pitch the project in 2008 following the completion of Devil May Cry 4. With internal discussions going on about Capcom's next large-scale project, the company had asked for a concept which could potentially sell one million copies. Dragon's Dogma was one of seven pitches given by Itsuno. The main concept was an RPG based primarily about single-player but with casual multiplayer elements similar to watching a bulletin board system. The Pawn system and its Western RPG-styled formed part of the pitch. Itsuno's decision to pitch the project was due to the advances in gaming hardware, which had become powerful enough to properly realize the game. At the time Dragon's Dogma was pitched, social mobile games with features similar to the Pawn system had yet to take off in Japan, and it was before the popularity of hardcore action RPGs such as Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. It was also the first time an open world had been proposed for a Capcom title. Due to these factors, there was initial resistance and scepticism from Capcom executives. Capcom eventually approved the project after Itsuni scaled down his initial proposal to fit within projected budget and development resources. Development of the game lasted three years including early concept development, with the 150-strong staff being mostly carried over from Devil May Cry 4. Including external staff, the development team was over 200 people. As with other large- scale Capcom projects, the development team was divided into units with specific tasks, allowing production to be streamlined without compromising the project as a whole. The public reveal of Dragon's Dogma was planned for the 2010 Tokyo Game Show alongside DmC: Devil May Cry, but the visual quality of the title at the time was thought lacking and so the announcement was delayed. The game was eventually revealed in April 2011 at a special event by Capcom. Initially scheduled for \\"early 2012\\", Capcom delayed the release date by several months. A game demo was released on April 24, 2012 in Japan and North America, and April 25 in Europe. The demo offered access to the character creation system and two classes to use in two boss encounters from the main game. Characters created in the demo could be imported into the full game. Dragon's Dogma was released on May 22 in North America, May 24 in Japan and Australia, and May 25 in Europe. All versions came with a one-time download code to access a demo of Resident Evil 6. Following the game's release, multiple downloadable content (DLC) packs were released, ranging from cosmetic items to new quests. =Scenario and art design= The scenario and script were written by Haruo Murata. Brought on board the project during development, he was favorably impressed by an early demo of a Cyclops battle. He was in charge of writing the main scenario and dialogue interactions, with his main aim being to create a setting which would react to playing actions in a \\"natural\\" way. The world design and basic scenario were created by Makoto Ikehara, a veteran of the Breath of Fire series. He was not involved in the later parts of production, but he was able to bring knowledge of both fantasy settings and role-playing mechanics to the team. Another contributor to the scenario was Bingo Morihashi, who had previously worked on the scripts on the Devil May Cry series since Devil May Cry 2 and BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger. Itsuno cited multiple inspirations for the world of Dragon's Dogma, including The Lord of the Rings, Dungeons & Dragons and The Neverending Story. To research the setting, the team made several trips to Europe to research its scenery and architecture. The game's title evoked both the Dragon's key role and how the Dragon taught the protagonist—and by extension the player—about the world. The art directors were Daigo Ikeno and Makoto Tanaka. Ikeno was an established Capcom artist noted for his work on the Street Fighter series, Devil May Cry 3 and the first two Onimusha titles. Ikeno designed the Dragon himself, aiming for a classic high fantasy look and \\"cool\\" aesthetic. The final design emulated the \\"simple yet powerful\\" dragons of folklore, but with the main aim being to make the fantastical creature as realistic as possible. The characters were designed by Toru Kanaseki; monster designs were handled by Yoshinori Matsushita and Yumei Nagaki; weapon and armor designs were created by Kaoru Araki and Tomihiko Osumi; and background and concept art was designed by Kenichi Suzuki and Western artist Craig Mullins. During the initial design phases, several concepts were created but had to be discarded due to either design changes or a lack of development time and resources to include them. Tanaka described the world as a \\"an orthodox sort of high fantasy open world\\" similar to those used in Hollywood movies so players would immediately understand it. The characters' clothing was inspired by the clothing used in Medieval society. The clothing designs of Cassardis and Gran Soren were designed to contrast each other; the people of Cassardis had a lot of exposed skin and a blue color theme, while those in Gran Soren covered up more and used orange. While much of the final game used Medieval clothing designs, many of Kanaseki's early designs drew from Ancient Greek and Roman designs. As the key colour of the game was red, Kanaseki designed the default Arisen character designs to look good with flaming red hair. He also gave the Arisen a simple hairstyle. Mercedes was designed to appear capable of defending herself while maintaining her femininity. The monastic design of Elysion was designed to both serve as the model for Salvation cultist clothing and remain modest so as not to overshadow the character himself. The Duke was designed to show his growing mental strain, and his cloak—which incorporated dragon designs symbolizing his reputation—took a long time to complete. The monsters were created based on their representations in folklore and fairytales. Rather than making the original designs more fantastical, they were made more realistic. The art team tried not to stray too far from traditional imagery grounded in ancient legends and iconography; this approach was influenced by Mike Mignola's Hellboy comics and the manga Berserk by Kentaro Miura. =Design= The aim for the developers was, rather than using Japanese role-playing traditions, to emulate Western RPGs including Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fable II. Itsuno's original version of the game was substantially larger than the final game, including the whole of Gransys, a dungeon related to the game's lore, and the game world's moon. While utilising RPG elements, Dragon's Dogma was primarily focused on action gameplay as Capcom's staff were experienced with action games. Itsune described the game as their attempt to create a defining RPG experience similar to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The control layout was carried over from Capcom's other action titles such as Devil May Cry. Many of the action elements were carried over and how characters fought with enemies was also drawn from that series. The game's open world was the largest world ever created for a Capcom title. The world's design was intended to promote both realism and fantasy; game designer Makoto Tanaka compared the wished-for atmosphere to someone walking through the African savana and encountering its wildlife, but with fantasy beasts replacing real-world animals. The team gradually worked through the rules of the game world, which were all based on the real world as far as possible. According to Kobayashi, the game's scale and style—which were like nothing produced by Capcom up to that point—caused multiple problems for the development team. There were several times when Kobayashi felt like giving up due to the problems that came up. Due to the world's scale, the development team had to get used to multiple new sound management techniques, creating a new audio program to manage sound over in-game distances. A difficult sound to create were bell chimes, which were included due to their importance to Medieval European life when sounding for events. The sounds were recorded using a real bell at a Hollywood studio. Recording the bell chimes was troublesome, as the structure the bells were suspended in nearly collapsed. To help create monster noises, the sound team used the sounds of trained animals from Hollywood which were trained for roles in production. The game used the 2.x version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine, which had previously been used in several Capcom games including Lost Planet: Extreme Condition and Devil May Cry 4. According to the programmer Taro Yahagi, who was in charge of work for the engine, Dragon's Dogma was the most difficult project as MT Framework required a large number of adjustments. Previous MT Framework titles had been stage-based action titles, so transitioning to an open world was a drastic change and required the creation of a dedicated \\"World Offset\\" function which shifted the world based on player position so environmental data could be updated. The team could not increase the number of data points to solve the issue of rendering environments as this would have been beyond the available hardware. Another new addition was \\"deferred lighting\\", an advanced lighting engine which could maintain realistic lighting during the game's day-night cycle in the open world, in addition to environmental effects such as characters getting wet. The retail version of the game also incorporated an advanced anti-aliasing filter. Character actions, including combat actions such as grappling, where created using a combination of motion capture and inverse kinematics. Physics was controlled using a specially-created in-house physics engine. The physical interaction between large monsters and characters climbing on them using a combination of physics and motion-based algorithms similar to early water animation techniques. These designs were intended to work on the contrasting hardware of the PS3 and 360. The game was developed for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Xbox 360 (360) consoles. The choice of PS3 and 360 was chosen due to both the team's experience with the platforms and their large international install base. According to producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi, the team's previous experience creating Devil May Cry 4 helped with development as they both carried over technology and had familiarity with the planned platforms. The online functionality for the PS3 and 360 were respectively co-developed and supported by Sony Computer Entertainment and the Japanese branch of Microsoft. Their cooperation enabled Capcom to reduce running costs for the online functions to nearly nothing. The limited scope of online elements was a compromise which both fulfilled with gameplay goals of the team while avoiding many of the problems of full multiplayer. =Localization= The localization was led by Erin Ellis. When creating the dialogue, Ellis's team wanted to create a similar feeling to the writing of George R. R. Martin and J. R. R. Tolkien due to the dramatic style of the game's narrative. The team decided to use semi- archaic English words in dialogue such as \\"thou\\" and \\"aught\\", resulting in the team needing to keep themselves from going too far or adding in incongruous words that clashed with the archaic style. Rather than using conventional spell names such as \\"Fire\\" and \\"Ice\\", the team found old English words such as \\"Halidom\\" and \\"Ingle\\". In contrast to many Japanese games—which were translated from Japanese to English and then into other languages—Dragon's Dogma was localized in six languages at once due to the development team still working on the game during the localization process. This meant that the team were able to minimize trimming the dialogue down and eliminating improbably abbreviations. According to Makino, the team hired 82 voice actors; the recording took place in North America between two studios over fifteen weeks, with two audio directors supervising the process. The team used different accents to indicate people being from different regions of the world, promoting a sense of realism. The Pawn voices were difficult due to the variety of physical customization. The team ultimately chose twelve voice actors to record lines at different pitches. The game ultimately featured 20 hours of voiced dialogue, coming to 42,000 lines of dialogue for all characters. As English was the primary language for all versions, lip syncing was not an issue. Needing to handle the different pieces of the localization within the strict time limit was a new experience for both Ellis and the Capcom staff. =Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen= An expanded version of the game titled Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen began development in 2012 for the game's original platforms. The game included additional content including an extra dungeon dubbed Bitterblack Isle, with additional weapons and armor exclusive to that area, and full Japanese voice acting. Producer Minae Matsukawa and director Kento Kinoshita had both worked on the original Dragon's Dogma. Kobayashi acted as executive producer. Dark Arisen was Kinoshita's debut as a director. The game came about due to community feedback about the original game, with Bitterblack Isle being designed as a lore-based end-game dungeon with powerful enemies. There was also a wish to create a \\"complete\\" version of the game. Dark Arisen released in Japan on April 25, 2013 as both standard and limited editions. In Western territories, the game released on April 23 in North America and Australia, and April 26 in Europe. Save data from Dragon's Dogma can be transferred into Dark Arisen. A Microsoft Windows version of Dark Arisen was planned from an early stage, with the main aim being to take advantage of the Windows platform's greater technical specifications compared to the PS3 and 360, in addition to expanding the game's player base. The port was developed with QLOC. The team's main aim was to optimise the game for the Windows platform, rather than improving or expanding on current assets. The Windows version of Dark Arisen was released worldwide on January 15, 2016. It eventually released in Japan on October 5, 2017. Dark Arisen was later released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 3 in the West and October 5 in Japan. Dark Arisen was later released for the Nintendo Switch on April 23, 2019 in Europe and North America,https://www.perfectly-nintendo.com/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen- announced-for-the-nintendo-switch/ and April 25, 2019 in Japan.https://www.4gamer.net/games/446/G044658/20190109031/ =Music= The music director for Dragon's Dogma was Tadayoshi Makino, who had previously worked on Monster Hunter Tri. Maniko initially began planning the musical elements of the game in 2009, when the game world's design was still in a state of flux. Makino was initially pulled in two different directions by Itsuno and Kobayashi; while both wanted to make an impression outside standard fantasy music expectations, Itsuno wanted to use jazz while Kobayashi wanted to use hard rock similar to Queen and Kiss. By contrast, Makino wanted to use a full orchestra and ethnic elements, which resulted in the score having far more variety than anyone expected. Makino's team created samples, matched them against prototype promotional videos, then consulted sound staff at Capcom to blend the ethnic, orchestral and rock elements. The first completed track, the game's main theme, was favorably received by Kobayashi and Makino used the fusion of elements for the entire score. When creating his plan for the music, Makino decided to move away from the typical harsh-sounding action soundtracks Capcom games were known for, which used many high and low-pitched notes. Instead, Makino chose a softer sound for Dragon's Dogma. His aim was to not make the music too assertive, allowing it to blend in with the natural world of the game. Makino brought on three other composers to work on the soundtrack. They were Rei Kondoh, a composer who had worked on Ōkami and the Sengoku Basara; Inon Zur, a Western composer noted for his work on the Dragon Age series who was brought on board to make the soundtrack an international collaboration; and Masayoshi Ishi, whose work included the Sengoku Basara series and The Excitement of Haruhi Suzumiya. Ishi was involved from an early stage, when the musical direction of the project was still being decided upon. Kondoh was brought in due to her work on previous Capcom titles. Zur's methods of working were entirely new to the otherwise-Japanese composers, something which the team thought would benefit the production. Makino acted as general supervisor due to his knowledge of the game's story. During the composing stage, Kondoh and Zur were described by Makino as bouncing opinions off each other when creating the soundtrack when creating tracks for individual situations. The composition went smoothly for the team, with each member stimulating the other. Vocals for the main theme \\"Eternal Return\\" were provided by Aubrey Ashburn, a frequent collaborator with Zur. Ashburn was brought on board after the theme was written and recorded using a substitute vocal track. During recording, she had instructions via a livestream from the production team. The music was recorded in Bulgaria by the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra; the recording, which took place at the Bulgarian National Radio Studio, included roughly 130 musicians and choir. A European orchestra was chosen as Makino wanted a distinctive sound different from the typical Hollywood-styled orchestral sound. The recording was supervised by Thomas Böcker and his company Merregnon Studios, who were brought aboard the project by Harmonics International based on their previous collaborations on Symphonic Fantasies concerts. Rock elements included in some tracks were recorded in Japan by guitarist Tenyu Nakamura and drummer Tatsuya Suzuki. As much music as possible was recorded live rather than using synthesized instruments. The game's theme song was \\"Into Free -Dangan-\\", written and performed by Japanese rock duo B'z. The song was an English cover version of B'z's 1998 single \\"Samayoeru Aoi Dangan\\". The lyrics were written by Koshi Inaba and Shane Gaalaas, while the music was created by Tak Matsumoto. For Dark Arisen, Makino returned to compose new tracks for the game's new dungeon alongside Kondoh and Zur;Capcom (2013-04-24). \\"Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen Original Soundtrack liner notes.\\" (in Japanese) Square Enix. SQEX-10277~80. Retrieved on . the new work, mainly focused on the new dungeon, covered 24 tracks. In contrast to Dragon's Dogma, the added music for Dark Arisen made heavy use of synthesized music. Despite moving away from the style of the main game, Makino wanted to ensure the new music remained thematically in tune with the rest of the soundtrack. The new vocal theme for Dark Arisen, \\"Coils of Light\\", was composed by Makino and performed by Japanese singer Raychell. When first contacted about the project, Raychell was already familiar with Dragon's Dogma and daunted by the prospect of providing a new theme song. The lyrics were written by Raychell to convey the game's world, in addition to the dark atmosphere of the new dungeon. Makino created \\"Coils of Light\\" using the core melody of \\"Eternal Return\\", tying into the original soundtrack. The English version of \\"Coils of Light\\" was sung by William Montgomery. The official soundtrack album for Dragon's Dogma was released on May 23, 2012. Featuring 66 tracks across two CDs, the album was published by the music label of Square Enix. A shorter album was released by Sumthing Else Music Works as a physical and digital release on November 11. \\"Into Free -Dangan-\\" was released as a digital single on iTunes on April 4, 2012. The two-CD album for Dark Arisen released on April 24, 2013. The first disc contained the new music, while the second included a selection from the main soundtrack and tracks that could not be released on the original album. The Japanese version of \\"Coils of Light\\" was not included on the album. At Kobayashi's suggestion, Makino collaborated with Square Enix's Tsuyoshi Sekito, who had composed music for multiple Square Enix titles and performed as part of The Black Mages; Sekito performed guitar for some of the album's arranged tracks. \\"Coils of Light\\" was released as part of Raychell's album L ▶ R on April 24. A compilation album titled Dragom's Dogma 5th Anniversary Best, featuring tracks from across the Dragon's Dogma series up to that point, was released on December 20, 2017 through Capcom's music label. Reception =Original version= The game has been well received in Japan, where gaming magazine Famitsu gave the game an overall score of 34 out of 40, based on four reviewer scores of 8, 9, 8, and 9. Famitsu gave it a \\"Hall of Fame: Gold\\" award, praising \\"the game’s variety in combat, the effectiveness of working together with Pawns, the exceptionally fun sidequests, and the uniqueness of each vocation.\\" In the Western world, Dragon's Dogma received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 78/100, and the Xbox 360 version 75/100. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 and stated that \\"I left the game feeling that I made my mark on Gransys the way I chose to, instead of being escorted from plot point to plot point. When you're talking about an open-world game, I can't think of higher praise.\\" Eurogamer Italy said that \\"Dragon's Dogma is a great fantasy game, where the lack of a multiplayer experience is compensated from an impressive single player.\\" UK magazine PSM3 wrote, \\"Big, challenging and imaginative, but its hardcore nature won't appeal to everyone.\\" GameSpot gave the game a score of 8 out of 10. The review praised the \\"fantastic combat encounters,\\" one of \\"the best boss fights in any role-playing game,\\" atmospheric touches, and \\"striking choices\\" that lead to \\"an unforgettable ending.\\" The review notes that the game \\"takes chances, and it's that riskiness that makes this role-playing game so unique among its peers,\\" concluding that, \\"Engrossing and frustrating, Dragon's Dogma is a flawed and unique gem.\\" The review also notes that while the boss battles are \\"epic\\", in the sense they allow players to climb up enemy monsters, the game itself lacks an adequate fast-travel system. Play UK criticized it for low framerates on the Xbox 360 version. IGN scored it 7.5/10, stating \\"Dragon's Dogma has the scale and challenge of a great action RPG, but not the character or polish. Nevertheless, there's a lot to love here, like some great ideas that make you want to give it a chance.\\" GameTrailers praised the challenging combat and the gameplay mechanics, though they criticized the story as \\"flat.\\" Their rating for the game was an 8.7. =Dark Arisen= Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen received positive reviews. On Metacritic, the PC version scored 81/100, the Xbox 360 version scored 77/100, and the PlayStation 3 version scored 80/100. IGN scored the PC version 8.9/10, calling it a \\"thoroughly great action RPG\\" and stating \\"it has near perfect fluidity and all the epic feel of the Xbox 360/PS3 edition\\" and is a \\"valid alternative to The Witcher 3 or Dark Souls, if one can withstand graphics that are not really on par with today's standards.\\" Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen received a nomination for \\"Role- Playing/Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year\\" at the 17th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. In April 2020, IGN listed Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen as one of the best modern role-playing games, placing at number 9. IGN Staff cited, \\"It may be built off the massive open world RPG foundation of games like The Elder Scrolls and The Witcher, but there’s still nothing quite like Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen.\\" =Sales= Upon its debut in Japan, the PS3 version of Dragon's Dogma topped gaming charts with sales of over 302,000 units. The 360 version came in at fourth place with over 29,000 units sold. These strong sales broke the previous record holder for the fastest-selling new intellectual property of the seventh console generation. In the United States, the game sold 92,000 copies within five days. The game reached ninth place in the regions's retail charts for May. In the UK, the game debuted in third place in game charts behind Max Payne 3 and ahead of Dirt: Showdown. By the following month, the game had sold 1.5 million copies worldwide, being considered a major success by Capcom. According to the report, sales in Japan \\"exceeded expectations\\", while the game struggled in Western markets. Alongside sales of Resident Evil 6, the game was credited by Capcom for their record-breaking earnings during 2012. Dark Arisen for PS3 debuted in Japan at second place in gaming charts with sales of over 125,300 units. The 360 version reached thirteenth place with over 9,000 units sold. In the United Kingdom, Dark Arisen debuted in third place behind Dead Island: Riptide and Injustice: Gods Among Us. In July 2013, Capcom described sales of the Dark Arisen version had met with solid sales without outselling the original version from the previous year. The PC version, while suffering from lower sales due to less marketing, became both Capcom's fastest-selling and one of the three best-selling titles for PC in the company's history.

Its south faces drop steeply into the Höllentalkar cirque, its north faces plunge into the Riffelriß above the lake of Eibsee. A knife-edge ridge runs from the Great Riffelwandspitze in a southwesterly direction to the Zugspitze. The ridge of the Riffelwandkamm joins the Little Riffelwandspitze to the Waxensteinkamm passing over the Riffeltorkopf. A side ridge runs away to the Eastern Riffelkopf (Östlichen Riffelkopf), whose east face plummets vertically into the Höllental valley.  Bases and routes  The most suitable base for an ascent over the south face is the Höllentalanger Hut (1,381 m). The routes on the northern side are best approached from the Eibsee or the railway halt of Riffelriß on the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway. The easiest route to the Little Riffelwandspitze runs from the col of Riffelscharte and the Riffeltorkopf up steep Schroffen and gullies to the top (climbing grade I (UIAA)). The Great Riffelwandspitze was first climbed on 2 August 1866 via the east ridge by F. Resch and C. Sam. They then succeeded in making the first ridge crossing to the Zugspitze. The route is classified as grade IV- and has long been viewed as the most difficult and dangerous route in the Wetterstein Mountains.Toni Hiebeler: Zugspitze – Von der Erstbesteigung bis heute.

It extends from Hornerstown, New Jersey, to the Assunpink Wildlife Management Area. The trail occupies the former roadbed of the Pennsylvania Railroad's Pemberton & Hightstown line, which was originally chartered by the Union Transportation Company (UTC) in 1864. The railroad connected local dairies and farms with larger railroads at rail junctions in Pemberton and Hightstown, New Jersey. Traffic gradually dried up, and the line was abandoned by UTC in segments, starting in 1950 with the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike. The line was completely abandoned by 1984. The roadbed was later acquired by Jersey Central Power & Light and was subsequently leased for trail use in 1998 by the Monmouth County Park system. The Union Transportation Trail—named after the UTC—first opened in September 2010 with the gravel-surfaced section between Millstream Road and Jonathan Holmes Road. A extension to the trail was completed in 2011, with the section between County Route 526 and Herbert Road/Sharon Station Road being added in February 2015. Construction on the segment between County Route 526 and Davis Station Road, in length, commenced in 2015 and was completed in September 2016. The fifth segment, completed in late January 2017, comprises the between Herbert Road/Sharon Station Road and County Route 539, passing through the Assunpink Wildlife Management Area. Trail access points with parking lots are located at Millstream Road, Jonathan Holmes Road, and the intersection of Herbert Road and Sharon Station Road, all of which are in Upper Freehold. A grant awarded through the New Jersey Department of Transportation will fund the construction of a extension of the trail from its current terminus at Old York Road in Upper Freehold. This extension will cross over the New Jersey Turnpike and connect to a proposed trail head and parking lot, located near the intersection of Airport Road in East Windsor. Additional expansion is also being considered, including a southern extension into New Egypt, which may extend further south into eastern Burlington County and connect to the Kinkora Branch Trail and the Pemberton Rail-Trail. This would function as a link with the southern New Jersey/greater Philadelphia trail network.

History  alt=Half-length portrait of Archbishop John Carroll After the completion of Healy Hall, an area was set aside for a future statue of Georgetown's founder. On January 23, 1909, in a speech titled \\"A Dream Realized and a Dream Still Unfulfilled,\\" Rev. John A. Conway, S.J. announced to Georgetown alumni at the annual Founder's Day banquet his wish that a monument to John Carroll, the founder of Georgetown University, be erected. In addition to establishing the university, Carroll was the first Bishop and later Archbishop of Baltimore, the oldest Catholic see in the United States, making him the first Catholic bishop in the United States. Fundraising began that year, and a total of $7,000 was raised in the effort (). = Dedication = Three days of pomp over the erection of the statue began on the evening of May 3, 1912. The Philodemic Society hosted a reception in Gaston Hall, with music provided by the university's glee club. Thomas Walsh delivered an ode, and Daniel William O'Donoghue gave a history of the society and a tribute to the life of John Carroll. Afterwards, the alumni retired to the refectory and gave informal speeches. The statue was publicly unveiled at 11:00 a.m. on May 4, 1912. In advance of the scheduled unveiling, the foundry that was casting the statue notified the university that the metalwork would not be ready in time. Not wishing to rescind invitations to dignitaries slated to speak, Georgetown went ahead with the unveiling ceremony after a brown-painted plaster cast of the statue was placed on the pedestal, unbeknownst to the several thousand ceremony attendees. This secret was kept until 1940, when Brother James Harrington, the overseer of campus workers in 1912, revealed it to the university's student newspaper, The Hoya. The ceremony began with a procession of clergy, government officials, faculty, and alumni. At the unveiling, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White formally presented the statue on behalf of the National Alumni Association, which financed the project. In his speech—which was said to have had a profound impact on Edmund A. Walsh (the founder of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service), who was in attendance—White commented on the connection between John Carroll and his brother, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, and on the common Christian principles that underlie the founding of Georgetown University and the United States. Following his speech, the American flag was lifted to reveal the statue, as the United States Marine Band played \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". alt=Photograph looking up at Bishop John Carroll with the Healy Hall clocktower in the background Additional speeches were made by: the Archbishop of Baltimore, Cardinal James Gibbons; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Champ Clark; the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, Ambassador Baron Hengelmuller; the Attorney General, George W. Wickersham; the president of the National Alumni Association and chairman of the statue's ways and means committee, George E. Hamilton; and the President of Georgetown University, Alphonsus J. Donlon. President William Howard Taft was supposed to speak at the ceremony but cancelled to attend a memorial service for his close aide who died on the Titanic, sending Wickersham in his stead. Also on the dais were Bishop Denis O'Connell of Richmond; Bishop Henry Northrop of Charleston; Monsignor Thomas Shahan, the rector of the Catholic University of America; Rev. Joseph Hanselman, the provincial of the Jesuit province of Maryland and New York; Monsignor John Joyce Russell, the pastor of St. Patrick's Church; Harry M. Clabaugh, the Dean of Georgetown Law Center; and four former university presidents: J. Havens Richards, John D. Whitney, Jerome Daugherty, and Joseph J. Himmel. The following day, celebrations continued at the Willard Hotel. Before more than 300 alumni, Rev. Conway gave a speech about Carroll's integration of his patriotic and priestly commitments. Senator-elect Joseph E. Ransdell, John G. Agar, Chief Justice Seth Shepard, and Dr. William Creighton Woodward also made statements. Afterwards, Bishop Northrop celebrated a solemn mass in Dahlgren Chapel, during which Rev. Terence J. Shealy made a speech about Carroll's influence on the Constitution's prohibition of religious tests for public office under Article VI. The festivities concluded with a reception hosted by the president of the university and the faculty. Several weeks later, the plaster cast stand-in was replaced with its bronze counterpart in the middle of the night.  Description  Bishop John Carroll is positioned on a circular lawn between Healy Hall and the university's front gates, an area known as Healy Circle. It was created by Irish sculptor Jerome Connor who trained as a stone carver. alt=Upper portion of the statue with the steps and stone façade of Healy Hall in the background The bronze sculpture depicts John Carroll, seated in a chair and resting his hands on its arms as he gazes slightly to his right, toward the front gates and out onto the Potomac River and downtown Washington. His lips are pressed together, and he appears to be in a moment of thought. In his right hand is a book, in which his index finger is inserted to mark a page. Carroll is dressed in Jesuit ecclesiastical attire, which sprawls over the arms and across the back of the chair. His hair is brushed away from his face and reaches down to his collar. Beneath his chair is a stack of books, a decoration that was inspired by the books beneath the chair of the John Harvard statue at Harvard University, on which Bishop John Carroll was modeled. The bronze sculpture portion of the statue measures long by wide by tall. The sculpture rests on a plinth of North Carolina granite, which measures long by wide by tall. This brings the overall dimensions of the statue to long, wide, and tall. An inscription on the front of the base reads: \\"JOHN CARROLL\\" and beneath it, \\"FOVNDER\\", while the rear contains the words \\"PRIEST\\" and beneath it, \\"PATRIOT PRELATE\\". On the right-hand side of the sculpture, near the base, is the artist's signature and date of completion: \\"Jerome Conner – 1912\\".  Student traditions  alt=Photograph of Healy Circle, with the statue in the center and Healy Hall in the background A popular belief is that the sculpture was modified in 1923 by filling in the space beneath the chair with a bronze stack of books in response to pranks by students who would place a chamber pot in the vacant space. However, this myth is untrue, as the books were a part of the original statue from its creation. On one occasion, students painted the statue red. A tradition that has developed is for graduating Georgetown students to climb the statue and sit in the lap of John Carroll. The statue has appeared in a number of films, including The Exorcist, The Exorcist III, Scorpio, and Born Yesterday.

To the northeast the ridge continues to the 2,264 m high Schönangerspitze. Whilst on the southern side grassy slopes, punctuated by rocky schrofen, run almost to the summit ridge, on the northern side, bare rock faces drop steeply away.  Bases and routes  The wind gap of the Riffelscharte to the southwest forms a crossing between northern and southern sides of the Waxensteinkamm crest and can be reached on marked hiking trails from the Eibsee (partly over protected klettersteigs) or from Ehrwald, as well as from the valley of Höllental. The most important base for these mountains, the Höllentalanger Hut (1,381 m) lies in the last-named valley. The Southern Riffelspitze can be reached from the Riffelscharte in about 20 minutes along a grade I climb. A climbing route of grade V- difficulty runs up the northwest face. The normal route to the Northern Riffelspitze runs from the Southern Riffelspitze in 20 minutes and is a climb of grade I difficulty.

He was the treasurer for the construction of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and also the chief sponsor of the Bradford Canal. Life John Hustler was the eldest son of William Hustler of Steeton (d. 11 May 1759) and Jane Jowet (1685–1745) at Apple Tree Farm, Low Fold, Bolton, near Bradford. His parents were Quakers and he was educated at the Friends' school in Goodmanend, Bradford and after an apprenticeship as a sorter and stapler of wool he joined his father and uncle (John) in the leading merchant business in the town. By 1752 he gave evidence before a parliamentary committee dealing with the false practices of wool growers and in 1764 was largely responsible for pressing for legislation against closed shop practices of textile workers. In 1777 he was elected chairman of the newly established Yorkshire Worsted Committee acting as a policing agency to prevent fraud and embezzlement in the industry. He proposed the Bradford Piece Hall and was responsible for opening out Bradford centre and was involved with several turnpikes. In 1766, following a meeting at the Sun Inn, Bradford which launched the idea of a cross-country canal from Leeds to Liverpool, he became the chairman and treasurer of the Bradford committee, writing a pamphlet A Summary View of the Proposed Canal from Leeds to Liverpool in 1770 which helped in the successful bid to bring the canal bill into law and was responsible for much of the fund raising. The next year he also raised support for a branch canal to Bradford which was finished by 1774. He had colliery interests in Bradford and Wigan motivating his efforts. He married Christiana Hird, a Quaker minister, in 1763 and they had six children, two sons and four daughters. He built Undercliffe House at Eccleshill where he lived for the rest of his life, playing host to itinerant Quaker ministers.

Life In 1888, he emigrated to Holyoke, Massachusetts. His father was a stonemason, which led to Connor's jobs in New York as a sign painter, stonecutter, bronze founder and machinist. Inspired by his father's work and his own experience, Connor used to steal his father's chisels as a child and carve figures into rocks. It is believed he may have assisted in the manufacture of bronzes such as the Civil War monument in Town Green in South Hadley, Massachusetts erected in 1896 and The Court of Neptune Fountain at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., completed in 1898. He joined the Roycroft arts community, in 1899 where he assisted with blacksmithing and later started creating terracotta busts and reliefs and eventually, he was recognized as Roycroft's sculptor-in-residence. One of the most ambitious works he created was The Marriage of Art and Industry. Connor is reported to have dedicated the better part of a year on the monument's construction. With new ideas came additions, improvements, and increased weight. Connor worked on the upper floor of an old barn, and one evening, as Roycrofters and visitors relaxed on the peristyle of the Roycroft Inn, a thunderous crash was heard from Connor's studio. The beams under the second floor had given way, and Connor's Marriage fell to pieces. Fortunately, no one was hurt. After four years at Roycroft, he then worked with Gustav Stickley and became well known as a sculptor being commissioned to create civic commissions in bronze for placement in Washington, D.C., Syracuse, East Aurora, New York, San Francisco, and in his native Ireland. In 1910, he established his own studio in Washington, D.C. From 1902 until his death, Connor produced scores of designs ranging from small portrait heads to relief panels to large civic commissions realized in bronze. Connor was a self-taught artist who was highly regarded in the United States where most of his public works can be seen. It was felt he was heavily influenced by the work of Irish American sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens. He used the human figure to give expression to emotions, values and ideals. Many of the commissions he received were for civic memorials and secular figures which he cast in bronze, a pronounced departure from the Irish tradition of stone carved, church sponsored works Connor is a recognized world class sculptor and his best known work is Nuns of the Battlefield located at the intersection of Rhode Island Ave NW, M St & Connecticut Ave NW in Washington, D.C., United States. Nuns of the Battlefield was surveyed in 1993 by the Smithsonian for their Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. It serves as a tribute to the over six hundreds nuns who nursed soldiers of both armies during the Civil War, and is one of two monuments in the District that represent women's roles in the American Civil War.Jacob, Kathryn Allmong. Testament to Union: Civil War monuments in Washington, Part 3. JHU Press, 1998, p. 125-126. The sculpture was authorized by Congress on March 29, 1918 with the agreement that the government would not fund it. The Ancient Order of Hibernians, raised $50,000 for the project. Jerome Connor was chosen since he focused on Irish Catholic themes, being one himself. but he ended up suing the Order for nonpayment. He worked in the United States until 1925 and moved to Dublin where he opened his own studio, but, lack of financial support and patrons caused his work to slow. In 1926 he was contacted by Roycroft and asked to design and cast a statue of Elbert Hubbard who, with his wife Alice, had died in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania. It was unveiled in 1930 and today it stands on the lawn of East Aurora's Middle School across the street from the Roycroft Chapel building. Bronze statue of Robert Emmet,1916, by Jerome Connor, from the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Currently on view in Washington, DC on Massachusetts Avenue between 24th and S Streets, NW, in a small park near the Irish embassy. While working on the Hubbard statue, Connor received a commission to create a memorial for all the Lusitania victims. It was to be erected in Cobh, County Cork where many of the victims were buried. The project was initiated by the New York Memorial Committee, headed by William H. Vanderbilt whose father Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, like Elbert and Alice Hubbard, perished on the Lusitania. Connor died before the Lusitania memorial was completed and based on Connor's design its installation fell to another Irish artist. Throughout his career, Connor was also known as Patrick Jeremias Connor, Jerome Conner, Jerome Stanley Connor, J. Stanley Connor, and \\"St. Jerome\\" Connor. He died on August 21, 1943 of heart failure and reputably in poverty. There is a now a \\"Jerome Connor Place\\" in Dublin and around the corner there is a plaque in his honour on Infirmary Road, overlooking Dublin's Phoenix Park (his favourite place) with the words of his friend the poet Patrick Kavanagh: Works The following are some of Connor's public sculptures: =Major works in the United States= *Civil War Memorial, South Hadley, Massachusetts, 1897 *Bishop John Carroll, Georgetown University, Washington D.C., 1912 *The Supreme Sacrifice, Washington D.C., 1920 *Nuns of the Battlefield, Washington D.C., 1924 *Victory Memorial, The Bronx, New York City, 1925 *Elbert Hubbard, East Aurora, New York, 1930 =Major works in Ireland= *Lusitania Peace Memorial, Cobh, begun in 1936, completed 1968 * Éire.

The genus is solely known from the Early Eocene Baltic amber deposits in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. History and classification Glisachaemus jonasdamzeni is known only from one fossil, the holotype, number \\"No. 20067\\". It is a single male individual preserved in a clear yellow amber specimen with several unidentified Collembola associated and a parasitic mite on its dorsal surface. The specimen is complete, with only the right foreleg detached, but associated close by the body. The male was entombed while in flight posture, with both the hemelytra and hindwings spread. The amber is currently residing in the private collection of Jonas Damzen, Vilnius, Lithuania. The specimen is to be donated to the Museum of Amber Inclusions, University of Gdańsk in Gdańsk, Poland with the accession number \\"MIB 5075\\". G. jonasdamzeni was first studied by Jacek Szwedo, with his 2007 type description being published in the journal Alavesia. The generic name was coined by Jacek Szwedo as a combination of the Old Prussian word glisis, meaning \\"amber\\", and Flachaemus, a modern planthopper genus. This is in reference preservation of the type specimen and the genus that Glisachaemus is possibly related. The specific epithet \\"jonasdamzeni\\" was designated by Jacek Szwedo in honor of the collector of the specimen, Jonas Damzen. Description Glisachaemus jonasdamzeni is in length and has a wing span of . Though similar to the related genus Flachaemus of South Africa, there are several notable differences between the genera. Flachaemus has an upper surface of the head which is flat with no border. Glisachaemus in contrast has front edge of upper surface delimited by transverse carina. The upper surface in Glisachaemus is shorter than its width, while in Flachaemus the surface is twice as long as it is broad. Also noted is the grouping of spines along the hind tibia of the genera, in Flachaemus the apical spines are grouped while in Glisachaemus they are not.

The elaborate building was the residence of Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld-Vorderort, governor of Luxembourg, who began its construction in 1563 and continued to extend it until his death in 1604. For this reason, it is also known as the Palais Mansfeld or Mansfeld Palace. Almost nothing remains of it to this day. History Mansfeld was appointed governor of Luxembourg in 1545 when he was only 28 years old. His successful military career combined with his interest in antiquity help to explain what drove him to embark on such an ambitious architectural project. Construction started when Mansfeld and his second wife, Marie de Montmorency, bought the hermitage and the Margaret's chapel belonging to it, as well as twenty houses and additional land from Neumünster Abbey. To build the castle, the road from Neudorf to Clausen was interrupted and a new path built around the land. Mansfeld also rented and closed off the old park of the Counts of Luxembourg, and exchanged plots of land belonging to Neumünster Abbey for those he had purchased. In 1590 he started to surround the whole area with a wall. The site itself offered not only magnificent views of the city from the front and of rocks and forests from the back but above all water from the River Alzette was available for the gardens, baths and fountains. Indeed, with a façade some 200 metres long, the castle was set back against the surrounding rocks in order to provide a maximum amount of space for the gardens. The gardens were decorated with antique statues, many of which were Roman works of art found in nearby Arlon. The estate, which also included a hunting park, had a 5 km perimeter enclosed by solid walls. Although the name of the architect is unknown, he appears to have been from the Netherlands, perhaps an associate of Hans Vredeman de Vries whose influence can clearly be seen. Some sources maintain that the castle was inspired by Château Fontaine in Forest near Brussels.Linda Eischen, \\"L'Architecture civile: Renaissance et Baroque\\" in Alex Langini, L'art au Luxembourg: de la Renaissance au début du XXIe siècle, Fonds Mercartor, Brussels, 2006. .Jacques Mersch, \\"Luxembourg: vues anciennes 1598–1825\\", Editions Paul Bruck, Luxembourg, 1977. Joachim Laukens: Château La Fontaine (1656) In the gardens, a Venus fountain was built. This was a rectangular pool with semi-circular apses, with a Venus statue in the middle, riding on a whale. This was surrounded by animal statues, spraying water. Later, a pergola was built around the pool. This fountain, or its remains, are being excavated since 2003. Fall into ruin On his death in 1604, Mansfeld bequeathed the furnishings of the castle to Philip III of Spain, who transported all the works of art and antiquities to Madrid. The Infanta Isabella did not accept the legacy of the palace, which was laden with debt. As a result, it began to decay, and was destroyed during the siege of 1684 by the French. Little remains of the castle. From descriptions by Jean Guillaume Wiltheim, we know it was decorated inside. The castle appears on various old city maps. Knowledge of the castle's size and appearance mostly comes from period paintings by Georg Braun (with Franz Hogenberg) and by Joachim Laukens. They show the style was late Gothic with Renaissance influences.

Biography Perinetti started playing football matches with his friends in the district of Barracas, his birthplace. Due to his skills with the ball, he was encouraged to try registering with a club with the hope of developing a career in football. His first club was Talleres (BA) where he played with the youth teams. Perinetti came to Racing in 1915, after being recommended by his older brother Juan. He started at the fourth division playing as right winger. It was during those years when he met Pedro Ochoa (other skilled player who would be later nicknamed the king of the dribbling), who became Perinetti's partner inside the field and best friend in life. Perinetti debuted with the senior team two years later. He soon noted as a key player for Racing, being praised and recognised for his speed and control of the ball. He played 17 consecutive years in Racing, winning 12 titles with the club (10 domestic and 2 international).\\"Idolos: Natalio Perinetti\\" on Racing website During his brilliant career in Racing, then president of Real Madrid, Santiago Bernabéu, tried to convince him to play for the club, but he refused the offer because of his love for Racing.

Their origin dates back to the seventeenth century. They are derived from a combination of the Greek logos (λογος) meaning \\"word\\", and daidalos (Δαίδαλος) meaning \\"cunning worker\\". The two words combine to give λογοδαίδαλος which means a person cunning in the use of words, rather like the modern expression \\"wordsmith\\". Use of these words in earnest has never been common. Some serious-minded Victorian writers applied them with varying precision, commonly in theological literature and usually with pejorative overtones, suggesting what in the second half of the twentieth century was described by the dismissive catchphrase \\"semantic arguments\\" or \\"semantic quibbles\\", though that fashion has largely given way to correct use of the term \\"semantic\\". Nowadays \\"spin doctoring\\" might be a more appropriate expression. Illustrative pre-twentieth quotes include firstly one by George Field: :And as to scholastic wrangling and debate, in particular, they are mere logodaedaly, or a war of words ; which, though affecting to employ reason, puts the winning of the game or victory in the place of truth, and is altogether sensual, unknown to true philosophy, unworthy of the logician, and may be properly consigned, with all the logic of sophistry, factious clamour, and special pleading, to the abusers of reason at the hustings, the rostrum, and the bar.Field, George. Outlines of Analogical Philosophy. Charles Tilt, 1839. May be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/outlinesanalogi00fielgoog Samuel Bailey used the term with greater precision, distinguishing between logodaedaly and logomachy: :In questions of philosophy or divinity, that have occupied the learned, and been the subjects of many successive controversies, for one instance of mere logomachy, I could bring ten instances of logodaedaly, or verbal legerdemain, which have perilously confirmed prejudices, and withstood the advancement of truth, in consequence of the neglect of verbal debate, i. e. strict discussion of terms.Bailey, Samuel. Letter to a Political Economist. R. Hunter, London, 1826. May be downloaded from: https://archive.org/details/lettertopolitica00bailrich Neither however, used either term in anything like a favourable sense. Similarly, during the twentieth century, though \\"logodaedaly\\" does appear occasionally in serious usage, it is hardly ever without overtones; for example: :... we have sought to show in the last chapter that he cut through this problem by attributing magical properties to language, which enabled us to organize realities in propositions of the traditional logical form--to produce products which were simply true of all the particulars we observed. Austin arrived at Anderson's result, for practical purposes, by a feat of logodaedaly. and: :The suave urbanity of Ovid and the sententious brevity of Seneca had an instantaneous appeal for Lucan ... The obsession with logodaedaly was initiated by Ovid... Its application still is rare in any but unfavourable senses, sometimes grudging, sometimes downright invective: :What is called a \\"twisted dialectic\\" is in its operation far from dialectic, being rather a piece of logodaedaly, a legerdemain that seeks to screen the kind of double postulate that Barthes is usually so quick (and so right) to deprecate. Since the mid twentieth century the terms are prone to appear in sesquipedalian humour or satire; for example: ::What logodaedaly shall we practise then? ::What loxodromics to get behind the light? Perhaps the finest modern example of its humorous application is in Defenestration, by R. P. Lister. The poem relates the thoughts of a philosopher undergoing defenestration who, as he falls, considers why there should be a word for so obscure an activity when so many other equally obscure activities have no single name. In an evidently ironic commentary on the word that the poem takes as its title, Lister has the philosopher summarize his thoughts with: :I concluded that the incidence of logodaedaly was purely adventitious.J.

It is surrounded by the Trollheimen mountain range including the mountains Gråfjellet, Kråkvasstind, and Lorthøa to the south and Bårdsgardskammen and Okla to the north. The lake Gjevillvatnet lies in the next valley to the north of Ångardsvatnet. Regulation The lake was regulated in connection with the development of Driva power plant, which opened in 1973. The lake Ångardsvatnet is connected to the lake Dalsvatnet through the river Haugelva, which is only long. After the smaller lake Dalsvatnet, the water flows through a dam into the river Vindøla and it then flows east to the river Driva at the village of Lønset. The regulation of the two lakes has resulted in very little water flow in the river Vindøla for parts of the year. Uses The lake Ångardsvatnet offers good swimming and other activities such as fishing and boating during the summer. Surrounding landowners lease out fishing rights and sell fishing permits for sports fishing in the summers. In the winter, the lake offers groomed ski trails and good opportunities for ice fishing.

Pedro Téllez-Girón y Fernández de Velasco or Pedro Girón (died Seville, April 25, 1531), was a Spanish noble, 3rd Count of Ureña and a leader of the Revolt of the Comuneros. He was the son of Juan Téllez-Girón, 2nd Count of Ureña and Leonor de la Vega Velasco, daughter of Pedro Fernández de Velasco, 2nd Count of Haro. He married Mencía de Guzmán, daughter of Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia. When his brother-in-law Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 4th Duke of Medina Sidonia, died in 1512 without issue, Pedro Girón unsuccessfully claimed the title of Medina Sidonia through his wife. Pedro stated that Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, son of the third Duke and his second wife, was an illegitimate child. Pedro Girón had contacted the Junta de Tordesillas to defend his claims on the Duchy of Medina Sidonia, and became thus one of the leaders of the comuneros, together with Juan de Padilla and Antonio de Acuña. He was proclaimed unanimously Capitán General of the rebel army.  Leadership and defeat  Troop movements in December 1520 In 1520, Pedro Girón led the comuneros army to Medina de Rioseco, establishing his headquarters at Villabrágima, only a mile away from the royalist army. On December 2, Pedro Girón moved his army from Villabrágima to Villalpando, and took that city without resistance. But this manoeuver opened the road to Tordesillas for the royalist army, which in fact moved on Tordesillas and took it on December 5, overwhelming the small garrison left in the city. The loss of Tordesillas was a serious setback for the comuneros, who lost access to Queen Juana I and the claim to fight in her name. Many leaders had also been captured or had fled. Pedro Girón was blamed for his troop movement and was forced to abandon his command. Some historians later accused Girón of not merely making an error, but rather intentionally betraying the comuneros and coming to an agreement with the leader of the royalist army, his maternal uncle Íñigo Fernández de Velasco. This theory is considered possible, but not likely. On Resurrection Day, 1524, Pedro Girón was pardoned by King Charles I of Spain. When his father died in 1528, he became 3rd Duke of Ureña.

At age 11 Hilgers was sent to the Netherlands. When Hilgers studied at a technical school for mechanics in Amsterdam, his hobby was already building model airplanes. After completing his education in 1908 he went on to work in electricity plants in Nijmegen. As of 1909 he enthusiastically started building his own experimental gliders.Newspaper article: “Een 10-jarige vliegeniersloopbaan.

Promos usually appear during commercial breaks, although sometimes they appear during another program. Background Promos typically run from 15 to 60 seconds, with 30-second spots being the most common, although some occasionally last run as little as five seconds or as long as 90 seconds. Most promos show select video or audio clips of scenes or segments from an upcoming program (such as a television or radio series, film or special). Some television promos (particularly for an upcoming television series) utilize a monologue format in which a star or host of the program breaks the fourth wall, which is often done in a humorous and/or parodical manner. Most radio promos utilize this format as well, with a host of the program discussing the show itself, though some feature audio clips from past editions of the radio broadcast. Broadcast television stations promote upcoming newscasts by featuring teases of select story packages to be featured in the broadcast, such as an investigative report or a special-interest feature segment.WLVI The Ten O'Clock News Preview/Promo (1999) The airdate and time of the program's broadcast as well as the name and/or logo of the station or network that the program will be broadcast on are displayed either at the end of or throughout the promo (in the latter case, the airtime and network/station may be displayed before it is mentioned verbally by the announcer). Until the mid-1980s on broadcast television stations, the text showing the date and time, along with the station logo were displayed on the bottom of the screen (unlike with broadcast and cable television, airtime information is not pre- displayed on promos for syndicated programs as syndicated programs are typically aired at different times depending on the market, and are instead inserted by the station itself); however, stations now posterize graphics over the tail end of a syndicated program promos where the program's logo is shown (many stations use this treatment on promos for programs airing on networks that the station maintains an affiliation, such as Fox and The CW) or show the latter portion of the promo within a box surrounded by the graphic. Premium cable channels and other television networks that do not accept outside advertising traditionally only air promos during pre-determined breaks that start after a program concludes; the length of these breaks can vary depending on the start time of the succeeding program, it is feasible for multiple program promotions to be shown within the break until the start of the next program. Types of promotional media:- 1) television 2) radio 3) internet 4) billboards 5) newspapers, magazines 6) pamphlets 7) SMS 8) brochures 9) word of mouth An ad in the lower third of a TV screen during a show helps to remind people what network they are watching. Called a snipe, this type of promotion targets people, especially younger people, who are used to seeing such items when they look at computer screens or cell phones. Some people have criticized the practice because it is distracting, and in some cases such ads cover up subtitles and prevent information from being seen. In some cases, the additional information can help people understand a story, but in others, too much information can interfere with communication.

He was studying at the University of Heidelberg when the Elector of Bavaria, admiring a landscape, aided him to devote his entire time to painting. He became the pupil of Peter Verschaffelt. He next studied art in Paris (1768–1769). On his return, he was appointed painter to the Cabinet (court painter), and later professor at the Academy. In 1793, he moved to Munich. He was appointed director of the Mannheim Gallery (1798) but died in Munich, before entering on his duties. Works He specialized in landscapes, following the style of Berchem, and his work shows a jealous study of natural effects. His oil painting are in a number of German galleries (Karlsruhe, Darmstadt, Stuttgart, and Augsburg), but his work as an engraver has more importance. His etchings (about 300) were published by Frauenholz, in Munich (1809), as Œuvres complètes de Ferdinand Kobell, another of 179 pages were published by Kugler (Stuttgart, 1842). His plates mark a distinct advance in the treatment of landscape etching in Germany. Family He was a grandson of Johann Heinrich Kobell, who came to Mannheim from Frankfurt in 1720. He was the father of Wilhelm von Kobell, and the brother of Franz Kobell, both painters.

(Costa Rica/Uruguay)  The Stockholm Prize in Criminology Foundation  Initially, the Stockholm Prize in Criminology was financed through yearly private donations. However, given its success, and in order to secure its long-term financial viability, the Swedish Ministry of Justice and the Torsten Söderberg Foundation jointly decided to found a permanent, independent Foundation, the Stockholm Prize in Criminology Foundation. A major official grant was approved by the Swedish Riksdag in December 2011. The Torsten Söderberg Foundation, with the support of the Ragnar Söderberg Foundation, generously provided the necessary matching funds, as well as subsequent additional donations. The Jerry Lee Foundation, original donor to the Stockholm Criminology Prize, as well as the Tokyo-based Hitachi Mirai Foundation continued their support for the Prize as co-founders to the new Stockholm Prize in Criminology Foundation. Regular support is also received from the Japanese Correctional Association. The Torsten Söderberg Foundation, founded in 1960 by Torsten and Wanja Söderberg and their sons, is dedicated to promoting scientific research and educational programs, primarily within the fields of economy, medicine and jurisprudence. Over the past ten years, the foundation has on average awarded grants in surplus of 100 million SEK per year. The donations to the Stockholm Prize in Criminology Foundation have been made in honour of Med. Dr h.c. Edvard Söderberg. The Jerry Lee Foundation is dedicated primarily to reducing crime and enhancing education through research on what works to achieve these goals. The foundation is committed to solving social problems associated with poverty, especially in American inner cities that suffer from concentrated poverty. The foundation’s special concerns are elementary education and crime. The Hitachi Mirai Foundation is engaged in a wide range of activities including the prevention of juvenile crime and delinquency, the enhancement of correctional and rehabilitation services for prison inmates and reform school students, and the promotion of social understanding and cooperation on issues involving young people. Japanese Correctional Association is an Tokyo based Public Interest Incorporated Foundation, committed to the public welfare activities. Their objectives are prevention of crime and delinquency through enlightenment of the general public on idea of correction and rehabilitation of offenders.

Life He was eldest of the twelve children of John Skatergood of Chaddesden, Derbyshire, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Baker, yeoman, of Ellastone, a village in North Staffordshire. The parents were married at Ellastone on 18 Dec. 1608, and Antony was baptised there on 18 September 1611. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar on 17 December 1628, graduating B.A. in 1633. His friends at Cambridge included William Sancroft and John Pearson. Taking holy orders, he acted as chaplain at Trinity College from 1637 to 1640. On 2 April 1641 he was admitted to the rectory of Winwick, Northamptonshire, on the presentation of John Williams, bishop of Lincoln. This living he held till his death. He received a canonry in Lincoln Cathedral on 6 May 1641, and became chaplain and librarian to the bishop. In June 1663 he received, at the king's request, the degree of D.D. at Cambridge, in consideration of his great abilities and ‘sufficience in learning’. In 1664 Scattergood received the prebend of Sawley in Lichfield Cathedral, to which the treasurership of the cathedral was attached; he became chaplain to Bishop John Hacket On 16 August 1666 he received another Lichfield prebend, that of Pipa Minor, and in 1669 the living of Yelvertoft, near Winwick, which he continued to hold with Winwick. On 13 July 1669 he was incorporated D.D. at Oxford at the opening of the Sheldonian Theatre. In 1682 he resigned his prebend of Lichfield and that of Lincoln. In both benefices he was succeeded by his son Samuel. He died on 30 July 1687, and was buried in the chancel of Yelvertoft church. White Kennett, while bishop of Peterborough, purchased in 1724–5 Scattergood's ‘choice collection of books’ from Mr. Smith, bookseller, of Daventry. Works He contributed Latin verses to the university collections in honour respectively of the Duke of York in 1633, of the Princess Elizabeth in 1635, and of Charles I, on the birth of his fifth child, in 1637. In the last year Greek verses by him were prefixed to J. Duport's ‘Liber Job.’ From an unprinted manuscript in John Williams's library he edited ‘Annotationes in Vetus Testamentum et in Epistolam ad Ephesios,’ Cambridge, 1653 (new edit. Frankfort, 1704). The authorship is uncertain. Meanwhile, he joined with John Pearson, the latter's brother Richard, and Francis Gouldman, in compiling a collection of biblical criticism which was intended to supplement Brian Walton's Polyglot Bible. Their efforts resulted in Critici Sacri sive Doctissimorum Virorum in SS. Biblia Annotationes et Tractatus, which was published in nine folio volumes in 1660, with a dedication to Charles II (another edition Frankfort, 1696; 2nd edition Amsterdam, 1698). Scattergood corrected nearly the whole work for the press. On 8 March 1662 Scattergood and Dillingham were directed by convocation to see through the press the amended Book of Common Prayer. In 1666 he prefixed a Greek ode to Duport's Δαβίδης ἔμμετρος, and in 1676 Duport returned the compliment by including a eulogy on him in his ‘Musæ Subsecivæ.’ Scattergood edited in 1672 (2nd edit.) ‘XLVII Sermons by Antony Farindon.’ He was long occupied in a revision of Schrevelius's Greek lexicon, first published in 1645, and he prepared a new edition (adding 5000 words) of Thomas's Latin dictionary in 1678. He is further credited with having brought up to a total of 33,145 the number of references to parallel passages in a folio edition of the Bible issued at Cambridge in 1678 by the university printer, J. Hayes. This number exceeds by 7,250 the references found in Hayes's edition of the Bible of 1677. No copy of the 1678 edition is known to be extant, but a quarto edition printed by Hayes appeared in 1683, and repeats Scattergood's embellishments. Family Scattergood married Martha, daughter of Thomas Wharton, merchant of London. She died in December 1654, being buried at Winwick. By her Scattergood had two sons—Samuel and John—and one daughter, Elizabeth.

CHAS offers children’s hospice services, free of charge, to every child, young person and their families who needs and wants them. CHAS was formed in February 1992 by a group of professionals and parents of children with life-shortening conditions who had travelled to England for hospice care. In 2018/19, CHAS supported 465 children with a life-shortening condition, and their siblings, parents and wider families. The care provided is multi-disciplinary, including from doctors, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, play specialists and others. CHAS also employs medical and nursing staff who work in hospitals alongside NHS doctors and nurses.  Rachel House, Kinross  Rachel House supports children and young people at end of life, and with short breaks. Work to build Rachel House, Scotland’s first children's hospice, started in December 1994. The land to build Rachel House in Kinross was donated by the Montgomery family who owned Kinross House which stands next to the hospice. Rachel House was named after Lady Rachel Workman MacRobert in recognition of a £2 million donation by The MacRobert Trust. A 17-month fundraising appeal by the Daily Record newspaper raised £4 million towards the £10 million building cost and the full target was raised 13 months later. On 16 December 1994 celebrity supporter Philip Schofield cut the first turf for Rachel House, assisted by children from Kinross Primary School. The hospice was opened in March 1996 by The Princess Royal.  Robin House, Balloch  A fundraising appeal to build Scotland’s second hospice Robin House in Balloch near Loch Lomond began in 2001 with readers of the Sunday Post helping raise the £10million needed to complete the project. Robin House was named after the European robin bird. In May 2003, the work began on the building with celebrity supporters Ewan McGregor and Sharleen Spiteri cutting the first turf with six-year-old Robyn Watterson who at the time used Rachel House. Robin House opened in August 2005 and supports children at end of life and with short breaks.  CHAS at Home  In 2003 Rachel House at Home launched, offering a home care service to families in their own homes. The service originally operated out of The Highland Hospice in Inverness and moved to Ardross Terrace, Inverness in June 2009. In December 2008 Rachel House at Home became known as CHAS at Home. In December 2011 CHAS at Home launched an Aberdeen base at Rosemount Place, Aberdeen. Now CHAS at Home supports families across every local authority in Scotland, operating out of four hubs across Scotland. In 2018/19, CHAS at Home supported approximately 1200 visits across every local authority area in Scotland, providing both planned care and emergency end-of-life care. In 2018/19, a volunteer-led home support service was established to support families of children with life-shortening conditions and operates in east central Scotland.  CHAS in hospitals  Most children who die from a life-shortening condition die in hospital. CHAS employs 4 Diana Children's Nurses. These are senior nursing roles who work across NHS areas and are based in Inverness, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. In 2019, a new hospital-based CHAS team was established in the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow. This is the first children's palliative care team in Scotland. CHAS also jointly employs consultant-level posts with NHS Lothian, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and NHS Ayrshire and Arran. A report on work in neonatal palliative care in Edinburgh was published in 2019.  Research  CHAS published two pieces of research in 2007 undertaken with the Cancer Care Research Centre, University of Stirling. The first evaluated future research priorities for CHAS and the second identified the existing home care service. In 2008, the Scottish Government published the report Living and dying well: a national action plan for palliative and end of life care in Scotland. CHAS staff members were integral to the consultation on children’s and teenage palliative care. In June 2011 a new research project undertaken by the Cancer Care Research Centre at the University of Stirling was published investigating the experiences and symptoms of children and young people with life-shortening conditions. In 2015, research was commissioned from the University of York to calculate the prevalence of children with life-shortening conditions in Scotland. This was the first single-nation study of such prevalence in the world and was published in a report called ChiSP (Children in Scotland Requiring Palliative Care). In 2019, and update of the report was commissioned by CHAS from NHS Scotland's Information Services Division. The CHISP2 study identified that the number of children with life-shortening conditions is growing and that the majority of children who die from life-shortening conditions are under 5. The total number of children and young people with life-shortening condition aged 0-21 is now at 16,000; many of these children are stable but about one third have had recent contact with a hospital team.  Funding and governance  CHAS has been registered as a charity since 5 February 1992, currently registered as a charitable company with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), Scottish charity number SC 019724. The Chief Executive is Rami Okasha and the Chairperson is George Reid. For the financial year 2018-19, CHAS spent £14.4mon delivering charitable services. CHAS employs 380 staff and had 864 volunteers supporting CHAS in care services, fundraising, retail and administration. CHAS received £6m of its funding from NHS health boards and £700k from local authorities. The majority of its funding is provided by the general public through voluntary donations.  Sites  In addition to Rachel House and Robin House, CHAS operates out of offices in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Kinross and Stepps. CHAS Trading has a small retail team based in Kinross who manage four charity shops. The head office is in Edinburgh, which is where the Chief Executive, Finance and Administration (IT, Finance and Facilities), Fundraising and Communications (Fundraising, Public Relations and Marketing) and Organisational Development (HR, Learning and Development and Volunteering) are based.

Messages are transported from a secure web-based portal to the data sub-carrier via GSSNet, a satellite data delivery system. These alerts and messages are then received on ALERT FM receivers (mobile, wall mounted, or USB) or on cell phones equipped with active FM chips and properly installed software. ALERT FM receivers can be programmed to receive local NOAA weather warnings.  Company  Global Security Systems, LLC (GSS), of Lafayette, Louisiana, is the manufacturer, producer, and systems integrator of ALERT FM and GSSNet (satellite data delivery system). GSS has offices in Jackson, Mississippi, Lafayette, Louisiana, Sarasota, and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  The Network  ALERT FM messages are currently being broadcast via Satellite on the digital data sub-carriers of over 1100 radio stations in 14 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia) and British Virgin Islands.  Customers  In 2005, the Mississippi Office of Homeland Security awarded GSS the first in the nation a statewide contract to deploy the first nationwide phase of ALERT FM which included installing broadcast equipment on 35 local FM radio stations and receivers in all 82 county emergency operations centers. This made the State of Mississippi the first state the country to use ALERT FM. Since that time, ALERT FM has been expanded across the State of Mississippi and the United States. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency was able to expand the Mississippi state-wide system to include a total of 85 radio stations in Mississippi. Several Mississippi counties and other local governments have purchased and began using the system on a local level. ALERT FM has been implemented into all of the western Tennessee counties including the Memphis-Shelby County UASI; across counties in Alabama including the Black Belt region and Mobile; in multi-counties surrounding a nuclear power plant in Missouri; across coastal counties surrounding Corpus Christi, Texas; in three central South Carolina counties; into a border county in Michigan; into a Mississippi and Arizona tribal nation; and several community colleges across the country including colleges in Mississippi, Florida, and New Jersey.  Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)  In 2010, ALERT FM successfully participated in a pilot project for Federal Emergency Management Agency to validate Radio Data System emergency notification for inclusion in the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System program. The study was conducted by Northrup Grumman and included RDS technology from ALERT FM, Alertus Technologies and Metis Secure. The one-year study concluded that RDS is a viable communication tool.

Savina worked with many of the notable film score composers of the 20th century including: Ennio Morricone, Armando Trovajoli, Nino Rota, Mario Nascimbene, Stanley Myers, Stephen Sondheim, Philippe Sarde, and Miklos Rozsa. His work ranged from composing music for frequent spaghetti westerns such as Johnny Oro to being the musical director and conductor in Federico Fellini's Orchestra Rehearsal. In 1985 he won the David di Donatello Best Music award for the film score of Pizza Connection. Biography Carlo Savina came from a musical family—his father was the first clarinet for the orchestra of Italian public radio broadcaster EIAR. Carlo learned the violin as a child and went on to graduate from the Conservatory of Music Giuseppe Verdi in Turin where he studied piano, violin, composition, and conducting. In 1945 he began composing music for radio. Early in his career he was awarded a prize by the Accademia Musicale Chigiana. He started his own orchestra and soon was famous. In 1950 he began composing and arranging music for film. For the next thirty years he composed, arranged, and conducted music for over 200 films and became one of the most prolific, and perhaps underrated, screen and television composers of the 20th century.

The company operates based on a service contract between the Government of Greenland and Great Greenland A/S.  History  The company was created in 1977 as the Grønlandsgarveriet (The tannery of Greenland) by Hans Lassen. It specialized in tanning seal skin. In 1982, Grønlandsgarveriet became government-owned. The company name was changed to Great Greenland in 1991. From 2005 to 2012, the company recorded a deficit in yearly revenues. In 2013, it recovered with a NOK 5.9 million profit. The company had been seeking legal recovery after a former partner sold 58,000 of the company's furs without informing the company about it. During the 2014 Kopenhagen Fur, Great Greenland sold 9,000 pieces during the world's largest fur auction. = Fur ban = The import and sale of seal fur is illegal in the United States, due to the 1972 U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. The act categorically bans \\"imports or sales of all marine mammal products\\", regardless of the conservation status of the animal. On May 5, 2009, the European Parliament voted in favour of an EU-wide ban on seal products, exemptions allowing limited seal product trade for Greenland Inuit. The majority of the fur products are headed for the European markets, with Denmark as the biggest customer. Since the EEC seal skin ban in 1983, the company receives between 25 and 30 million DKK (3.5 to 4 mil EUR) annually to support and develop Greenlandic seal hunt and production. There are currently 1,900 licensed professional hunters on Greenland, of these an estimated 200 to 300 are economically dependent on supplying seal skins to Great Greenland. On average the professional hunters earn about 50,000 DKK (6,000 EUR) annually from hunting and coastal fishing, roughly 20% of this amount consists of direct subsidies from the Greenland Home Rule. The EU's 2009 seal ban led the company to close it last sewing workshop in 2016. In 2017, the company estimated the number of seals in Greenland around 12 million. Following the ban, many Inuit chose fishing as a main source of income and trade, leading to a seal overpopulation and a sharp decline of fish stocks (fished by men and the growing seal population)Seal skin folder, a product of Great Greenland A/S  Description  = Procurement of skins = The company purchases seal skin from all over Greenland. The company owns trading stations, skin centers, in Maniitsoq, Nuuk, Tasiilaq, and Upernavik, as well as independent trading stations in smaller villages, totalling more than 70 independent trading stations. Dried seal skin can also be purchased from the smallest communities via Pilersuisoq. In total over 2,500 people are involved in the seal skin trade. This makes Great Greenland Furhouse one of the biggest employers in the entire country. Also, of the 64 people directly employed the company, 51 are working in Qaqortoq, making Great Greenland one of the biggest employers in the town.

The younger Kobell was finally able to take a journey in one when his father arranged some business he could attend to in London in 1779. There he conducted his business while drawing all sorts of ships and boats, and when he returned to the Northern Netherlands in 1770, he gave up the pottery business to study art in Amsterdam. He studied for two years under Jacob de Vos and Cornelis Ploos van Amstel with such success that he was elected a member of the Stadstekenacademie (Amsterdam drawing academy). He travelled to Paris in 1772 and in 1772 settled in Rotterdam, where he helped set up a similar drawing academy; Genootschap Hierdoor tot Hooger.

There are two species included in the genus: Clymenia platypoda and Clymenia polyandra. Taxonomy Cultivated locally for its sweet fruits on a handful of southwestern Pacific islands, Clymenia was originally considered an obscure citrus hybrid. Botanist Tyôzaburô Tanaka noted that Clymenia would hybridize with a few other citrus plants (notably kumquats), but otherwise was generally different from other citrus in many aspects of its appearance. In the 1960s, botanist Walter Tennyson Swingle proposed that Clymenia might belong to a genus of its own. Swingle assumed that Clymenia and citrus evolved from a single common ancestor. Alternatively, Berhow suggested in 2000 that a close relationship existed between Clymenia and kumquat and that it might be a Citrofortunella hybrid. More recent genomic analysis showed Clymenia to cluster within the genus Citrus in a clade with the Australian and New Guinean limes, which though formerly placed in genera Eremocitrus and Microcitrus are now considered members of Citrus. Because excluding them would make Citrus paraphyletic, the Clymenia species may likewise belong in Citrus, with Clymenia relegated to the status of a subgenus. Genomic analysis also showed Clymenia polyandra to be completely homozygous, proving it to be a distinct species and not a hybrid. Description Clymenia forms a shrub or small tree, free of spines. Leaves feature a short, narrow petiole, which sets them apart from most other citrus, especially the papedas native to the same general area. Clymenia fruits are a small hesperidium, very similar to a citrus fruit. Sweet and lemony in flavor, the tangerine-sized fruits are highly segmented, with yellow pulp, and a leathery rind, similar to a true citrus fruit. They contain a large number of polyembryonic seeds. The fruit are eaten by the Bismarck islanders, who call it a-mulis. Native to a handful of locations on Papua New Guinea and nearby islets, Clymenia is far more tropical than other citrus, and even in subtropical parts of the United States, it can only be grown in a greenhouse. Specimens thrived in greenhouses in Riverside, California, but perished when planted out in the arid climate. They are locally cultivated in indigenous villages, but have never been commercially cultivated. One local name for Clymenia polyandra is a-mulis (Namatanai).

Pedro Virgili () (Vilallonga del Camp, Tarragona (Spain), 1699 – Barcelona (Spain), 1776) was one of the most prominent royal surgeons of Spain in the 18th century and one of the surgeons of the King of Spain. He has been described as particularly influential and was regarded as a role model by subsequent esteemed men of this profession in Spain, such as Antonio Gimbernat.  Biography  He trained in the medical profession in Montpellier and Paris. He served as a military surgeon at hospitals in Tarragona, Valencia and Cádiz, where he founded the Royal College of Surgeons and the Botanical Garden of Cádiz in 1760. Along with Jorge Juan y Santacilia, Virgili organized a scientific \\"assembly\\" which they had envisioned developing into a national academy of science in Madrid. A British medical journal of 1861 said of him \\"What Piquer was to scientific medicine in Spain, Pedro Virgili, his contemporary, was to scientific surgery ; but in this not so much by his writings, as through the powerful impetus he gave for its advancement by his successful organization of those separate surgical schools\\". Virgili is also noted for his use of tracheostomy to treat quinsy; the procedure is better known for treating diphtheria. One of his most notable publications was his Compendium of Midwifery, an important textbook used by new surgical colleges in Spain. He died in 1776 at the age of 77. The military hospital Sanitari Parc Pere Virgili (his Catalan name) in Barcelona has been named in his honor. An award is also given by the City of Cádiz and the Royal Academy of Medicine in his name.

The novel was later adapted into a Nickelodeon television series, Wayside. Setting The story takes place in the fictional Wayside School, a school that was meant to be built one story tall with thirty classrooms all in a row, but was instead built thirty stories tall with a single classroom on each floor, save for the nonexistent nineteenth story. The book is primarily set in Mrs. Jewls's class, which is located on the thirtieth story of Wayside School, and each chapter focuses on a different student or teacher at the school.  Chapters  ; 1. Mrs. Gorf: This chapter introduces the classroom on Wayside School's 30th floor. Their teacher, a strict woman named Mrs. Gorf, turns her students into apples if they misbehave even slightly. At times, Louis the yard teacher visits and assumes that Mrs. Gorf must be an excellent teacher if she has so many apples. She eventually turns all the students into apples, but the students, led by Todd, force her to change them back into humans. She gets angry and tries to turn them into apples again, but Jenny holds up a mirror in front of Mrs. Gorf, and she turns herself into an apple. Louis then comes in, sees the apple, and—unaware that it is actually Mrs. Gorf—decides to eat it. ; 2. Mrs. Jewls: Mrs. Jewls becomes the new teacher after Mrs. Gorf is eaten. When she first sees her students, she figures that they must be monkeys, because she's never seen children so cute. After the students convince her that they aren't monkeys, Mrs. Jewls begins teaching normally, though the students liked her original idea better. ; 3. Joe: Joe is a student who cannot count properly, but always ends up at the correct answer anyway. Mrs. Jewls holds him back during recess and attempts to teach him, but finds herself unable to do so. After recess, other students make fun of Joe, but Mrs. Jewls reassures him that he will wake up one day and suddenly be able to count. Joe asks why he has to go to school, and Mrs. Jewls explains that school speeds it up; if he didn't go to school, it could take him 70 years to learn, and by then he wouldn't have any hair. The next day, Joe wakes up and realizes he is indeed able to count correctly. He counts every hair on his head, totaling to 55,006. ; 4. Sharie: Sharie has big eyelashes and an oversized coat, and she tends to sleep through class. Mrs. Jewls doesn't care; she thinks students learn best when sleeping. One day in class, while sleeping, she falls out the window. Louis saves her at the last moment. ; 5. Todd: Todd is a good student, but he always gets in trouble due to Mrs. Jewls selectively enforcing the rules, as he was the first student to speak out loud in her class. Her class works on a three-strike system: first, the student's name is written on the board, then a checkmark is written next to it. Upon receiving a third strike, the name is circled, and the student is sent home early on the kindergarten bus. While working on his workbook, Todd is harassed by Joy, but gets punished for speaking out. Suddenly, burglars enter the classroom, having mistaken the building for a bank. Todd averts the situation by giving Joy's workbook to the robbers. Despite this, he's still sent home early on the kindergarten bus, though he receives a standing ovation upon leaving. ; 6. Bebe: Bebe Gunn is the quickest drawer in class, able to draw pictures faster than anyone else. She can produce a picture of a cat in under 45 seconds, a dog in less than 30 seconds, and a flower in less than 8 seconds. In one art class, with the assistance of Calvin, she makes 378 works of art in one hour. Mrs. Jewls tells her that the quality of art is more important than the quantity; in her words, if a single picture produced by a single person over the course of a lifetime is better than each of Bebe's pictures, the person with only one picture has produced more art than Bebe. Distraught, Bebe subsequently goes home to begin a picture of a cat; she indicates that she probably will have barely begun by the next day. ; 7. Calvin: Calvin is sent by Mrs. Jewls to deliver a nonexistent note to the nonexistent Miss Zarves on the nonexistent nineteenth floor. He consults Louis, who tells him that he's \\"not supposed to deliver no notes to no teachers\\". Upon returning to the 30th floor, Mrs. Jewls thanks a dumbstruck Calvin, who ultimately decides it was nothing. ; 8. Myron: Myron becomes class president. The class president's only job is to turn the lights on before everyone arrives, and turn the lights off in the afternoon after everyone leaves. Myron, unsatisfied, wonders if there's more to being class president. Subsequently, he saves the life of Dana's dog Pugsy, but is demoted due to arriving late to class. Stephen becomes the class president after Myron. ; 9. Maurecia: Maurecia eats ice cream every day for lunch. After Maurecia has tried all the ice cream flavors, she no longer likes ice cream. Mrs. Jewls decides to make ice cream flavors based on each student, which each taste differently to everyone but their namesake (who instead tastes \\"the flavor they taste when they aren't tasting anything\\"). Everyone likes Maurecia's flavor the best, but Maurecia likes Todd the best. ; 10. Paul: Paul is unable to resist the temptation to pull Leslie's pigtails. When he pulls on them, Leslie yells out in pain. He pulls one of her pigtails, earning him his name on the board, and then, after a brief struggle (including a hallucination of the other pigtail talking), he pulls the other pigtail, thus earning him a checkmark. He figures that he can pull Leslie's pigtails twice a day with impunity, until Leslie yells out in pain again. Paul's name is then circled and he is sent home early; it is suggested that Paul did not actually pull Leslie's pigtails the third time, and that Leslie's yell was unprovoked so he would go home. ; 11. Dana: Dana, a student with glasses, is suffering from a number of mosquito bites that prevent her from focusing in class. Mrs. Jewls turns the mosquito bites into numbers in arithmetic problems so that they don't itch anymore. ; 12. Jason: After Jason gets Joy in trouble for chewing gum, Joy puts her chewing gum on Jason's chair, so Jason gets stuck. After several unsuccessful attempts to get Jason unstuck from his chair (hanging him upside down and pouring ice water to freeze the gum), Mrs. Jewls decides that the only solution is to cut Jason's pants off. However, a solution is eventually reached when Joy kisses him on the nose, causing him to jump out of his chair. Joy was to be sent home early for getting Jason stuck to his chair, but because she got him unstuck, her punishment was rescinded. ; 13. Rondi: Rondi is a student who is missing her front two teeth. She is very confused when other people compliment her about the nonexistent things she has (particularly her missing two front teeth). When Louis compliments her on her two missing front teeth, she becomes fed up and bites him. It is said that a bite with missing teeth is even more painful than one with the teeth still in place. ; 14. Sammy: On a rainy day, a new kid named Sammy comes to Wayside School. However, something about him doesn't seem right, due to his odor and many raincoats. As Mrs. Jewls attempts to remove his raincoats, he begins to insult her and the other students; she writes his name on the board, checks it, circles it, and (in an unusual extension of the violation system) draws a triangle around the circle. After removing all of Sammy's raincoats, all that remains is a dead rat. Because Mrs. Jewls dislikes dead rats, he is thrown away. It is revealed that dead rats frequently try to sneak into her classroom, this being the third since September. ; 15. Deedee: This chapter is introduced as a story with a problem and a solution. Deedee, a mousy-looking student, is unable to get a high-bouncing green ball or a decent red ball at recess; instead, she ends up with the one yellow ball, which doesn't bounce and never goes the direction it's kicked. Even when running as fast as she can, she is still unable to reach the playground in time, as her class is on the 30th floor. Her solution is to disguise herself as a dead rat, knowing Mrs. Jewls' dislike of them. She is immediately thrown out to the playground, allowing her to get a green ball. ; 16. D.J.: D.J. is happy, and it spreads through the whole class, including the room itself, but he won't tell why. His explanation is that no reason is required to be happy. ; 17. John: John is a student with a round head who can only read upside-down. Mrs. Jewls says that the only solution is to stand on his head. Using a pillow, he attempts to stand on his head, but keeps falling over due to his round head. Eventually, he finds his center of balance, but falls flat on his face; this evidently flips his brain over, thus allowing him to see words right-side up. When Mrs. Jewls tells him to put the pillow under her desk and get a Tootsie Roll Pop from the can on top, he places the pillow on top and fails to find the can of lollipops underneath. ; 18. Leslie: Leslie can't figure out what to do with her toes, since she thinks they're useless. She tries to sell them to Louis for 5¢ each (a total of 50¢), but then he lowers the offer price on her six smaller toes to 3¢ each (a total of 38¢). When Leslie won't sell the small toes at that price, Louis offers her 10¢ total for the two big ones; she refuses to sell her toes unless as a complete set, thus losing the deal. When Louis asks if she would be willing to sell her pigtails instead, Leslie calls him crazy. ; 19. Miss Zarves: Miss Zarves is the teacher of the nineteenth story of Wayside school. However, there is no nineteenth story of Wayside School, which means there is no Miss Zarves. The book apologizes for the absence of a nineteenth chapter and moves on. ; 20. Kathy: Kathy hates everyone, especially the reader, even though she hasn't met them. Her reasoning is often self-fulfilling. When Kathy is afraid of her pet cat running away, Mrs. Jewls tells her that he won't if she cares for him properly. To prove her wrong, Kathy locks her cat in a closet, and he subsequently runs away, proving Kathy right. Similar examples are given, such as playing catch with Dameon (she is afraid of being hit by the ball, so she closes her eyes and refuses to catch, thus getting hit anyway) and receiving a cookie from Allison (she thinks it won't taste good, so she doesn't eat it until three weeks later, when it is stale and dusty). The chapter concludes that Kathy hates the reader because she knows they wouldn't like her. ; 21. Ron: Ron wants to play kickball, but nobody wants to play with him because he's not a great kicker. Louis teams up with him against the whole class, proving successful when Ron is pitching, but unsuccessful when Ron is kicking. The chapter ends with Louis chiding Ron for his poor kicking; Ron punches him, which is apparently much harder than his kick. ; 22. The Three Erics: There are three students in Mrs. Jewls' class named Eric: Eric Bacon, Eric Fry, and Eric Ovens. The students give each Eric a negative, stereotyped nickname that doesn't match his personality, but reflects a trait that the other two have. Eric Bacon, the skinniest child in the class, is nicknamed \\"Fatso\\", because the other two Erics are fat. Eric Fry, the best athlete in the class, is nicknamed \\"Butterfingers\\", because the other two Erics are poor athletes. Eric Ovens, the nicest student in the class, is nicknamed \\"Crabapple\\", because the other two Erics are mean. ; 23. Allison: Allison is kindhearted and generous, but has a short temper and often threatens to knock people's teeth out, as she supposedly did to Rondi. Throughout the chapter, Allison returns favors to each teacher she meets (lending a book to the librarian, giving food to the lunchlady Miss Mush, and returning a ball to Louis). At the end of the chapter, she helps Mrs. Jewls with an arithmetic problem (spelling the word \\"chair\\"), and in return, Mrs. Jewls reveals a secret: students are really smarter than their teachers. Allison claims that everyone knows that. ; 24. Dameon: Mrs. Jewls wants to know if Louis will join the class to watch a movie, so she tells Dameon to ask him. Dameon has to repeatedly run up and down all 30 flights of stairs while Louis asks questions about the movie, which is about turtles. Ultimately, Louis declines to watch the movie; he doesn't like turtles, because they are too slow. Afterwards, each student writes a paper about the movie. Since Dameon missed the movie, he decides to write that turtles are slow. However, he dropped his pencil on his way back up, and Louis returns it to him. To prevent this from happening again, Mrs. Jewls requests that each student write their name on their pencil. Dameon cannot figure out how to write on his pencil with just his pencil, comparing it to how his eyes cannot see themselves. ; 25. Jenny: Jenny arrives to school late, but everyone in her class is missing. Unsure of what to do, she decides to work on spelling. She is eventually approached by a mysterious man with an attache case, who begins questioning her. After consulting with two other mysterious men, they decide that she doesn't know anything, and let her go. Before they leave, they remind Jenny not to come to school on Saturday. ; 26. Terrence: Terrence is a good athlete, but a bad sport. Whenever other kids try to play ball games with him, he invariably kicks the ball over the fence. Ultimately, there are no balls left, so the kids get Louis to kick Terrence over the fence. ; 27. Joy: Joy forgets her lunch, but she notices Dameon's lunch (a turkey sandwich, a slice of chocolate cake, and an apple) and decides to steal it when he isn't looking. To deflect the blame, she places the leftovers on other students' desks. Eventually, Joy's mother arrives with her missing lunch (an old bologna sandwich and a dried-up carrot), which Joy offers to Dameon. As a reward for her generosity, Mrs. Jewls offers her a Tootsie Roll Pop, and she takes another while nobody is watching. However, the story notes that while Joy had a great lunch and Dameon had a mediocre lunch, it didn't matter to either of them what they tasted like five minutes later. For the rest of the year, however, whenever Joy eats any of the foods she took from Dameon, they instead taste like Miss Mush's porridge. ; 28. Nancy: A boy named Nancy and a girl named Mac are both embarrassed by their names, so they decide to trade. However, when the rest of the class hears about this, they want to trade names as well. Due to the ensuing confusion, nobody knows whose name belongs to who. Ultimately, everyone agrees to use their original names, except for Mac, who keeps his new name. Only the three Erics are unsure of what their original names were. ; 29. Stephen: Stephen is the only one dressed up for a Halloween party; according to him, since Halloween falls on a Sunday that year, it should be celebrated the Friday before. After a five-minute party, Mrs. Jewls continues with her lesson, much to Stephen's disappointment. Suddenly, the ghost of Mrs. Gorf appears to take her revenge. She explains that she can haunt the classroom because Halloween falls on a Sunday, so it should be celebrated the Friday before. Feeling validated, Stephen hugs Mrs. Gorf, which causes her to disappear. ; 30. Louis: Louis is revealed to be the author of the book. When recess is canceled due to a June blizzard, he tells a story to Mrs. Jewls' class about a normal school where students were never turned into apples, sold their toes, traded names, or even had Maurecia- flavored ice cream. The students find this story odd, and Mrs. Jewls chides Louis for making up a fairy tale. When told to thank him, everyone in the class boos.

This is a listing, and account, of notable cases; it is not necessarily a complete listing for New York City: Two 2011 basketball-program cases Two cases in 2011 – those of Bob Oliva and Ernie Lorch – have both centered in highly ranked NYC youth basketball programs sponsored by churches of different denominations. Both cases have also moved to a criminal stage due to actions which have been alleged to, or admitted to, have happened in Massachusetts. As with many abuse cases, the fairly recent accusations addressed events which happened many years ago. However, Massachusetts law froze the statute of limitations when the victims left that state and allowed the cases, thence, to be brought many years later. In the open case – Lorch's – the statute of limitations provision is being challenged in court. =Bob Oliva= In early 2011, long-time basketball coach at Christ The King Regional High School Bob Oliva was accused of two cases of child sexual abuse.

Satmar Hasidic and Haredi communities Brooklyn is home to the largest Haredi community outside Israel, and Haredim make up about a quarter million of New York City's population, and most of them live in Brooklyn. According to scholars, the rate of sex abuse within Haredi communities is roughly the same as anywhere else. In many abuse cases, though, victims have not come forward with accusations because of stigmatization from the community, and when they did come forward, the matter generally stayed within the community rather than being reported to the police and forming part of crime statistics. Sexual abuse within the community is often not reported to police. Rather than reporting to police, Haredim may take a case of sexual abuse to the shomrim, a local Jewish street patrol. The shomrim keep the names of suspected child molesters on file, but do not share them with law enforcement or take other measures to end abuse, and sometimes also try to discourage people from taking a case to the police. Many feel that to report a Jew to non-Jewish authorities constitutes the religious crime of mesirah. Samuel Heilman, a professor of Jewish studies at Queens College, says that telling outside police would betray the Jewish community. Agudath Israel of America, an ultra-Orthodox organization, has stated that observant Jews should not report allegations to law enforcement without first consulting with a rabbi. However, other rabbis, including a Chabad-Lubavitch rabbinic court in Crown Heights and Yosef Blau, disagree and encourage reporting abusers to police, stating that the ban on mesirah does not apply.

The village is situated approximately 20 miles (30 km) east from Stoke-on-Trent and 20 miles (30 km) northwest from Derby. History =Toponymy= The name Wootton is thought to come from the Old English wudu meaning wood and tūn meaning an enclosure; farmstead; village or estate. This translates to Wood Farm/Settlement. =In Victorian times= In 1870-72 John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer described Wootton as =Industry= In early reports Wootton was predominately a farming village, with over 60% of males engaged in agriculture. Even to this day there remains a large farming culture, with still around 25% of the working population engaged in agriculture. The rest of the population are spread out between working in service industries or in managerial/professional occupations. Notable Establishments * Wootton Hall, the house where Rousseau stayed, was demolished in the 1930s. *Wootton Lodge - The privately owned 17th century house is a grade I listed building in the parish. During the English Civil War the house was held for the Crown and was badly damaged during a Parliamentary siege. It was restored in about 1700 when a flight of balustraded entrance steps was added. *Alton Towers - Popular holiday theme park Alton Towers is located 4 miles (6.5 km) away from Wootton. The park attracts 2.7 million visitors from all over the globe annually. The resort encloses an area known as \\"Slain Hollow\\", reputed to be the site of a battle between King Ceolred of Mercia and King Ina of Wessex in 716 AD. In poetry A rich poetic description of the area around Wootton is The vales of Wever, a loco-descriptive poem (1797) by John Gisborne, written as a present to his host after staying at Wootton Hall. It shows the influence of Erasmus Darwin, who also wrote similar topographic poetry on the district, and it was admired by many poets including Wordsworth. Transport Wootton is located about 1.5 miles off the B5032 Uttoxeter to Ashbourne road, and is served by the 409 bus service between those two towns, which stops at Ellastone village.

He threw a New Year's Eve party welcoming in 2012 with over 60 featured artists showing their artwork.  Bio  Horner has created a vast universe of personal symbols and archetypes that find their way to the surface of his paintings. Always beginning with free-form ideas, he visualizes elements (influenced by everything from conceptual art, skate culture, illustration, and family history) and puts them to canvas in a gesture reminiscent of surrealist automatic drawings. For his‘sectional’ pieces, he creates large painted studies that are then graphed out in alphanumeric order and ‘cut’ top to bottom, left to right on a grid. He works to ensure they do not resemble the original piece, that he opens himself to randomness, chance, the subconscious, where new layers of meaning emerge. Transforming one panel at a time, individual sections become both contained compositions and elements of a larger one. Once complete, he titles the piece based on thematic threads, or patterns, that have revealed themselves in the process. This interplay between structure and flow state, of finding resolution in shape, form, and thought, are a hallmark of Horner’s practice and body of work.

Literary career Like all Georgian children, Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili – who would later call himself Stalin – grew up with the national epic, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. As a child, Jughashvili knew the poem by heart and passionately read the other popular poems of the time, notably those by Raphael Eristavi, Akaki Tsereteli and – once he learned Russian – Nikolay Nekrasov. At the Orthodox Seminary of Tiflis, where he was enrolled beginning in 1894, Jughashvili read Goethe and Shakespeare in translation, and could recite Walt Whitman. He also started writing Romantic poetry in Georgian. In 1895, at the age of 17, Jughashvili's work impressed the noted poet Ilia Chavchavadze, who published five of them in his journal, Iveria, attributed to the pseudonym Soselo. One of these poems, \\"Morning\\" (dedicated to Prince Raphael Eristavi), begins: :\\"The pinkish bud has opened, Rushing to the pale-blue violet And, stirred by a light breeze, The lily of the valley has bent over the grass.\\" Once Jughashvili entered revolutionary politics, and became Stalin, he stopped writing poetry – it took too much time, he told a friend – but in 1907 he still used his prestige as Soselo to obtain information from an admirer needed for a bank robbery. During the Great Purge, he edited a Russian translation of the Knight in the Panther's Skin (by a Georgian intellectual he released from prison for the purpose) and competently translated some of the couplets himself. Stalin published all of his work anonymously and never publicly acknowledged it. When Lavrentiy Beria secretly had Boris Pasternak and other noted translators prepare a Russian edition of Stalin's poems for the ruler's 70th birthday in 1949, Stalin had the project stopped. Reception In his biography of Stalin, Simon Sebag Montefiore notes that the poems in Iveria \\"were widely read and much admired. They became minor Georgian classics, to be published in anthologies and memorised by schoolchildren until the 1970s (and not as part of Stalin's cult; they were usually published as 'Anonymous').\\" Montefiore adds that \\"their romantic imagery was derivative but their beauty lay in the delicacy and purity of rhyme and language\\". Robert J. Service, another Stalin biographer, describes the poems as \\"fairly standard for early 19th-century Romantic poetry\\", and as \\"very conventional, ... very standardized and rather self-indulgent\\". Stalin's poems have been translated into English by Donald Rayfield.

Its first program, The Company Program, was offered to high school students on an after-school basis. In 1975, the organization entered the classroom with the introduction of Project Business for the middle grades. Since then, Junior Achievement has gradually expanded its activities and broadened its scope to encompass an ever-widening student population. Junior Achievement of South Florida Junior Achievement of South Florida was founded locally in 1959 by the Fort Lauderdale Rotary Club and served just 373 high school students during its first year. Programs now span grades K-12, with age appropriate curricula designed to teach elementary students about their roles as individuals, workers, and consumers and to prepare middle grade and high school students for key economic and workforce issues they will face. Junior Achievement programs reached 44,000 Broward and South Palm Beach County students during the 2009-2010 school year. Programs Junior Achievement of South Florida offers age-appropriate curricula to ensure that students understand their roles as future members of the business community. The programs are divided into three categories: elementary, middle school and high school. =Elementary= The elementary school programs include six sequential themes for kindergarten through fifth- grade students and one capstone experience. Students learn the basic concepts of business and economics and how education is relevant to the workplace. The activities build on studies from each preceding grade and prepare students for secondary school and continued learning. Fifth graders can have the opportunity to work at JA BizTown, a facility on the Broward College campus. =Middle school= The middle school programs emphasize the value of workforce readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy.Tyko, Kelly. \\"Treasure Coast educators get look at Junior Achievement center\\" Students are also introduced to many economic concepts and facts about the working world. The programs in this level expand upon the concepts that were learned in elementary school and help teens make good decisions about their futures. Junior Achievement's lessons are meant to supplement standard social studies curricula and develop communication skills. 8th graders have the opportunity to work beyond JA BizTown to JA Finance Park, also on the Broward College campus. =High school= The high school programs teach students about concepts relating to entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and work readiness. Students are encouraged to make informed decisions about their future, and foster skills that will be useful in the business world. Volunteers aid in these goals by bringing real-life business experience into the classroom, which reinforce the lessons that are taught. JA World Huizenga Center at Broward College Since its inception, Junior Achievement has been committed to \\"experiential learning.\\" Taking it to the next level, Junior Achievement of South Florida created the JA World Huizenga center at Broward College that houses two new programs: JA BizTown and JA Finance Park. This dramatic shift forward will significantly transform how every local student is taught to view the world of work, free enterprise and their possibilities for success in it. Through the experiential learning derived from both BizTown and Finance Park, students achieve advanced levels of engagement, reflection, and personal responsibility. =JA BizTown= JA BizTown is a miniature city that allows fifth-graders the opportunity to assume roles as proprietors, civic leaders, and consumers. It greatly increases students’ knowledge of the free enterprise system as they learn how to fulfill the goals of satisfying customers, paying- off business loans, and realizing a profit at the conclusion of the business day. =JA Finance Park= JA Finance Park expands upon the lessons learned in JA BizTown by giving students an identity to manage that includes marital status, number of children, annual income, education attained, and job type. Students take these characteristics into consideration as they prepare budgets that take into consideration housing, food, furniture, insurance, education, automobiles, investments, and more. Providing a real life experience of managing an income and learning to live within your means offers a strong and important lesson on the value of staying in school to maximize earning potential.

Written in first-person, on behalf of a writer Sergei Maksudov, the novel tells of the drama behind-the-scenes of a theatre production and the writers' world. Bulgakov began work in earnest on the novel on 26 November 1936. In 1929, he had begun a novel, written in the form of letters, called For Secret Friend (also unfinished), addressed to his future wife Helen Bulgakova, which explains how he \\"became a playwright\\". In 1930, For Secret Friend began to develop into a new novel, The Theatre, but in the same year he burned his initial sketches, along with rough drafts of The Novel About the Devil. Six years later and several weeks after the final break with Moscow Art Theatre, Bulgakov began writing a novel about the theatre. On the first page of the manuscript, he outlined two titles: A Dead Man's Memoir and Theatrical Novel. The book satirizes Konstantin Stanislavski through the character Ivan Vasilievich, whose methods hinder actors' performances, reflecting Bulgakov's frustration with Stanislavski whilst attempting to stage A Cabal of Hypocrites in 1930–1936.

G. Viswambharan. Based on Vadakkanpattu, the folklore of North Malabar, which are ballads extolling the brave and valiant chekavars, it stars Kunchacko Boban, Vani Viswanath, Devan, Siddique and Captain Raju in major roles. Jagadeesh, Mala Aravindan, Jayakrishnan, Anoop, Sreehari, Manya, Manka Mahesh, Spadikam George and Mamukkoya form the supporting cast. This is the last film of P. G. Viswambharan. The film's music is scored by veteran composer Usha Khanna with lyrics by poet Yusuf Ali Kechery. Even though the film had some of the best technicians of India in its crew, such as composer Johnson, cinematographer Ramachandra Babu, editor Sreekar Prasad and art director Gangan Thalavil, the film proved to be a critical and commercial failure. The film's production commenced in December 2000 and occurred mainly at Cheloormana in Chittur, Palakkad. Captain Raju, Kundara Johny, and Bheeman Raghu also starred in the 1989 Malayalam blockbuster Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, depicting the story from Chanthu's side. Plot The film tells the story Unniyarcha, the valiant heroine of the Vadakkanpattu (Ballads of North Malabar or Songs of the North), though a member of the fairer sex, she masters martial arts and proves herself as an equal to her brother Aromal Chekavar and cousin Chanthu Chekavar, both renowned warriors. Unniyarcha is portrayed as the embodiment of all virtues. The film also narrates how jealousy takes its roots in the mind of Chanthu, and how he grows hostile to Aromal, consequently betraying him during a duel. Chanthu always attracted to Unniyarcha who always hated him for his cheating behavior. Unniyarcha marries Kunjiraman in spite of Chanthu's objection. Chanthu leaves Puthuram Tharavadu and goes to Tulunadu. Now Aromal has to fight with Aringodar who is an experienced fighter . Aromal's father, Kannappan Chekavar calls back Chanthu as second for Aromal for the fight even though it was objectied by Aromal and Unniyarcha. Aringodar encourage Chanthu to make a defective sword for Aromal. During the fight between Aromal and Aringodar, the sword of Aromal brakes into two pieces. Aromal requests Chanthu to give his sword but Chanthu lie that he has not taken one. Then Aromal throws the broken sword piece at Aringodar which cuts his head off. Now at Puthuram Tharavadu, everyone sees a fatally wounded Aromal come out of the palanquin and tells that Chanthu had cheated by stabbing him while sleeping. Unniyarcha then pledges to take revenge for this betrayal; and till then, she never tie her hair. Now Unniyarcha trains his son Aromalunni who grow to become a brave warrior along with Aromal's son Kanappanunni. Now both the cousins are sent for a kalari. Here the local boys try to attack Aromalunni due to jealousy of his rich status. Aromalunni and Kanappanunni defeat everyone but the elders ask them to show their skill by defeating Chanthu. Now Aromalunni asks his mother to reveal the killer of his uncle. Unniyarcha reveal everything. Kannappan Chekavar first refuses Aromalunni and Kanapanunni to go for revenge fearing Chanthu is skilled in the eighteen techniques of kalari. He teaches them the 19th secret technique. Chanthu finally get ready to fight with the sons of Puthuram Tharavadu. Finally after long fight, Aromalunni tells the 19th secret technique of the kalari he going to fight. He lifts a dust cloud around Chanthu's head finally chopping off the head of Chanthu. Aromalunni and Kanappanunni returns with the head of Chanthu on a platter and hands over to Unniyarcha.

In the 20th century, magazines such as Nueva Dimensión and Narraciones Terroríficas (the Spanish-language version of Weird Tales) popularized science fiction among Spanish speakers worldwide.  History  El hotel eléctrico (1905), directed, written and special effects by Segundo de Chomón, can be considered the first Spanish science fiction film, even though the film was made for Pathé. Spanish science fiction starts mid 19th century; depending on how it is defined, Lunigrafía (1855) from M. Krotse or Una temporada en el más bello de los planetas from Tirso Aguimana de Veca — a trip to Saturn published in 1870-1871, but written in the 1840s — is the first science fiction novel. As such, science fiction was very popular in the second half of the 19th century, but mainly produced alternate history and post- apocalyptic futures, written by some of the most important authors of the generations of '98 and '14. The influence of Verne also produced some singular works, like Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau's El anacronópete (1887), a story about time travel that predates the publication of The Chronic Argonauts by H. G. Wells; Rafael Zamora y Pérez de Urría's Crímenes literarios (1906), that describes robots and a \\"brain machine\\" very similar to our modern laptops; or Frederich Pujulà i Vallès' Homes artificials (1912), the first Science Fiction book in Catalan, and the first in Spain about \\"artificial people\\". But the most prolific were Coronel Ignotus, and Coronel Sirius, who published their adventures in the magazine Biblioteca Novelesco-Científica. The 19th century up to the Spanish Civil War saw no less than four fictional trips to the Moon, one to Venus, five to Mars, one to Jupiter, and one to Saturn. The Spanish Civil War devastated this rich literary landscape. With few exceptions, only the arrival of pulp science fiction in the 1950s would reintroduce the genre in Spanish literature. The space opera series La Saga de los Aznar (1953-1958 and 1973-1978) by Pascual Enguídanos won the Hugo Award in 1978. Also in the 1950s started the radio serial for children Diego Valor; inspired by Dan Dare, the serial produced 1200 episodes of 15 min., and spun a comic (1954-1964), three theater plays (1956-1959) and the first Spanish Science Fiction TV series (1958), that has been lost. Modern, prospective, self-aware science fiction crystallized in the 1970s around the magazine Nueva Dimensión (1968-1983), and its editor Domingo Santos, one of the most important Spanish Science Fiction authors of the time. Other important authors of the 70s and 80s are Manuel de Pedrolo (Mecanoscrit del segon origen, 1974), Carlos Saiz Cidoncha (La caída del Imperio galáctico, 1978), Rafael Marín (Lágrimas de luz, 1984), and Juan Miguel Aguilera (the Akasa-Puspa saga, 1988-2005). In the 1990s the genre exploded with the creation many small dedicated fanzines, important Science Fiction prizes, and the convention HispaCon; Elia Barceló (El mundo de Yarek, 1992), became the most prolific, and possibly the best Science Fiction author from Spain. Other recent authors are Eduardo Vaquerizo (Danza de tinieblas, 2005), Félix J. Palma (The Victorian trilogy, 2008-2014), and Carlos Sisí (Panteón, 2013). Spain has been continuously producing Science Fiction films since the 1960s, at a rate of 5 to 10 per decade. The 1970s was specially prolific; the director, and screenwriter Juan Piquer Simón is the most important figure of fantaterror, producing some low budget Science Fiction films. La cabina (1972) is the most awarded Spanish TV production in history. In the 90s Acción mutante (1992), by Álex de la Iglesia, and Abre los ojos (1997), by Alejandro Amenábar, represent a watershed in Spanish Science Fiction filming, with a quality that would only be reached again by Los cronocrímenes (2007), by Nacho Vigalondo. The most important Science Fiction TV series produced in Spain is El ministerio del tiempo (2015-), even though Mañana puede ser verdad (1964-1964) by Chicho Ibáñez Serrador, and Plutón BRB Nero (2008-2009), should also be mentioned.

With a high-profile career spanning forty years, he's one of the most recognizable media personalities in the countries of former Yugoslavia. From 2011 to 2016 Milić was the Al Jazeera Balkans news and program director. Early life and education Born in Zagreb, PR Croatia, FPR Yugoslavia to Croat parents (father Marko Milić from Slano and mother Marija Smodlaka from Dubrovnik),Volim kad kažu da sam blefer ;Globus, 2009 young Goran spent a couple of months in Prague at the age of six, joining his father who was part of the Yugoslav diplomatic staff in Czechoslovakia. In 1954, his father got reassigned to an observer post in the Council of Europe so the family moved to Strasbourg where young Goran attended primary school, grades two through six.Goran Milić – 37 godina televizijske karijere svjetskog putnika;Nacional, 18 December 2007 In 1959, his father got a job at the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which for 13-year-old Milić meant relocation to Yugoslav capital Belgrade where he soon commenced his gymnasium studies. Before graduating gymnasium, however, he was on the move again, this time to Montevideo, Uruguay as his father got named to the post of Yugoslavia's ambassador in the South American country. Milić returned to Belgrade to graduate gymnasium, and then went back to Uruguay before returning to Belgrade once more to enroll at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law. In 1968, Milić served the mandatory Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) stint in Titograd and went to live in London for a year. Journalism career =Radio-Television Belgrade= In 1970, twenty-four-year-old Milić began his journalism career at Radio-Television Belgrade (RTB). Initially, the youngster learned the ropes under seasoned journalists Ranko Lozo, Nebojša Popović, and Velimir Popović.Čovek svih televizija;Vreme, 27 January 2011 Milić also cites Momčilo Popović as an influence, specifically his style of summarizing news items in a catchy headline before expanding upon the topic.Moj dnevnik gleda dva miliona ljudi;Glas javnosti, 6 March 2005 Foreign reporter RTB eventually assigned Milić to cover foreign politics where his knowledge of languages came in handy. His first foreign assignment was reporting from the Arab League summit in Algiers in late November 1973. A year later, he reported from the scene in Cyprus in July 1974 during the Turkish invasion where he went after interviewing Greek foreign minister Georgios Mavros. Milić soon advanced to the position of editor in the foreign affairs department and was among the Yugoslav press pack following president Tito on his foreign trips to Panama, Venezuela, Mexico, Berlin, as well as the United States in 1978. Correspondent from New York City In late 1979 Milić was named RTB's correspondent from New York City, moving there in April 1980 with his wife Olivera. Only a month after Milić's arrival to the United States, Yugoslav president Tito died. During the mourning period back home, Milić managed to interview the U.S. president Jimmy Carter. Milić later revealed the diplomatic maneuvering behind the interview: Milić returned from New York in 1985. Coming back home to Yugoslavia, simultaneously with work at RTB, he began teaching at the University of Belgrade's Department of Journalism as lecturer, a job he performed until 1988. Dnevnik 2 news anchor Right after returning from New York, Milić began hosting Saturday's Dnevnik 2, RTB's 7:30pm central daily newscast, which made him a well-known television personality all over SR Serbia and SFR Yugoslavia. He simultaneously received promotion to an executive position, getting appointed as RTB news division's deputy editor-in- chief. At Dnevnik 2, in addition to delivering the news, his Saturday newscasts also bore somewhat of a personal imprint with several thematic segments including one where he got to interview general interest guests. One of the most enduring moments of his time hosting Dnevnik was a live link into a 1987 Bijelo Dugme concert at Belgrade's Sajam, allowing the band to perform their \\"Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo\\" song live for the large television audience. In 1989, he covered the Kosovo miners' strike. =Side PR jobs= Throughout Milić's time anchoring RTB's Dnevnik 2, his popularity and prominence got him various one-off high profile side jobs in public relations. In fall 1985, upon returning from America, he got appointed to the executive committee of the city of Belgrade's bid to host the 1992 Summer Olympics. His work at the committee from late 1985 and throughout 1986 mostly entailed dealing with the bid's media presentation and publicity in foreign press and electronic media. In October 1986, at the IOC vote, Barcelona won ahead of Paris and Brisbane, with Belgrade coming in fourth out of the six bids. In 1987, communist politician Josip Vrhovec appointed Milić the president of the information commission for the Universiade in Zagreb. In September 1989 Milić became spokesman for the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Belgrade. In July 1990, Milić reportedly received a personal offer from Franjo Tuđman, the president of SR Croatia, to transfer to Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT). At the hour-long meeting Tuđman wanted Milić to run HRT's news division, a network that was undergoing major organizational and conceptual changes including a name change from Radiotelevizija Zagreb (RTZ), but Milić turned down the offer. =Yutel= In October 1990 Milić became host and editor-in-chief of the newly established Yutel, Sarajevo-based daily newscast founded and financed by the Federal Executive Council (SIV) under the presidency of Ante Marković. Milić hosted the very first Yutel newscast on Tuesday, 23 October 1990 at 10pm, opening with \\"Good evening, Yugoslavia\\", which would soon become something of a signature for him. Alongside Milić, other journalists producing the hour-long Yutel daily newscasts were Gordana Suša, Dževad Sabljaković, Velibor Čović, and Zekerijah Smajić. In July 1991, along with other Yutel personalities, Milić emceed the Yutel for Peace concert. =Working for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina government at the start of Bosnian War= After the May 1992 dissolution of Yutel that took place a few weeks following the start of the Bosnian War, Milić remained in Sarajevo, getting employed by the government of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the warring sides in the conflict. In addition to filing news reports for the government-run television BHTV, he also ran the international press center under the government auspices. In July 1992, he was the head of the Bosnia and Herzegovina delegation at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The engagement provided him with an opportunity of getting out of war-ravaged Sarajevo and once the Olympics ended, he never returned to the besieged city, opting to go live in Zagreb instead. =1992–1997= Arriving to the newly independent Croatia, despite a wealth of experience and a famous name in journalism, Milić was conspicuously absent from the most prominent Croatian media outlets during this time and in later interviews admitted to being essentially blacklisted in the country's top outlets due to his previous association with Yutel and pro-Yugoslav political views.Jedan an jedan;ATV, February 2011 As a result Milić worked a series of lower profile jobs such as local TV productions in Umag as well as an 18-month columnist stint in Slovenian newsmagazine Mladina followed by writing for Marinko Božić's controversial right wing weekly newspaper Slobodni tjednik. Milić later revealed that during this time he turned down an offer from Soros Foundation due to \\"being well aware of what they're all about\\". In early 1993 Milić wrote an accusatory open letter directed at Serbian journalists, his former colleagues, and Serbian society as a whole. In the letter Milić talked of his \\"illusions about the Belgrade democrats all of whom had the Greater Serbia idea in their heads\\" and dismissed the country's movement opposing Slobodan Milošević as \\"nothing but cackling and lighting candles\\". Serbian media largely ignored the open letter, except for newsmagazine Vreme that published it in full along with a rebuke by their journalist Stojan Cerović who took issue with a number of views Milić expressed in the letter. In 1996 Milić was involved in consulting capacity in the OHR's and EU's creation of Televizija OBN in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Milić's unofficial ban in Croatia reportedly began to thaw in late 1996 when he got invited to a state-organized Christmas dinner, along with some other prominent individuals in Croatia known or perceived to hold unpopular political views such as Igor Mandić, where the Croatian president Franjo Tuđman made a point of being seen and photographed with Milić. Within months, Milić got hired at Croatian Radio Television (HRT), the state-run broadcaster. =Croatian Radiotelevision= In 1997 Milić started at Croatian Radio Television (HRT) as a contractor. In 2002 he got his own show on HRT called Brisani prostor. From 2004 he worked as host and editor of the Sunday edition of Dnevnik, HRT's daily newscast. He has attracted attention for his travelogues from Europe, Russia, North America, Asia, Australia and South America. He is a speaker of multiple languages including English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Russian. He was named Best Journalist in Croatia in 2007. He retired from HRT in early 2011, signing off his last Dnevnik on 23 January 2011. Controversy =Alleged extortion attempt= In September 2003, Milić was accused by Formula One Management CEO Bernie Ecclestone of an extortion attempt: \\"That man, Goran Milić, rang me up several times over the last few months. He told me he wants to help me because things can go very badly for me, badly for me in Croatia, bad for my image. He didn't mention specific amounts, but it was obvious he's talking about money and absolutely obvious that it's extortion\\". In support of his claims Ecclestone showed two letters he received from Milić, dated March and June 2003, respectively.Nacional:Goran Milic ucijenjuje obitelj Eccelstone;index.hr, 9 September 2003 Reportedly, the financial compensation Milić was asking from Eccelstone had to do with HRT journalist Srebrenka Herold-Mijatović who on 20 July 2000 fell down a flight of stairs on Eccelstone's yacht named \\"Petara\\", getting severely injured with a skull fracture. The yacht was docked in Bol on the island of Brač and Herold- Mijatović had reportedly been invited on board due to her husband Vlado Mijatović being friends with Ecclestone's then-wife Slavica Radić. Ecclestone continued: \\"I told Milić if someone wants to sue us they're free to do so. He insisted that would be bad for my image, and that he doesn't want to destroy it. He said that Herold-Mijatović is unable to work and that someone should compensate her\\". Personal In 1977 Milić married Olivera Katanić, a fellow journalist and Radio-Television Belgrade (RTB) colleague. In 1980 when Milić became RTB's foreign correspondent from New York, the couple, along with Olivera's son Igor from her previous marriage, moved to the United States.Чаролија је почела уз тамбураше;Vranjske, 24 November 2011 In 1984 their daughter Lana Marija Milić was born. Katanić, already diagnosed with cancer since 1978, died in 1988. In 1988, at a speaking engagement in Sarajevo, 42-year-old widower Milić met Ana, a Radio Sarajevo contract employee. The two soon began dating, initially long distance as Milić lived in Belgrade where he anchored RTB's Dnevnik. In late 1990, after Milić's new job at Yutel brought him to Sarajevo, the couple started living together, along with Milić's 6-year-old daughter Lana Marija whom he brought over from Belgrade. As the Bosnian War broke out during spring 1992, Ana right away fled to Zagreb with Milić's daughter Lana Marija, while Milić, who initially remained behind in Sarajevo where he began working for Alija Izetbegović's Bosnian government, joined them in Croatia within a few months. Later in 1992, Milić married Ana, and in 1993 they had a son Marko. On 2 June 2015, Milić received a citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina.http://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/goran-milic-dobio-drzavljanstvo- bih/150602091 References * Croatian television journalists Yugoslav journalists University of Belgrade faculty 1946 births Living people People from Zagreb ","title":"Goran Milić"},{"id":"31482088","text":"Golfamania is a golf video game released exclusively for the Sega Master System in Brazil and Europe.

His case was the first prosecution under Title 50 783(b) of the Subversive Activities Control Act. His case also prompted a modification of the Espionage Act of 1917 to allow it to be used outside U.S. territory.  History  Starbeck was a student at City College of New York and New York University He was in the US Army from 1942-1946. Later, he went to work at the State Department, where he won an award for meritorious service. In 1958 he was deployed to the U.S. embassy in Warsaw, Poland, as an office manager. His wife, daughter, and two sons joined him there. He loved taking family trips in the countryside and enjoyed music. He was well liked by his staff. In 1959, aged 39, he became involved in a romantic affair with 22-year-old Urszula Maria Discher. He got her an apartment and often visited her there. In 1960, agents of the Polish Security Service surprised the two in bed and took photographs. The ministry then used the photos to blackmail Scarbeck into giving them secret information from the US government. He later claimed that the secret police had also threatened Ms. Discher with arrest and prosecution. By cooperating with the ministry, he said that he was able to save her from a terrible fate. He managed to enable her escape to West Germany, where he found an apartment for her, and gave her some money to help her. The FBI arrested him on June 13, 1961. In July 1961 a grand jury in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia indicted him on one count of taking a government document under and three counts under . This was the first prosecution ever under 783(b). The law had been created as part of the McCarran Internal Security Act / Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 during the Red Scare of the 1950s by Senator Karl Earl Mundt. Mundt claimed it was a reaction to the Alger Hiss, Elizabeth Bentley, and similar cases. It is one of the few Federal statutes that criminalizes delivering classified information. He was found guilty of the Title 50 counts but not guilty of the Title 18 count. In November 1961 he was sentenced to three consecutive terms of 10 years in prison, the maximum penalty the law allowed. His wife said she would \\"stick by him\\". He tried to appeal his conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court. His lawyers argued that the phrase \\"classified documents\\" did not include documents classified by an Ambassador, only those classified by the President; that Scarbeck should have been able to challenge the classification; that Scarbeck was authorized to disclose the documents; that his confession was coerced and therefore inadmissible, and his confession was not corroborated by other facts. The Supreme Court denied to hear the case in June 1963. However the consecutive sentences were made concurrent and Scarbeck was paroled in 1966.  Effect on Espionage Act  Scarbeck's case was cited by Congressman Richard Poff as a reason to amend the Espionage Act of 1917 in 1961. He pointed out that Scarbeck could not be prosecuted under the Act because it originally contained language making it apply only to acts committed inside U.S. territory. Poff's solution was to repeal the restrictive language (Section 791) so that the Espionage Act would apply everywhere. The Senate passed Poff's bill only after a third attempt.  See also  *Gorin v.

In the distance is Greenwich Power Station. Enderby's Wharf is a wharf and industrial site on the south bank of the Thames in Greenwich, London, associated with Telcon and other companies. It has a history of more than 150 years of production of submarine communication cables and associated equipment, and is one of the most important sites in the history of submarine communications. Location The wharf lies on the Greenwich Peninsula, a little to the north of the historic centre of Greenwich. It is between the Thames and the Blackwall Tunnel approach road, across the river from Cubitt Town. It covers an area of some and has a frontage of around . History The wharf was first developed commercially by the whaling company of Samuel Enderby & Sons. The site was first acquired by Samuel Enderby II, with Morden College assisting in the acquisition of the naval ammunition wharf. It was Samuel Enderby III who initially developed the site along with brothers Charles and George, who acquired the site for a ropeworks. Enderbys also built Enderby House in the early 1830s, which stands today as a listed building among modern housing. In 1857 submarine cable manufacturers Glass, Elliot & Co and W.T.Henley took over the site; Henleys subsequently moved to North Woolwich. As well as jointly making the short-lived first transatlantic telegraph cable, Glass, Elliot supplied many early telegraph cables including Corsica–Sardinia, Lowestoft–Zandvoort, Malta–Alexandria and Sicily–Algeria. In the 1860s Glass, Elliot and the Gutta Percha Company were absorbed into the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon), which manufactured a second transatlantic telegraph cable at Enderby's Wharf. This was successfully laid by the SS Great Eastern. The company went on to manufacture many more transatlantic cables, and others to Australia, New Zealand, India, Hong Kong etc. In 1935 the site came into the ownership of the newly formed Submarine Cables Ltd. Some of the cross-channel, D-Day Pluto pipeline was made at the wharf in World War 2. After ownership by BICC and AEI, in 1970 it passed to STC. Manufacture of submarine cable at the site ended in 1975 (transferring to Southampton), and work concentrated on manufacture of optical repeaters and amplifiers. It subsequently passed to Northern Telecom and then to Alcatel of France in 1994. In 2006 Alcatel merged with US company Lucent to create Alcatel-Lucent, and the following year their division based at Enderby Wharf was renamed Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks, which became Alcatel Submarine Networks after Alcatel-Lucent was acquired by Nokia in 2016. Around 2010, a large part of the site was sold to Barratt Developments for a housing estate, called Enderby Wharf. Enderby House, the original office building, is within the Barratt site but stood disused for several years; in 2018 it was due to become a bar and restaurant. Proposed cruise ship terminal In 2010 a proposal was made to turn of the river frontage of the site not in use by Alcatel into a terminal for huge cruise liners, and housing. The proposal (known as 'Enderby Wharf') received planning approval from Greenwich Council in 2011, subject to approval by the Greater London Authority (GLA). Mayor Boris Johnson gave his approval to a revised application for a larger terminal in August 2015.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/Londons-new- cruise-terminal-gets-the-green-light/ It was expected that up to 55 large cruise ships would dock there every year. Each would need to run its diesel engines continuously to power onboard facilities, generating large polluting emissions near residential areas and schools. While London has strict regulations on air quality and emissions, they do not apply to the Thames, which is in the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority (PLA) rather than the GLA. At the London elections in 2016 the Conservative and Labour mayoral candidates joined their Green and Liberal Democrat rivals to support the residents' campaign against the terminal.https://853blog.com/2016/04/11/sadiq- khan-sides-with-enderby-wharf-campaigners-in-clean-air-battle-with-greenwich- council/ In 2018 Greenwich council changed its opinion, and called for Morgan Stanley, current owner of Enderby Wharf, to implement a less polluting solution for the cruise terminal. Residents of the area proposed it should be \\"zero emissions\\", supporting ships able to use onshore electrical power without the need to run their engines while docked. Some cruise ships already support the use of shore power, while others are being adapted to do so. In 2019, Morgan Stanley sold the site to Criterion Capital for further housing development.

An unknown figure in her lifetime, she was forced by her brothers to live in isolation, which estranged her from courts and literary salons. While living in solitude in her castle, she produced a body of work which did not circulate in the literary milieu of the time. Her brothers eventually murdered her for her suspected secret romance. Thirteen poems by her have survived to this day. This work is considered among the most powerful and original poetic expressions of Italian literature from the 16th century,. employing topics and techniques which make her, according to some scholars, a forerunner of Romantic poetry. Biography =Early life= Isabella di Morra was born into a noble family in Favale (now Valsinni, in the province of Matera), at the time part of the Kingdom of Naples. She was the daughter of Giovanni Michele di Morra, baron of Favale, and Luisa Brancaccio, a noblewoman belonging to a Neapolitan family. Her birthdate is uncertain: generally, reference is made to the study by Benedetto Croce which puts it around 1520,. although she could have been born earlier, about 1515 or 1516.. As a child, Isabella was educated in literature and poetry by her father. She, her mother and her siblings (five brothers: Marcantonio, Scipione, Decio, Cesare, Fabio, and one sister: Porzia) were abandoned by Giovanni Michele in 1528, when he was forced to seek refuge in France after having supported the invading French army against the Spanish monarch Charles V for the conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. He could have returned to Favale as his crime against the Spanish crown was pardoned, but he remained in France serving in the army and as a counsellor of Francis I as well as attending court festivities.. The youngest child, Camillo, was born after he left. Scipione followed his father shortly afterwards and the eldest sibling Marcantonio then took over power in Favale.. Isabella grew up in a hostile family environment, with a helpless mother and brothers who were uncouth, unruly and brutish.. She was deeply affected by the sudden departure of her father, which tormented her for the rest of her life. She was given a tutor who guided her in the study of Petrarch and Latin poets, and was probably the only person with whom she could talk about literature.. = Youth = Castle of Isabella di Morra in Favale (now Valsinni) From the beginning, animosity marked the relationship between Isabella and her three younger brothers Cesare, Decio and Fabio, who perhaps envied their gifted sister and the attention lavished on her education. They forced her to live in strict isolation in the family castle of Favale, perched on a steep cliff above the Ionian sea. In the castle Isabella dedicated herself to writing poems, finding in poetry the only solace for her solitude. Nonetheless, she had the opportunity to befriend her learned neighbours: Diego Sandoval de Castro, baron of Bollita (the present-day Nova Siri) and castellan of Cosenza, and his wife Antonia Caracciolo. Of Spanish heritage, Diego, described as a handsome and brave soldier who fought for Charles V's army in the Algiers expedition, was a published poet, member of the Florentine Academy and well connected to the power structure in Naples being a protégé of Viceroy Pedro de Toledo. Perhaps encouraged and helped by her tutor, Isabella and Diego began a secret correspondence, when he began to send her letters in the name of his wife with some poems enclosed, to which Isabella might have answered. Rumours about a hidden liaison began to emerge, although their relationship remains a mystery and it is unclear whether or not they were more than just friends. Except for a brief reference to marriage, the surviving work of Isabella includes no love poem addressed to a man, while Diego's lyrics described his feelings towards his beloved, possibly referring to a specific woman, or simply conventional laments, following the poetic style of the era.. However, Isabella's brothers, after being informed of the letters, suspected an extra- marital affair and, in order to redeem the family honour, prepared a cruel plan of punishment. =Death= The first victim was her tutor, who carried the letters between them. Next they confronted Isabella, and she was found with the letters in her hands according to the reports of the time. She was stabbed to death. Two of the brothers escaped to France but they soon returned with the evident intention of concluding their revenge against Diego who, fearing for his life, hired a bodyguard. The three assassins, with the help of two uncles and probably fuelled by hatred against Spaniards, killed him in the woods near Noja (today known as Noepoli) several months later. The death of Isabella went almost unnoticed and even approved by society according to the code of honour of the 16th century, and Diego Sandoval's murder was hardly investigated. Her year of death is not known with certainty but it was most likely 1545 or 1546, though other studies suggest she died in 1547 or 1548.. It is believed that she was buried in the local church of San Fabiano but no grave and no trace leading to her have been found. While visiting Valsinni, Croce tried to discover Isabella's tomb but renovations in the church had destroyed all traces of the di Morra family burials, and his exploration behind an underground wall revealed only heaps of bones.. = Aftermath = The murderers were forced to flee the Kingdom of Naples to escape the wrath of the Viceroy Pedro de Toledo, who ordered that the whole province be scoured. They joined their father in France, who allegedly died shortly after the tragedy as he was still living and receiving a pension in 1549.. They were judged guilty in absentia. Scipione, although shocked and disgusted by the murders, resigned himself to helping his brothers. Decio became a priest and Cesare married a French noblewoman but there is no certain information about Fabio. Scipione, who was secretary to Queen Catherine de' Medici, was later fatally poisoned by other court members who were envious of him.. Meanwhile, the remaining brothers were taken to trial. Marcantonio, who did not take part in the conspiracy, was imprisoned for some months and then released. The youngest brother, Camillo, who also had nothing to do with the murders, was absolved of complicity. Poetry The poems of Isabella were discovered when the authorities entered her estate to investigate the murder. There are ten sonnets and three poems, which were published posthumously. She has been associated with the 1500s literary movement known as Petrarchism, a revival of Petrarch's model launched by Pietro Bembo. Although her form, vocabulary and phrases follow the Petrarchist fashion of the period, she is distinguished by her gloomy and distressing tone, possibly influenced by medieval poets such as Dante Alighieri (especially the Inferno chapter and Rime Petrose lyrics) and Jacopone da Todi. Her poetry is very personal, influenced by her own family condition and forced isolation; she wrote on impulse in order to vent her frustration, without any literary adornment or formal elegance. Unlike other women's poems, which are principally based on a celebration of idealized love, in Isabella's work there is only space for existential pain, grudge and loneliness, making her a distinctive figure among Petrarchist poets of the time. Marriage is the only way to love, which would not only satisfy her social and feminine position, but would be the only way to escape the oppressive environment she lived in.. Her poetry describes the grief she feels at being isolated, being separated from other literary people, and missing her father, with Nature as the primary interlocutor of her verses. Isabella herself defined her style as \\"bitter, harsh and sorrowful\\" (amaro, aspro e dolente). or \\"unmannered and frail\\" (ruvido e frale).. Fortune is the main antagonist of her work, blamed for depriving her of happiness and freedom. Fortune is her personification of mankind's cruelty towards \\"every good- natured heart\\" (ogni ben nato core),. implicitly condemning a world in which tyranny and violence prevail over virtue.. The Sinni river at sunset She expresses repugnance towards her homeland, described as an \\"infernal valley\\" (valle inferna) and \\"cursed place\\" (denigrato sito), surrounded by \\"lonely and dark woods\\" (selve erme ed oscure), inhabited by \\"irrational people, without intelligence\\" (), and crossed by the \\"turbid Siri\\" (torbido Siri, today known as Sinni) the river running in the valley below her castle, whose continuous murmur as it flowed downstream into the sea increases her sense of isolation and despair. She imagines throwing herself symbolically into her loved and hated river, perhaps alluding to suicide.. This has led to the singular theory that her sister Porzia and Diego Sandoval were corresponding and then became victims of the murderers; accordingly Isabella, affected by the tragedy, threw herself into the river, since there is no clue as to where she might have been buried. She scans the sea waiting for a ship to bring good news about her exiled father (who lived comfortably in France, ignoring her fate), in the vain hope that her condition would improve with his return. Charles V (known as \\"Caesar\\" in the lyrics) is accused of \\"preventing a father from helping his daughter\\" (privar il padre di giovar la figlia) and Francis I is the \\"great king\\" (gran re), to whom all hopes for her own liberation were addressed, but they were shattered as the French monarch was finally defeated by his rival, making Isabella even more depressed. Her mother is portrayed as an old and miserable woman unable to control her children; her brothers are \\"extremely and disgustingly indolent\\" (in estrema ed orrida fiacchezza) blaming Fortune for depriving them of the kindly nature enjoyed by their ancestors. and explaining their uncouth and despotic manners by saying: \\"by those who,through ignorance, do not understand me , I am, alas, reproached\\" (da chi non son per ignoranza intesa i' son, lassa, ripresa).. She also paid tribute to the poet Luigi Alamanni, who took refuge in France after a conspiracy against Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, later Pope Clement VII. She writes about her \\"pitiful end\\" (miserando fine) and \\"now that I feel my bitter end near\\" (or ch’io sento da presso il fine amaro), which leads one to think she was aware of her imminent murder, or perhaps waiting for the natural course of her sad existence. In the last compositions she finds consolation in Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, through whom she seems to have finally accepted her painful existence and tried to find peace of mind, apparently reconciling herself to the land she once despised. Her final hope is to see herself \\"totally freed from the stormy terrestrial cloud, and among the blessed souls\\" (sgombrata tutta dal terrestre nembo, e fra l’alme beate).. Legacy Statue of Isabella di Morra in Valsinni A few years after her death, the verses began to circulate in Naples and were read with pity and admiration, and then sent to Venice, where some of her poetry appeared in Book 3 of Lodovico Dolce's anthology, Rime di diversi illustri signori napoletani e d'altri nobilissimi intelletti (Verses of several esteemed Neapolitan gentlemen and other most noble intellects) in 1552. The entire production was later included in Lodovico Domenichi's Rime diverse d’alcune nobilissime, et virtuosissime donne ( Verses by some most noble and virtuous women) in 1559. In 1629, her nephew Marcantonio, son of Camillo, published a family biography entitled Familiae nobilissimae de Morra historia (History of the most noble di Morra family), giving details regarding her life and death which were unknown until its release. Despite her work being later included in other anthologies, Isabella was almost forgotten and ignored by critics over the centuries. After a long period of silence, which lasted until the beginning of the 20th century, she was rediscovered by Angelo De Gubernatis in 1901, while attending a conference about literature in Bologna. In 1907, De Gubernatis published Isabella Morra. Le rime (Isabella Morra. The Verses), including annotations and an introductory biography of Isabella drawn from her nephew's monograph. But it was Benedetto Croce who released her first historically documented biography and provided a critical essay, re-evaluating her place in Italian literature.. Croce praised her poetry for its \\"passionate immediacy\\" and \\"immersion in emotion\\", very different from the prevailing style of that time, which he considered \\"precious and artificial\\".. According to Paul F. Grendler's Encyclopedia of the Renaissance in association with The Renaissance Society of America, her work is an \\"impressive prefigurement of Romanticism\\" and he states: \\"no other poet prior to Isabella di Morra infused such personal depth into poetry, bringing new drama to the lyric precisely because it so closely addresses the tragic circumstances of her life\\", contributing \\"to the development of a new sensibility in poetic language, one grounded in a kind of life writing that raises the biographical, the political, the familial, and the personal to a genuinely lyric stature\\". She is cited as a precursor to Giacomo Leopardi due to similar themes, feelings and life experiences. Her poetry is also considered a possible influence on Torquato Tasso. as it is eerily echoed in his poem Canzone al Metauro (A Poem for Metauro, 1578). In popular culture Isabella has been portrayed by Anny Duperey in the eponymous drama performed at the Théâtre d'Orsay, Paris, on 23 April 1974. It was written by André Pieyre de Mandiargues and directed by Jean-Louis Barrault. A literary site named after her was established in her hometown of Valsinni in 1993, where theatrical and musical performances take place. The theatrical work Storia di Isabella di Morra raccontata da Benedetto Croce (The story of Isabella di Morra as told by Benedetto Croce) by Dacia Maraini was staged in Valsinni (1999) and Rome (2000).. The Io Isabella International Film Week festival is dedicated to her memory.

Fidelity is often represented as a woman, shown holding a golden seal and a key, but may also be represented by a dog. Fidelity may be shown alone, or may be accompanied by a dog, a symbol of not only faithfulness but also fidelity.Hall, James. Dictionary of Subjects & Symbols in Art. Rev. ed. United States of America: Westview Press, 1979. In the Renaissance, Penelope or Griselda might also stand for fidelity. Fidelity is not in the usual lists of the seven virtues, though it may sometimes be included in such groupings. The plant myrtle (Myrtus) has been associated with fidelity, and hence used in weddings, from Roman times to the present, and wreathed crowns of myrtle may be found in art.  Fidelity in allegory  A dog, when included in an allegorical painting, portrays the attribute of fidelity personified. The deep origins of this can also be recognized in the generic name Fido given to dogs, which originated from the Latin word fidus, meaning \\"trust.\\" The story of the faithful dog of Titus Labienus, that would not quit his master's corpse, recorded in Pliny's Natural History book viii, was briefly recounted in Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (1593, etc.) in the explanation of the emblem of Fedeltà represented as a woman holding a ring and accompanied by a white dog.Ripa, Iconologia  Fidelity in portraiture  When in a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. When the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband. An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's \\"Arnolfini Portrait.\\"  Fidelity and Death  During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity. The crusader lying in full armor on his tomb-chest, with a dog beneath his feet is a familiar trope.

Reading specialists are professionals who aim to improve reading achievement in their district or school by serving as teachers, coaches, or leaders of school reading programs.http://www.reading.org/General/CurrentResearch/Standards/ProfessionalStandards2010/ProfessionalStandards2010_Role5.aspx The reading specialist is authorized to teach reading and to provide technical assistance and professional development to teachers. The reading specialist also supports, supplements and extends classroom teaching, and works collaboratively to implement a quality reading program that is research-based and meets the needs of students.  Individual state standards  Certification generally involves completing literacy-related coursework after one has obtained a bachelor's degree. Each state has different criteria for obtaining reading specialist certification. Some states require general teacher certification, and some require at least one year of teaching experience in a general classroom, before obtaining reading specialist certification. It may be issued as a full certificate or as an endorsement on an existing teaching certificate. Some states require applicants to pass a reading specialist content area examination.http://www.isbe.state.il.us/certification/requirements/toc.htm  International Reading Association standards  The International Reading Association has its own standards for reading specialists, which they also term literacy coaches. They posit that a reading specialist must have valid teaching certification, teaching experience, and a master's degree with concentration in reading and writing education. The International Reading Association also believes that reading specialists should undergo coursework that builds skills and knowledge that would result in ability to take on leadership skills with the school reading program, fostering knowledge among staff and students. In addition, the Association recommends that specialists seeking certification should complete 21–27 hours of language arts, reading, and other related courses at the graduate level. They state that the graduate- level coursework should include a practicum with a supervisor, recommended to be 6 semester hours. The supervised practicum experience should require working with students who struggle with reading, as well as collaborative and coaching experiences with teachers.

It is located in Camp County in the U.S. state of Texas, southeast of Pittsburg at the intersection of Farm to Market Road 2057 and County Road 4247. Center Point is the birthplace of mezzo-soprano Barbara Smith Conrad. In 1979, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 9790 was designated to commemorate the founding of Center Point. Settlement Center Point was settled by freed slaves in 1865 as one of the Freedman's settlements that resulted from the Emancipation Proclamation. The origin of the settlement's name is said to be from Farm to Market Road 2057 crossing County Road 4247. The Center Point Baptist Church was established in 1873. The community supported a brick kiln, sawmill and cotton gin. School A one-room school established in 1887 served thirty-one black children, during each 100-day term. The school, however, was initially not a very good one. Later school bonds improvements brought the educational institution up in 1916 to a four-room building, raising the school quality to one of the best in Camp County by 1936. The first school principals on the 14-acre campus were Mr. and Mrs. L.B. Cash. At its peak, the school accommodated 279 students. Because of declining community population and, thereby, enrollment, the school consolidated with Pittsburg Independent School District in 1955. In 1996, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 9791 was designated to commemorate the school. Cemetery The Texas Historical Commission had noted Center Point Cemetery as CP-C010. Notable people Mezzo-soprano Barbara Smith Conrad was born in Center Point in 1940. Conrad has performed with opera companies around the world. She has sung at the White House, and performed for Pope John Paul II during his 1995 New York City visit. She credits the Baptist church in Center Point as the origins of her love of music.

Ivașcu;\\"Partea I B: Dispozițiuni și publicațiuni care nu au caracter normativ: Deciziuni. Ministerul Informațiilor\\", in Monitorul Oficial, Nr. 112/1947, p.3980 July 22, 1911 - June 21, 1988) was a Romanian journalist, literary critic, and communist militant. From beginnings as a University of Iași philologist and librarian, he was drawn into left-wing antifascist politics, while earning accolades as a newspaper editor and foreign-affairs journalist. Openly confronting the Iron Guard and fascism in general, he was persecuted and went into hiding during the first two years of World War II. He reemerged as a pseudonymous correspondent, then editorial secretary, of the magazine Vremea, slowly turning it away from fascism. In parallel, he also contributed to the clandestine left-wing press, preparing for an Allied victory. After a brief career in the communist regime's bureaucracy, Ivașcu found himself exposed to accusations of perfidy. Due in large part to a case of mistaken identity, he was prosecuted for fascism and war crimes, and spent almost five years in confinement. Released and rehabilitated by the same regime, his alleged compromises with both fascism and communism have been at the center of controversies ever since. In his later years, Ivașcu profited from liberalization and, as editor of Contemporanul, Lumea, and România Literară, allowed nonconformist talents to express themselves with confidence, while he himself oscillated between national communism and Western Marxism. His tolerance of dissent irritated the regime, and Ivașcu was pushed back into accepting and even promoting communist censorship during the final two decades of his life. Biography =Early life= Born in Cerțești, Galați County, \\"George Ivașcu\\" at the V. A. Urechia Galați County Library siteButnaru, p.253, 255 he enlisted at the Gheorghe Roșca Codreanu High School in Bârlad. In March 1929, as a terminal year student, he published his first literary contribution: a poem titled \\"Reveries\\", in the Lugoj student magazine Primăvara Banatului.Tudor Opriș, Istoria debutului literar al scriitorilor români în timpul școlii (1820-2000), Aramis Print, Bucharest, 2002, p.92. Upon completing his secondary studies, Ivașcu moved to Iași, entered the local university, and graduated from its Letters and Philosophy Faculty in 1933.Butnaru, p.253 A librarian at his Iași faculty in 1932, he became a teaching assistant there upon graduation and until 1936, owing his appointment to professor Iorgu Iordan (and replacing Gheorghe Ivănescu, who was studying abroad). Pavel Țugui, \\"George Ivașcu, cronicar de război, la ziarul Vremea (1941-1944). I\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 17/2013 From 1935 until 1937, he was also secretary of the Institute of Romanian Philology and of its publication, which hosted Ivașcu's essays on Alf Lombard and Ion Creangă.M. C., \\"La aniversare. Profesorul Gavril Istrate la 90 de ani\\", in Buletinul Institutului de Filologie Română A. Philippide, Nr. 1/2004, p.10-12 Influenced by the left-leaning views of his Iași professors, Ivașcu was, in 1934, founder and editor of the political review Manifest. Constantin Coroiu, \\"Un creator de mari publicații\\", in Cultura, Nr. 30, July 2006Butnaru, p.255; Iorga, p.2; Netea, p.133, 169 A group of young literary aficionados and militants grew around the magazine, including, among others, Emil CondurachiIorga, p.2-3 and Ștefan Baciu.Raluca Nicoleta Spiridon, Mihaela Toader, \\"Sub lupa Securității. Ștefan Baciu – un destin al exilului românesc (1918-1993)\\", in Caietele CNSAS, Nr. 2/2010, p.162 Its advocacy of literary modernism and its alleged \\"socialist-communist\\" tinges were censured at the time by Nicolae Iorga, the traditionalist doctrinaire and culture critic. Iorga nevertheless noted that, unlike Condurachi and the others, Ivașcu wrote \\"with sense\\". At Manifest, Ivașcu spoke out against the Iron Guard, a homegrown fascist movement—but, according to Iorga, did so in a \\"disjointed\\" manner.Iorga, p.2 Much later in life, Ivașcu told his friends that the murder of Premier Ion G. Duca by a Guardist death squad had greatly shocked him. He was involved in several street battles and, in 1936, when he helped Iordan break through an Iron Guard barrage, received a rather deep cut on his cheek from shattered glass. He was also dragged in academic confrontations between the left and the right: the latter denied his application for Iorga's Romanian School in Fontenay-aux- Roses. Under these circumstances, Ivașcu moved into far-left politics. A member of the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), which had been outlawed by the Kingdom of Romania (according to his own testimony, he joined in 1935), Andrei Udișteanu, Alexandra Olivotto, \\"Cum să te lepezi de copil în fața 'conducătorului iubit'\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, 13 April 2011 he agitated in favor of prosecuted communists such as Petre Constantinescu and Teodor Bugnariu, befriending the far-left intellectual Stephan Roll. Party theorist Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu was allegedly the behind-the-scenes figure at Manifest.Doris Mironescu, Andrei Corbea-Hoișie, \\"Dialog-ul prin vremuri\\", in Aurelia Stoica (ed.), Literatură, arte, idei în Alma Mater/Dialog, 1969-1990, Editura Universității Al. I. Cuza, Iași, 2005, p.33. Like these figures, Ivașcu found himself placed under constant surveillance by Siguranța policemen.Boia, p.87-88, 145, 215 As he himself would later claim, he was troubled by his choices, and equally alarmed by the Great Purge that was occurring in the Soviet Union. He attributed its \\"monstrous crimes\\" to the overzealous prosecutors. =Iașul and Jurnalul Literar= In March 1938, some days after King Carol II proclaimed his authoritarian National Renaissance Front (FRN) regime, Ivașcu, Alexandru Piru and Eusebiu Camilar founded a daily, Iașul. Advertising itself as an \\"exact and precise\\" newspaper, it had a cultural program promoting \\"civic education\\" and Moldavian regionalism, and was formally managed by the violinist Mircea Bârsan.T. Petrescu, p.191, 194 Ivașcu was the real caretaker, fixating the editorial line on the promotion of modernism. He also composed the literary supplement and theatrical column, and answered the letters to the editor.T. Petrescu, p.194-195 Beyond its conformist facade, which was well-appreciated by FRN officials, Iașul functioned as an antifascist mouthpiece, involved in open polemics with the far-right press.T. Petrescu, p.191-194 Ivașcu played a prominent part in the latter disputes, with articles he signed as Radu Vardaru.T. Petrescu, p.193-194 The subsequent period marked the start of Ivașcu's close friendship with the senior literary critic George Călinescu, whose activities were carefully recorded by Iașul. Ivașcu was especially enthusiastic about Călinescu's plan to transform Iași into a Romanian cultural capital: this, he noted, was \\"the very reason why our paper exists.\\"T. Petrescu, p.192 Upon Ivănescu's return to Iași, Ivașcu lost his university position, and taught Romanian Literature at a high school in Iași. In January 1939, he became editorial secretary at Călinescu's Jurnalul Literar. Ivașcu greatly admired Călinescu's antifascism and rationalism; however, the Siguranța reported of his debates with Călinescu, with the latter refusing to allow more communists at Jurnalul Literar. According to such sources, Călinescu feared that a left- turn would expose the magazine to attacks from the far-right.Boia, p.145 Still, Călinescu paid homage to Ivașcu as an \\"excellent\\" journalist and man of letters, with \\"a great devotion to a certain idea.\\" Reviewing the letters to the editor, Ivașcu discovered and edited for publishing the work of a literary hopeful, the 17-year-old poet Ștefan Augustin Doinaș (alongside whom he would work later in life).Neagoe, p.32, 33 In August 1939, just before the start of World War II (in which Romania was still neutral territory), Piru took over Ivașcu's office at Jurnalul Literar. Marin Iancu, \\"Al. Piru și Jurnalul Literar\\", in Cultura, Nr. 444, November 2013 Ivașcu was still a contributor, and, in the magazine's final issues, took over Călinescu's own foreign policy column, \\"The War in Weekly Recapitulations\\". It was manifestly apolitical. Nicolae Mecu, \\"Contradicția lui Călinescu\\", in Cultura, Nr. 215, March 2009 A year later, Romania found herself trapped between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. By the end of 1940, she had ceded Bessarabia to the Soviet Union and relinquished Northern Transylvania to pro-Nazi Hungary. Following the bankruptcy of Jurnalul Literar, Călinescu became a regular presence in Iașul. Also in Iașul, Ivașcu wrote a foreign policy column, Situația (\\"The Situation\\"), sharply critical of the king, deploring the country's rapprochement with Nazi Germany, and praising the Western Allies. In July 1940, he found himself arrested, under official inquiry. =In hiding= Ivașcu's mugshot, taken in or around 1940 Although described in Siguranța reports as \\"one of the principal communists in Moldavia region\\",Boia, p.215 Ivașcu was released on parole following the intervention of Călinescu, Iordan, Mihai Ralea and Petre Andrei. In September 1940, the National Renaissance Front crumbled and the Iron Guard came to power, establishing its own \\"National Legionary State\\"—in fact an unbalanced partnership with an authoritarian Premier, Ion Antonescu. The regime immediately stripped Ivașcu of his teaching post. Following arrangements made by his in-laws, Ivașcu relocated to Bucharest, the national capital. Reportedly, he was in contact with the PCdR and its Social Democratic Party allies, who provided for Ivașcu with means to join the antifascist underground. This clandestine interval ended in November, when he was arrested by the National Legionary authorities, and interrogated for at least a month. Upon his release, protected and housed by his brother-in-law, Colonel Zlotescu, Ivașcu requested to be integrated as a civil servant in the Propaganda Ministry. However, in his letters to Călinescu, he confessed that could not bear himself to write for any \\"[politically] colored newspapers\\". By January 19, 1941, Ivașcu had reached an agreement with the editors of Vremea, the former Iron Guard newspaper, becoming its pseudonymous foreign-affairs analyst (a parallel application at Timpul, the official newspaper, having been rejected); he was paid by the article. Ion Cristoiu, \\"Securitatea, un bun istoric literar\\" , in Jurnalul Național, September 2, 2005 He took the decision only after assuring himself that \\"not everybody there [at Vremea] is green from head to toe\\" (a reference to the Guard's green flag and uniforms). The historian Vasile Netea, who was one of Vremeas editors, conceded that Ivașcu showed superlative skills and, displaying a \\"great love\\" for his job, ensured that the magazine was both \\"substantial and varied\\".Netea, p.133 Using the signatures Paul Ștefan, Radu Costin, and Dan Petrea, his work originally consisted of translating articles from the foreign press, drawing maps in ink, and contributing his own pieces. These referred to such topics as the Italian Imperial consolidation, Australian participation, or the evolution of the Norwegian Campaign, and were seasoned with encoded antifascist references. He used all kinds of sources, including Radio Londres and Radio Moscow. Pavel Țugui, \\"George Ivașcu, cronicar de război, la ziarul Vremea (1941-1944). II\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 18/2013 With time, he became a cultural page editor, writing reviews of works by Alexandru A. Philippide and Mihai Moșandrei, and gazetteer entries for Ethiopian Christianity. His social standing improved unexpectedly with the Iron Guard's downfall of January 21, which left Antonescu as the sole leader in national politics. Ivașcu was reintegrated in education, teaching at Gheorghe Lazăr High School and at Spiru Haret High School. =Anti-Soviet war= After the attack on the Soviet Union, which sealed Antonescu's alliance with Nazi Germany, Ivașcu was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, but, being aged 30, was ordered to continue his work at Vremea in lieu of active service. According to one account, during this short interval in the military Ivașcu wrote pro-war propaganda in the army newspapers Soldatul and Santinela.Butnaru, p.255 His presence in the official press became even more controversial after that date. Historian Lucian Boia identifies him behind the pen name Victor Pancu, used in articles that praise Adolf Hitler and describe Joseph Stalin's as \\"the most atrocious of dictatorships\\".Boia, p.230 With contributors such as Ion Anestin and Costin Murgescu, Vremea was a staple of anti-Soviet propaganda all throughout 1942, leading Boia to conclude that Ivașcu was playing a \\"double game\\".Boia, p.230-231, 318 Boia's account is disputed by literary historian Nicolae Manolescu, who reports that the articles and pen name in question were those of a disgraced Iron Guard affiliate, Alexandru Gregorian. Manolescu notes that Ivașcu \\"was always a man of the left\\". Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Câteva precizări cu privire la George Ivașcu\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 51-52/2011 This identification is supported by Pavel Țugui, the literary historian and former communist, who notes that, as Victor Pancu, Gregorian was already contributing brochures on the Soviet war crimes. In articles that can be more readily attributed to him, Ivașcu makes only minimal reference to the recovery of Bessarabia, and centers on more distant objectives, such as the Siege of Leningrad, and vaguer topics, such as the Moscow Conference. These contributions, Țugui notes, are reserved in tone, and barely conceal his hope that British forces would soon land on the Nazi-occupied continent. As the war on the Eastern Front dragged on, Vremea grew apolitical. Its hosting of political undesirables intensified: the magazine inaugurated a \\"cohabitation\\" of the political opposites. At some point between late 1941 and summer 1942 (the circumstances are disputed), Ivașcu was appointed editorial secretary, and began signing in his own name the cultural column, critical essays, and reportage pieces from Slovakia (where he most likely traveled in mid 1942). He also kept up his foreign- affairs contributions, but used his old pseudonyms and the pen name Analist. In 1943, the Battle of Stalingrad, which Ivașcu refused to report on, put an end to the German-and-Romanian advances. Consequently, Ivașcu persuaded his boss, Vladimir Donescu, to renounce fascism for good. Vremea offered its columns to known leftists such as Călinescu, Virgil Ierunca, Ion Pas, and Radu Boureanu.Boia, p.231, 280. See also Netea, p.21, 133-134, 135, 169-170 Ivașcu also had contacts with the liberal Doinaș and other Sibiu Literary Circle members, whose ideas he chronicled for Vremea.Neagoe, p.36; Florentina Răcătăianu, \\"Cercul literar de la Sibiu. De la Corydon la Euphorion\\", in Studia Universitas Babeș-Bolyai Ephemerides, LII:1, 2007, p.154 =1945 rise= Ivașcu soon attracted unwanted attention: a series of denunciations in the antisemitic newspaper Moldova brought up his collaboration to the left- wing press and his association with Jewish intellectuals. Victor Durnea, \\"Misterioasa viață a Soranei Gurian\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 20/2003 By then, Ivașcu had affiliated with the Union of Patriots, an underground organization led by Dumitru Bagdasar, and reportedly managed its clandestine newspaper, the future România Liberă. At Vremea, beginning 1944, he contributed columns that were openly critical of the \\"Nazi New Order\\", spoke favorably of the Yugoslav Partisans and the French Resistance, and noted that the war had entered its \\"critical phase\\". In the wake of the Palace Coup that toppled Antonescu, Ivașcu published his final contributions to Vremea, including the September 6 editorial. It stated that \\"all good Romanians\\" had \\"shouted out their relief\\" at news that Antonescu had been arrested. Ivașcu soon rejoined the now-legal communist press. Following the arrival of the Allied Commission and the start of Soviet occupation, he was also integrated on the new bureaucracy, with directorial positions in the Information Ministry (heir to the wartime Propaganda Ministry). In 1945, he was applying communist censorship and introducing agitprop techniques in the field of Romanian cinema.Cristian Vasile, Literatura și artele în România comunistă. 1948–1953, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2010, p.211-212. In his official capacity at the Ministry, Ivașcu also took part in preparing a fraudulent win for the Communist Party in the 1946 election, keeping notes on the activities of dissident Social Democrats and issuing orders to restrict the activities of visiting Western journalists.Nicolae Balint, \\"Acțiunile Ministerului Informațiilor în judeţul Mureș pentru sprijinirea PCR în preajma alegerilor din noiembrie 1946\\", in Revista Bistriței, Vol. XXI/2: Istorie, 2012, p.195 With Pas, N. D. Cocea, Miron Constantinescu, Nicolae Carandino, George Macovescu and various others, Ivașcu was elected to the Committee of the Professional Journalists' Union (UZP).Victor Frunză, Istoria stalinismului în România, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1990, p.254-255. From 1945 to 1946, he served as editor-in-chief of Cocea's Victoria daily. This apparent reconversion irritated anti-Soviet left-wingers such as Tudor Arghezi, for whom Ivașcu was a \\"turncoat\\", deaf to \\"the irritating voice of truth\\".Boia, p.280 According to Boia, Victoria was a nominally independent gazette, but \\"just as vehement as the genuine communist ones\\", congratulating the PCdR for its purging of Romania's monarchist elites.Boia, p.287-288 Formalizing its affiliation to the Union of Patriots in October 1945, Victoria signaled a definitive ideological break with Doinaș and the Sibiu Circle.Ana Selejan, \\"Receptarea critică a Revistei Cercului Literar. Piaţa ideilor și piaţa pâinii în presa de după august 1944\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 6/2010, p.64-65 Ivașcu's work, such as his 1946 homage to the socialist writer Gala Galaction, was taken up by the communist literary journal Contemporanul.\\"Presa mondială\\", in Revista Fundațiilor Regale, Nr. 10/1946, p.187 Ivașcu was also a member of the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union and prominent contributor to its magazine, Veac Nou.Adrian Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx. O introducere în istoria comunismului românesc, Editura Curtea Veche, Bucharest, 2005, p.143, 146. From 1947 to 1948, he served as head of the Propaganda Ministry's Press Directorate,Boia, p.318 during which time he was also created a Knight 2nd Class of the Meritul Cultural Order.\\"Partea I B: Dispozițiuni și publicațiuni care nu au caracter normativ: Decrete regale. Ministerul Artelor\\", in Monitorul Oficial, Nr. 192/1947, p.7544 He assisted Grigore Preoteasa in setting up the Ministry's own Disciplinary Committee, of which Ivașcu was secretary. =Communist imprisonment= Despite his underground communist credentials, Ivașcu was among those who, in 1948, alongside Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, fell out of favor with the new Communist regime. The communist party opened a file on him, comprising a psychological profile notes by Preoteasa, who called Ivașcu \\"characterless\\", \\"perfidious\\", and \\"a dangerous man\\". Ivașcu was consequently sacked from his position at the Ministry, and made Director of the Nicolae Bălcescu Museum. The Securitate secret police opened a file on him, investigating his Vremea work. He was erroneously identified with another Paul Ștefan, who had collaborated with the antisemitic review Sfarmă-Piatră and was the object of a national manhunt. Ivașcu was eventually arrested on March 23, 1950, and formally indicted of \\"crime against peace\\".Boia, p.318; Butnaru, p.255 Accounts differ as to what happened next. According to one version, he was sentenced to death, but his penalty was commuted to hard labor. Others, however, suggests that he was in fact sentenced just once, with a total penalty of five years.Boia, p.318; Butnaru, p.255; Șerbulescu, p.94, 95 The verdict came despite favorable testimonies in his favor from Călinescu and his colleagues in the Union of Patriots. Ivașcu's mother Maria appealed the decision and wrote letters of protest to Ana Pauker, the communist grandee, but these went unanswered. Ivașcu was detained for a while in the same cell as another disgraced communist, Belu Zilber, with whom he became friends and later bitter rivals. In his account of their time together, Zilber claims that Ivașcu was being prepared as a false witness in a show trial of the former Social Democrats, including those who had aligned themselves with the PCdR. As he puts it, communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu- Dej \\"gave up on this plan. He discovered that it made more sense to appoint [the Social Democrats] as high dignitaries.\\"Șerbulescu, p.95 For a while, Ivașcu was held together with Adrian Marino, a fellow literary man and Călinescu disciple, within a cell that also housed Bessarabian inmates and militants of the Iron Guard. When Ivașcu began learning Russian with the Bessarabians, the Guardists were infuriated, and he very narrowly escaped a pummeling.Eugen Lungu, \\"Basarabia și așa-zișii\\", in Revista Sud-Est, Nr. 1/2011 Archival research carried out in 2006 indicates that Ivașcu turned informant for the Securitate, spying on his cell mates at Constanța, Jilava, and eventually Aiud.Dan C. Mihăilescu, \\"A ști, a înțelege, a ierta\\", in Idei în Dialog, Nr. 9/2006 =Rehabilitation and Contemporanul= Following a review of his case,Butnaru, p.255-256 Ivașcu was declared innocent and freed in 1954. As claimed by Zilber, \\"he proved to be an obedient fella while in prison, and the party rewarded him for it.\\"Șerbulescu, p.118 He rejoined the teaching staff at Lazăr High School, where he remained until 1956. His skills as a propagandist were employed by the Securitate, which also contemplated keeping him as an informant in the outside world. Ivașcu's case officer described him as: \\"intelligent and able, may be in a position to collect intelligence from very difficult targets, his skills likely to facilitate his entrance there\\". He was subsequently assigned to publishing the magazine Glasul Patriei, which was dedicated to cajoling the Romanian exiles and was officially issued in Pankow by a \\"Romanian Repatriation Committee\\". Florin Manolescu, \\"Scriitori români în exil. Vintilă Horia față cu Premiul Goncourt\\", in Viața Românească, Nr. 5-6/2013 The task was unusual: Ivașcu, an antifascist and former prisoner, was working under orders from \\"some Securitate operative\\", and alongside Nichifor Crainic, the reformed far-right politico.Crohmălniceanu, p.173 This team focused its attacks on anti-communist intellectuals who had flirted with fascism, in particular Vintilă Horia and Emil Cioran.Cornel Moraru, \\"Receptarea critică a operei lui Cioran (I)\\", in Studia Universitatis Petru Maior. Philologia, Vol. 3, 2003, p.6-7 The next step in Ivașcu's rehabilitation was his 1955 appointment to the position of Contemporanul editor-in-chief, where he was seconded for a while by Ion Mihăileanu (later a noted screenwriter and critic of communism). Valerian Sava, \\"Premiul César pentru Radu Mihăileanu\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 310, March 2006 Boia notes that the authorities' sudden change of heart offers a glimpse into \\"the impeccable communist logic\\"; Țugui attributes it to an intervention by his old mentor Iordan, by then a high-ranking communist, who took Ivașcu's side in Central Committee meetings. According to Zilber, the time he had spent in prison was serendipitous, helping Ivașcu to \\"outdo himself\\".Șerbulescu, p.94, 118 This is because Ivașcu was \\"a born editor\\": \\"He gets high on printers' ink, can spot a missing letter out of one thousand words, can detect a text alignment error at a glance\\". Ivașcu was also allowed to return to his passion for foreign politics. In August 1959, Lupta de Clasă hosted his festive essay praising peaceful coexistence, and describing the Warsaw Pact as Romania's \\"keystone\\" alliance.A. Stan, \\"Revista revistelor. Numere închinate aniversării a 15 ani de la eliberarea Romîniei de sub jugul fascist. Lupta de Clasă nr. 8/1959\\", in Studii. Revistă de Istorie, Nr. 4/1959, p.410 As noted in 2006 by critic Constantin Coroiu, Ivașcu's Contemporanul was \\"the bridge that linked (or, one could say, salvaged) the interwar era to the contemporary era\\". Consecrated writers (Călinescu, Philippide, Arghezi, Lucian Blaga, Mihail Sadoveanu) were featured alongside young talents (Manolescu, Nichita Stănescu, Ana Blandiana). In addition to such work, Ivașcu inaugurated the Contemporanul \\"tea parties\\", where former prisoners such as Egon Balas could network and find protection.Egon Balas, Will to Freedom: A Perilous Journey through Fascism and Communism, Syracuse University Press, Syracuse, 2000, p.330. Ivașcu also helped Marino, his former cell mate, by having him published in Contemporanul. Liviu Antonesei, \\"Stahanovismul, armă de război (II)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 522, April 2010 Nevertheless, Contemporanul maintained the status of an elite propaganda magazine. Looking back on the period, writer Gheorghe Grigurcu describes it as a collaborationist tribune, a Romanian answer to the Nouvelle Revue Française, with Ivașcu as a communist Drieu La Rochelle.Elvira Iliescu, \\"Instanța Grigurcu: la Judecata de apoi a scriitorilor (2)\\", in Ex-Ponto, Nr. 33/2011, p.106 In the early 1960s, official publications listed Ivașcu as one of sixteen literary critics whose work supported \\"socialist construction\\". Ion Simuț, \\"Canonul literar proletcultist (III)\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 29/2008 In 1961, Leonte Răutu, head of the Agitprop Directorate, selected him to oversee and preface the complete edition of Blaga's poetry. Blaga had enjoyed a precarious standing with the regime, and had basically forbidden from publishing for some 15 years. In effect, Ivașcu acted as a censor, cutting out stanzas, destroying the inner continuity of poetic cycles, and inserting misleading critical commentary.Negrici, p.98-100; Cristian Vasile, \\"Dorli Blaga, un editor tenace al tatălui\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 1197, February 2013; Mihai Zamfir, \\"Clasici revizitați: Lucian Blaga\\", in Viața Românească, Nr. 11-12/2013 Reportedly, he regretted his role in the affair, privately confessing that he had \\"exploited [Blaga's] fears and cravings\\".Paul Aretzu, \\"Jurnalul propriei regăsiri\\", in Vatra, Nr. 6-7/2008, p.140 As an official emissary of the party, he coaxed another banished poet, Arghezi, to collaborate and adopt socialist realism.Florin Mihăilescu, De la proletcultism la postmodernism, Editura Pontica , Constanța, 2002, p.89. In 1969, after the poet's death, he published in Books Abroad the short essay Tudor Arghezi: Poet for Contemporary Man, praising him as \\"the inspired prophet\\", victorious \\"in the conflict between cognizance and noncognizance.\\"George Ivașcu, Astrid Ivask, \\"Tudor Arghezi: Poet for Contemporary Man\\", in Books Abroad 43(1), 1969, p.32-36 Gheorghiu-Dej even allowed Ivașcu to travel abroad, urging him to convince Romanian defectors and exiles, such as conductor Constantin Silvestri, to return home. According to Manolescu, Ivașcu consciously failed at this task, hinting to Silvestri that a return would not be in his best interest. As Coroiu notes, Ivașcu was personally involved in smoothing out the relationship between Contemporanul and Călinescu, whose columns were sometimes refused for publishing as politically suspect. =University professor and Lumea editor= From 1958 to 1968, Ivașcu headed the University of Bucharest's History of Romanian Literature department, also directing the History of Contemporary Romanian Literature department there from 1966 to 1968. Alexandru Niculescu, \\"Momente cu George Ivașcu\\", in România Literară, Nr. 51-52/2011 He worked closely with two other Călinescu disciples, Piru and Marino, and from 1963 employed Manolescu Pavel Țugui, \\"Dosarul studentului Nicolae Manolescu: povestea unei exmatriculări\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 760, September–October 2004 and Eugen SimionIlin, p.140 as his assistants. He helped clear Manolescu of charges that he was from a fascist family, later protecting his freedom of expression against renewed censorship. \\"Cuvântul, Cotidianul, Contrast\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 79, August 2001 As his university colleagues noted, Ivașcu was a good manager of his department, one who helped the faculty as a whole,Nicolae Rotund, \\"Ce a fost – cum a fost. Paul Cornea de vorbă cu Daniel Cristea-Enache\\", in Ex-Ponto, Nr. 1/2014, p.105 and whose arrival there helped restore \\"the normalcy of values\\".Ilin, p.138 Ivașcu founded and let a literary society representing the faculty, called Junimea (in honor of a 19th-century club in Iași). It enjoyed a flurry of activity during the 1960s, when it hosted talents such as Stănescu, Ioan Alexandru, and Adrian Păunescu, but was virtually defunct by 1970.Crohmălniceanu, p.143 Ivașcu remained at Contemporanul until 1971, while also in charge of the French-language Arcades and Revue Roumaine. In summer 1963, with financial support from the UZP,Bîlbîie, p.113 he also founded Lumea, a magazine of international politics which gave readers an alternative to the official news.John Neubauer, Robert Pynsent, Vilmos Voigt, Marcel Cornis-Pope, \\"Part I: Publishing and Censorship. Introduction\\", in Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer (eds.), History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Volume III: The Making and Remaking of Literary Institutions, John Benjamins, Amsterdam & Philadelphia, 2004, p.59. Modeled on Western news magazines, its imprimatur a sign that Gheorghiu-Dej was moving away from the Soviets, an \\"extensive de-Russification process\\".Corina L. Petrescu, \\"Performing Disapproval toward the Soviets. Nicolae Ceaușescu's Speech on 21 August 1968 in Romanian Media\\", in Martin Klimke, Jacco Pekelder, Joachim Scharloth (eds.), Between Prague Spring and French May: Opposition and Revolt in Europe, 1960–1980 (Protest, Culture and Society, Volume 7), Berghahn Books, New York City & Oxford, 2013, p.203. Imprimatur was therefore provided under the new guidelines of national communism, as noted by party functionary Paul Niculescu-Mizil. According to Mizil, Lumea effectively replaced a Romanian edition of Novoye Vremya, while returning to a \\"national line\\" in politics.Paul Niculescu-Mizil, \\"Prestigiu și autoritate\\", in Magazin Istoric, April 1997, p.104 Ivașcu would direct Lumea to 1966. The magazine made a point of underscoring Romania's debt to Western culture, notably by publishing Marino's historical essay, Descoperirea Europei de către români (\\"Romanians Discovering Europe\\"). \\"Adrian Marino la optzeci de ani\\", in Caietele. Echinox, Vol. 1, 2001 Probably using his contacts in the communist elite, Ivașcu managed to protect and hire at Lumea Doinaș, who was also just returning from prison. Gelu Ionescu, \\"Cazul Doinaș\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 2/2014 The eccentric poet-translator Mircea Ivănescu was also employed by Ivașcu as a columnist. Ivașcu asked him to fictionalize himself into an Italian correspondent, which allowed Ivănescu to study Italian politics.Felicia Antip, \\"Portret Mircea Ivănescu. Un eșec ireparabil\\", in Menora. Minirevista Comunității Evreiești din Focșani, Nr. 10/2012 Similar practices were imposed on other staff members of the staff (among them Felicia Antip, Florica Șelmaru, and Cristian Popișteanu), but the magazine also hosted translations from Western intellectuals: Art Buchwald, Sebastian Haffner, Walter Lippmann, Drew Pearson, Jean Schwœbel, and Daily Workers John Gritten.Bîlbîie, p.113-115 Ivașcu still intervened to remove articles that went too far in praising non-orthodox stances, as with a 1964 piece honoring Nicolae Titulescu.Cristian Popișteanu, \\"Cum am ajuns la Magazin Istoric\\", in Magazin Istoric, April 1997, p.100 In 1964, after an eight-year wait and numerous character checks, Ivașcu was reinstated a member of the Communist Party (or, as it was known then, Workers' Party) by Gheorghiu-Dej. Florin Mihai, \\"Cerberul Ceaușescu contra lui Zaharia Stancu, 'agentul Siguranței'\\", in Historia, March 2012 The ailing communist leader died in March 1965, and Ivașcu made a public show of his grief. As he recounted in 1968, he \\"respected and loved Gheorghiu-Dej\\", a \\"standard bearer\\" for the party and the writers' community.Elis Neagoe-Pleșa, \\"Reacții ale populației la moartea lui Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej\\", in Caietele CNSAS, Nr. 1-2/2012, p.283 During that same interval, Ivașcu invited Călinescu to visit and lecture at his university department, thus facilitating the ailing scholar's very last meetings with young writers. In early 1965, Ivașcu was one of the few witnesses to Călinescu's death in hospital,Crohmălniceanu, p.64 and one of the disciples who oversaw his vigil and funeral.Lucian Nastasă, Intimitatea amfiteatrelor. Ipostaze din viața privată a universitarilor \\"literari\\" (1864–1948), Editura Limes, Cluj-Napoca, 2010, p.466-467. He also carried on with editorial work, putting out a 1967 edition of Nicolae Filimon's 1862 classic, Ciocoii vechi și noi. It was published with Ivașcu's footnotes, which bracketed out and toned down Filimon's critique of egalitarianism. Ștefan Borbély, \\"Exactitate și manierism\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 8/2010 In 1969, Ivașcu clashed with his pupil Manolescu over political and literary matters: Manolescu had insisted on publishing a poetry anthology which included unfrequented anticommunists, seeing their removal from literary history as a form of induced \\"amnesia\\", which resulted in a literary void. As the volume was being withdrawn from bookstores, Ivașcu published a Contemporanul article which insisted that communist poetry was fertile enough to fill that void.Lovinescu, p.340-342 According to Radio Free Europe's Monica Lovinescu, his demonstration was \\"long and useless\\". She also notes that Ivașcu's attempt to invalidate the contribution of formerly fascist poets contradicted the regime's policy of recovering them at Glasul Patriei.Lovinescu, p.342-343 =At România Literară= Under the spell of liberalization promoted by the new communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Ivașcu became a member of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences. In 1969 and 1971, he received the Romanian Writers' Union Prize. From 1971 until his death, Ivașcu directed România Literară, the Writers' Union magazine. According to Manolescu, who was to succeed him there, the move from Contemporanul to România Literară was rather a demotion, signaling that Ceaușescu did not trust him. Others contrarily note that Ceaușescu handpicked Ivașcu to direct the magazine after the fall from favor of a previous editor, Nicolae Breban. Breban had made public his criticism of the July Theses, through which Ceaușescu had reintroduced hardline Marxism-Leninism. Mircea Iorgulescu, \\"Amintirile unui critic\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 730, March 2004 Ivașcu was asked to contribute propaganda editorials honoring Ceaușescu's stance. As his colleague Mircea Iorgulescu noted, he only regarded such pieces as an \\"editorial task\\" that required his \\"technical skill\\". C. Stănescu, \\"'Pe invers...'\\", in Cultura, Nr. 466, April 2014 Other authors contrarily assess that Ivașcu had been assigned a leading role in the subsequent \\"cultural revolution\\". Media analyst Claudia Chiorean sees Ivașcu as one of Ceaușescu's \\"first violinists\\", whose bad reputation also harmed Manolescu's own.Claudia Talașman Chiorean, \\"Promovarea mitului Erei Noi în perioada 1989-2000 prin România Literară\\", in Studia Universitas Babeș-Bolyai Ephemerides, LII:1, 2007, p.139 By then, Ivașcu was making occasional returns to agitprop in the film industry supervisor, this time as a promoter of Ceaușescu's national communism. Anca Alexandrescu, \\"Filmul românesc și educația în procesul de formare al omului nou\\", in Sfera Politicii, Nr. 135, May 2009 Ivașcu still made a point of promoting foreign literature and the more daring aspects of Romanian modernism, putting out poetry by Blandiana, Mircea Dinescu, and Ion Caraion, as well as essays by Iorgulescu and Sami Damian. The magazine also hosted debates on culture and society, and, as Manolescu writes, was \\"the objective ally of democratically-minded writers.\\" With that, Ivașcu relaxed the censorship mechanisms, but the editorial staff still followed customary rules and censored themselves. Marian Victor Buciu, \\"N. Manolescu despre cenzură\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 4/2010 Moreover, Ivașcu made it his goal to promote awareness of Romanian grammar, employing the services of linguists Alexandru Graur, Theodor Hristea, Ștefan Badea, and Alexandru Niculescu, who wrote special columns for the correction of vulgarisms. Returning to his work in literary history, Ivașcu recovered a reassessed unorthodox Marxist literary criticism. As noted by a fellow researcher in the field, Z. Ornea, Ivașcu helped \\"restore the truth\\" with his biography of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (published by Editura Albatros in 1972).Z. Ornea, Junimea și junimismul, Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1998, p.329. The following year, at Editura Politică, Ivașcu oversaw an edition of articles and speeches by the communist potentate Petru Groza.Nicolae Georgescu, Sorin Radu, \\"Refacerea politică și extinderea organizatorică a frontului plugarilor în anii 1944-1945\\", in Studia Universitatis Petru Maior. Historia, Vol. 9, 2009, p.200 Although he had held a professorship, Ivașcu had not obtained his Ph.D., and was pressured into correcting that error. He eventually enlisted for the university's own doctoral program, with a paper on the early history of Romanian literature, and with Șerban Cioculescu as his doctoral advisor. The work, published in 1969, and echoing Călinescu's style, was saluted by the columnist at Magazin Istoric: \\"emerging from our epoch's burning core\\", the book showed that \\"Romanian writing has sprung up on the battlefield of independence, being conceived [...] as a wall protecting [our] national being\\".C. Z., \\"Panoramic. George Ivașcu: Istoria literaturii române, vol. I\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1969, p.95 Other academics gave the work poor reviews, in particular for its political content. Ivașcu took an \\"ultra-orthodox\\" nationalist stand on Romanian language history, downplaying the contribution of Slavs.Gabriel Moisa, \\"Absences from Map. The Problem of Bessarabia in the Historiographical Imaginary of Nicolae Ceaușescu Regime\\", in Revista Română de Geografie Politică, Nr. 1/2013, p.77 Eugen Negrici notes that Ivașcu had annexed Slavonic texts to his area of study, covering up the paucity of literary sources, and had taken for granted protochronistic claims about \\"baroque literature\\" in Romania.Negrici p.181, 187, 208-209, 213-214 The result, Negrici concludes, is \\"pitiful\\", the probable result of a \\"political command\\".Negrici p.181, 187 As Niculescu notes, Ivașcu found his degree \\"utterly useless\\", being \\"a man of the fleeting everyday facts, of generic notes, and certainly not one to spend time documenting himself at any length.\\" Several of his colleagues expressed concerns that Ivașcu had had his thesis ghostwritten. Despite such controversy, Ivașcu joined a staff of writers who put out an official edition of Romanian literary history at Editura Academiei. Negrici describes the collective volume, published in 1970, as an \\"antiquated or, at the very least, inopportune\\" mixture of aestheticism and socialist realism, which unwittingly showed the limits of Ceaușescu's liberalization.Negrici p.256 =Final years and legacy= Living a withdrawn life from 1976, Ivașcu was described by Niculescu as a figure of the \\"Western left\\", whose personality encompassed a love for \\"the literary tradition\\" and public displays of Francophilia. A \\"sui generis independent\\", he maintained close friendships with a few like-minded literary figures who had peaked in the interwar age. Among them were Zaharia Stancu and F. Brunea-Fox. Liliana Nicolae, \\"Brunea-Fox: Lucruri neștiute\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 351, November 2010 In public, Ivașcu was showing himself a devotee of the Ceaușescu regime—as Manolescu puts it, \\"he feared Ceaușescu\\". He traveled freely to the West, but, as reported by exile author Sanda Stolojan, spoke admiringly of Ceaușescu's anti-Sovietism, and claimed that the anticommunist Radio Free Europe interested nobody but Romania's \\"old age pensioners\\". Stolojan wrote: \\"I found his cowardice fascinating. He no longer believes in anything, at his very core he just plays the regime's card.\\"Sanda Stolojan, Au balcon de l'exil roumain à Paris. Avec Cioran, Eugène Ionesco, Mircea Eliade, Vintila Horia, L'Harmattan, Paris, 1999, p.26. Ivașcu and Florica Georgescu-Condurachi had one daughter, Voichița. Georgescu-Condurachi fled to Paris in 1978, followed by their daughter in 1981. Subsequently, Ivașcu wrote to Ceaușescu, addressing him as \\"beloved conducător\\", in order to \\"disavow\\" his daughter's deed. According to Dinescu and historian Stelian Tănase, the letter was probably a formality, meant to ensure retention of his privileges, such as his position at România Literară. Niculescu also notes that he continued to be tortured by a parental \\"arduous love\\". Visiting Paris in 1984, Ivașcu met secretly with his wife and daughter, with help from the Lebanese Embassy. By then, the România Literară group had been subject to a clampdown and the full reintroduction of censorship; Lumea was also made to resume the party line. At around that time, writer Corneliu Vadim Tudor reported to the Securitate, accusing Ivașcu himself of \\"ideological subversion\\".Lavinia Stan, Transitional Justice in Post-Communist Romania: The Politics of Memory, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc., 2013, p.101. Other officials took his side. Macovescu, his friend at the UZP, addressed him a letter intended for publication on his 70th birthday. He noted there that Ivașcu had been made to endure \\"terrifying torments\\" by \\"those who believed that the new world [of communism] was their own profitable business.\\"Butnaru, p.254-255 Late in life, Ivașcu was tasked by the regime with editing the work of philosophers Gabriel Liiceanu and Andrei Pleșu, both of them disciples of Constantin Noica, the former political prisoner. Ivașcu's work implied participating in censorship: his cuts in Pleșu's text were preserved by Liiceanu as illustrations of a \\"pathology of culture\\" under communism. Ivașcu had cut out all visible hint that Noica had spent time in prison.Gabriel Liiceanu, The Păltiniș Diary: A Paideic Model in Humanist Culture, Central European University Press, Budapest & New York City, 2000, p.136. Ivașcu died in Bucharest on June 21, 1988, one and a half years before the anti-communist Revolution. In an obituary piece written by Coroiu, Ivașcu is referred to as \\"the greatest Romanian journalist of the postwar era.\\" By July 2006, on Ivașcu's 95th anniversary, Coroiu noted that \\"there is yet no reason why I should revise that claim\\". Already in July 1988, Ivașcu's colleagues at România Literară were taking steps toward political independence. A Securitate note on the period reported that Manolescu and Iorgulescu, together with Ion Bogdan Lefter and other writers, were seeking to commit the magazine to pure aestheticism and \\"reduce the political content\\", \\"as the late director would have wanted it\\".Magdalena Răduță, \\"«Ils sont tous mes fils!» L'institution du parrainage littéraire et la génération 80\\", in Studia Universitas Babeș-Bolyai Philologia, LVII:2, 2010, p.69-70 Returning to Romania some years after these events, Voichița Ivașcu donated much of her father's belongings to the Pârvan Centennial Museum of Bârlad. The Revolution also allowed Ivașcu's work to be critically reassessed. Zilber's posthumous memoirs of life in prison were ultimately published in 1991. As acknowledged by editor G. Brătescu, some of the passages relating to Ivașcu had to be cut out from the printed version, in order to avert bitter controversies.G. Brătescu, Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2003, p.410. In his 2008 book of memoirs, România Literară columnist Gabriel Dimisianu made a conscious effort to restore Ivașcu's good standing in cultural memory. As Dimisianu argues, \\"only saints can be said to have done only good things\\".

The granite-faced hexagonal building was designed by Guy Lowell of Boston in classical Roman style and was built between 1913 and 1927, completion having been delayed by World War I. It replaced the former New York County Courthouse on Chambers Street, popularly known as the Tweed Courthouse. Both the interior and exterior are New York City Landmarks: the exterior was designated on February 1, 1966New York County Courthouse Designation Report, New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (February 1, 1966) and the interior on March 24, 1981. History The architect was selected through a design competition, which Boston architect Guy Lowell won in 1913.Legal History and Architecture of New York County Supreme Courthouse, Historical Society of the Courts of the State of New York (accessed September 27, 2015). Lowell originally proposed a circular building, to be built at the vastly expensive sum of $20 to $30 million. Construction was delayed by World War I and the design was remade as a smaller and less expensive hexagonal building—a Temple of Justice. The building was designed in the Roman classical style. Work began in 1919. The courthouse's dedication ceremony took place in February 1927, two weeks after Lowell died. Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals Benjamin Cardozo and Associate Judges of the Court of Appeals Frederick E. Crane and Irving Lehman were present at the event. Design = Exterior = The building's mass and scale give it the appearance of a temple. A broad set of steps sweeps up from Foley Square to a massive Corinthian colonnade covering most of the front of the courthouse, topped by an elaborate 140-foot-long (43 m) triangular pediment of thirteen figures carved in bas relief from granite. The pediment and acroteria by Frederick Warren Allen include three statues: Law, Truth, and Equity. A frieze bears the inscription \\"The true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good government\\", a quotation taken from a letter written by George Washington to Attorney General Edmund Randolph on September 28, 1789.Ben Zimmer, \\"When Typos are Set in Stone\\", Visual Thesaurus (February 18, 2009).\\"New York County Courthouse Pediment, New York Supreme Court, abt 1924\\" on the Frederick Warren Allen websitePaul Goldberger, The City Observed: New York: A Guide to the Architecture of Manhattan. New York: Vintage Books, 1979, p. 34. \\"New York State Supreme Court Building\\", New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services (accessed September 27, 2015). The inscription is a slight misquote; Washington actually referred to the \\"due administration\\" of justice and not the \\"true administration\\" of justice, an error discovered by the New York Post in 2009.Golding, Bruce. \\"George Denied His Due\\", New York Post (February 16, 2009). The error was apparently made by the architect, Guy Lowell, and the mistake was repeated by others, including Charles Warren in his Pulitzer Prize–winning The Supreme Court in United States History (1922). Along Foley Square, the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse (right) sits next to the New York State Supreme Court Building (left). On the far right can be seen part of the Manhattan Municipal Building. The stone steps leading up to the colonnaded entrance were flanked by two allegorical statues, Justice and Authority, both designed by the Franco-American sculptor Philip Martiny (1858–1927).Lucy D.

These are now at the back of the building. Both are large seated figures made of granite. On the right is Justice, a female figure holding a shield and scroll, while on the left is Authority, which holds a scroll and fasces, the Roman symbol of authority. The figures were purchased by the City of New York in 1906 and originally flanked the Centre Street entrance to the Surrogate's Courthouse; they were removed in early 1960 for the widening of Centre Street and an expansion of the underlying platforms of the New York City Subway's Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station and were then moved to the New York County Courthouse.Municipal Reference Library Notes, Volumes 35–36, Municipal Reference Library (1961), p. 142. = Interior = The rotunda is in circumference and rises to a cupola which in high and long.

This New Deal-era mural was designed by the Italian artist Attilio Pusterla and painted by him and a team of artists working under his direction from 1934 and 1936, under sponsorship from the Federal Art Project of the Works Project Administration. Pusterla also executed murals in the courthouse's Jury Assembly Rooms on the fourth floor and Ceremonial Courtroom on the third floor. Law Through the Ages is divided into six lunettes, or sections. Each depicts a pair of figures from historical cultures important to the history of law: Assyrian and Egyptian, Hebraic and Persian, Greek and Roman, Byzantine and Frankish, English and early colonial, with the final section portraying George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Above the seated figures are portraits of six lawgivers: Hammurabi, Moses, Solon, Justinian, Blackstone and John Marshall.New York County Courthouse Interior Designation Report , New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (March 24, 1981). Accessed September 2, 2011. Restoration of the mural (along with a stained-glass window also by Pusterla) took place in 1988; the project received a 1989 Design Award from the Public Design Commission of the City of New York. The restoration project, which was privately funded by money raised from New York City judges and attorneys, was part of a broader renovation campaign in the 1980s and 1990s to protect the courthouse's historic art from water seepage and other damage caused by neglect. Environs The building is somewhat of an older sibling to Cass Gilbert's 1936 Corinthian-columned Foley Square Courthouse (renamed the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in 2001) just to its south, which also faces Foley Square from the east. Both buildings face Federal Plaza across the square, which includes the more modern Jacob K. Javits Federal Building and James L. Watson Court of International Trade Building, which houses the U.S. Court of International Trade. Other court buildings are nearby, including those for New York City Criminal Court, New York City Civil Court, and the Surrogate's Courthouse.

Among other actions, the conference approved a resolution endorsing the exclusion from Chinese law given Chinese Christians in the \\"unequal treaties\\" imposed on China by European countries, the United States, and Japan. The Conference The Conference celebrated the centenary of the arrival of the first Protestant missionary to China, Robert Morrison. It was convened on April 25 and adjourned on May 8, 1907.The title page of the official record of the Conference states that the conference opened 5 Apr, but this is in error as the text of the report indicates. Chinese Centenary Missionary Conference Records (hereafter CCMCR). New York: American Tract Society, n.d., title page, p. ix Attendees at the Conference totaled 1,170 persons, mostly missionaries from every province of China and with representatives from 25 countries. About 100 missionary organizations were operating in China, although not all were present at the conference.MacGillivray, D. ed. A Century of Protestant Missions in China. Shanghai: American Tract Society, 1907, pp. v-vii Most attendees were British and American. Despite the fact that the subject of the conference was the promotion of Christianity in China fewer than 10 Chinese can be identified among the delegates.Yao, Kevin Xiyi. “At the turn of the century: a study of the China Centenary Missionary Conference of 1907\\".

Several served on a committee related to women's work.Thompson, Larry Clinton. William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, p. 216 Congregationalist author-missionary Arthur Henderson Smith was elected co- Chairman of the Conference. American missionary author and Congregationalist Arthur Henderson Smith and British Presbyterian John C. Gibson were elected joint Chairmen for the Conference. Eleven Committees presented resolutions on different subjects of interest to the delegates. Debate and Decisions The tenor of the Conference was optimistic. The martyrdom of 189 Protestant missionaries – men, women, and children—during the Boxer Rebellion seven years before was hardly mentioned.Thompson, 184 Since the Boxer Rebellion, the Chinese government had undertaken a large number of internal reforms and missionaries perceived a much greater openness by the Chinese to Western influences, including Christianity. Missionary William Scott Ament, famous for his clash with Mark Twain, headed a Committee at the Conference. The missionaries celebrated their success in converting about 180,000 Chinese to Christianity during the previous 100 years. However, a negative note was interjected into the conference by J.W. Lowrie who said that “the far larger part of this century’s sowing [i.e. spreading Christianity]... has been on fallow ground,” CCMCR, pp. 101-102 an acknowledgement that the missionaries had often been disappointed at the pace of their progress and their results. A major objective of many at the Conference was to unite Protestant efforts into a single coordinated body rather than the diverse and often competitive efforts of many different missionary organizations. William Scott Ament chaired the Committee of Federation and Comity which established a framework for united action. The Conference also called for an expansion of resources devoted to education and medical work – to the discomfort of evangelical missionaries who said that “education is not...a substitute for preaching.\\"CCMCR, p.380 The most divisive and controversial issue at the Conference was the privileges and exemptions from Chinese law given Chinese Christians under the unequal treaties. Some missionaries wanted to forgo the protections of Chinese Christians as “a hated yoke upon the [Chinese] government” and an encouragement for unscrupulous Chinese to become Christians for personal advantage.Yao, p. 67 But the majority disagreed and the resolution adopted by the Conference stated that “the time has not come when all the protection to Christian converts provided in the treaties can safely be withdrawn.”CCMCR, p. 743 Consequences The missionaries at the 1907 Conference “did not see any need to make fundamental adjustments or to reorient the missionary movement in China.” Events soon proved they were short-sighted. The optimism of the missionaries that Christianity would continue to progress in China was soon dashed as was the spirit in favor of “federation and comity.” The Qing dynasty fell in 1911 and it was followed by an era of chaos and warlords and the increasingly hostile identification of Christianity with Western colonialism and imperialism. Within 10 years the spirit of Protestant unity and cooperation coming out of the Conference was undermined by disagreement between fundamentalists and liberals.Yao, 69-70 References External links * China Centenary Missionary Conference Records.

The name is derived from the jidār (wall), which is used locally to refer to ancient monumental ruins. These pre-Islamic tombs date from Late Antiquity (4th-7th? centuries CE).Unless otherwise indicated, information has been taken from Kadra's (1983) publication, which is the most detailed archaeological work on the subject. See also LaPorte (2005) who supplies some information omitted from Kadra's work as published.  Construction  The tombs are situated on the tops of two hills in the mountainous Frenda area, around 30 km south of Tiaret. There are three sepulchres on Jabal Lakhdar (), and ten on Jabal Arawi (, also known as Ternaten) 6 km south of the first group. The graves' size and commanding situation indicate that they were built for royalty. They have been systematically plundered for many centuries, and hence are in a state of ruin. The monuments were erected straight onto the substratum or with very shallow excavation. Some stone was quarried from local limestone and sandstone, some was recycled from nearby settlements and necropoli of earlier times. The materials vary widely: dressed stone blocks 1-1.5 m. long, partially dressed blocks up to 2.4 m. long, natural rock slabs with minimal dressing, old tombstones, and old building fragments. Most of the construction is dry stone; lime mortar is used sparingly. The thirteen Jedars share many characteristics. There are also many similarities with much smaller Berber tombs called bazinas, which are common in the pre-Sahara zone. This shows that they represent indigenous Berber architecture in spite of their use of Roman architectural techniques and Mediterranean Christian iconography. The characteristics are:LaPorte (2005) p. 337 tabulates the known measurements. * A square body, the largest being 46 m. on a side, and the smallest 11.55 m., with a height of up to 4 m. In some cases, the body is solid stonework, in the largest examples it contains funerary chambers. * A pyramidal top, which in all cases is very much ruined, but which must have been originally up to 13 m. high, constructed in many small steps (rise and tread about equal at around 0.2-0.25 m.). The top is mostly solid masonry, but in those jedars that contain funerary chambers, removable steps on one side conceal a passage leading down into the chambers, the ceilings of which may protrude up into the top. * Most, perhaps all, were surrounded by a courtyard, square except for an extension in the middle of the side facing east. In the larger ones this extension contains a small building modeled after the main monument. This building is believed to have been used for obtaining divinatory dreams by sleeping in the vicinity of the tomb. * Most if not all were further surrounded by a complex of low walls. It is believed that the solid jedars that do not contain funerary chambers may cover a single tomb excavated into the bedrock.  Epigraphy and iconography  right The jedars of Jabal Lakhdar seem to have displayed a dedicatory inscription on one side of the top. This inscription was in Latin,Early researchers, including the influential archaeologist Stéphane Gsell (1901), claimed they were bilingual Latin and Greek, which is occasionally repeated even today (e.g. Alan Rushworth, 2004, \\"From Arzuges to Rustamids: State Formation and Regional Identity in the Pre- Saharan Zone\\" in A.H. Merrills (ed.) Vandals, Romans and Berbers: New Perspectives on Late Antique North Africa; Guy Halsall, 2007, Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West 376-568). Kadra (1983, e.g. p. 257 & 261; see also LaPorte, 2005, p. 365) has shown that almost all the so-called Greek is based on erroneously identified late forms of Latin letters, while the remainder is merely the combination of Greek alpha and omega used as a Christian symbol rather than as text. but not deeply engraved and hence in every case is now almost illegible; the inscribed blocks are also very damaged. Enough remains only to confirm that these were tombs, but not whose they were.e.g. isolated words like egregius (eminent), duci (duke), filius (son) and matri (mother) can be made out However, these jedars display an enormous range of stonecutters' marks, from isolated letters to partial names. Most of these are also Latin, some have been postulated to be Tifinagh.Kadra (1983) p. 243. There are a few unobtrusive Christian symbols, and a couple of roughly carved panels (apparently hunting scenes) similar to many ancient Lybico-Berber rock carvings. The largest jedar at Ternaten is the only one in that group sufficiently intact to display epigraphy and iconography. It contained large well-executed polychrome murals (now almost completely weathered away) of religious scenes typical of Mediterranean Christian iconography of the 5th century or later,See LaPorte, 2005, fig. 18 for one of the remaining fragments. indicating that the ruling class had by then become Christian. This jedar also contains many Latin inscriptions on recycled tombstones and other building material, dating from the time of Septimius Severus (202-203 CE) up to 494 CE. The source of this recycled material is not known with certainty, but there are several large ruins of cities and necropoli in the surrounding districts.Cadenat (1957). Judging by Roman milestones found in the district, there was a large city nearby, the name of which was abbreviated Cen, perhaps for Cenis (LaPorte, 2005, p. 324).  Age  The three jedars of Jabal Lakhdar are believed to be the oldest. Within this group, the relative chronology is now believed known, from study of the stonemasons' marks. The largest, with funerary chambers, known as Jedar A, is the oldest; very soon after, solid Jedar B was constructed by many of the same workmen. The last jedar, C, is believed to have been incomplete when it was very hurriedly finishedperhaps the top was never finished. and its occupant interred, perhaps a generation later. Taking into account the unobtrusive nature of the Christian symbols, it is believed the occupants of these tombs were not themselves Christian but ruled over Christian subjects. Remains of a wooden coffin from Jedar B returned a C14 date of 410 ± 50 CE.Camps stated that this should be adjusted to 490 CE, a claim not repeated in his 1995 article. Calibrating the date on the OxCal system gives a range of 410 - 615 AD at 95.4% probability. A recent re-reading of the dedication from Jedar A has proposed a 4th-century date.Lepelley & Salama (2006). LaPorte (2005) thinks this is too early. The only jedar in the Ternaten group for which dating has been attempted is the largest, Jedar F. Because the latest recycled tombstone bears a date of 494, it may belong to the 6th or 7th century.How much time would have to elapse before a Christian ruler would rob Christian graves to build his own? has been asked in justification for these dates (Cadenat, 1957), but this does not take into account the often violent sectarianism of those times, viz. Arianism and Monophysitism. Unlike the Jabal Lakhdar monuments, its funerary chambers seem to have been built to hold more than one occupant, so it has been proposed that it is dynastic, with the smaller jedars surrounding it those of lesser nobility or rank.  History and archaeology  The earliest known reference to the jedars is in 947, when the Fatimid caliph Ismail al-Mansur was conducting military operations in the Tiaret area. According to a campaign diary that was copied by several later historians such as Idris Imad al-Din and Ibn Khaldun, the caliph was shown the jedars at Jabal Lakhdar and encountered an inscription \\"in the Roman language\\" (presumably in Greek, but also possibly in Latin). Inquiring as to its meaning, he was told that it read \\"I am the strategos Solomon. This city is called Mauretania. The inhabitants of this city have rebelled against the Emperor Justinian and his mother Theodora. Therefore he sent me against them, and I have built this building, so as to commemorate the victory which God has granted me\\". Although Ibn Khaldun lived in the area for a number of years, he made no other reference to the jedars. Beginning in 1842, French military expeditions in the area noted the monuments, resulting in the first archaeological descriptions. Jedar A was opened in a very rough manner Kadra (1983) p. 27. in 1875 by antiquarians who failed to publish their research. In 1882, Professor La Blanchère from Algiers University published a detailed study on the jedars (mostly based on the previous excavations) and attempted to place them in historical context. His identification of them as belonging to the Berber king Massonas mentioned by the 6th-century historian Procopius is not supported today. In the early 1940s, an anthropology student, Dr. Roffo, obtained permission to excavate. In pursuance of this, he used explosives to open Jedar B, from which he obtained a skeleton which was in a wooden coffin in a tomb excavated beneath the building; the same happened with one of the smaller jedars at Ternaten. The whereabouts of these skeletons is unknown (they may lie unrecognised in an Algerian museum) and Dr. Roffo, it is said, burnt most of his notes in a fit of pique after an argument with the Director of Antiquities (who had probably got wind of his methods of 'excavation').LaPorte (2005) p. 328. LaPorte notes that Kadra was able to locate some of Roffo's notes in Algerian archives, which she published in 1985. During the Algerian War of Independence the jedars were closed by the French military who filled in any entrances and laid mines in some places. After the war they were used by a shaman for quasi-Islamic fertility rituals until he was evicted by local authorities. During the years 1968-70, an Algerian studying under Gabriel Camps at the University of Aix-Marseilles, Fatima Kadria Kadra, made the first archaeological study of the jedars to use systematic modern techniques. A book based on her thesis was published by Algiers University in 1983 and remains the definitive reference.Works by Camps and by LaPorte are largely based on her material. Attempts by Camps (1995) to attribute the tombs to known Berber kings such as Mastigas and Garmul are considered speculative.LaPorte (2005) p. 389-390. More recently the oldest of the jedars has been attributed by Lepelley & Salama (2006) to a 4th-century governor from Pontus in Asia Minor, but LaPorte considers this doubtful also. Further work has been discouraged by the unstable situation in Algeria since that time.

Ferguson one of the labour leaders Arrest of the Leaders 15 September 1892 The 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike was a sixteen-week strike which was one of four major strikes that took place between 1889 and 1920 in Broken Hill, NSW, Australia. During the four months from July to November 1892, both local miners and Women's Brigade were active in defending the mines from imported labour using organised direct action methods. The strike collapsed after several strike leaders were arrested and tried for 'unlawful conspiracy and inciting riots', found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment and it became unpracticable for locals to defend the mines from imported labour.Kearns, R.H.B. 1982, The Mines of Broken Hill, Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, p158-159. History Broken Hill developed as a mining town in the arid north-west of New South Wales near the Barrier Ranges after Charles Rasp, then a boundary rider/station hand for the Mount Gipps sheep station studied a 'black craggy hilltop' which he believed to contain black oxide of tin.Kearns, R.H.B. 1982, The Mines of Broken Hill, Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, p47. The first shaft (the Rasp Shaft) was sunk on this hill in January 1885 with the Broken Hill Mining Company formed on 25 April, becoming The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited on 3 June 1885.Kearns, R.H.B, 1982.Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW. It is for this hill (since mined away) that the town is named. The original introduction of unionism in the area was through a meeting at the Adelaide Club Hotel in Silverton on 20 September 1884 with the resolution 'That this meeting deem it advisable to form a Miners' Association, to be called the Barrier Ranges Miners' Association'Laurent, J. Bastion of unionism, Solomon, R. J. (ed) 1988. The Richest Lode: Broken Hill 1883–1988, Hale & Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney, p237. and with the object to form 'a Friendly Society, to afford succor to members who sustained injury as the result of a mining accident.Kearns, R.H.B. 1982, Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p153. Following the adoption of Trade Union Acts throughout Australian states in this decade, a further meeting was held at Silverton on 12 January 1886 where it was decided to reconstitute the organisation as branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association of Australasia.Laurent, J. Bastion of unionism, Solomon, R. J. (ed) 1988. The Richest Lode: Broken Hill 1883–1988, Hale & Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney. The branch was later transferred to Broken Hill where the mining population had grown to 3000. At this time it was estimated that unionists out-numbered non- unionists in the town by a factor of 7:1. Broken Hill's first mining strike occurred in 1889 as a result of the trade union ultimatum that members not be made to work with non-unionised workers. The strike lasted a week and during this time the Women's Brigade was formed. In the following year, in an attempt to achieve 100% unionism for Australian workers, major strikes of the Maritime unions and Shearing unions erupted. While mining shut down as a result of the wharf closures preventing supplies from reaching Broken Hill, the maritime dispute ended in defeat and work resumed at Broken Hill within the month As economic depression threatened Australia in 1892 and the values of silver and lead (mined at Broken Hill) declined, the Broken Hill companies attempted to increase profits through the use of contract workers. This resulted in the 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike as it was a direct breach of the terms of the 1890 trades agreement. The Strike =Conditions= According to Unbroken Spirit, 'Poor living conditions and negligent managerial policy on the mines at Broken Hill fed into a strong union presence from the very early days'.Unions and Politics, Unbroken Spirit, Australian Women's Archives Project, 2009, http://www.womenaustralia.info/exhib/bh/unionspol.html Women and children found life in the mining town harsh, yet fought alongside the miners in favour of the union goals despite the hardship prolonged strikes caused to family welfare. Blainey (1968) states that anxiety ran high in Broken Hill due to the living and working conditions which included the difficulty of mitigating the risk of lead poisoning and the danger of cave-in due to poorly excavated mines.Blainey, G. 1968. The Rise of Broken Hill, Macmillan of Australia, Victoria, p61. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill in the late 1800s to open a steelworks at Newcastle in 1915 was due to the technical difficulty in developing a process to recover value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912–1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, p34. As a result of the delay in establishing this technology, 'huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to 40 ft high'Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912–1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, pp42-43. were left to build up around the town in the hope that an extraction method could be developed. This was not to occur for many years. It was these tailings left in huge piles around the town that added to the toxic dust which caused lead poisoning and pneumoconiosis and added to the concerns of both the miners and their families.Blainey, G. 1968.

This Inquiry was under discussion at the committee on the eve of the strike (Blainey, G. 1968, p88). =Trade Act Clause Overturned= Union president Josiah Thomas had been successful in having radical candidates elected to local Council in an attempt to have the Council Rates paid by the mine owners increased. However, the mine owners were successful in appealing their current rate so that it was actually reduced (p27). Union leaders including Thomas were sacked for being absent on union business at this time and it was felt that an attack on the unions was imminent. This appeared to be confirmed in the following actions of the Mine Managers Association (MMA). 'At a special meeting of the Barrier Ranges Mining Managers' Association (MMA) in the Masonic Hall on 6 May 1892 it was resolved':Laurent, J. Bastion of unionism, Solomon, R. J. (ed) 1988. The Richest Lode: Broken Hill 1883–1988, Hale & Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney, p238. > That clause 4 of the 1890 Agreement (which confirmed the above rates of > wages but provided for a reduction in the working week from 48 hours to 46) > should be struck out of that Agreement, and further, that there should be no > restriction on any work either underground or at the surface. According to Laurent in Solomon (1988), the reason behind overturning this previously agreed-to clause was to take advantage of extra labour from other mines in an effort to offset reductions in profit caused by the slowing of the economy. However Blainey attributes the overturning of the clause without union consultation to an assumption that the miners would prefer to be paid by the amount of ore extracted (and thus retain some influence over their take home pay) than work less hours. Although Blainey does concede that both the miners and mine managers, in his opinion, had stronger cases than indicated in the formal grounds for dispute. Blainey states that the union argued against contract mining on the basis that it had the potential to 'encouraged dangerous practices', penalise the weaker miners and created dissent between the miners through providing conditions where miners could earn greatly varying amounts depending on their abilities. The unions were formally advised that termination of the 1889 and 1890 agreements would occur on 30 July 1892. This led to a 6000 strong meeting at the Central Reserve on 3 July which called for immediate strike action. On 16 August the mining companies issued a statement from Melbourne saying that on the mines would be open to non-union labour from 25 August and both sides became further entrenched within their own positions. =25 August 1892= Fearing an outbreak of violence against the strike-breakers, the mining companies sought and received the support of police in readiness for the opening of the mines. A crowd estimated at 10 000 had organised to be witness to the arrival of the strike-breakers. This included the Women's Brigade who were 'armed with sticks, broom handles and axe handles, set upon any man who attempted to pass through the union picket lines'.Kearns, R.H.B. 1982, Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p155. A street march was also held on the afternoon of the 25th led by Richard Sleath 'and a woman' on horseback which was accompanied by a brass marching band which led back through Argent St to the Central Reserve to receive speeches from several women and union leaders. Orators included Mrs Rogers & Urqhart.Kearns, R.H.B. 1982, Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p157. =Defeat= The first train load of contract workers arrived on 10 September 1892 and were met with violence and hostility from the local men and women. This conflict continued over the coming days and police resistance also escalated at a meeting of the Labour Defence Committee held at the Theatre Royal Hotel with the attendance of 30 police with fixed bayonets.Solomon, R.J. 1988. The Richest Lode:Broken Hill 1883–1988, Hale & Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney, p241. Seven strike leaders were arrested for conspiracy and inciting riot and tried at Deniliquin on 24 October 1892, presided over by judge Alfred Paxton Backhouse. All received sentences with Richard Sleath and Ferguson receiving two years each. The Secretary of the Union, Robert Augustine Hewitt was also arrested and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment. Combined with the continuing influx of contract labour at the mines, the incarceration of the strike leadership and continuing hardship for striking workers resulted in a breakdown of the resistance against the introduction of contract labour.Solomon, R.J. 1988. The Richest Lode:Broken Hill 1883–1988, Hale & Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney. The strike was officially abandoned on 8 November 1892 and the contract labour leading to the strike has remained at Broken Hill mines. Consequences In addition to the introduction of contract miners, the defeat of the strike led to a 10 per cent decrease in wages and a restoration of a 48-hour work week.Blainey, G. 1968. The Rise of Broken Hill, Macmillan of Australia, Victoria, p62. The defeat of the 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike led to a collapse of credibility in the union movement in Broken Hill. Within two years, union membership had fallen from 6000 to 300 and faith in direct action methods also fell. Along with the defeat of the 1890 Australian maritime dispute and the Shearers' Strikes of the 1890s, the defeat of the 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike was seen to lead to a loss of faith in union action alone to defend the interests of the working class. This led to increased electoral support for the Australian Labor Party based on their strong union affiliations. Richard Sleath's imprisonment saw him emerge a martyr in 1893 and saw him elected to the Legislative Assembly for Wilcannia in 1894.

She became a prostitute when she was 15 and Sydney's most extravagant gangster's moll by the time she was 18. She was attracted to, and associated with, many major criminals of the era. On 13 May 1931, stallkeeper Alfred Dillon and gunman Cecil \\"Scotty\\" McCormack came to blows over the attentions of Markham and in the resultant melee, Dillon stabbed McCormack to death.Morton and Lobez, 2007:96.

Taplin was subsequently shot dead later that year. Then in 1940, her first husband, Frank Bowen, was shot and killed in Kings Cross In 1943, Markham relocated to Queensland's Gold Coast to take advantage of the influx of American GIs. When picked up for vagrancy by local police, she protested that she lived with her current de facto husband, Arthur Williams, and that while he gave her money and groceries, she was not involved in the local sex industry at that time, and was not aware of Williams' involvement in the sly-grog or bootleg alcohol distribution networks that flouted wartime beer and spirits rationing mandates.

Charges were later dropped when another pair of local gunmen, Charles Martin and George Barrett, were charged with an attack on Hull, but also acquitted a month later.Morton and Lobez, 2007: 128 On 25 September 1951, Markham was shot in the hip at a wild party that turned violent in St Kilda, Victoria. Her then boyfriend, Gavin Walsh was shot and killed at the same party. Three months later, while still recovering from the shooting, she married Leonard \\"Redda\\" Lewis, who was later shot in Melbourne on 22 April 1952. They didn't live together again and were later divorced. Markham faced Central Police Court for soliciting one final time in 1957 before retiring from prostitution. In January 1959, Markham stood before a special Federal Court on a charge of not having filed a tax return for 1957. She was found guilty and fined £50 with £1 costs. Later years Markham married Martin Rooney in 1972 in Sydney (according to her death certificate), and gave up her criminal career.

It is the only remaining free-flowing water course feeding into the lake, and the second-largest natural source for the lake. Most of the land surrounding the stream is either publicly owned or under conservation easements restricting development. The lower part of the stream remains in a largely natural state, and efforts are underway to restore the upper part of the stream to a more natural state. Description A swimming hole. The name Fisheating Creek is derived from the Seminole name for the stream recorded on a military map of 1839, Thlothlopopka-Hatchee, which is translated as \\"the river where fish are eaten\\".Lodge:196 Fisheating Creek is between and long. It flows southward through an area called the Cypress Swamp in the southwestern part of Highlands County and into Glades County, where it turns eastward about north of County Road 731 and flows about to Lake Okeechobee. The stream spreads out into Cowbone Marsh for the last before entering the lake.Lodge:107 Fisheating Creek is the second-largest natural source of water for Lake Okeechobee (behind the Kissimmee River), supplying close to 9% of the water flowing into the lake.Boning:196 (large PDF file, may be low to load) Fisheating Creek originally arose in a series of perennial marshes in Highlands County west of Lake Placid. Each marsh overflowed into another, slightly lower marsh until Fisheating Creek emerged. In the 20th century ditches and a canal drained the marshes, which were converted into agricultural land. In 2010 the United States Department of Agriculture purchased a conservation easement on in Highlands County south of State Road 70, and plans to restore the land in the easement area to marshes. Fisheating Creek flows through a landscape of prairies, both dry and wet, flatwoods, freshwater marshes, hammocks, bottomland forests, and floodplain swamps. Human activity has introduced improved pastures, and eucalyptus and pine plantations. In 1842 Fisheating Creek was described as a large stream in the dry season, varying in width from a river to a brook, and very \\"tortuous\\".Preble:32 Lake Okeechobee has been artificially maintained at a lower level than prevailed before the 20th century, with the result that much of Cowbone Marsh has been drained and converted to agricultural land. Lake Okeechobee has been almost completely enclosed by the Herbert Hoover Dike. The only gap in the dike is at Fisheating Creek, where the dike turns inland and parallels the stream on both sides for several miles, leaving Fisheating Creek as the only remaining free-flowing tributary of Lake Okeechobee.Lodge:113 The Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail runs across the Herbert Hoover Dike. The stream lies almost entirely within the Fisheating Creek Wildlife Management Area. The only populated places near Fisheating Creek are the small communities of Palmdale, near where U.S. Route 27 crosses the stream, and Lakeport, near the mouth of the stream on Lake Okeechobee. Twenty-seven rare species live in the Fisheating Creek watershed. Preservation of the Fisheating Creek ecosystem is considered critical to the long-term welfare of Florida panthers, black bears, swallow-tailed kites, whooping cranes, sandhill cranes, crested caracaras and other species History The area around Fisheating Creek was occupied by people of the Belle Glade culture from as early as 1000 BCE. There are many archaeological sites from that period in the area, the best known of which is Fort Center, which was occupied from before 450 BCE until about 1700. \\"Fort Center\\", a palisade of cabbage-palm trunks named for United States Army Lieutenant J. P. Center, was built on the banks of Fisheating Creek during the Second Seminole War (1835-1843) (the archaeological site is named after the Seminole War fort). In 1842, a reconnaissance party of 83 sailors and marines (along with a Seminole guide and his wife and child) led by United States Navy Lieutenant John Rodgers traveled in 16 dugout canoes from Key Biscayne through the Everglades, across Lake Okeechobee and up both the Kissimmee River to Lake Tohopekaliga, and Fisheating Creek to the head of the open stream, before returning to Key Biscayne. Fort Center had been abandoned by then, and the expedition had to repair the palisade when they occupied it for a few days. The expedition found evidence that Seminoles had been living in the area of Fisheating Creek, but did not encounter any in the course of the 60-day expedition.Preble:33, 39-42 Fort Center was reactivated during the Third Seminole War (1853–55) as a station on a military road from Fort Myers to Fort Jupiter, with part of the route using canoes to cross Lake Okeechobee.Hanna:63 A survey in 1881 found that Fisheating Creek was one of five main areas in Florida occupied by Seminoles.Hanna:328 Non-Indian settlement began impinging on the area in the 20th century. Lakeport, near the mouth of Fisheating Creek, was founded in 1915.Hanna:251 Increasing development around Fisheating Creek had forced the Seminoles out of most of the area by 1930. The Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation, established in 1935,Hanna:334 is in Glades County adjacent to Fisheating Creek. Modern history Near a railroad bridge. Lykes Brothers, Inc. acquired the land around Fisheating Creek early in the 20th century and used it as largely unimproved cattle range. The company owned 67% of the land in Glades County. For many years Lykes Brothers allowed public access to fisheating Creek and the land around the Creek, including a waterfront park, campground, and canoe concession at Palmdale and open to hunting in a Game Management Area leased to the state of Florida. Lykes Brothers began closing public access to its land along Fisheating Creek in the 1980s, apparently in response to increased vandalism and poaching. Lykes Brothers did not renew the state's lease on the Wildlife Management Area in 1987, instead leasing the land to a private company that charged fees for hunting rights on the land. In 1989 Lykes closed the waterside park, campground, and canoe concession, and erected fences and gates to block access to land formerly open to the public. Lykes also placed logs and other obstructions in Fisheating Creek to block access by boats. In March 1989 residents of Glades County broke open a gate that Lykes Brothers had placed on an old road to block access to Fisheating Creek. The Glades County Commission then ordered the gate and nearby fence to be bulldozed, claiming that the land in question belonged to the county. Lykes Brothers then sued the county. The legal fight soon settled on the question of whether or not Fisheating Creek was a navigable waterway. If the stream was navigable, then its bed, up to the high water mark, belonged to Florida. A court decided in 1998 that the stream was navigable, and therefore belonged to the state. Lykes Brothers prepared to appeal the decision, but a settlement to end litigation was agreed to by Florida and Lykes Brothers. As part of the settlement Florida paid $46.4 million to Lykes Brothers to purchase along the stream, which became the Fisheating Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA). The state also bought a conservation easement on another of Lykes Brothers land. The settlement also calls on the state to maintain a navigation channel in Fisheating Creek from Lake Okeechobee to the U. S. Route 27 bridge at Palmdale. Motor vehicles and jet-powered watercraft are prohibited from the WMA, and airboats are banned from parts of Cowbone Marsh. Hunting is limited in the WMA.

Early life Montgomery-Moore was born in Chicopee, Massachusetts in 1899, to Alexander Acheson Montgomery-Moore, who was born in Cork, Ireland and moved to the United States in 1890, and Lillian Webber Montgomery-Moore, born in New Hampshire.

He was given leave to travel to Canada to join the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), air wing of the British Army, one of twenty or so Bermudians who did so during that war, and was discharged from the BVRC effective 7 August 1917, the date he began service in the RFC. He was one of two Bermudian airmen to earn the Distinguished Flying Cross during the war (the other being Rowe Spurling). On 1 April 1918, Lieutenant Montgomery-Moore, along with the rest of the RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), became part of the new Royal Air Force, from which he was discharged on 5 May 1919. Between the Wars Bermuda Volunteer Engineers, 1934. Lieutenant Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC, in front row, third from left Following the First World War, Montgomery-Moore returned to Bermuda. In 1931, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers (BVE) was created as a replacement for the departed regular Royal Engineers Fortress Company of the Bermuda Garrison (that guarded the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda). The original role of the BVE was to operate the search lights at coastal artillery batteries, notably the Examination Battery at St. David's Head, the guns of which were manned by the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA). The BVE subsequently also took on responsibility for providing signals crew and equipment to all elements of the garrison. The first commanding officer of the BVE was Captain H.D. (later Sir Harry) Butterfield, and Lieutenant Montgomery-Moore (who began service with the BVE on 12 February 1931) was second-in-command. In 1932, Butterfield retired, and Montgomery-Moore succeeded him. The new 2-i-c was Lieutenant Bayard Dill (later Sir Bayard), whose father, Colonel Thomas Melville Dill, was a former commander of the BMA. Second World War The BVE, like the other part-time units, was mobilised at the start of the Second World War, fulfilling its role to the Garrison throughout the war. Some members also were detached for service overseas with other units. These included four Sappers who were attached to a larger BVRC contingent despatched to the Lincolnshire Regiment in June 1940, and Captain Richard Gorham, who served in Italy, earning a Distinguished Flying Cross for his decisive role in the Battle of Monte Cassino. In Bermuda, Montgomery-Moore was promoted to Major in 1940, and Bayard Dill to Captain. In addition to his role with the BVE, Montgomery-Moore also headed the Bermuda Flying School, which trained 80 local volunteers as pilots for the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm. Volunteers were only accepted from those already serving in the local forces, some of whom came from the BVE. After 1942, with the RAF having a glut of trained pilots, the school converted into the Bermuda Flying Committee, a recruiting arm for the Royal Canadian Air Force, to which it sent sixty aircrew trainees, as well as twenty-two women to train for ground roles. The BFC was administered by Montgomery-Moore, as well as Bertram Work and others previously associated with the BFS. Montgomery- Moore had been dispatched to Canada to make arrangements for it to send its aircrew candidates, and he received a commendation from the RCAF at the end of the war for his efforts. Post-War The BVE was demobilised in 1946, as were the other three territorials and the Home Guard. The BVRC and the BMA maintained skeleton command structures until they began recruiting again in 1951. The BVE, however, with its two main roles becoming obsolete, was disbanded completely. Montgomery-Moore was discharged on 25 January 1946, and returned to civilian life, eventually settling in Connecticut, where he died in 1970. Peter Kilduff posthumously published Montgomery-Moore's memoirs as That's My Bloody Plane. His wife, Hélène, gave gifts to Columbia University in New York, and funded the Mrs. Cecil Montgomery-Moore Scholarship for journalism, in memory of Alice Weel BigartAlice Weel Bigart was the wife of reporter Homer Bigart.

Early life Artés was born in Reus, in Catalonia, region of Spain on October 9, 1813, but he moved to Cuba in 1828 to evading military service. Forced to enlist, he joined the band of one of the battalions based in Havana. Career Once he graduated, he found employment doing tenor roles in an opera company that made its performances at the Teatro Tacón. He toured in Puerto Rico by 1840, then returned to Cuba, where he lived. Later he joined the opera company of Stefano Busatti, that finally led him to Puerto Rico in 1860. When the company disappeared he moved to Mayagüez. In Mayagüez he founded a new company of comedies: Compañía Dramática Astol (The Astol Drama Company). Fèlix Astol, was author of several pieces of popular music, but his most famous work was the dance Bellísima trigueña (Georgeus brunette), composed in 1867. Conceived as a love song, it has had several versions throughout Latin America. In Cuba had the title of Mi amor (My love). In Brazil it was named Encantadora infancia (Lovely childhood). In Peru has two versions, one of them is named Bellísima peruana (Georgeus Peruvian). In Haiti is danced and in Venezuela is well known too. But the most popular version is \\"La Borinqueña\\", adopted as the official anthem of Puerto Rico. The revolutionary lyrics written by Lola Rodíguez de Tió a year after the composition of the danza, became the popular anthem. It was a time of great turbulence in Puerto Rico, as a nationalist revolution against Spain was sweeping across the political landscape. The lyrics were in keeping with that spirit. However, the lyrics known and sung today are attributed to Manuel Fernández Juncos per the request of the new Commonwealth, as Lola's were yet again deemed too revolutionary. He died in Mayagüez on January 21, 1901.  References   Bibliography  * Félix Astol Borinquen (La Borinqueña), danza, y aguinaldos populares del folklore de Puerto Rico.

It is a political satire in the form of a radio play featuring characters that portray the ministers and shadow ministers of the Australian parliament.  Background  The program is currently produced by Triffique Productions, Director and head Writer Doug Edwards and stars Keith Scott and Robyn Moore, who portray the male and female characters, respectively. Each episode lasts two minutes and takes the form of a dialogue between Australian political figures,http://www.cactus.com.au/script4542.htm although the show frequently lampoons other topical subjects, such as sports (particularly cricket)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-iF09EhFOQ and well- known television advertisements. Daily episodes can be downloaded @  History  The program commenced in 1986 during the tenure of the Labor Hawke Government in Australia, and featured Bob Hawke as its main character, although the program usually referred to him as \\"King Bonza the Charismatic\\" - a reflection of Hawke's larrikin image and populist appeal. The title of the show is taken from the family saga movie about Welsh life How Green Was My Valley and is a reference to the dramatic, soap-opera elements that frequently characterise Australian political life. The program is the longest-running radio serial in Australian history (passing the ABC radio drama Blue Hills, which ran for twenty-seven years) and is the longest-running radio serial still being broadcast in Australia today.  Syndication  The program is carried on over fifty radio stations nationally.http://www.cactus.com.au/radio.htm Typically it is broadcast by smaller adult contemporary radio stations, who unlike larger FM stations may not have the resources to produce their own in-house variety programs for the morning and evening drive timeslots. Consequently, those syndicated stations often play the program twice during the day, both in the morning and in the evening.

She is currently the T.Z. and Irmgard Chu Distinguished Chair in Chemistry at University of California, Berkeley. She was formerly the Sterling Professor of Chemistry at Yale University. Early life and education Alanna Schepartz was born on January 9, 1962, in New York City and was raised in Rego Park, Queens. She graduated from Forest Hills High School in 1978 at the age of 16. She then earned a B.S. degree in Chemistry from the State University of New York, Albany and a PhD degree in Organic Chemistry from Columbia University, where she worked under the supervision of Ronald Breslow. Following an N.I.H. postdoctoral fellowship with Peter Dervan at the California Institute of Technology, she joined the faculty at Yale University in July 1988. Yale career Schepartz joined the faculty at Yale University in July 1988. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1992, to Full Professor with tenure in 1995, and was named the Milton Harris, '29 PhD Professor of Chemistry in 2000. In 2001, she was named a Professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. From 2002-2007, she held a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professorship. In 2017, she was named a Sterling Professor, Yale's highest faculty honor. Schepartz is the first woman to be granted tenure in Yale's Department of Chemistry, and the first female Full Professor in any physical sciences department at Yale. Field of study Schepartz works in the field known as chemical biology. Her laboratory is well known for the creative application of chemical principles to understand and control biological recognition and function. Her research has guided thinking in multiple areas of chemical biology, including the understanding of how specificity is achieved during protein-DNA and protein- protein recognition processes; how to design molecules (\\"miniature proteins\\") that function as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions; how these molecules can be engineered to reach the cell cytosol intact and with high efficiency; and the development of β-peptides as protein ligands and as building blocks of protein-like architectures. The development of β-peptide bundles was cited by Chemical and Engineering News, a weekly news magazine of the chemical world, as one of 2007's “most important research advances”. In 2017, Schepartz was appointed by Yale as Sterling Professor of Chemistry. In 2019 she joined UC Berkeley College of Chemistry. Schepartz Laboratory Schepartz is the Principal Investigator at the Schepartz Laboratory of Chemical Biology. According to the Schepartz Laboratory Website, the laboratory \\"develops chemical tools to study and manipulate protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions inside the cell. Our approach centers on the design of molecules that nature did not synthesize—miniature proteins, β-peptide foldamers, polyproline hairpins, and proto-fluorescent ligands—and the use of these molecules to answer biological questions that would otherwise be nearly impossible to address. Current topics include the use of miniature proteins to identify the functional role of discrete protein-protein interactions and rewire cellular circuits, the use of cell permeable molecules to image misfolded proteins or protein interactions in live cells, and the design of protein-like assemblies of β-peptides that are entirely devoid of α-amino acids.\\" Achievements In 1990, Schepartz was awarded a David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship. In 1991, Schepartz earned an Eli Lilly Biochemistry Fellowship, a Morse Faculty Fellowship from Yale, and a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award. In 1993, she earned a Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, and in 1994 received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. Schepartz received an A.C.S. Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award in 1995 and an A.C.S. Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry in 1997. In 1999, she received the Dylan Hixon ’88 Award for Teaching Excellence in the Natural Sciences, and in 2002, she was awarded the Agnes Fay Morgan Research Award. In 2008, she was awarded the Frank H. Westheimer Prize Medal from Harvard University. In 2012, she was awarded the Ronald Breslow Award for Achievement in Biomimetic Chemistry. Throughout her career she has also been invited to be a distinguished guest speaker and lecturer. In 2014, she was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences.

The series was serialized in Hakusensha Shōjo monthly magazine Hana To Yume and the serial chapters collected into fifteen Tankōbon released between July 2005 and November 2009. Publishing companies Tokyopop licensed the manga for release in America and as well Sharp Point Press in Taiwan.  Plot  Uru Takamura is a naive and cheerful girl who is often mistaken as an elementary school student because of her short height. After her mother got remarried, she took a part-time job at a small cafe called Cafe Bonheur. There she meets co-workers Satsuki Shindou a pâtissier who rarely smiles but is actually very kind and Ichirou Nishikawa who falls asleep instantly when he's hungry. Even though they're scary and weird at first glance, something inside them will change as they meet Uru and feelings of love will develop as Uru works hard to bring and show them happiness once again.  Characters  ; :A 16-year-old, second-year high school student with childish looks (she greatly resembles her mother) and very short height but possessing superhuman strength. Working part-time as a waitress at Cafe Bonheur, she went to live on her own after her mother got remarried in order to give the new couple some space. She was secretly lonely and unhappy with living alone, and at first considered moving back. However, after some encouraging words from Shindou, she decided to patch things up with her parents, and has since kept into contact with and sustained a good relationship with them. She is very naive and perky and always puts the happiness of others before her. She is rather oblivious and is unaware that many of her male friends have romantic feelings for her. She believes that a name is the second most important thing that a person has, next to their body, by their parents and must therefore be cherished. This phrase is later revealed to have come from her father, who is shown in her flashbacks to have been a very kind person who often wore kimonos and was the one to have named her Uru, as he wanted her to grow up to be the type of person who could instantly replenish anyone who felt down or drained. Even though she is happy for her mother, she actually wonders about and longs for her father, who died when she was young. She then finds out that she is the reason behind the death of her father. :She is kind of a dense girl since it took her almost the whole series to realize her feelings for Satsuki, because both Ichirou and Mitsuka messed with her. In the final chapter she confessed that the person she loves is in front of her (which was Satsuki), and waited for him for three years (while he went to France). ; :A 20-year-old patissier who graduated from school at the age of 15. He always has a displeased, almost yakuza look on his face. He easily loses his temper and is rather unsociable. He was raised by the café manager Nankichi Matsumoto after being abandoned by his mother at a young age. He is very independent and shown to be scared of being alone, due to his mother's abandonment. However, he feels he has no choice but to accept that he will always be alone and thus chooses not to show his feelings or emotions to others as he does not want to burden them. As the story develops, he begins to open up due to Uru's support and her optimistic and comforting personality. He deeply respects Nankichi and sees him as a father figure. He does not drink or smoke, as he had taken after Nankichi's influence. He is terrified of spiders and dislikes crowds. He loves baking because he likes to see the smiles from the faces of the customers. As a child, he believed Nankichi had performed magic whenever he baked. Even though he always scorns at Uru and Ichirou, he is actually a very caring person. :He realized his feelings for Uru after Sou confessed to her, but still had to go to France to learn more about sweets and came back after three years. ; :An eccentric 18-year-old high school student who works as a waiter at Cafe Bonheur and the love rival of Shindou. He is often referred to as a weirdo and is always seen dozing-off when hungry. The only way to wake him up is to feed him food. He tends to have a misleading way of speaking, such as when he said \\"Hello father-in-law\\" to Uru's stepfather, when he meant to say \\"Hello stepfather\\" and calling his housekeeper cocoa-san once when he wanted him to make him cocoa for him. He is repeating his third year in high school solely because he sleeps in most of his classes. He always shows zero interest in everything around him but he actually enjoys playing along with Uru and is a good artist. His father is a doctor and his mother is a designer for children's outfits. His family has a male housekeeper who has been employed with his family since he was in kindergarten. In chapter 15, it is revealed that as a child, he would often fall asleep at the dinner table waiting up for his parents to come home to have dinner with him. Curious as to what Ichirou's reaction would be and in order to wake him up, his mother would shove food in his mouth. Because she did this for several days in a row, Ichirou's eccentric habit of falling asleep when he is hungry and waking up when he is fed developed. He initially has curly hair until he has it cut and has straight hair in chapter 23. He began working in Happy cafe around his first year in high school as Shindou realized his purpose in attracting female customers with his looks in exchange for a cake a day and grew to believe that Happy Cafe gave him something he wanted to do. :He loves Uru so much that he still stick with her even after three years; since, they are in the same university. ; :The manager of Cafe Bonheur and the foster father of Shindou who had been mentioned throughout the manga but did not appear until chapter 23. Unlike Shindou, he is very perky, is fond of making jokes, and cries easily as he is very emotional. A running gag throughout the series is that he has weak joints and no sense of direction. According to Shindou, he does not smoke or drink. Despite his looks, he can be a very shrewd person. He is very caring and understanding towards Shindou. He desperately wishes for Shindou to call him \\"Father\\" but believes Shindou doesn't (and won't change his last name) because he is still waiting for his biological family. He believes Shindou does not see him as his real family. However, Shindou later explains that he did not call him Father because the people around them looked down upon Nankichi because he had adopted Shindou at such a young age and did not want people to belittle Nankichi because of this. He hopes that Uru will marry Shindou and become his daughter-in-law. ; :Kashiwa's younger brother. He is a first-year high school student who helps run bohneur's rival shop, 'Abeekawa Japanese Sweets' along with his brother. He is kind of shy; because of that he often behaves in a surly fashion. However, in front of customers, he fawns a business smile and acts nice and politely towards his customers. Uru tends to call him a monkey face and at first dislikes his seemingly mean disposition, but grows to consider him a friend. Originally, the Abekawa brothers didn't like Bonheur and its staff because they feel their little sister likes the shop better than their own. However, they eventually come to realize that the Bohneur staff (Uru in particular) aren't as bad as they seem. He has a particular hatred for Ichirou because when Sou was three (and Ichirou was six), Sou fell in love with Ichirou at first sight, not realizing he was a guy (he didn't notice Ichirou was wearing pants) and asked him to be his girlfriend, only for Ichirou to bluntly reject him by saying he was a guy. Sou often complains that his first love experience was traumatic and wasted. Sou also develops a crush on Uru. ; :Sou's older brother, whom he deeply respects (aside from his flirtatious ways). He's a third-year high school student and has a huge sister complex on his sister Sakura. This caused him to hate Happy Cafe as he believed they stole his sister from them because she loved to go eat cakes at Happy Cafe, along with most of their female customers and waged a competition against them. However, he eventually develops a truce with them and grows to respect the Happy Cafe employees. He is also aware of Sou's crush on Uru and has attempted to advance their relationship. Kashiwa tends to be a little more laid back than his brother. He is a big flirt. ; :She is the youngest of the Abekawa siblings. Sakura is very cheerful and sweet and loves strawberry deserts. She often plays with Uru in the café and is also close friend with Ichirou's younger brother Jirou. It is revealed that she is actually Sou's and Kashiwa's half-sister, since their real mother died when Sou was one and Kashiwa was three. Their father remarried shortly afterwards. However, despite knowing this, her older brothers still love her and their stepmother as if they were a genuine family and vice versa. A running gag in the story is that whenever Sakura and Uru see each other, they perform unusual gymnastic poses together. ; :The younger brother of Ichirou. He is classmates with Sakura and is good friends with her. His mother loves dressing him up as a girl. He is also very attached to his big brother, but he doesn't like Uru as much. However, later into the manga, where he \\"approves\\" of Uru as a potential bride for Ichirou. He has a weak body and is thus susceptible to illness and fatigue, and is not allowed to play with the other kids because of his weak body, with the exception of Sakura. ; :A 15 year old upcoming model and middle schooler (despite her tall height and mature beauty) who debuted in chapter 4. She is incredibly beautiful and described as cutie honey by Uru when she first met her; however, after her father told her not to waste time being a model and to marry the son of a patron company's president in order to further his own success, she decided to run away from home. She later ran into Uru after Uru saved her from some guys hitting on her. Shortly afterwards, she arrived at Cafe Happy where she worked temporarily attracting male customers. However, after Uru learns of her running away from home, she helps Mitsuka confront her father regarding his desire to have her married to someone she doesn't want, and he agrees to let her model and not marry someone she does not want to, on the condition that she return home and keep up her good grades. Since then, she has become a regular customer at happy cafe, and has become great friends with Uru, often visiting her in the shop and texting her messages that tease her about her growing romance with Shindou (she appears to understand they are developing feelings for each other). She also has an unusually large sweet tooth for a model, eating four slices of cake as \\"starters\\". Mitsuka resembles her mother but has the same personality as her father. It is shown in chapter 18 that her bodyguard/chauffeur Suzuki(who is nine years older and was adopted by her family after he ran away from her father's abuse) has feelings for her, which she seems to reciprocate. ; :Uru's sixth grade cousin from her father's side (he is the son of the sister of Uru's biological father) who resembles her and has had a crush on her since he was young. The two would often spend time together as little children as their mothers went on errands together, and Uru's kindness and gentleness caused him to fall in love with her. He dislikes Uru's closeness to the Happy cafe's employees, as he believes he should be closer to her since he has known her longer. When he tells Shindou that he knows he will laugh at him because of his crush on Uru despite his age, Shindou reprimands him by saying nothing is funny about liking someone, and appears to hold a grudging respect towards him. Despite clearly conveying his feelings to Uru by handing her cookies after saying he wanted to give something to the person he liked, Uru believes this means that he has accepted her as his sister. His classmate, a half Japanese-American girl named Chiyogami Tsukishiro with a fear of men from repeated bullying from the past, has a crush on him because he defended her from some bullies who made fun of her for her American heritage, but he remains oblivious to her feelings, in a similar fashion to how Uru is oblivious to his feelings for her. Media =Manga= =Drama CD= A drama CD was released on January 25, 2007 by Marine Entertainment under the same title, and a second was released on October 24, 2007. Akemi Kanda, Kousuke Toriumi and Noriaki Sugiyama were the voice actors of Uru, Shindou and Ichirou. The plot of the second CD includes the three of them going to a theme park and entering a haunted house. Reception Johanna Draper Carlson felt that the series quickly began to settle into telling \\"standard stories\\" for the genre, and criticised the character designs as looking as though Uru and the men of the cafe are from different series. Carlo Santos described the second volume as \\"halfhearted\\", later appreciating that although the story is a fantasy about an ordinary girl being surrounded by hot guys, that the series is a balance of humour and character development. He notes that sometimes romantic cliches are deployed, though, and that the art is mediocre. Katherine Dacey describes the author's artistic strength as being her facial expressions. Steffi MC describes the manga as not being \\"sickeningly sweet\\" or melodramatic, and feels the artwork is inconsistent, which she attributes to this being the author's maiden work. Jon Morse writes \\"The story development isn't particularly special, but this is completely overlooked by the laugh-out-loud comedy that fills the pages. It's an excellent read if you're not a total snob about how a shojo manga operates. I call this work a pioneer!\\" References  Further reading    External links  * Tokyopop titles Sharp Point Press titles Hakusensha manga 2005 manga Shōjo manga ","title":"Happy Cafe"},{"id":"31483276","text":"The Huntsman Marine Science Centre (acronym: HMSC; previously Huntsman Marine Laboratory) is located on Lower Campus Road in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada.

It signals a belief that, in literate society, young children—even one- and two- year-olds—are in the process of becoming literate. Through the support of parents, caregivers, and educators, a child can successfully progress from emergent to conventional reading. The basic components of emergent literacy include: * Print motivation: Being interested in and enjoying books. * Vocabulary: Knowing the names of things. * Print awareness: Noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page. * Narrative skills: Being able to describe things and events and to tell stories. * Letter knowledge: Understanding letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere. * Phonological awareness: Being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words. Emergent literacy is of critical importance in early education in light of research showing that children learn skills that prepare them to read years before they start school. History Traditionally, society has considered reading and writing in their formalistic senses, and viewed children as being knowledgeable about literacy only when they were capable of identifying written words without picture clues, and spelling words that adults could read. In 1966, New Zealand researcher Marie Clay introduced the concept of emergent reading, using it to describe the earliest behaviors and concepts young children employ in interacting with books even before they are capable of reading in the conventional sense. The 1970s and early 1980s saw robust research activity in children's early language development, early childhood education, and reexamination of the concept of reading readiness. This work resulted in Teale and Sulzby assembling a book authored by various leading researchers of the time that proposed reconceptualizing what happens from birth to the time when children reading and write conventionally as a period of emergent literacy. Since then, an extensive body of research has expanded the concept, illuminating that a child's literacy development begins well before formal introduction in school, and can be influenced by social interactions with adults, exposure to literacy materials, and the use of engaged learning activities. While the concept of reading readiness suggested that there was a specific point in time after which children were ready to learn to read and write, Clay's notion of emergent literacy suggested that there were continuities in children's literacy development between early literacy behaviors and those displayed once children could read independently. Clay also emphasized the importance of the relationship between writing and reading in early literacy development. Until then, it was believed that children must learn to read before they could learn to write.  Emergent literacy skills  = Print motivation = This component relates to a child's interest in and enjoyment of books. A child with print motivation might enjoy being read to, playing with books, pretending to write, and going to the library. Children who enjoy books are more likely to want to read, and to keep trying, even when it is hard. = Vocabulary = The component \\"vocabulary\\" relates to the knowing of the names of things. Children with rich vocabularies are at a tremendous educational advantage, since studies show that vocabulary is the best predictor of reading comprehension at the end of second and third grades and is otherwise linked to overall academic achievement. = Print awareness = This component relates to noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page. It includes knowing that books are organized from left to right, the words are read from left to right and top to bottom, and how to tell words from letters. These skills are invaluable to a child's literacy development because without these skills, a child will have difficulty learning how to read and write. = Narrative skills = This component relates to the ability to describe things and events and to tell stories. = Letter knowledge = This component relates to the understanding that letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere. = Phonological awareness = This component relates to being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words. It involves rhyme recognition, syllables, onset, and rime. Types of phonological awareness include: phonemic awareness, syllable awareness, word awareness, and sentence awareness.  Lessons and activities  Emergent literacy lessons may focus on one emergent literacy skill or blend them. Below are examples of emerging literacy games and activities that each focus primarily on one emergent literacy skill. Building vocabulary Sorting games can help children build vocabulary skills by asking them to identify defining characteristics of the items being sorted. Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by Kansas University, suggests a shoe sorting game in which each child takes off one of his or her shoes. The children work together to sort the shoes by different characteristics, thus building vocabulary related to color, types of fasteners (buckle, velcro), shoe type (sandal, gym shoe), etc. This activity could work with other objects such as legos and pasta. The full activity is available online. The Hanen Centre outlines another strategy for teaching vocabulary to promote emergent literacy. Letter recognition Letter recognition games help children learn the letters of the alphabet. In one simple game, the teacher writes each letter of the alphabet on a separate notecard and passes them out to students. The students then have to arrange themselves in alphabetical order. This game is provided by Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by the University of Kansas, and is available online. Phonological awareness One type of phonological awareness game involves rhyming, which helps children identify similar sounds in words. In one rhyming game, the teacher can present three different \\"consonant-vowel-consonant\\" words and ask children which word does not rhyme. For example, cat, log, and dog. The full activity and other similar rhyming activities are available online. Other activities include: songs and chants; word play, games, rhymes and riddles; Storybooks, poetry, nursery rhymes, Dr. Seuss; Oral Storytelling; Clapping, jumping, manipulating letters, blocks. Everything should be playful, engaging, interactive, social, deliberate, and purposeful, stimulate curiosity, and encourage experimentation with language and comprehensive language and literacy programs. Print motivation Since print motivation involves a child's interest and enjoyment of books, there are a variety of activities that parents and teachers can share with children to help promote print motivation. Examples include: * Read often and make it enjoyable * Read when you and the child are in a good mood, so the experience is a positive one * Change your voice when you read aloud * Keep books accessible to children * Stop reading when a child becomes tired or loses interest Print motivation tips adapted from the Loudon County Public Library. Print awareness Print awareness is a child's understanding of the parts of a book and how a book works. The State Library of Louisiana suggests an activity in which a child shares the parts of a book with an adult. For example, the teacher or parent could ask the child to point out different parts of the book and its contents, such as the front cover; the title; the first line of the book; a word; a letter; and the back cover. George Mason University suggests additional family activities. These include: Make a book with your children. You might include familiar photographs with labels under each photo, or children might illustrate the book by themselves. Parents could write the words as the children dictate the story. Or, when going out to a restaurant, show the menu to your children and point to the words as you read to them. Let them choose what they want to eat and make it an interactive experience. This will help children understand how print is connected to real life. Additional activities can be found online. Narrative skills Children can build narrative skills by describing something that happened to him or her, even something as simple as taking a bath. Parents and teachers can promote narrative skills by prompting children for further detail. Other activities to promote narrative skills in both babies and toddlers are available from the Loudon County Library.

Fossils have been found from deposits in the Chinle Formation, which is latest Triassic in age. While theropods had diversified into several specialized groups by this time, Daemonosaurus is likely a very basal theropod (if one at all), and lies outside the clade Neotheropoda. Daemonosaurus is unusual among putative early theropods in that it had a short skull with long protruding teeth. Discovery The Whitaker Quarry of Ghost Ranch as it appears in 2019. Daemonosaurus is known from a single fossil, the holotype CM 76821, which consists of a skull, mandibles, an atlas bone, an axis bone, other neck vertebrae, and rib fragments. This specimen was discovered in a sediment block collected from the Coelophysis Quarry (also known as the Whitaker quarry) at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico. This site is famous for abundant fossils of Coelophysis, an early theropod. C-4-81, the block containing CM 76821, was collected in the early 1980s by E.H. Colbert and is now housed in the collection of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Fossils of Coelophysis were also present in the block. CM 76821 was first uncovered by a volunteer preparing the block while it was on loan to State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. Daemonosaurus was named by Hans-Dieter Sues, Sterling J. Nesbitt, David S. Berman and Amy C. Henrici in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2011 and the type species is Daemonosaurus chauliodus. The generic name Daemonosaurus is derived from the Greek words \\"daimon\\" (δαίμων) meaning \\"demon\\" and \\"sauros\\" (σαύρα) meaning \\"reptile\\". The specific name is derived from the Greek word \\"chauliodous\\" (χαυλιόδους) meaning \\"prominent toothed\\", which is in reference to its procumbent front teeth. Description Life restoration Based on the proportions of related theropods, Daemonosaurus is estimated to have been around 1.5 m (5 feet) long. Other estimates suggest that Daemonosaurus was at most long and weighed . The skull of Daemonosaurus differs considerably from all other Triassic theropods. The snout is short and bears large premaxillary and maxillary teeth in the upper jaw. Procumbent teeth project forward from the tips of the upper and lower jaws, which is highlighted in the species name chauliodis that roughly means \\"buck-toothed\\". Daemonosaurus is unique among Triassic theropods because it has an unusually short snout, and all other early theropods had long heads and jaws. Like the coelophysoids, Daemonosaurus has a kink in its upper jaws, between the maxilla and the premaxilla. The proportionately large orbit, the short snout, and the apparent lack of fusion between the bones of the braincase suggest that the holotype specimen CM 76821 may be an example of a juvenile dinosaur. On the other hand, the closure (fusion) of the neurocentral sutures in the vertebrae suggest a mature individual. According to Sues et al. (2011), Daemonosaurus can be distinguished based on the following features: the skull is proportionately deep and narrow, with a short antorbital region. The antorbital fenestra is nearly the same size as the external naris (possible autapomorphy). The long posterior process of the premaxilla almost contacts the anterior process of the lacrimal bone (possible autapomorphy). The ventral process of the lacrimal bone has a slender posterior projection extending along anterodorsal margin of the jugal bone. The jugal is dorsoventrally deep and has a prominent lateral ridge; and the alveolar margin of the dentary is downturned at the symphysis. The postorbital with anterolateral overhang over the orbit; and the prefrontal is large and occupies about 50% of the dorsal margin of the orbit. The first two dentary teeth are large and procumbent; and the premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth are much enlarged relative to the posterior maxillary teeth. The third cervical vertebra has a deep, rimmed, ovoid pleurocoels on the anterolateral surfaces of both the centrum and the neural arch. Classification Daemonosaurus is typically considered to be a basal theropod that lies outside the clade Neotheropoda,H.D. Sues, S. J. Nesbitt, D. S. Berman and A. C. Henrici. 2011. A late-surviving basal theropod dinosaur from the latest Triassic of North America. Proceedings of the Royal Society B 278:3459-3464 a group that includes more advanced Triassic theropods (like Coelophysis) and their descendants. With such a basal position, Daemonosaurus represents a lineage that extended from the earliest radiation of dinosaurs in the Middle Triassic alongside forms such as Eoraptor and Herrerasaurus from South America. A phylogenetic analysis conducted in its original description found Daemonosaurus chauliodus to be closely related to Tawa hallae, a theropod that was described from Ghost Ranch in 2009, and the Neotheropoda. Although the two theropods are closely related, Tawa was found at a quarry that is slightly older than the Whitaker Quarry at Ghost Ranch. Sues et al. (2011) noted that the discovery of Daemonosaurus provided \\"additional support for the theropod affinities of both Eoraptor and Herrerasauridae and (demonstrated) that lineages from the initial radiation of Dinosauria persisted until the end of the Triassic.\\" Below is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Sues et al. in 2011, showing the relationships of Daemonosaurus: Examination of this genus by Sues et al. (2011) demonstrates that Daemonosaurus is separate and distinct from its other contemporaries. Daemonosaurus differs from Herrerasaurus based on key features in the skull and because it has much larger teeth in the premaxilla. Daemonosaurus differs from Eodromaeus based on features of the jaw bone, skull, cheek bones, and because it has much larger teeth in the premaxilla. Daemonosaurus differs from Eoraptor lunensis based on the presence of much larger premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth and a much more restricted antorbital fossa on the maxilla. Daemonosaurus differs from Tawa hallae and Coelophysis bauri in features of the skull bones. Daemonosaurus differs from Chindesaurus bryansmalli in features of the cervical vertebrae. A paper published by Baron et al. (2017) resurrected the clade Ornithoscelida to unite ornithischians and theropods to the exception of sauropodomorphs. Although not included in the original study, the authors added Daemonosaurus to their dataset after their hypothesis was criticized by a team of international researchers, Langer et al. (2017). In Baron et al.'s response, Daemonosaurus was found to be the earliest ornithischian, retaining many theropod-like characteristics. Nesbitt and Sues (2020) rescored the genus and reran the analyses of both Langer et al. (2017) and Baron et al. (2017). Langer et al.'s analysis resulted in a large polytomy placing Daemonosaurus as either a basal saurischian, a herrerasaurid, or a basal silesaurid. When Agnosphitys (a fragmentary possible silesaurid) was removed from the analysis, Daemonosaurus was placed as the sister taxon to Eusaurischia, which encompassed the theropod-sauropodomorph split. The rescoring of Baron et al.'s analysis placed Daemonosaurus as an ornithoscelidan outside the ornithichian-theropod split. This area was also occupied by Tawa and Chindesaurus. Although Daemonosaurus was not recovered as an ornithichian in any analysis, it also does not share any clear unambiguous characteristics exclusively with theropods. Though Nesbitt and Sues (2020) considered Daemonosaurus a likely saurischian, they were unable to conclusively place the genus within any subgroup of Dinosauria. Paleoenvironment The only specimen of Daemonosaurus was recovered at the Coelophysis (Whitaker) quarry at Ghost Ranch in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. This site preserves pebbly, calcareous conglomerate rich in fossils of many different animals, with the theropod dinosaur Coelophysis being particularly abundant. It has been correlated the Siltstone Member of the Chinle Formation, which is tentatively dated to the Rhaetian (or possibly latest Norian) stage of the Late Triassic period. Ghost Ranch was located close to the equator 200 million years ago, and had a warm, monsoon-like climate with heavy seasonal precipitation. The paleoenvironment of the Whitaker quarry included a diverse collection of rhynchocephalians (like Whitakersaurus), archosauromorphs, and archosaurs. Archosauriform taxa present include phytosaurs (Redondasaurus), crocodylomorphs (Hesperosuchus), shuvosaurids (Effigia), the dinosauromorph Eucoelophysis, and the dinosaur Coelophysis.E. H. Colbert. 1989. The Triassic dinosaur Coelophysis. Museum of Northern Arizona Bulletin 57:1-174 =Taphonomy= The multitude of specimens deposited so closely together at Ghost Ranch was probably the result of a flash flood event. Such flooding was commonplace during this period of the Earth's history and, indeed, the nearby Petrified Forest of Arizona is the result of a preserved log jam of tree trunks that were caught in one such flood. In 1989, Colbert noted that the Daemonosaurus specimen and several Coelophysis specimens were washed into a small pond, where they drowned and were buried by a sheet flood event from a nearby river.\\"  References  Prehistoric reptile genera Prehistoric theropods Rhaetian life Late Triassic dinosaurs of North America Triassic United States Paleontology in New Mexico Fossil taxa described in 2011 Taxa named by Hans-Dieter Sues Taxa named by Sterling Nesbitt ","title":"Daemonosaurus"},{"id":"31483402","text":"A maid is a female domestic servant employed for housekeeping.

He is best known for endowing John Tarleton Agricultural College, which eventually became Tarleton State University.  Biography  He was born in either White Mountain, Vermont or in New Hampshire, probably in November 1808, although one source claims 1811. He was orphaned when he was seven, and went to live with his widowed aunt in Vermont. His brother was sent to another relative in Virginia. When Tarleton was 13, he left and wandered from place to place all over the country. In Knoxville, Tennessee, he worked as a schoolteacher for a while, before getting a job as a store clerk with the Cowan-Dickerson mercantile. Here he toiled for the next 40 years, living frugally and buying up bounty certificates issued to veterans of the War of 1812, which authorized them \\"to settle on any unsurveyed or unappropriated public land.\\" He also purchased of land in Erath and Palo Pinto Counties in Texas at 12.5 cents an acre. In 1860 or 1861, he set out to look over his property. He found Native Americans living on the land, so he set up a mercantile store in Waco. In September 1876, he married wealthy widow Mary Louisa Johnson. They agreed to a contract keeping their estates separate, but when the wife learned that her husband owned a considerable amount of land, she asked for a different division of their property. He refused, and a year and a day after their wedding, she filed for divorce in a St. Louis court. John Tarleton got to the hearings just in time to present his copy of their marriage contract, and the divorce was granted with no division of property. The couple did however remain friends. In 1880, he revisited his land in Erath and Palo Pinto Counties. The Native Americans had been supplanted by settlers, whom he paid for the improvements they had made. He had his land surveyed and tried to sell plots, with no success, so he became a rancher, with middling success. John Tarleton died of typhoid fever on September 11 or November 16, 1895.  Legacy  In his will, Tarleton left about $85,000, a considerable amount at the time, to establish a college in Stephenville, Texas, which eventually became Tarleton State University. He also directed that his land in Knoxville be used to set up the John Tarleton Institute \\"for poor, worthy youths of good moral character.\\" A monument and historical marker to Tarleton stands across from the Stephenville campus at the intersection of Lillian and Washington Streets.

Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237, 243 (2d Cir.1989). Under “common interest” or “joint defense” doctrine, parties with shared interest in actual or potential litigation against a common adversary may share privileged information without waiving their right to assert attorney–client privilege.In re Pittsburgh Corning Corp., 308 B.R. 716 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 2004). Because the joint defense \\"privilege sometimes may apply outside the context of actual litigation, what the parties call a ‘joint defense’ privilege is more aptly termed the ‘common interest’ rule.”United States v. LeCroy, 348 F. Supp. 2d 375, 381 (E.D. Penn. 2004); see also United States v. BDO Seidman, LLP, 492 F.3d 806, 815 (7th Cir. 2007). Purpose “The need to protect the free flow of information from client to attorney logically exists whenever multiple clients share a common interest about a legal matter.” The common interest rule serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to the attorney for another party where a joint defense effort or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel. Scope The joint defense privilege does not merely protect statements made by attorney to client or attorney to attorney. The privilege also is held to cover communications made to certain agents of an attorney, including accountants hired to assist in the rendition of legal services. Furthermore, a person need not be a litigant to be a party to a joint defense agreement. The joint defense privilege also applies to \\"parties or potential parties sharing a common interest in the outcome of a particular claim. Only those communications made in the course of an ongoing common enterprise and intended to further the enterprise are protected. Elements A party seeking to assert the joint defense privilege must demonstrate that: *The communications were made in the course of a joint defense effort. *The statements were made in furtherance of that effort. For “common interest” or “joint defense” doctrine to apply, to permit parties with common interest in actual or potential litigation to share privileged information without waiving their right to assert privilege, parties' common interest must be identical and not merely similar, and must be legal and not solely commercial. Furthermore, the protection of the privilege “extends only to communications and not to facts.”Laforest et al v. Honeywell v. Motor Comp. et al, 2004 WL 1498916, *3 (quoting Upjohn v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 395 (1981)). While a client may refuse to answer questions regarding what it said or wrote to its attorney, it may not refuse to disclose relevant facts “merely because [it] incorporated a statement of such fact into [its] communication to [its] attorney.” The joint defense privilege, like the attorney–client privilege, does not protect “underlying facts embodied in a communication between attorney and client.”Florentia Cont. Corp. v. Resolution Trust Corp., 1993 WL 127187, *5 (S.D.N.Y.1993). *The privilege has not been waived. *The communication must be \\"given in confidence and that the client reasonably understood it to be so given\\". Generally, a client waives the attorney–client privilege when he voluntarily discloses privileged communications to third party. Waiver under joint defense doctrine is essentially the same as that under attorney client privilege. The only difference is that a co-defendant’s communication with the other attorney is not a waiver of the confidentiality of that communication. Voluntary disclosure to a third party of purportedly privileged communications has long been considered inconsistent with the privilege. It is well settled that when a party voluntarily discloses privileged communications to a third party, the privilege is waived. Similarly, when a party discloses a portion of otherwise privileged material but withholds the remainder, the privilege is waived only as to those communications actually disclosed, unless a partial waiver would be unfair to the party's adversary. Disclosure alone, without intent, may constitute waiver of the attorney–client privilege. ... “under traditional waiver doctrine a voluntary disclosure ... to a third party waives the attorney–client privilege even if the third party agrees not to disclose the communications to anyone else.” In Massachusetts, when an attorney represents more than one client in a particular matter, one client's communication made to the attorney in the presence of the other client or clients is not privileged, as between the clients.Thompson v. Cashman, 181 Mass. 36, 62 N.E. 976, 977 (1902) In Thompson v. Cashman a lawyer who was acting for both plaintiff and defendant was allowed to testify to a conversation between the lawyer, plaintiff, and defendant.Mass. Eye & Ear v. QLT Phototerapeutics, 167 F. Supp. 2d 108, 115 (2001). But not all disclosure results in waiver. “Under joint defense privilege, communications between client and his own lawyer remain protected by attorney–client privilege when disclosed to co-defendants or their counsel for purposes of common defense.”. Burden The burden for showing joint defense is the same as the burden for showing attorney client privilege. The party asserting the joint defense agreement always bears the burden of demonstrating its existence by establishing each element of the attorney- client privilege.United States v. Salvagno, et al, 306 F. Supp. 2d 258, 271 (2004). Likewise, the party asserting privilege, both in the context of joint defense agreements and otherwise, bears the burden of proving the applicability of the privilege. Joint defense agreements “No written agreement is generally required to invoke joint defense privilege.”United States v. Stepney, 246 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1079, footnote 5 (2003). And, although “privileges should be narrowly construed and expansions cautiously extended,” courts have found that an oral joint defense agreement may be valid. Joint defense agreements are not contracts which create whatever rights that signatories chose, but are written notice of defendants' invocation of privileges set forth in common law. As a result, joint defense agreements cannot extend greater protections than legal privileges on which they rest. “A joint defense agreement which purports to [extend greater protections than legal privileges on which it rests] does not accurately set forth the protections which would be given to defendants who sign. In United States v. Stepney,US v Stepney, 246 F. Supp 2d 1069 (2003) unless the joint defense privilege recognized in this Circuit imposes a duty of loyalty on attorneys who are parties to a joint defense agreement, the duty of loyalty set forth in the proposed agreement would have no effect other than misinforming defendants of the actual scope of their rights. Joint defense privilege did not impose general duty of loyalty to all signing defendants, and thus duty of loyalty set forth in proposed joint defense agreement had no effect other than misinforming defendants of actual scope of their rights. “The proposed joint defense agreement explicitly imposes on signing attorneys not only a duty of confidentiality, but a separate general duty of loyalty to all signing defendants. Such a duty has no foundation in law and, if recognized, would offer little chance of a trial unmarred by conflict of interest and disqualification.” When there is a conflict, under “joint defense” doctrine, joint defendant must consent to waiver of conflict of interest for waiver to be effective.

Ceylon programs run on the Java virtual machine (JVM), and can be compiled to JavaScript. The language design focuses on source code readability, predictability, toolability, modularity, and metaprogrammability. Important features of Ceylon include: * A type system enforcing null safety and list element existence at compile time * Regular syntax and semantics, avoiding special cases and primitively-defined constructs in favor of syntactic sugar * Support for generic programming and metaprogramming, with reified generics * Modularity built into the language, based on JBoss modules, interoperable with OSGi and Maven * powerful tools, including an Eclipse-based IDE The name \\"Ceylon\\" is an oblique reference to Java, in that Java and Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, are islands known for growth and export of coffee and tea. In August 2017, Ceylon was donated to the Eclipse Foundation.  Language features  Ceylon is heavily influenced by Java's syntax, but adds many new features. = Type system = One of the most novel aspects of Ceylon compared to Java is its type system. Ceylon foregoes Java's primitive types and boxing in favor of a type system composed entirely of first-class objects. While this may cause boxing overhead in some situations, it makes the type system more uniform. Ceylon allows for union and intersection types, in a similar fashion to TypeScript, Whiley and Flow. Union types, written \`AB\`, allow a variable to have more than one type. The following example shows a Ceylon function which may take either an integer or a string: shared void integerOrString(IntegerString input) { if (is Integer input) { print(\\"Got the integer \`\`input\`\`\\"); } else { print(\\"Got the string '\`\`input\`\`'\\"); } } Intersection types, written \`A&B;\`, are the theoretical foundation of flow- sensitive typing: shared void integerOrString(IntegerString input) { Integer added = input + 6; // illegal; the + operator is not defined on IntegerString if (is Integer input) { Integer added = input + 6; // legal; input is now known to be an Integer print(\\"Got the integer \`\`input\`\`\\"); } else { print(\\"Got the string '\`\`input\`\`'\\"); } } The condition \`is Integer input\` narrows the type of \`input\` to \`<IntegerString> & Integer\`, which distributes to \`Integer&Integer  String&Integer\`, which, as \`String\` and \`Integer\` are disjoint types, is equivalent to \`Integer&Integer  Nothing\` (\`Nothing\` is the empty bottom type), which simplifies to just \`Integer\`.  Null safety  Union and intersection types are used to provide null safety. The top type of the Ceylon type hierarchy is the class \`Anything\`, which has two subclasses: \`Object\`, the superclass of all normal classes and all interfaces, and \`Null\`, with the only instance \`null\`. Since \`Object\` and \`Null\` are disjoint types, most regular types like \`Integer\` or \`List<String>\` are not nullable; a nullable type is the union \`IntegerNull\`, abbreviated \`Integer?\`. Intersection types can be used to get a non-optional type out of a possibly- optional type, such as a type parameter. For example, the signature of a function that removes \`null\` elements from a stream of values could be: Iterable removeNulls(Iterable stream); When \`removeNulls\` is called with a stream of \`IntegerNull\` elements, the result will be a stream of \`<IntegerNull> & Object\` elements, which simplifies to \`Integer\`.  Functions  Similarly to many modern languages, Ceylon supports first class functions and higher order functions, including function types and anonymous functions // A top-level higher-order function using block syntax (not associated with any user-created classes) String process(String text, String transformString(String toChange)) { return transformString(text); } // A top- level function calling String.reverse in expression form. String reverse(String text) => text.reversed; // A function reference to String.reversed but mostly equivalent to the function above. String(String) reverseFunctionReference = String.reversed; // An example where the top-level function above is provided as an argument to the higher-order function above String reversed1 = process(\\"one\\", reverse); // An example where an anonymous function - (text) => text+text - is provided to the higher-order function above. String reversed2 = process(\\"one\\", (text) => text+text);  Enumerated types  Similar to Java and many other languages, and with a similar mechanism as algebraic types, Ceylon supports enumerated types, otherwise known as enums. This is implemented in Ceylon with a pattern of limiting the instances of an abstract class at declaration to a limited set of objects (in this case, singleton instances). Another way to implement this pattern is with the new constructor feature in Ceylon 1.2 where the objects are implemented as different named constructor declarations. // Traditional syntax for enumerated type, in this case, limiting the instances to three objects(for this purpose: Singletons) abstract class Vehicle(shared String name) of plane  train  automobile {} object plane extends Vehicle(\\"plane\\") {} object train extends Vehicle(\\"train\\") {} object automobile extends Vehicle(\\"automobile\\") {} // Compile error: type is not a subtype of any case of enumerated supertype: 'boat' inherits 'Vehicle' //object boat extends Vehicle(\\"boat\\") {} // New (as of Ceylon 1.2.0) constructor-based syntax class Vehicle of plane  train  automobile { String name; abstract new named(String pName) { name = pName; } shared new plane extends named(\\"plane\\") {} shared new train extends named(\\"train\\") {} shared new automobile extends named(\\"automobile\\") {} // Compile error: value constructor does not occur in of clause of non-abstract enumerated class: 'boat' is not listed in the of clause of 'Vehicle' //shared new boat extends named(\\"boat\\") {} }  Type inference  Ceylon is strongly and statically typed, but also has support for type inference. The \`value\` keyword is used to infer the type of a variable, and the \`function\` keyword is used to infer the type of a function. The following two definition pairs are each equivalent: Integer i = 3; value i = 3; Integer add(Integer i1, Integer i2) { return i1 + i2; } function add(Integer i1, Integer i2) { return i1 + i2; } However, to make single-pass type inference possible, type inference is only allowed for non-toplevel and unshared declarations. = Entry point with names= By default the starter (\`ceylon run\`) runs the shared run() function of a module: /* The classic Hello World program */ shared void run() { print(\\"Hello, World!\\"); } but any other shared function without parameters can be used as main calling the program with the --run parameter, like this: \`ceylon run --compile=force --run hello default\`  Versions  Versions of Ceylon released:https://ceylon- lang.org/download-archive/ Ceylon: Download Previous Ceylon versions * M1 0.1 \\"Newton\\" (Dec 20 2011) * M2 0.2 \\"Minitel\\" (Mar 2 2012) * M3 0.3 \\"V2000\\" (Jun 21 2012) * M3.1 0.3.1 \\"V2000\\" (Jul 6 2012) * M4 0.4 \\"Analytical Engine\\" (Oct 29 2012) * M5 0.5 \\"Nesa Pong\\" (Mar 13 2013) * M6 0.6 \\"Virtual Boy\\" (Sep 23 2013) * 1.0 beta \\"Virtual Boy\\" (Sep 24 2013) * 1.0.0 \\"No More Mr Nice Guy\\" (Nov 13 2013) * 1.1.0 \\"Ultimate Ship The Second\\" (Oct 09 2014) * 1.2.0 \\"A Series of Unlikely Explanations\\" (Oct 28 2015) * 1.2.1 \\"Irregular Apocalypse\\" (Feb 11 2016) * 1.2.2 \\"Charming But Irrational\\" (Mar 11 2016) * 1.3.0 \\"Total Internal Reflection\\" (Sep 19 2016) * 1.3.1 \\"Now We Try It My Way\\" (Nov 22 2016) * 1.3.2 \\"Smile Tolerantly\\" (Mar 02 2017) * 1.3.3 \\"Contents May Differ\\" (Aug 21 2017)  License  All parts of Ceylon are available as free software, mostly the Apache License.

It supersedes the Nokia E72 as the new Symbian business mobility solution from Nokia following its announcement on 12 April 2011 (same day as Nokia X7-00). It shipped with the new \\"Symbian Anna\\" version of Symbian^3, and originally retailed for 340 euros before taxes.https://www.computerworld.com/article/2507336/mobile-wireless/nokia- launches-two-phones-running-an-updated-symbian-os.html The smartphone is notable for its backlit 4-rows QWERTY keyboard and touch screen input methods, for its long battery life (Talktime : 7.5 to 14.8 h and Standby : 28 to 31 days), the out-of-the-box access to Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, Microsoft Communicator Mobile and Microsoft SharePoint and the high pixel density of its VGA display (326ppi). Like its predecessors (Nokia E71/E72), the Nokia E6-00 integrates a stainless steel and glass design. The back removable cover, the raised panel for the back camera, dual LED flash and loud speaker and the contour of the front are made of stainless steel. The front of the phone (except for the QWERTY keyboard, short cut buttons and Navikey) is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass. Its casing has three color options (black, silver and white). The E6 would also be the last Symbian-based device with a QWERTY keyboard, as the later QWERTY devices would be Series 40 from the Asha line. The Nokia Asha 302 from 2012 bears strong design similarities to the E6.https://www.pinoytechblog.com/archives/nokia-asha-302-review-looks-premium- for-its-pricehttp://www.intomobile.com/2012/02/27/nokia- asha-202-203-and-302-say-hello-nokias-latest-feature-phones/ In October 2012 Vertu released the Constellation Quest Blue, based on the E6.http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/flow/item/15888_The_ultimate_Nokia_E6_makeover.php  History and availability  The predecessor of the E6-00 in the Eseries, consisting of business-oriented smartphones, was the Nokia E72 which shipped in November 2009. As with the E71, the E72 received mostly praises from the press. It is worth noting that Nokia released the E7, a landscape QWERTY slider smartphone in the Eseries based on Symbian^3, that shipped in February 2011. The first hints that the Nokia E6-00 was being developed came, in early January 2011, from a Nokia XML and pictures from a Picasa album with pictures taken with the device. Various information could be retrieved from the XML such as the 8 MP camera, VGA display and QWERTY keyboard. The device was not officially announced at the Mobile World Congress held in Barcelona (14–17 February 2011). Various pictures and videos of the Nokia E6-00 leaked during the months of February and March. It was officially announced at a special event, named Discover Symbian, on 12 April 2011 along with the Nokia X7 and the latest update of Symbian software. It was expected to be released in Q2 2011 in Europe at a price of €340 (before taxes and subsidies) and in Q3 2011 in North America. In May 2011, the Nokia E6 became available at the Nokia Deutschland online shop for preorder at the price of €429.  Hardware  = Processors = The Nokia E6-00 is powered by the same processor found in other contemporary Symbian devices such as the Nokia N8 , E7 and C7 , Nokia e series which is an ARM11 clocked at 680 MHz with a Broadcom BCM2727 GPU which supports OpenVG1.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0 support. = Screen and input = The Nokia E6-00 has a 62.5 mm (diagonally) capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 640 × 480 pixel (VGA, 326 ppi). According to Nokia, it is capable of displaying up to 16.7M colours. This pixel density was the highest among the smartphones launched at the time until the launch of Nokia Lumia 920. The screen brightness of the E6-00 is \\"more than double the brightness of the E72\\" when measured in candelas. There is a proximity sensor which deactivates the display and touchscreen when the device is brought near the face during a call. The Nokia E6 also understands PictBridge protocol so it's possible to directly print from the phone to a printer without using a computer to handle the data transfer in between. The optical Navi key of the E72 has been replaced by a Navi key on the E6-00. It has also an ambient light sensor that adjusts the display brightness and activates the backlit of the 4-row keyboard. A 3-axis accelerometer is present but will not switch the display to portrait mode when the device is turned sideways. It will, however, take pictures in portrait and show them the right way in the photo gallery. The device has an autonomous GPS with optional A-GPS functionality, Wi-Fi network positioning and Cell-ID and comes pre-loaded with the Ovi Maps application. Ovi Maps for Symbian^3 provides: free lifetime, turn by turn, voice guided car and pedestrian navigation. If the map is already downloaded to the device, Ovi Maps does not require an active data connection and can work as a stand-alone GPS navigator. For other services, for example Google Maps, a data connection is required. Live Camera view of Nokia E6's 8 Mega- Pixel Camera The 8-megapixel (3264 × 2448 px) back camera has an extended depth of field feature (no autofocus), dual LED flash, 2X digital zoom (3X in video mode) and offers high definition (720p, 16:9 aspect ratio) video recording at 25 frame/s or 4:3 aspect ratio. The 0.3-megapixel front camera is capable of video recording (176 × 144 px at 15 frame/s) for video calling. The Nokia E6 has a loudspeaker and two microphones. The microphone at the front of the device collects voices of the user, another microphone at the back of the device collects environmental noise for active noise cancellation, which makes user's voice in noisy environment sound clearer to the person at the other end of the line. Noise cancellation is not available when using the loudspeaker or a headset. = Buttons = On the front of the device, there is a QWERTY keyboard, call creation and call termination keys, home (menu), calendar, contact and email shortcut keys with short and long press features and a 5-way Scrolling (Navi key). On the top there is the power/lock button, on the right hand side there is the lock/unlock slider, which also turn on the torch (dual LED flash of the camera). Above that button, there are three keys: (1) volume down, (2) volume up and (3) a middle key for activating the voice commands (long press) and the voice recorder (short press). When the device is locked, pressing the Navi will also bring up a menu which allow to unlock the Nokia E6-00 from the touch screen. The QWERTY keyboard comes in a variety (24) language versions, including Arabic, Thai, Russian and Chinese. = Audio and output = The E6-00 has a microphone and a loudspeaker located on the back of the device. There is a 3.5 mm four-contact audio jack which simultaneously provides stereo audio output and either microphone input or video output. PAL and NTSC TV out is possible using a Nokia Video Connectivity Cable (not included upon purchase) or a standard 3.5 mm audio jack to RCA cable. There is a High-Speed USB 2.0 USB Micro-B connector provided for data synchronization, mass storage mode (client) and battery charging. The Nokia E6-00 supports for USB On-The-Go 1.3 (the ability to act as a USB host) using a Nokia Adapter Cable for USB OTG CA-157 (not included upon purchase). The built-in Bluetooth v3 supports wireless earpieces and headphones through the HSP profile. The Nokia E6-00 is also capable of stereo audio output with the A2DP profile. Built-in car hands-free kits are also supported with the HFP profile. File transfer is supported (FTP) along with the OPP profile for sending/receiving objects. It is possible to remote control the device with the AVRCP profile. The DUN profile which permits access to the Internet from a laptop by dialing up on a mobile phone wirelessly (tethering). Other profiles are also supported (BIP, GAP, GAVDP, GOEP, HSP, PBAP, SAP, SDP and SPP). The device has an 87.5-108 MHz (76-90 MHz in Japan) FM receiver with RDS support. It has Wi-Fi b/g/n connectivity (single band) with support for WEP, WPA and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) security protocols. = Battery and SIM = The BP-4L 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery performance, as provided by Nokia, are up to 14.8h of talk time, 681h standby, 9h of video playback, 4.7h of video recording and up to 75h of music play back. = Storage = The Nokia E6-00 has 8 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSDHC card up to 32 GB in size There is 1 GB of ROM, of which 350 MB is available to the user to install applications.  Criticism and issues  = Notification LED visibility = Some new users of the Nokia E6 have experienced problems with the notification LED which has been placed under the D-pad navigation key, as in previous models (E71, E72). However, it is apparent that Nokia has not allowed sufficient space between the D-pad key and the front face for the light to be visible. Nokia have acknowledged the problem but have not indicated whether a fix is possible in software by adjusting the brightness of the component. There is one solution that was done by Aniket Patil (aniketroxx), it was to redirect the notification light to Red Mute key, which was used by many people as alternative to D-Pad Fix. That solution also helped user to see light without opening E6 from cover. A revised Nokia E6 which has a hardware change to resolve the notification light issue started shipping on 22 October 2011. = Vibration alert not strong enough = Many users of the Nokia E6 reported that the vibration alert is not strong enough.  Software  = Symbian^3 \\"Anna\\" = Along with the Nokia X7, the E6-00 shipped with the updated Symbian^3 software user experience. This update, nicknamed \\"Anna\\", offers, amongst others: * New icons. * Improved text input with a split screen portrait QWERTY when entering text into web pages and applications. * New web browser (v7.3) with an improved user interface (URL entry bar, always visible ‘Go Back’ and extended toolbar buttons), search-integrated address field, faster navigation and page loading. * An updated Ovi Maps (v3.06) application with search for public transport routes, ability to download full country maps via WLAN or Nokia Ovi Suite and check-in to Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare. * Hardware accelerated encryption. * Increased file size limits for downloading over WLAN with Ovi Store (v2.06). * Improved Social (v1.3) with status updates in contact card and ability to retweet and view follower list in Twitter. * Flash Lite 4 that support some Flash Player 10.1 content such as YouTube. * Java Runtime 2.2, Qt Mobility 1.1 and Qt4.7. Preinstalled applications on the Nokia E6-00 include JoikuSpot Premium (mobile WiFi hotspot), World Traveler, F-secure Mobile Security and QuickOffice. = Nokia Belle = The stock OS version Symbian Anna was specially adapted to E6. The February 2012 Nokia Belle update was heavily criticised for its failure to meet special demands of E6 which had been met by the original stock firmware. In August 2012, Nokia Belle Refresh was made available. = Compatibility = Due to its VGA (640 × 480) resolution, compared to the nHD (640 × 360) of the other Symbian^3 devices, some application may be incompatible with the E6-00 if they are designed for nHD display. For example, Nokia guidelines stipulate that the user interface elements of the touch screen (accept button, virtual numpad, etc. ...) should be at least 7mm × 7mm. The high pixel density of the Nokia E6-00 means that the elements will need to be proportionately larger in pixels. Compared to other recent Symbian^3 devices, the Nokia E6-00 has two extra homescreens bringing the total to 5 homescreens. This is to give users the same opportunity for customization as other devices with smaller displays accommodating 3 widgets per homescreen. The Nokia E6 has WiFi coverage of the full spectrum of channels 1-13 in the crowded 2.4 GHz waveband (compared to just channels 1-11 on the E63 for example). It does not support the newer 5 GHz WiFi frequencies.

Officially announced by HTC on April 12, 2011, the HTC Sensation was launched by Vodafone in key European markets including the United Kingdom on May 19, 2011 and by T-Mobile in the United States on June 12, 2011 (marketed as the HTC Sensation 4G). It was HTC's fifth flagship Android phone and the first HTC phone to support the HTC Sense 3.0 user interface. At the time of its release, the Sensation XE was the world's fastest Android phone.  Software  The device shipped with Android 2.3.3 and includes HTC Sense 3.0 UI. The device was part of a new generation of HTC phones that have a signed bootloader. As a consequence, the phones were originally not rootable, thus denying users administrative rights to their phones. Despite originally being shipped with the locked bootloader, it was announced on July 10, 2011 that HTC Sensation devices would have their bootloaders unlocked due to overwhelming customer feedback since the device's initial release. On July 29, 2011, a tool named Revolutionary was released by AlphaRevX and unrevoked which enabled S-off, and subsequently, allowed permanent root. In August 2011, HTC officially allowed unlocking HTC Sensation bootloaders at the HTCdev.com website. = Update = In the beginning of March 2012, HTC updated their devices to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. The update re-locked the bootloader, but developers found a procedure that made it possible to obtain S-off after the new ICS bootloader installed. HTC decided to fork their Sense user interface, leaving Sensation owners who updated to ICS with the Sense 3.6 interface, as opposed to getting Sense 4.0 which came with newer phones. The phone can be upgraded to Android 7.1.2 with a custom ROM but development has stopped as the device is currently considered obsolete.

Career Iola was built at Hammersley Inlet, then known as \\"Big Skookum\\", in the extreme southern portion of Puget Sound. The vessel entered service in June 1885 under the command of her first owner, Capt. Edwin Miller. The vessel initially made weekly runs from Oakland, Washington (in northern Puget Sound) to Olympia and Seattle, but within six months trip frequency had increase to twice a week. In June 1887, Miller hired John F. Vanderhoef to act as the vessel's master and agent. He rebuilt the cabins to accommodate both his wife and himself on a full-time basis. By 1889 Vanderhoef had ceased service in north Puget Sound and was concentrating on Vashon Island landings. Overboard incident A story is reported that as Iola was moving towards Seattle on the west side of Vashon Island, with Captain Vanderhoef in the pilot house. While shaking a tablecloth over the side, Mrs. Vanderhoef fell overboard. Her husband did not hear her call for help, because of the engine noise. He did not notice she was missing until he reached Seattle. He turned the vessel around to begin looking for her.

He served as the deputy chief of mission of the Israeli embassy in Cyprus (1996–1999). During his service in Cyprus, Cohen coordinated the historic visit of President Ezer Weizman in 1998, the first-ever visit of an Israeli president to the island. He was also in charge of organizing the events of the 50th anniversary of Israel, in Cyprus. Back in Israel, Cohen was nominated as counselor at the department of Middle East economic affairs (1999–2001), and was responsible for developing economic and commercial ties between Israel, The Palestinian Authority, and Arab countries in the Middle East. He was working directly with the diplomatic missions of Israel in Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Morocco, Tunisia, and Mauritania.

Guatemala did it in May 2018 and Honduras is planning to do it by the end of 2020. Cohen initiated a campaign among mayors in Guatemala to name streets in their cities \\"Jerusalem Capital of Israel\\". Until now, there are 17 cities in Guatemala, including the capital Guatemala City that accepted the challenge, making Guatemala the first and only country in the world with streets bearing this name. He accompanied the visits in Israel of the Presidents of Guatemala, Jimmy Morales (May 2018 - Opening of the Guatemalan embassy in Jerusalem) and Alejandro Giammattei (December 2019) as well as President of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez (September 2019 - Opening of the commercial office of Honduras in Jerusalem). To honor Israel for its 70th anniversary, he initiated the \\"Celebrate Israel Parade\\" in the streets of Guatemala City with thousands of participants.

Jondalar, Jonayla, their animals and many others decide to travel. The second part is mainly about the caves they visit. In many of the Sacred caves the Ancients, the people before the Zelandonii, left drawings. Ayla meets many other Zelandoni and one of them gives her a pouch of dried herbs smelling faintly of mint. Ayla also discovers that the Clan visit some of the sacred caves as well. In the third part of the book, Ayla is marking the passage of the sun and moon's phases as part of her training as an acolyte. One night she is distracted and decides to share Pleasures with Jondalar, starting a baby. However, most of her Cave leaves for the Summer Meeting, but Ayla stays behind until Midsummer so she can finish her observation of the celestial bodies. During this time she takes care of Marthona, her mother-in-law, as well as the others in her Cave. One night Ayla makes some mint tea, actually the dried herb mixture given to her in the second part of the book, and is Called. If an acolyte is Called, then she will be tested by the Zelandonia, and initiated into the Zelandonia if the Calling is true. Ayla puts down her drink and runs along a river into a cave, where she spends the next three days hallucinating. Wolf wakes her from her visions, and she finds herself in the dark cave. She allows Wolf to lead her out of the cave, but not before finding a bag hidden there by Madroman, an unskilled acolyte who faked his Calling, and who has had a deep-seated hatred of Jondalar since adolescence. Outside are people from her Cave who were worried about her absence, and it is discovered that Ayla miscarried. She spends the next few days recovering from her experience and helps deliver a friend's baby. After delivering the baby, Ayla travels to the Summer Meeting. Upon her arrival, she finds Jondalar sharing Pleasures with Marona (Marona being Jondalar's bitter ex-girlfriend whom he abandoned to go travelling in the second book, and who actively and spitefully caused Ayla much difficulty when she first arrived at Jondalar's home). This leaves a rift between Ayla and Jondalar. She turns Madroman's bag over to the Zelandonia, and he is rejected from their ranks for his attempted deception. Ayla is accepted into the Zelandonia and attempts to use a dangerous hallucinogenic root as part of her initiation - one that was greatly feared by her first mentor, Mamut. The rift with Jondalar is only healed when he manages to call her back from the deathlike coma induced by the root. The spiritual knowledge Ayla's Calling brings to the community is that men are active in the conception of a baby during 'Pleasures', which leads to the start of recognized fatherhood and that men have purpose on earth equal to that of women, and subsequently leads to the need for monogamous relationships to reduce jealousy/possessiveness over sexual partners and for fathers to take responsibility for children, thus shaping this prehistoric culture further to match our current one.

History The society was established by Louisa Hubbard and Caroline Blanchard in 1880 and was active until 1884. Another person credited with founding the organisation was Emily Anne Smythe.Elizabeth Baigent, ‘Smythe , Emily Anne, Viscountess Strangford (bap. 1826, d. 1887)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 3 May 2015 The goal of the society was to allow women with few opportunities in England to move to places such as North America or New Zealand. The organizers of the society believed that women would be able to find employment much more easily in these locations than they were able to in England. They generally attempted to find women jobs as governesses or helpers for families. They also believed that women would be able to find husbands through these professions. Hubbard began believing in the importance of female emigration from England in 1877. A writer pointed out to her that many more men than women had emigrated from England and that there were many opportunities for women in the British colonies. She then began publishing articles about this in her magazine, The Women's Gazette. These articles caught the attention of other emigration advocates and they soon met with Hubbard and decided to form the society. The society often worked with branches of the YWCA in the locations that they sought to place women. Hubbard later realized that there were several different societies working interdependently to promote emigration and decided to try to unify them. She then published a book titled The United Englishwomen's Emigration Register and founded the United Englishwomen's Emigration Association to try to unify the women's emigration movement. In 1884 Caroline Blanchard also began the Colonial Emigration Society to focus on promoting emigration.

It aired in the United States on NBC on March 4, 2010. It was written by Jessie Miller and directed by Anthony Russo. In the episode, Jeff faces off with the coach of the billiards class over wearing gym shorts, while the rest of the group encourages Abed to pursue a girl they think has a crush on him. It received positive reviews from critics. Plot Jeff (Joel McHale) dresses stylishly for his billiards class. Troy (Donald Glover) finds a hand-drawn portrait resembling Abed in his used Spanish book (Danny Pudi). The group concludes that the book's previous owner, Jenny Adams (Carrie Wiita), likes Abed. However, Abed seems uninterested in meeting her. In class, Jeff impresses Coach Bogner (Blake Clark) with his technique. However, Bogner tells the class they must wear gym shorts because pool is a physical education class, frustrating Jeff. Meanwhile, the group encourages Abed to talk to Jenny in the cafeteria. After some urging, he heads over, although he acts in an off-putting way as he does so. The group stops him and decides to teach Abed how to attract women. Jeff enters class in the shorts, visibly uncomfortable. After failing to look cool, he changes his clothes and confronts Bogner. Bogner calls Jeff a \\"hipster\\" who cares too much about his appearance. Jeff challenges him to a game of pool, but Bogner only offers to play Jeff in shorts; Jeff refuses and leaves the class. The other group members teach Abed how to act differently for Jenny. Jeff enters and chastises them for trying to change Abed. Abed then impersonates Jeff, which impresses the group; they encourage him to act like that when he approaches Jenny. Abed meets Jenny and begins seducing her until her boyfriend (also played by Pudi) appears and threatens Abed. Later, the group worries Abed will be upset over what happened. However, when he arrives, he seems unfazed. He explains that he went after Jenny because he knew it was important to them that he learn to act normally. He also explains that knowing what he likes about himself makes changing for others not such a big deal. This inspires Jeff to overcome his ego. Jeff enters the common room in shorts and challenges Bogner to play him; a crowd gathers to watch their intense match. In between shots, Bogner argues Jeff has not actually changed. Jeff strips down to his underwear, claiming he does not care how he looks, and Bogner follows suit. Bogner gets to the last ball, still taunting Jeff. To try to show each other up, both men rip off their underwear. Bogner misses his shot, allowing Jeff to win and earn Bogner's respect. Afterwards, one of Jeff's classmates (Jill Latiano) asks Jeff to introduce her to Abed; Jeff suggests introducing herself instead. Production This episode was director Anthony Russo's sixth episode and writer Jessie Miller's first of the series. The climactic pool scene features the song \\"Werewolves of London\\", which was used in a similar scene in the film The Color of Money. Joel McHale later remarked that he wore a dance belt for the portions in which Jeff is naked but added that it \\"required a lot of bravery on [his] part\\", as he had never acted out a scene like that before. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on March 4, 2010, the episode was viewed by 5.06 million viewers and achieved a 2.3 rating among adults 18-49, placing third in its timeslot behind American Idol and Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. =Reception= The episode received positive reviews from critics. Jonah Krakow of IGN rated it an 8.5/10, denoting a \\"great\\" episode, and called it \\"another solid episode with yet another uproarious finale\\". Sean Gandert of Paste also gave it an 8.5/10, noting that the show's cast had become very balanced and that both plotlines were strong. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it an A- grade, arguing that the show takes its strength from a strong ensemble and that it has a \\"philosophical bent\\" that made its conflicts much more compelling than other sitcoms. John Young of Entertainment Weekly noted that the episode was what the show needed as it faced renewal or cancellation and called it \\"the episode [he'd] choose when introducing the show to the uninitiated.\\" In a retrospective ranking of the show's 110 episodes, Cory Barker of TV.com placed the episode thirty-seventh, noting that it (along with \\"Communication Studies\\" and \\"Beginner Pottery\\") helped to mark the show's shift from \\"community college hijinks\\" to \\"conceptual and parodic nods\\".

History  In 2008 American Institute of Architects Sierra Valley Chapter (AIASV) founded the “AIA Sierra Valley Film Festival” in collaboration with the Modesto Art Museum, the State Theatre, and the Modesto Film Society. Bob Barzan, Executive Director of the Modesto Art Museum, had the original idea to put on a one- night architecture film festival in Modesto. He approached the Modesto Film Society, State Theatre and AIA Sierra Valley to see if they were interested in partnering with the museum on the event. The four non-profit organizations got together and planned the first event. The festival was such a success that they decided to make it an ongoing event featuring 4 architectural film nights throughout the year. Since 2008 the Festival has grown each year to incorporate new events, taking it beyond film and incorporating lectures, exhibits, tours and special events. In 2010 the festival received its new name \\"The Modesto International Architecture Festival.\\"The festival introduces the public to the world of architecture past, present, and future.

Early life and education Muller was born in Adelaide and educated at St Peter's College from 1942 to 1944. He studied at the University of Adelaide graduating with Bachelor of Engineering degree together with the South Australian School of Mines and Industries graduating with a Fellowship in Architecture in 1948. Muller won the Board of Architectural Education and Royal Australian Institute of Architects traveling scholarship in 1947. He won a Fulbright Traveling Scholarship and was awarded a Graduate Tuition Scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia in 1950/1951, where he obtained a Master of Architecture degree. Muller became an Associate of the Royal British Institute of Architects. He began private practice in Sydney in 1952. In 1953, Muller married Rosemary Winn Patrick. They had three children named Peter, Suzy and James. In 1964, they divorced and he married Carole Margaret Mason, whom he also divorced in 1991. He remarried, but three years after the death of his third wife, Helen Hayes, in 2001, he returned to Sydney and reunited with Carole.Architects Database, \\"Peter Muller\\". Accessed 8 April 2011. Career Muller took an alternative design approach to the then-contemporary modern movementProfessor Philip Drew, \\"Profile on Peter Muller\\". Accessed 12/04/2011. He travelled and lived in many places around the world which included France, London, Bali, South Australia and Sydney. He had several influences including Adrian Snodgrass (1952), Albert Read (1954) and lastly, Frank Lloyd Wright (1952) whom only \\"influenced him on the Audette house at the beginning of his practice\\".Quotation by Peter Muller, \\"Influences\\". Accessed 8 April 2011 In Sydney 1953, Muller worked in his own architectural practice called 'The Office of Peter Muller'. He avoided synthetic finishes and instead used natural materials, as he felt strongly about the Australian landscape. This is reflected in many of his Sydney contemporaries. He later moved to Marulan, New South Wales where he practiced at home in his grazing property \\"Glenrock\\". In 1962 Muller tutored at the University of New South Wales and worked as a director of the National Capital Branch of the National Capital Development Commission in Canberra from 1975 to 1977. This helped and allowed him to author 'The Esoteric Nature of Griffin’s Design for Canberra’ in 1976. Later, in 1978, he was the founding Principal of Regional Design and Research and he has acted independently from locations all around the world as a consultant for 'Peter Muller International'. =Notable Projects= Richardson House 949 Barrenjoey Road, Palm Beach, Sydney, Australia, 1956 Like many of Peter Muller’s designs, the Richardson House began with extensive research of the site. Muller designed this house to sit on the edge of a cliff face, seven metres below the adjoining road and fifteen metres above the water. One design key was the use of circles as the primary motif. This motif came from the form of a large rock already on the site. Twenty-nine hollow cylinders, made of curved concrete blocks and of a natural grey and green appearance, made up the main support system. Muller was a designer of organic architecture and all of the interior spaces of this design are connected and freely flowing.Robert Irving, John Kinstler and Max Dupain, \\"Fine Houses of Sydney\\" p160-169.

He was best known for his conté and charcoal drawings reflecting of the African-American experience.  Personal life  Born in Chicago, Illinois, Bailey grew up in Los Angeles, California.Fuller, H.W. \\"Editor's Notes.\\" Negro Digest 16.9 (1967):4. He received his education from Alabama State College and then attended Howard University where he studied under Alain Locke, Sterling Brown and James A. Porter. He obtained his MFA at the University of Southern California. At Alabama he received commissions for large paintings and murals as a student. He was described as a \\"black bohemian\\" at the time, often seen wearing a beret, talking jive, carrying a bottle \\"in one pocket\\" and talking about music and art. While living in Atlanta his studio space was located at the Institute of the Black World's second building. He lived at Paschal's Motor Lodge Hotel, where if he was unable to make rent he would trade artwork with one of the Paschal brothers in exchange. Bailey spoke with slurred speech, which was due to his heavy use of drugs and alcohol. Bailey was described as taking pills then drinking, spending his money on \\"a full pint of scotch\\" or vodka. Herman \\"Kofi\\" Bailey died in 1981 in Atlanta, Georgia.  Professional career  His work and illustrations have been described as \\"... Combining both geometric and figural elements, he often used massive shapes to surround the sensitively rendered figures that serve as focal points for most of his compositions.\\" Geometric forms are often make up the background, as if to appear emerging from it. Bailey usually used charcoal or conté as a medium, experimenting with oil and acrylic painting as well. Sometimes he used three to four mediums in an artwork and color often took a secondary role in his work, preferring to rely on earth tones. Bailey was influenced by artists such as Goya, Rico Lebrun, Jacob Lawrence and Charles White. He described himself in 1967 as a \\"representational\\" artist \\"rather than \\"abstract\\" because his work is committed to the masses who, he feels, \\"want to see art that deals with man, art which tries to express the varying moods of man; and man is my principal concern.\\"\\" In 1967 Bailey was artist-in-residence at Spelman College which held an exhibition about Bailey's work that was created while he was living in Ghana in 1962–1966. = Political and racial themes = Poster created by Bailey for Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign, 1968 His artwork often reflected influences of Pan-Africanism. Portraits of Kwame Nkrumah often appeared, with Nkrumah, then President of Ghana, depicted as a heroic figure in front of a black star. While living in Ghana he served as an art teacher and the artist-in-residence to Nkrumah until the leader was deposed in 1966. Bailey also covered other areas of the African-American experience such as Black Power, anticolonialism, and African-American civil rights. Black women and children often made frequent appearances as well. These socially aware and often politically charged artworks reflected the racism experienced by Africans and African Americans primarily in the 20th century. The stark contrast of the black inks or charcoals on white paper at times dramatizes the conflicts of blacks and whites. His work is commonly found in art and literature about the Civil Rights Movement . While living in Atlanta he created posters for the H. Rap Brown Center, a venue that was frequented by members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Eventually he would create posters for and serve as newsletter illustrator for the SNCC. After the Six-Day War, which Israel won, SNCC launched an anti-Zionist campaign featuring anti-Semitic images. Bailey created an illustration featuring an Israeli firing squad shooting a group of Arabs with a caption reading: \\"This is the Gaza Strip, Palestine, not Dachau, Germany\\". While some SNCC officers distanced themselves from the article and image, the SNCC's pro- Palestinian stand cut support from many Jewish organizations. Bailey continued to create at times controversial comics for SNCC including depictions of Moshe Dayan, believed by some to be stereotyping of Jewish financial dominance and by others as showing the financial dependencies between the US and Israeli military's. The Palestine Problem, another comic by Bailey during this time, connects United States racial violence, military imperialism in Vietnam and the Arab world, and the Afro-Arab freedom struggle. = Reception = James Early cites Kofi's work as a major influence, describing the illustrations by Bailey as \\"among the great, energizing artistic expressions created in the crucible of social justice activism and organizing that was Atlanta in the 1960s.\\" Artist and art historian Floyd Coleman described Bailey as a rule breaker: \\"Although he didn't follow the rules he was committed to the struggle of African Americans and set a standard in his work that many of us tried to emulate.\\" Carmen Riddle described Bailey as \\"a genius, a pure genius at his art.\\"  Notable collections  * California African American Museum * Hampton University * National Museum of African American History and Culture * National Civil Rights Museum * Spelman College * University Museums at the University of Delaware  Notable exhibitions  * Showcase & Tell: Treasures from the Spelman College Permanent Collection, 2009, Spelman College, Atlanta * Tradition Redefined: The Larry and Brenda Thompson Collection of African American Art, 2009, University of Maryland, College Park * A Century of African American Art: The Paul R.

It was released on the App Store on March 29, 2010, on the Android Market on December 24, 2010, and on the Amazon Appstore in the first quarter of 2011. Story  The prologue of the game states that four heroes were tasked with guarding the seal of the evil dragon Ladon after the events of the first game, as Regret is nowhere to be found. However, humans slowly become corrupted, so the gods of Zenonia have no choice but to wipe the memories of everyone in the land to restore peace using the \\"Tree of Life\\". Now, the residents of Deva Castle search for a way to restore their lost memories, as well as keep Ladon imprisoned, by finding the four gems. Each of the four selectable characters has a prologue specific to them that sets up the events of the game, in which the four characters are inevitably imprisoned in the dungeon of Deva Castle. After escaping, the characters are given an ultimatum: work for Zavkiel to retrieve the four gems and, as a result, have their wishes granted, or be re- imprisoned. After choosing the former, the adventure begins. Each of the characters have their own back-story and motivations. Daza, the warrior, is the last remaining member of the Minotaur tribe; Ecne, the gunslinger, is on a mission to find her older brother; Morpice, the magician, was taken in, and subsequently trained, by the magician Zealous after being orphaned; and Lu, the paladin, wants to save his grandfather.  Gameplay  Much like its predecessor, Zenonia 2 still features real time combat and exploration. The player has four characters to choose from: Daza, Ecne, Morpice, and Lu. Daza is a melee-class warrior with high strength and speed but low defense. Ecne is a ranged-class shooter with high evasion and attack power but low defense. Morpice is a ranged-class magician who relies on his pool of SP (skill points) for his magic attacks. Lu is a melee-class paladin with high defense and healing spells but low attack power. All characters are controlled by using the virtual d-pad, which is located in the lower left corner of the screen. It can be adjusted along with the action button located on the lower right of the screen. Zenonia 2 adheres to the formula for action role-playing games, with questing, skill trees, leveling up, and battles. It also has a PvP (Player verses Player) system, in which users can test their characters against other user's characters.  Reception  Zenonia 2 has had a largely positive reception. It has received a 7/10 from Pocket Gamer, earning a bronze award, but with criticism directed toward the lack of substantial changes from the first game. Slide to Play gave it a 4/4, labeling it a \\"Must Have\\" title and saying that, \\"The iPhone’s first game-changing RPG is back and yet again setting the bar higher.\\" 148Apps gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, saying that while Zenonia 2 was no longer the best RPG of its time on the App Store like its predecessor, it was still \\"...an excellent, traditional romp through an old-school world.\\"  References   External links  * 2010 video games Android (operating system) games IOS games Multiplayer and single-player video games Role-playing video games Video games developed in South Korea Action role- playing video games ","title":"Zenonia 2"},{"id":"31484196","text":"The , published by Chicago Shimpo, Inc.

By 1995, assimilation and a decrease in size of the ethnic Japanese community in Chicago reduced the community's demand for a Japanese-language newspaper, causing the Chicago Shimpo to struggle. The newspaper had trouble with finances during the decade leading into 1995. During the year of 1995, the newspaper circulation had stagnated at 5,000, and Sugano was unable to find a buyer for the newspaper.

Issues previously discussed events that occurred months before publication, while after Sugano's fixes, the newspaper had a time lag of one week.

He once said that it's the only thing that \\"excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else.\\" Painting children, in particular represented rebirth and the infinite. Over his career Van Gogh did not make many paintings of children, but those he completed were special to him. During the ten years of Van Gogh's career as a painter, from 1881 to 1890, his work changed and grew richer, particularly in how he used color and techniques symbolically or evocatively. His early works were earth-toned and dull. After a transformative period in Paris, Van Gogh embarked on his most prolific periods starting in Arles, in the south of France and continuing until his final days in Auvers-sur-Oise. During those times his work became more colorful and more reflective of influences, such as Impressionism and Japonism. Japonism influences are understood in the painting of a young girl, La Mousmé. Among others, he was inspired by the work of Jean-François Millet which he emulated in First Steps and Evening: The Watch. Van Gogh enjoyed painting portraits when he had available models. Possibly the greatest impact to his paintings of children came out of the friendship with Joseph Roulin and the many paintings of his family. Portraits Van Gogh, known for his landscapes, seemed to find painting portraits his greatest ambition. He said of portrait studies, \\"the only thing in painting that excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else.\\" To his sister he wrote, \\"I should like to paint portraits which appear after a century to people living then as apparitions. By which I mean that I do not endeavor to achieve this through photographic resemblance, but my means of our impassioned emotions -- that is to say using our knowledge and our modern taste for color as a means of arriving at the expression and the intensification of the character.\\" =Convey comfort= Of painting portraits, Van Gogh wrote: \\"in a picture I want to say something comforting as music is comforting. I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we seek to communicate by the actual radiance and vibration of our coloring.\\" =Infants= Van Gogh saw \\"something deeper, more intimate, more eternal than the ocean in the expression of the eyes of a little baby when it wakes in the morning.\\" Infants which represented \\"rebirth and immortality\\" to Van Gogh and lightened his mood. When he had the opportunity, Van Gogh enjoyed painting them. =Peasant genre= The \\"peasant genre\\" that greatly influenced Van Gogh began in the 1840s with the works of Jean-François Millet, Jules Breton, and others. In 1885 Van Gogh described the painting of peasants as the most essential contribution to modern art. He described the works of Millet and Breton of religious significance, \\"something on high.\\" Referring to painting of peasants Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo: \\"How shall I ever manage to paint what I love so much?\\" This was a decided transition in approach to paintings from his earlier works influenced by Dutch masters, such as Rembrandt. His goal at that time was to paint them as he saw them and based upon his emotional response to them. His early works of peasants were in muted tones. As he was influenced by Impressionism and the use of complementary colors, his style changed dramatically. =Models= As much as Van Gogh liked to paint portraits of people, there were few opportunities for him to pay or arrange for models for his work. He found a bounty in the work of the Roulin family, for which he made several images of each person. In exchange, Van Gogh gave the Roulin's one painting for each family member. Netherlands Boy Cutting Grass with a Sickle, made in 1881, is owned by the Kröller-Müller Museum. Of a study that Van Gogh made for Girl in a Wood or Girl in White in the Woods, he remarked at how much he enjoyed the work and explains how he wishes to trigger the audience's senses and how they may experience the painting: \\"The other study in the wood is of some large green beech trunks on a stretch of ground covered with dry sticks, and the little figure of a girl in white. There was the great difficulty of keeping it clear, and of getting space between the trunks standing at different distances - and the place and relative bulk of those trunks change with the perspective - to make it so that one can breathe and walk around in it, and to make you smell the fragrance of the wood.\\" In The Girl in the Woods the girl is overshadowed by the immense oak trees. The painting may be reminiscent for Van Gogh of the times in his youth he fled to the Zundert Woods to escape from his family. { Boy Cutting Grass with a Sickle, 1881, Black chalk and watercolor, reportedly at Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo (F851) Girl in a Wood, August 1882, Oil on paper mounted on canvas, Kröller-Müller Museum, Netherlands (F8) Girl in the Woods, 1882, Private Collection (F8a) } A Girl in the Street, Two Coaches in the Background and Peasant Woman with Child on Her Lap are both part of private collections. Van Gogh was attracted to Sien partly for her pregnancy and made use of the opportunity to paint her infant boy. { A Girl in the Street, Two Coaches in the Background, 1882, Private Collection (F13) Sien Nursing Baby, 1882, Private Collection (F1068) Peasant Woman with Child on Her Lap, 1885, Private Collection (F149) } Van Gogh reached a point around 1885 when he was looking to free himself physically, emotionally and artistically from the gray colors of his art and life, moving away from Nuenen to develop, as author Albert Lubin describes, a more \\"imaginative, colorful art that suited him much better.\\" Parisian influences Act of Sitting Little Girl, Spring 1886, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F215)In 1886, Van Gogh left the Netherlands never to return. He moved to Paris to live with his brother Theo, a Parisian art dealer. Van Gogh entered Paris as a shy, somber man. While his personality would never change, he emerged artistically into what one critic described as a \\"singing bird\\". Although Van Gogh had been influenced by his cousin Anton Mauve and the Hague School, as well as the great Dutch masters, coming to Paris meant that he was exposed to Impressionism, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese art (see Japonism). His circle of friends included Camille Pissarro, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Paul Signac, and others. The works of the Japanese printmakers Hiroshige and Hokusai greatly influenced Van Gogh, both for the subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors without shadow. In the two years from 1886 through 1888 he spent working in Paris, Van Gogh explored the various genres, creating his own unique style. Arles Van Gogh moved to Arles in southern France where he produced some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as portraits of members of the Roulin family and La Mousmé. The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content. In a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \\"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color.\\" As a means of explanation, Vincent explains that being like music means being comforting. Van Gogh painted the family of postman Joseph Roulin in the winter of 1888, every member more than once. The family included Joseph Roulin, the postman, his wife Augustine and their three children. Van Gogh described the family as \\"really French, even if they look like Russians.\\" Over the course of just a few weeks, he painted the Augustine and the children several times. The reason for multiple works was partly so that the Roulin's could have a painting of each family member, so that with these pictures and others, their bedroom became a virtual \\"museum of modern art.\\" The family's consent to modeling for Van Gogh also gave him the opportunity to create more portraits, which was both meaningful and inspirational to Van Gogh. Van Gogh used color for the dramatic effect. Each family member clothes are bold primary colors and van Gogh used contrasting colors in the background to intensify the impact of the work. =Augustine and Marcelle Roulin= In Philadelphia Museum of Art's Portrait of Madame Augustine Roulin and Baby Marcelle Augustine holds baby Marcelle who was born in July, 1888. The mother, relaxed and her face in a shadow, is passive. We can see by the size of Augustine's sloping shoulders, arm, and hands that she worked hard to take care of her family. For instance, there were no modern conveniences like washing machines. In a traditional pose of mothers and new babies, Augustine is holding her baby upright, supporting the baby's back by her right arm and steadying the baby's midsection with her left hand. Marcelle, whose face is directed outward, is more active and engages the audience. Van Gogh used heavy outlines in blue around the images of mother and baby. To symbolize the closeness of mother and baby, he used adjacent colors of the color wheel, green, blue and yellow in this work. The vibrant yellow background creates a warm glow around mother and baby, like a very large halo. Of his use of color, Van Gogh wrote: \\"instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have before my eyes, I use color... to express myself more forcibly.\\" The work contains varying brushstrokes, some straight, some turbulent - which allow us to see the movement of energy \\"like water in a rushing stream.\\" Émile Bernard, Van Gogh's friend, was the initial owner of this painting in its provenance. =Marcelle Roulin= Marcelle Roulin, the youngest child, was born on 31 July 1888, and four months old, when Van Gogh made her portraits. She was painted three times by herself and twice on her mother’s lap. The three works show the same head and shoulders image of Marcelle with her chubby cheeks and arms against a green background. When Johanna van Gogh, pregnant at the time, saw the painting, she wrote: \\"I like to imagine that ours will be just as strong, just as beautiful – and that his uncle will one day paint his portrait!\\" A version titled Roulin's Baby resides at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In addition to the mother-daughter works where Marcelle is visible, Van Gogh also created several works where Augustine rocked her unseen cradle by a string. =Camille Roulin= Camille Roulin, the middle child, was born in Lambesc in southern France, on 10 July 1877, and died on 4 June 1922. When his father had to answer to letters, he served as his secretary.Letter xxxLetter of Joseph Roulin to Vincent van Gogh, 24 October 1889; see Van Crimpen & Berends-Alberts (1990), pp. 1957-58 (Nr. 816) - see previous note. When his portrait was painted, Camille was eleven years of age. The Van Gogh Museum painting shows Camille's head and shoulders. Yellow brush strokes behind him are evocative of the sun. The very similar painting resides at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (F537). In The Schoolboy with Uniform Cap Camille seems to be staring off in space. His arm is over the back of a chair, mouth gaped open, possibly lost in thought. This was the larger of the two works made of Camille. =Armand Roulin= Armand Roulin, the eldest son, was born on 5 May 1871 in Lambesc, and died on 14 November 1945. He was 17 years of age when portrayed by Van Gogh.Letters of Joseph Roulin to Vincent van Gogh, 22 May and 24 October 1889; see Van Crimpen, Han & Berends-Alberts, Monique: De brieven van Vincent van Gogh, SDU Uitgeverij, The Hague 1990, pp. 1878-79 (No. 779); 1957-58 (Nr. 816) - both letters, written in French, are hitherto only published in Dutch translation. Van Gogh's works depict a serious young man who at the time the paintings were made had left his parents’ home, working as a blacksmith's apprentice. The Museum Folkwang work depicts Armand in what are likely his best clothes: an elegant fedora, vivid yellow coat, black waistcoat and tie. Armand's manner seems a bit sad, or perhaps bored by sitting. His figure fills the picture plane giving the impression that he is a confident, masculine young man. The second work, with his body slightly turned aside and his eyes looking down, appears to be a sad young man. Even the angle of the hat seems to indicate sadness. Both museum paintings were made on large canvas, 65 x 54 cm. =La Mousmé= La Mousmé also known as La Mousmé, Sitting in a Cane Chair, Half-Figure (with a branch of oleander) was painted Van Gogh in 1888 while living in Arles, which Van Gogh dubbed \\"the Japan of the south\\". Retreating from the city, he hoped that his time in Arles would evoke in his work the simple, yet dramatic expression of Japanese art. Inspired by Pierre Loti's novel Madame Chrysanthème and Japanese artwork, Vincent painted La Mousmé, a well-dressed Japanese girl. He wrote in a letter to his brother: \\"It took me a whole week...but I had to reserve my mental energy to do the mousmé well. A mousmé is a Japanese girl—Provençal in this case—twelve to fourteen years old.\\" Van Gogh's use of color is intended to be symbolic. The audience is drawn in by his use of contracting patterns and colors that bring in an energy and intensity to the work. Complementary shades of blue and orange, a stylistic deviation from colors of Impressionist paintings that he acquired during his exploration in Paris, stand out against the spring-like pale green in the background. La Mousmé's outfit is a blend of modern and traditional. Her outfit is certainly modern. The bright colors of skirt and jacket are of the southern region of Arles. Regarding Van Gogh's painting of her features, his greatest attention is focused on the girls face, giving her the coloring of a girl from Arles, but with a Japanese influence. The young lady's posture mimics that of the oleander. The flowering oleander, like the girl, is in the blossoming stage of life. =Girl with Ruffled Hair (The Mudlark)= Another painting from this time Girl with Ruffled Hair (The Mudlark) resides at Musée des Beaux-Arts, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland (F535). Saint-Rémy In May 1889 Van Gogh voluntarily entered the Saint-Paul asylum near Saint-Rémy in Provence. There Van Gogh had access to an adjacent cell he used as his studio. He was initially confined to the immediate asylum grounds and painted (without the bars) the world he saw from his room, such as ivy covered trees, lilacs, and irises of the garden. Through the open bars Van Gogh could also see an enclosed wheat field, subject of many paintings at Saint-Rémy. As he ventured outside of the asylum walls, he painted the wheat fields, olive groves, and cypress trees of the surrounding countryside, which he saw as \\"characteristic of Provence.\\" Over the course of the year, he painted about 150 canvases. =First Steps= First Steps is one of twenty-one paintings that Van Gogh made in Saint-Rémy that were \\"translations\\" of the work of Jean-François Millet. He used black and white images of prints, reproductions or photographs to \\"pose as subject\\" and then \\"improvised color on it.\\" This source of the image for this work, made January 1890, was a photograph of Millet's First Steps painting. Theo had sent the photograph of Millet's First Steps with perfect timing. Theo's wife, Jo, was pregnant with their child, so it had special meaning to the family. In addition Van Gogh was still saddened by recent seizure episodes that impacted his mental clarity. Rather than vibrant colors, here he used softer shades of yellow, green and blue. The picture depicts the father, having put down his tools, holding his arms outstretched for his child's first steps. The mother protectively guides the child's movement. =Evening: The Watch= Like the painting First Steps, the painting Night or Evening: The Watch depicts happy life of a rural family: father, mother and child. Here the image seems bathed in yellow light like that of the Holy Family. A lamp casts long shadows of many colors on the floor of the humble cottage. The painting includes soft shades of green and purple. The work was based on a print by Millet from his series, the four times of day. Van Gogh Museum says of Millet's influence on Van Gogh: \\"Millet's paintings, with their unprecedented depictions of peasants and their labors, mark a turning point in 19th-century art. Before Millet, peasant figures were just one of many elements in picturesque or nostalgic scenes. In Millet's work, individual men and women became heroic and real. Millet was the only major artist of the Barbizon School who was not interested in 'pure' landscape painting.\\" Theo wrote Van Gogh: \\"The copies after Millet are perhaps the best things you have done yet, and induce me to believe that on the day you turn to painting compositions of figures, we may look forward to great surprises.\\" Auvers-sur-Ouise After leaving the south of France, Van Gogh's brother, Theo and artist Camille Pissarro developed a plan for Van Gogh to go to Auvers-sur-Oise with a letter of introduction for Dr. Paul Gachet, a homeopathic physician and art patron who lived in Auvers. Van Gogh had a room at the inn Auberge Ravoux in Auvers and was under the care and supervision of Dr. Gachet with whom he grew to have a close relationship, \\"something like another brother.\\" For a time, Van Gogh seemed to improve. He began to paint at such a steady pace, there was barely space in his room for all the finished paintings. From May until his death on July 29, Van Gogh made about 70 paintings, more than one a day, and many drawings..\\" Van Gogh painted buildings around the town of Auvers, such as The Church at Auvers, portraits, and the nearby fields. =Portraits of Little Children= Two Young Girls, also called Two Children is owned by Musée d'Orsay, Paris. Another version of Two Children is part of a private collection (F784). { Two Young Girls or Two Children, 1890, Musée d'Orsay, Paris, France (F783) Two Children, 1890, Private Collection (F784) Child with Orange, June–July, 1890, Private Collection (F785) } =The Little Arlesienne= The Little Arlesienne (Head of a Girl) is found at the Kröller-Müller Museum. =Young Man with Cornflower= The Young Man with Cornflower was made in June, 1890 in Auvers. =Adeline Ravoux= During his time in Auvers, Van Gogh rented a room at the inn of Arthur Ravoux, whose sixteen-year-old daughter sat for three paintings. Van Gogh depicts Adeline, rather than a photographic resemblance, with \\"impassioned aspects\\" of contemporary life through the \\"modern taste for color.\\" Van Gogh wrote to his brother: “Last week I did a portrait of a girl about sixteen, in blue against a blue background, the daughter of the people with whom I am staying. I have given her this portrait, but I made a variation of it for you, a size 15 canvas.\\" Adeline Ravoux was asked sixty-six years later what she remembered of Van Gogh. Before he painted her portrait, van Gogh had only made polite exchanges of conversation with Adeline. One day, though, he asked her if she would be pleased if he were to do her portrait. After obtaining her parents permission, she sat one afternoon in which he completed the painting. He smoked continually on his pipe as he worked, and thanked her for sitting very still. She was very proud to sit for the painting she described as a \\"symphony in blue\\". Van Gogh thought she was sixteen, but she was just thirteen years of age at the time. Adeline sat just once, but three paintings were made of her: * For the sitting, Adeline was dressed in a blue dress, the background was blue and her hair ribbon was blue. * Van Gogh made a copy of the original painting for his brother, with slightly different shades of blue. * In a slightly different pose or aspect, Adeline appears against a background of roses, portions of a still life of roses (F595) that he completed just a few days prior to this painting. This painting is owned by the Cleveland Museum of Art. Neither she nor her parents appreciated Van Gogh's style and were disappointed that it was not true to life. Yet, even though Adeline was a young girl at the time, pictures of her as a young woman showed that van Gogh painted her as she would become. { Portrait of Adeline Ravoux (Half-Figure), 1890, Private Collection (F768) Portrait of Adeline Ravoux, June, 1890, Private Collection (F769) Portrait of Adeline Ravoux, June 1890, Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio (F786) } References External links Vincent van Gogh paintings of Arles Vincent van Gogh paintings of Saint-Rémy Vincent van Gogh paintings of Auvers Series of Vincent van Gogh paintings 19th-century portraits 1888 paintings 1889 paintings 1880s paintings 1890s paintings Collections of the Van Gogh Museum Paintings of children ","title":"Paintings of Children (Van Gogh series)"},{"id":"31484216","text":"The Pacific Biological Station (acronym: PBS) is located on Hammond Bay Road in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. Established in 1908, with the Rev. George William Taylor as its first director and sole employee, it is the oldest fisheries research center on the Pacific coast. Operated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the station forms a network with eight other scientific facilities. Together with the St. Andrew's Biological Station in New Brunswick, the Pacific Biological Station was designated a National Historic Event in 2011. Research Its research facilities include the research vessel CCGS W.E. Ricker and an experimental fish farm. Key research areas are stock assessment, aquaculture, marine environment, habitat science, ocean science, and productivity. Ongoing elasmobranch research at the PBS includes basking sharks, skate tagging, Pacific Spiny Dogfish, Blue Shark tagging, and development of aging methods. Since 1984, Station researchers store their finding in the GFCATCH database, which holds a record of all specimens removed from fisheries for study. This system was later altered in 1991 to record trawl trips and other cruising information. GFCATCH has also added records of the station's cruising and trawling activities as well as shipping patterns since 1954. This data is gathered from both official ship logs and first-hand accounts from the crews and fishery scientists that attended those voyages. The database also keeps a catalog of the species that were studied on each expedition, ranging from sea sponges and jelly fish to various arthropods, like shrimp. The list also categorizes various worm species, such as leeches and other annelids.  History  The station conducts research expeditions and trawling missions along Canada's west coast, with expeditions to the Strait of Georgia, Queen Charlotte Sound and the Hecate Strait. Between 1944 and 2002, the Fisheries and Oceans Canada launched 652 research cruises from the station. These cruises allowed researchers direct access to the fisheries were they investigated various aquatic animals and their ecologies. One prominent species in the Station's research has been the groundfish. These research cruises are all cataloged using an online database, GFCruise. The vessels chartered for these voyages included Investigator #1, which operated from January 1948 to November 1964. Other vessels included the AP Knight, G.B. Reed, Ocean Traveller, Gambler 1, Star Wars II, and Rupert Brand V. Scientists and researchers from many different backgrounds worked at the station during its long tenure. These researchers included freshwater biologist Ferris Neave, who worked at the station from 1939 until he retired in 1966. Richard J. Beamish, a Canadian fisheries scientists, served as a groundfish researcher and later director of the station from 1980 to 1993. Statistician also work with the researchers to measure stock assessments and fishery management. John T. Schnute, a mathematician from Texas State University, worked at the station for 28 years. The station celebrated its 100th year of research in 2008. The centennial celebration included guest lecturers Mark Angelo and Rick Troll, and attract 20,000 visitors from multiple fields of research. The celebration also included guided tours of the station's facilities, including a library and containers of circulating sea water to store specimens.  Scientific Discoveries  A report from the Canadian Chemistry and Metallurgy journal found early studies from the station neglected to account for chemical factors in the fisheries they were observing This included the oxygen content of a specimen's habitat and the materials that make up the ocean sediment were many roundworms live. Studies headed by Richard Beamish discovered new techniques for determining the ages of fish. This discovery has altered the way many fisheries monitor their stocks to prevent themselves from over harvesting. The study also found the Pacific ocean perch could live up to 100 years. Station fishery research has also contributed to mathematical studies to improve management of major Pacific fisheries. These studies also provided possible alternatives to existing fishery models and offer greater insight into the relationship between the fishery activities and the Pacific environment.

Career Hyak was built at Portland, Oregon in 1909 at the shipyard of Joseph Supple for the Kitsap County Transportation Company.Newell, Ships of the Inland Sea, at 190 and 209. The vessel was , rated at 195 tons, and was equipped with a triple expansion steam engine with cylinders 12, 18 and 32 inches in diameter with an 18-inch bore stroke on all cylinders. The engine worked on steam produced at 225 pounds of pressure, and generated 750 horsepower. Hyak was brought up from the Columbia River around the Olympic Peninsula by Capt. J.J. Reynolds. It was reported that during this trip the vessel was at times able to reach a speed of 20 miles per hour. Hyak was placed on routes running from Seattle to Bainbridge Island and Poulsbo, serving Port Madison, Suquamish, Seabold, Keyport, Lemola, Scandia, and Pearson. The vessel was also used for excursions. Like many other Puget Sound steamers, Hyak used Pier 3 (now Pier 54) as its Seattle terminal.Faber, Steamer's Wake, at 131, 135, 144, 165. Hyak was one of the faster vessels on Puget Sound and was a favorite among passengers. Hyak was one of the last of the wooden-hulled steamships of Puget Sound to operate in regular commercial service. From 1935 to 1938 Hyak was owned by the Puget Sound Navigation Company, then the dominant steamboat and ferry company on Puget Sound.Kline, Mary S., and Bayless, G.A., Ferryboats -- A Legend on Puget Sound, Bayless Books, Seattle, WA 1983 , at page 350.

This background prepared him for 13 years as a high school teacher and principal at Thomas Jefferson High School, while he started his family in his home town. A career change in 1962 landed Carl with the Oakland A's when he accepted a position as minority owner of the Kansas City Athletics team after being 'romanced' into this capacity by his cousin Charlie O.

So, the 1968 season was our first in Oakland, CA. This was Oakland's first MLB team. With the A's move to Oakland, California in 1968, Carl & his daughter Nancy moved from Texas to Oakland so he could manage the business. Carl was a private and humble individual. In the off-season, Carl enjoyed teaching 'Business Law' part-time at Laney College, in Oakland, CA. Minority owner Carl did not seek attention to himself, but he played a huge role in the success of the Oakland A's, as General Manager and Vice- President of operations throughout the 1970s. He was the peace-keeper of the organization. In addition to working with Charlie to build the championship teams, it was also Carl's job to implement and manage Charlie O's promotional ideas, such as the bright yellow and green uniforms, orange baseballs, Harvey the mechanical rabbit, Oakland A's Promotion Days, the Finley Fireworks, Charlie the Mule, and the A's 'Rally Railroad Bell Ringer'. Carl was the one who spoke at local organizations on behalf of the Oakland A's, dealt with players' contract reviews, and attended MLB annual owners' meetings between 1975 and 1980. Carl communicated regularly the Oakland A's Minor League Division, and was a major decision maker in bringing new talent to the majors. Charlie & Carl spoke often on the phone to make decisions - sometimes, when Charlie would fire an employee, Carl would quietly put the person back on the payroll the next day. Carl had the final say on everything on a day-to-day basis at the Coliseum. He would sign off on the A's roster every late afternoon when the team was in town. Carl also dealt with the media, advertisers, season ticket holders, security, etc. Whenever a fan was hit by a foul ball, he had to see that person afterward.

It was the first Zimbabwean film since independence set during the Rhodesian Bush War, and served as a tribute to the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army's many female guerrillas. Plot At the height of the Rhodesian Bush War, Florence, an impulsive teenage peasant girl from the Mashonaland countryside, decides to run away and join the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) after her father is detained by the Rhodesian security forces. She is joined on her journey by her friend, Nyasha; together, the duo trek across the border to a ZANLA training camp in neighbouring Mozambique. While undergoing guerrilla training, the girl adopt new revolutionary identities: Nyasha chooses the nom de guerre \\"Liberty\\", signifying her desire for independence, while Florence brands herself \\"Flame\\" to represent her passionate nature. Flame becomes pregnant after being raped by Comrade Che, an unscrupulous ZANLA political commissar. Although initially devastated, she reconciles herself to raising her infant son in the camp. Flame subsequently survives a Rhodesian air strike that kills both Che and their child. Determining she has nothing to live for but the war effort, she throws herself into her training and soon distinguishes herself in several ZANLA raids targeting infrastructure and commercial farms. The end of the war and the election of Robert Mugabe in 1980 proves bittersweet for Flame, who finds it difficult adjusting to civilian life. Many unemployed ZANLA veterans, including Flame and her new husband, feel disillusioned and neglected by Mugabe's government. Flame subsequently relocates to Harare, where Liberty has used her background as an intelligence officer to secure a lucrative administrative post. The reunion between the two is somewhat tense, as Flame wants financial assistance but Liberty no longer believes in the collectivist lifestyle of mutual support and shared purpose once pursued in the guerrilla camps. Five years after the war's end, Flame and Liberty attend a Heroes' Day party in an increasingly authoritarian and corrupt Zimbabwe.

She is Director of the architecture firm \\"Cassandra Complex\\". She emerged in the public spotlight in 2000 because of the controversial 'Newman House', located in St Kilda, designed for media and football identity Sam Newman. She is also known for her works on \\"The Smith Great Aussie Home\\" and the BHP Billiton Healesville Sanctuary \\"Platypusary\\". Her work has received a number of awards as well as being featured in many local and international publications. Design career Cassandra completed the Bachelor of Architecture at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in 1998. During her studies she traveled internationally to produce a documentary on Architects practicing at the turn of the millennium. Among these were Sir Norman Foster, Peter Eisenman, and Jean Nouvel. Whilst in New York she met Richard Serra and was influenced by his sculpture in its original setting in a converted New York City garage. The effect of this can be seen later in the design of her own house, \\"Chameleon\\". Interior of Chameleon, 2001. Back in Melbourne, in her earlier career she received guidance from Tom Kovac and Edmond Corrigan and soon registered her own practice which she named the Cassandra Complex. In 2005 Fahey was engaged in a Masters in Contemporary Art at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne. Fahey developed a unique approach to architecture using different styles in each of her projects rather than developing a common theme. Her influences within this \\"no one way\\" approach have been \\"so-called nature\\", Emily Kame Kngwarreye and the \\"whole bang lot\\". Notable works =Sam Newman House= Fahey was given a completely open brief for the Sam Newman House—named White Noise after Robert Venturis Term 'Billboard Façade'—in St. Kilda West, Melbourne. It features Cassandra's 9 m by 8 m façade design comprising patterned glass and contains a Pamela Anderson mural, with a garage door opening at her mouth. Post-modernism co-habits seamlessly with minimalism. It was completed in 2001 and its mural received the Best New Residential Building in the RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards. The design of the house's exterior was controversial however, encountering objections and incorrect planning applications. It became known as the house that Melbournians love to hate. \\"White Noise\\", Newman House =BHP Billiton Platypusary= BHP Billiton Platypussary at Healesville Sanctuary.

His work includes many building types, including residential, ecclesiastical, educational, commercial, and prefabricated kit buildings. Like his mentor Robin Boyd, Jones has continued to experiment with ideas of space and environmental design. His architectural works promote passive environmental systems, and has become a leader in the implementation of sustainable design practices in Western Australia. History Raymond Jones was born in Geelong, Victoria, Australia on 18 July 1925. From 1943 to 1945, Jones joined the Royal Australian Navy, and was aboard the cruiser during the Philippines Campaign. In 1946, Jones began his architectural studies at the University of Melbourne, and was taught by Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds, John Mockridge, and Frederick Romberg. Jones took a particular interest in the works of Boyd, particularly in relation to Boyd's ideas of spatial continuity between building and landscape, as well as his environmental design philosophy. Upon completion of his architectural degree in 1951, Jones worked for Melbourne architectural firm, Yuncken, Freeman Brothers, Griffiths & Simpson (now known as Yuncken Freeman). At the same time, Jones became part of the design team that won a competition to design an Olympic stadium in Carlton, Victoria, as well as housing for the new town of Eildon, Victoria, which had been constructed to support the construction of Lake Eildon.\\"Pioneering ecological architect celebrated.\\", University of Western Australia, 22 March 2011 During his studies, Jones played Australian rules football for Collingwood and Melbourne from 1946 to 1949. In 1953, he later played in a premiership with the South Fremantle Football Club. Jones moved to Western Australia in 1953 and began his own practice in Perth. During the 1950s Jones had an increased number of staff, ranging from young architects and students, which included; Wallace Greenham, Walter Hunter, Robert Hart, Ken Yewers, and Michael Patroni. From 1966 to 1967, Jones had practiced in partnership with Montague Grant, going by the name \\"Jones Grant Architects\\". His first significant architectural project was his own residence, the 'Jones House', in Haining Avenue, Cottesloe, where Jones heavily references the architectural teachings of Boyd Jones begins to experiment with space and structure in responding to the environment, through passive ventilation, northern glazing and thermal massing Jones is also noted for his many ecclesiastical projects, and completed a total of six churches for the Catholic Church. All of his churches were inspired by cave-like catacombs, a common metaphor he used in the design of communal spaces. The Church of St Cecilia, in Kenmore Crescent Floreat, references this cave-like metaphor, and departs from the typical cruciform plan. Instead, St. Cecilia's pentagonal form was based on a total of ten planes (five walls planes and five roof planes), which symbolised the Ten Commandments and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Jones' educational projects, particularly his work at Preschool Centre in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle; New Day Nursery in High Street/Parry Street, Fremantle; and 'Winterfold Primary School', in Annie Street, Hamilton Hill, have been designed to enable variable use, through the use of large internal and external centralised spaces. This relationship between space and environmental design culminates in his development of the Tetrakit system. Working in the cyclonic areas of north-western Australia in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy in 1974, Jones with the help of structural engineer George Katieva, devised prefabricated kit homes. Constructed of prefabricated frames and panels, the Tetrakit kit home would resist the strong wind pressures during a cyclone. Roofs and walls inclined at 15 degrees balanced the cyclonic winds loads placed on the building. Contribution His interests and passions in ecological design continued, particularly through the use of skillion roofing and courtyard spaces, as well as passive ventilation and site orientation, as environmental design strategies. Jones is also attributed to the innovative use of concrete raft slabs and swimming pools to suburban housing, in controlling interior temperatures. Climate also begun to inform Jones' approach to architecture, experimenting with how architecture is best suited to its particular site and environment. Current thoughts on architecture Jones has been a lifelong critic of active heating and cooling systems, particularly mechanical air conditioning,Bevis, Stephen, \\"No need for home air-con, says top architect\\", The West Australian, 1 April 2011 and always strived to create buildings which rely on more passive systems. He states that, \\"We ought to legislate that there is no air-conditioning in new homes and that a building license should only be issued if they build along renewable energy principles. You can do it well without building expensively\\". Jones is not impressed by a lot of modern architecture in Perth, saying he's depressed by the \\"proliferation of ugliness\\".Buck, Veronica, \\"Ahead of the pack in architectural thinking\\", ABC News, 24 March 2011 \\"We are just not going forward at all, we are going backward\\". He blames Perth's ugly, impractical and unsustainable modern homes on the laziness and expediency of politicians, city planners and mass-marketed project homes. Mr Jones says he is a crusader for sensible, environmentally aware design. Jones is still practicing as an architect as of 2011 and has no interest in quitting entirely any time soon, instead focusing on projects of interest.

Initially introduced as a 3-month love interest for TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell), Ruakere's contract was extended to a regular role. Initially pitched to be of European descent, under the suggestion of the show's Māori adviser, the character was rewritten to be a fluent Te Reo speaking Maori. Roimata arrived to the show in early 2011 as part of a double act with fellow new character, Jill Kingsbury (Natalie Medlock). Used as a focal point for the TK and Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) love triangle, the 2011 Winter Season climaxed with TK's and Roimata aborted wedding. Roimata's following story lines saw her support her criminal father, become a victim of sexual assault, end her marriage after having an affair with Josh Gallagher (Chris Tempest), and ultimately die as the result of an explosion in the 2013 Christmas cliffhanger. The character of Roimata was praised alongside Ruakere's acting. The 2012 sexual assault storyline was also singled out by many reviewers as not only a highlight of the show's 20th year, but also a true and emotionally stimulating storyline. Creation and casting Following the temporary departure of the Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) character in late 2010, producers decided to create a new love interest for TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) so as to create a love triangle upon Sarah's ultimate return. Originally the character was set to be of European descent however Māori adviser, Ngamaru Raerino fought with writers until they wrote the character as a good looking Māori who could speak the native language fluently. The character was given a screen time of 6 months to play out the storyline before departing. Television presenter Shavaughn Ruakere landed the role and stated, \\"It's really exciting for me. I'm soaking it all up and loving it.\\" She described joining Shortland Street as a step forward in the right direction for her career. The character was written alongside another new nurse, Jill Kingsbury (Natalie Medlock) and a double act was established between the two characters. Roimata made her debut on the episode airing, 26 January 2011 with the line, \\"Kia Ora, I'm from the bureau\\". As the characters 6-month duration came to an end, producers acknowledged their enjoyment of Ruakere's portrayal and the extent of story lines it opened up; they subsequently extended her contract to a regular role. In April 2013, producers offered Ruakere a 1-year renewal to her contract, to which she declined in favor of moving overseas to find work. She agreed to stay on the show for several months so that Roimata could get properly written off. The character was killed off in the 2013 Christmas cliffhanger. Ruakere was happy Roimata was killed off in such a dramatic way, stating, \\"Yup, all good'. Nothing like a big exit!\\" Storylines Roimata arrived to Shortland Street in early 2011 as a temporary bureau nurse and quickly caught the attention of ED doctor, TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell). After Roimata's initial refusal, the two began to date but the shock return of TK's pregnant estranged wife Sarah (Amanda Billing), lead to the couple hastily becoming engaged. TK ended up ditching Roimata on the wedding day but the following week, the two married in an unofficial ceremony on the Bay of Islands. The following year Roimata was shocked to discover her father Henare (George Henare) had been embezzling funds under TK's name, yet lent her support to him in court. The couple decided to try for a baby, but following Roimata's birthday party, she was sexually assaulted in a dark alleyway and then continuously harassed in her own home. Josh Gallagher (Chris Tempest) supported her through the ordeal and helped unmask Zac Smith (Mike Edward) as the culprit. Roimata ended up falling for Josh and the two began an affair that ended her marriage to TK. Roimata decided to leave Ferndale but was talked into continuing her nursing studies. However she soon discovered that Josh had lost his mind and was deliberately making people sick so as to heal them. After failing to get him charged, Roimata tried to stop Josh only to become involved in a dramatic explosion he planned at the staff Christmas function. Roimata was initially saved after Josh sacrificed his life, but ultimately ended up dying from her injuries on the operating table. Character Development =Characterisation= The character of Roimata upon arrival was described as \\"Beautiful, intelligent and intriguing\\" and Ruakere stated that Roimata has a \\"Cutting sense of humour\\". She is further stated as \\"kind\\" and \\"nice\\" Ruakere also stated that; \\"Roimata is pretty cheeky and can run rings around anyone who challenges her, she's also got a very strong sense of right and wrong. Once she gets an idea in her head, it's very difficult for anyone to change her mind.\\" She has also been described as a; \\"sophisticated, intelligent, and caring woman with a sense of humour.\\" Roimata had issues with her father and was described as, \\"trying to find her own identity and passions\\". Roimata's father Henare (George Henare) arrived to the show in early March and Henare described his characters relationship with Roimata, \\"My character is a likeable man whose daughter is the apple of his eye, so he was a lovely character to play.\\" =Relationships= Roimata was introduced as a love interest for TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) and to create a love triangle upon the eventual return of his ex-wife, Sarah (Amanda Billing). Upon arriving to the show, Ruakere teased the idea that Roimata would be getting a love interest, \\"In true Shortland Street style, there's some exciting romance on the cards for Roimata\\" Roimata found herself attracted to co worker, TK and after his flirtatious manner, eventually began to date him. Ruakere enjoyed working alongside Mitchell, \\"Ben's taken me under his wing. He's a very generous actor and I'm learning a lot from him.\\" However, after a month of dating, Sarah returned and announced her pregnancy with TK's child. Ruakere described this moment as a \\"rough time\\" and explained the wide range of emotions she had to portray during the onscreen relationship. Sarah pleaded with TK to take her back and raise their child, to which he rejected. Ruakere explained, \\"It's fair to say that TK makes a relatively big decision about his future with either Sarah or Roimata. And no matter the outcome, you can guarantee that there will stunned reaction from all involved.\\" TK and Roimata became engaged, but on the day of the wedding, he ditched her to attend the birth of his daughter. They subsequently married each other in an unofficial ceremony. In early 2012, the relationship was briefly shaken when Roimata realized TK was in on an illegal deal with her father. The couple struggled to work alongside each other in the Emergency Department and Roimata found herself at odds with doctor, Josh Gallagher (Chris Tempest). Following her sexual assault, Roimata began to exclude herself from TK and Mitchell speculated the marriage was at risk. Josh provided support for Roimata when TK couldn't and even comforted her at the scene of the crime, leaving TK suspicious of his motives. Ruakere explained that the sexual assault left the couple at odds, \\"They are two people lost in the middle of the ocean, splashing around, trying desperately to find each other and make sense of stuff and it's not working. She does all the stages - denial, anger - she's just snapping at him and he can't do anything right.\\" Ruakere explained Roimata's bond with Josh, \\"Ever since the attack, Roimata has trusted Josh and turned to him for guidance. She can't understand why anyone would think he would be the culprit.\\" Roimata was insulted by TK suspecting Josh of the attack, \\"Roimata feels TK is undermining her by blaming her pillar of support. Just when she needs TK the most, he can't control his anger\\". However, when Josh's ex-girlfriend Lana Jacobs (Brooke Williams) announced he had fallen for Roimata, she too suspected he may be the attacker. Roimata soon started to develop feelings for Josh, much to TK's ignorance; Mitchell stated, \\"Roimata is always reassuring TK that she loves him. But he's starting to wonder how much she means it.\\" In May, Roimata gave into her feelings and began a love affair with Josh. Ruakere was upset when she learned Roimata was going to cheat on TK and hoped for a potential reunion though admitted Roimata needed some serious help after her assault. =Sexual assault= In 2012 it was decided that the character of Roimata would be subject of a sexual assault at the hands of Zac Smith (Mike Edward). Edward had been hired on a 6-month contract, but, following the implementation of the storyline, his contract was extended. Sexual assault storylines had previously occurred in Shortland Street (such as the rape of Minnie Crozier (Katrina Devine) in 1998), but Ruakere felt Roimata's was portrayed with \\"the most depth needed\\". Ruakere wasn't aware when acting out the storyline that it would have great effect on her immediately afterwards, \\"this storyline is heavy. I had no idea how much it would affect me until after I'd done it. I knew that to do the scene properly, I needed to feel the fear, to have a real force on me. Of course I didn't want to be hurt, but a sexual assault is every woman's worst nightmare and I knew I had to be as scared as I could be. Although we had practised beforehand so that level of contact wasn't uncomfortable, when the time came and my arm was twisted behind my back, there was no acting required.\\" The scene depicted Roimata pinned face first against a wall and sexually assaulted. She described it as \\"horrific\\" and \\"every women's worst nightmare\\". Behind the scenes, Zac was always intended to be the perpetrator but the assailant was depicted anonymously so as to create suspense. To further the illusion that it was not Zac, directors shot the assault scene with Chris Tempest (Josh Gallagher) actually physically carrying it out, whilst Sam Bunkall (Boyd Rolleston) added the voice over. The trick successfully fooled much of the audience, with many believing it was in fact Beulah Koale's (Jared Afeaki) voice. On screen Zac was interviewed by police when footprints matching his boots were identified at the scene of the crime. Though Zac denied any involvement and was even backed by ex lover, Vasa Levi (Teuila Blakely). However, on 12 December 2012, Zac was revealed to the audience as the attacker when he threatened Detective Lisa Stone (Caitlin Bossley) and later removed a balaclava to expose his face. The characters soon started to discover the attacker had assaulted Roimata as a personal attack on TK. Further harassments included the assailant breaking into the house and sprawling out Roimata's underwear and later leaving a white feather on the doorstep. As the year ended, Zac poisoned TK and used several tricks to frame Josh for the attack However, with Josh's input, Roimata realised Zac was the attacker and publicly accused him, causing him to lose what little friends he had left. With his dwindling amount of friends, in early 2013 Zac decided to take drastic action in exacting revenge on TK. He kidnapped Roimata, bound and drugged her and locked her in the cellar of 'The I.V.' bar. After Roimata was eventually recovered, Zac was arrested and charged after she collected enough DNA evidence to have him charged. Producer Steven Zanoski praised Ruakere for her dedication to the sexual assault storyline, \\"I've really admired Shav's dedication to staying true to the emotional depths demanded by the story. From firsthand experience talking to victims of sexual assault, Shavaughn has this week written a letter of protest to the prime minister regarding the government's withdrawal of funding for the sexual violence helpline. This production can be proud that Shavaughn has lent her public profile to promoting this issue. To me, this says this story was more than just a job for Shavaughn.\\" Reception In 2013, Ruakere was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" in the TV Guide Best on the Box Awards following her portrayal of Roimata throughout the sexual assault storyline. Before the characters arrival, it was suggested she was destined to be a popular character due to Ruakere's acting and bubbly personality. Hugh Sundae of The New Zealand Herald stated that \\"Ruakere seemed to nail it from the first scene. Completely natural and not a trace of that self-awareness newbies often show.\\" Ruakere's co star Amanda Billing stated that TK and Roimata made a good couple with good chemistry. The storyline that saw Zac kidnap Roimata, was voted by fans as their second favourite plot and third biggest plot twist, in the Ferndale Talk Best of 2013 awards. Upon Roimata's death in 2014, a Herald on Sunday blogger suggested that the show had lost one of its \\"finest actors\\". Ruakere's co-star Christina Asher who portrayed Roimata's mother Ruth in a guest role, enjoyed how the producers had created such a believable Māori family unit, saying; \\"No need to say that the writers have done a great job in creating a Māori family with some credibility but it is a relief to see this on our favourite soap. They're a reasonably normal family with a few disfunctions.\\" References Shortland Street characters Television characters introduced in 2011 Fictional nurses Fictional Māori people Fictional sexual assault victims Female characters in television ","title":"Roimata Ngatai"},{"id":"31484652","text":"Deluxe Edition is a 2002 compilation album of recordings by Son Seals for Alligator Records.

Hugh Mitchell (3 December 1849 – 16 August 1937) was a Scottish member of the Royal Engineers who later became a barrister. In his youth he was a keen footballer who played for the Royal Engineers in the 1872 FA Cup Final and appeared for Scotland in two of the representative matches played against England in 1871 and 1872. Family and education Mitchell was born in Marylebone, London, the son of Lieut. Col. Hugh Mitchell of the Madras army and his wife Jessie née McCaskill. He was educated at Harrow School between 1864 and 1867 before going to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. At Harrow, he was a keen sportsman, representing the school at football, cricket and shooting. In 1878, he married Mary Catherine \\"Katie\\" Creswell, the sister of Col. Edmund Creswell who had played alongside him in the 1872 FA Cup Final. They had seven children, including Philip Euen Mitchell (1890–1964), who served as Governor of Uganda, Fiji and Kenya. Katie died in 1892 following the birth of her youngest child. Mitchell had always been \\"rather dour\\" and his wife's death was \\"an incurable loss and grief\\" to him; as a result, he became more withdrawn and was seen by his grandchildren as a \\"patriarchal and terrifying figure\\". Football career The Royal Engineers team of 1872. Eight of these players played in the first FA Cup Final. Mitchell is standing on the right Mitchell played as a forward who was described as \\"a good charger and useful forward [who] sticks to the ball well\\". He was part of the Royal Engineers team who reached the final of the inaugural FA Cup tournament, scoring a goal in the semi-final replay over Crystal Palace. In the final, played at Kennington Oval on 16 March 1872, the Engineers were defeated by the Wanderers by a single goal, scored by Morton Betts. In November 1871, he was selected to play for Scotland in the fourth of a series of matches between teams representing Scotland and England; he qualified for the Scottish team by virtue of his father's Scottish origins. The match ended in a 2–1 defeat, with the Scots' goal being scored by Mitchell's Royal Engineers team-mate, Lieut. Henry Renny-Tailyour. He retained his place in the Scottish team for the final match in the series, played the following February, which ended in a 1–0 victory for the English. Military career Mitchell joined the Royal Engineers as a Lieutenant on 8 January 1870. He was posted to Bermuda from 1873 to 1875 and then to Gibraltar before returning to England in 1878 where he worked in the War Office. Although he was promoted to the rank of Captain on 8 January 1882, he retired from the army two months later to qualify as a lawyer. Legal career He became a student of the Inner Temple on 21 January 1881 (then aged 31) and was called to the bar on 7 May 1884. He moved to South Wales where he operated on the South Wales and Chester Circuit and the Glamorgan Sessions. He practiced in Gibraltar and Tangier from 1896.

Werdenfels. The county was not contiguous with the Prince-Bishopric of Freising to the north 18th-century map showing the County of Werdenfels The county was administered from Werdenfels Castle. In 1294 Count Perchthold of Eschenloh sold his land to Bishop Emicho of Freising. The county was divided into three administrative areas: Garmisch, Partenkirchen and Mittenwald. The senior judge (Pfleger) had his seat in Garmisch, where he held his hearings (Gerichtstage). Court sessions initially took place at the castle, but in 1632 they were moved to Schwaigwang. The county had considerable ore and silver deposits. Of even greater economic importance was its control of the trading routes to Italy at the beginning of the Modern Era. Goods that came from the south (spices, fruit, incense, wine) had to be deposited in Mittenwald for a fee while goods coming from the north (copper, brass, cloth, jewellery, metal goods) had likewise to be stored in Partenkirchen for a fee. Only one Werdenfels wagoner guild had the right to transport goods within the county. From 1487 to 1679, the Republic of Venice held its own market in Mittenwald. As a result the region became quite prosperous and was referred to as the \\"golden land\\". Due to its wealth, the county was coveted by nearby Tyrol and Bavaria and in 1530, Duke William IV of Bavaria offered to the Prince-Bishop to exchange Bavarian territories between the Isar and Amper rivers for Werdenfels but the exchange did not materialize. After the Thirty Years' War the region gradually lost its importance as a transshipment point. Violin making, founded by Matthias Klotz, brought a certain boom in Mittenwald. With the secularisation of the Prince- Bishopric of Freising in 1803, Werdenfels went to Bavaria.  Sources  *Albrecht, Dieter: Die Grafschaft Werdenfels. in: Unbekanntes Bayern.

He wrote the libretto for The Book of Gold, an opera about Joseph Smith publishing the Book of Mormon. He is the founder of New York City's Mormon Artists Group and cofounder of the Mormon Arts Center. He has written several nonfiction books that focus on Mormon artists. Writing career Nelson is a graduate of New York University, where he studied James Joyce. Nelson has collaborated with Murray Boren on the following operas, cantatas, and song cycles. He wrote the libretto for an Easter cantata in 1991. He wrote the libretto for a one-act opera adaptation of Joyce's Dubliners entitled The Dead which was staged in 1993. He wrote the poetry for the song cycles Coney Island Songs and Pop Art Songs in 1995. That same year he wrote the poetry for the cantata Jesus, Lay Your Sleeping Head: A Cantata for the Christmas Season. He was the librettist for The Singer's Romance (1998), an opera based on the stories of Willa Cather. Nelson has also worked with other artists. He collaborated with composer David Fletcher on the song cycle Joseph Smith's Letters from Prison, which was performed in 2001. He has collaborated with Royce Twitchell on children's songs. In 2005, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) commissioned Nelson to write the libretto for an opera about Joseph Smith. He researched nineteenth-century literature in order to make the play's dialogue more authentic, and used events from historical records for the opera's plot. The play focuses on Smith's attempts to publish the Book of Mormon, and includes Smith translating the plates with a seer stone in a hat. Murray Boren composed the music for the opera, which was directed by Kory Katseanes.Program notes In 2001, Nelson's daughter had been hospitalized with a brain tumor, which Nelson said helped him identify with Joseph Smith's experience of worrying about his children's health and trying to publish a book; this inspired him to set the opera in the time Smith was trying to publish the Book of Mormon. Also in 2005, Nelson collaborated with David Fletcher on the song cycle Articles of Faith. Nelson edited a collection of personal essays by fellow Mormons in New York in 2002. He wrote the production script for Fictionist's rock opera The Bridge, which he based on Ambrose Bierce's short story \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\". The Bridge premiered in 2016. Nelson has also ghostwritten several New York Times nonfiction bestsellers. Mormon arts Nelson founded the Mormon Arts Group in 1999. The group has published books and limited edition artworks, with some commercial publications. In 2010 they did 18 projects with 86 different artists. Nelson and his wife Marcia started collecting artworks from friends after they married in 1986. Gradually, they made more purchases of Mormon artwork. In 2013, they published a book of their collection of more than 150 works through the Mormon Artists Group, including short biographies of the artists. They published a second edition in 2016. In 2015, Nelson was a juror in the 10th annual International Art Competition for the LDS church. =Mormon Arts Center= Nelson and Richard Bushman co-founded the Mormon Arts Center and Mormon Arts Center Festival. The first festival was held in 2017 and included, among other events, a keynote address from Terryl Givens and a sing-along with Craig Jessop. Laura Hurtado curated an art show of 23 artworks from the LDS Church's permanent collection, including works by Jorge Cocco Santángelo, Annie Poon, and Brian Kershisnik. Givens said the festival was \\"a seminal event in Mormonism's coming of age artistically\\". Dieter F. Uchtdorf attended with his wife Harriet and their daughter Antje, who are on the advisory board for the center. Nelson is developing a database of Mormon composers and their works. In 2018, he curated a collection of Hildebrando de Melo's art for an exhibition at the Mormon Arts Center Festival.

History  Wycliffe Bible Translators USA was founded in 1942 by William Cameron Townsend. When other Wycliffe organisations were founded around the world, they initially operated as its divisions in those countries. A new organisation, Wycliffe Bible Translators International, was started in May 1980 to provide this international leadership. In 1991 Wycliffe International was restructured so that the Wycliffe organisations in each country became fully independent, causing Wycliffe International to become an association of organisations. In February 2011, Wycliffe International took on a new \\"doing business as\\" name, Wycliffe Global Alliance. Philosophy and methods Wycliffe bases its philosophy on Townsend's Protestantism which regards the intercultural and multilinguistic spread of Christianity as a divine command. The organization adheres to the principle of sola scriptura and regards Biblical texts as the authoritative and infallible word of God. Wycliffe states its focus is participating with and encouraging Christian churches to minister to minority languages, so that every language community can have access to the Bible.

The publisher was Cornelius Bee. The work appeared in nine volumes, and collected numerous authors, both Protestant and Catholic, of early modern critical work on the Bible. It was intended to complement Brian Walton's Polyglot Bible, and set off a series of subsequent related publications.. The original work, while influential (particularly in making the notes of Grotius widely available), was not a connected Bible commentary, and was found to be long-winded, as well as scanty in other parts. Later publications attempted to address these shortcomings. Critici sacri (1660) The original full title was Critici Sacri, sive Doctissimorum Virorum in SS. Biblia Annotationes et Tractatus, and it appeared in nine volumes starting in 1660. The commentary project was launched by Cornelius Bee, with the main editor being John Pearson, supported by Anthony Scattergood and Francis Gouldman, as well as Pearson's brother Richard. Bee was a bookseller in Little Britain, London. He suffered major losses in the 1666 Great Fire.. Synopsis criticorum (from 1669) The Synopsis criticorum was a work by Matthew Poole, in five volumes, condensing the Critici sacri, and adding further authors. There was a 1684 edition by Johann Leusden; also editions by J. H. Maius (1679), and J. G. Pritz (Pritius) (1712). There had already been a pioneer complete Bible commentary in English, the Annotations upon all the Books of the Old and New Testament sponsored by the Westminster Assembly. Prompted by William Lloyd, Poole began his compilation in 1666. The prospectus of Poole's work bore the names of eight bishops (headed by Morley and Hacket) and five continental scholars, besides other divines. Simon Patrick, John Tillotson, and Edward Stillingfleet, with four laymen, acted as trustees of the subscription money. A patent for the work was obtained on 14 October 1667. Poole had assistance from John Lightfoot and Matthew Robinson. The first volume was ready for the press, when difficulties were raised by Cornelius Bee, who accused Poole of invading his own patent. After pamphlets had been written and legal opinions taken, the matter was referred to Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, and Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey, who decided in Poole's favour; Bee's name appears (1669) among the publishers of the Synopsis. The style was crisp notes, including rabbinical sources and Roman Catholic commentators.. Matthew Poole's Synopsis criticorum is currently being translated by the Matthew Poole Project, and much of the work is available online.https://www.fromreformationtoreformation.com/poole-project Critici sacri (from 1698) An expanded edition was produced in Amsterdam from 1698 by a Dutch editorial group, credited as: Hendrick Boom, the widow of Dirk Boom, Johannes Janssonius van Waesberge, Gillis Janssonius van Waesberge, Gerardus Borstius,.

The basilica of Santo Stefano () encompasses a complex of religious edifices in the city of Bologna, Italy.

(\\"Holy Jerusalem\\"). It has the dignity of minor basilica. History According to tradition Saint Petronius, a bishop of the city during the 5th century, built the basilica over a temple of the goddess Isis. The saint wished to have a building that recalled the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The different parts of the complex include: * Church of Saint Stephen or of the Holy Crucifix (8th century, presbytery reshaped in 17th century), with the Crypt * Church of the Holy Sepulchre (according to tradition: 5th century) *Church of the Saints Vitale and Agricola (4th century, rebuilt first in the 12th century) * Courtyard of Pilate (\\"Santo Giardino\\", 13th century) * Church of the Trinity or of the Martyrium (13th century) * Chapel of the Bandage (\\"Cappella della Benda\\") dedicated to the strip of cloth worn around the head by the Virgin Mary as a sign of mourning. thumb Pilate's Courtyard recalls the lithostrotos, where Jesus was condemned; it leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

Cloister, Basilica di Santo Stefano, Bologna, Italy, 1895.  Church of Saint Stephen or of the Holy Crucifix  The church of the Crucifix is of Lombard origin and dates back to the 8th century: it consists of a single nave with a trussed vault and a raised presbytery on the crypt. In the nave, on the left, there is the XVIII century statuary complex of the Compianto sul Cristo morto by Angelo Gabriello Piò [3]. At the center of the presbytery, remodeled in the seventeenth century, which is accessed via a staircase, is the Crucifix, the work of Simone dei Crocifissi dating back to about 1380. On the walls there are 15th century frescoes with the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen. Under the presbytery there is the crypt divided into five naves with columns of different invoice, one of which, according to legend, from the base to the capital is perfectly equivalent to Jesus (about one meter and seventy, very high for the time); at the end of it, in two urns placed on an altar, the remains of the Saints Vitale and Agricola are kept. On the sides of the altar, a few years ago, two 16th century frescoes were found under a layer of plaster, illustrating the martyrdom of Vitale and Agricola. In the left aisle, at the back near the altar, there is a small fresco of the early fifteenth century, the so-called Madonna della Neve, perhaps of Lippo di Dalmasio. An object of lesser artistic value but of some suggestion is the white statue of the Madonna Bambina, at the beginning of the crypt, on the right wall.  Church of the Holy Sepulchre  The old pulpit, within the building called Basilica del Santo Sepolcro. thumb The church dates back to the fifth century, built by the bishop Petronius as a simulacrum of the Constantinian Sepulcher of Jerusalem and rebuilt at the beginning of the eleventh century by Benedictine monks after it was heavily damaged during the devastating 10th century Hungarian invasions. The building, with a central plan, is built on a perimeter with an irregular octagonal base in the center of which a dodecagonal dome is erected. Inside there are 12 columns of marble and brick, while in the center there is a shrine that housed the relics of San Petronio, found here in 1141. The door of the Sepulcher is opened one week a year, after the celebration of mass midnight Easter, in the presence of the Knights of the Holy Sepulcher. In ancient times it was possible to crawl inside to venerate the remains of the saint; the prostitutes of Bologna, on Easter morning, moreover, in memory of Mary Magdalene, went there to pronounce, before the Holy Sepulcher, a prayer whose content they themselves never wanted to reveal. Still according to another ancient tradition, pregnant women in Bologna used to walk thirty-three times (one for each year of the Savior's life) around the Sepulcher, entering each lap in the tomb to pray; at the end of the thirty- third lap, the women then went to the nearby church of the Martyrium to pray before the fresco of the pregnant Madonna. Today the body of St. Petronius is no longer in this church, after which in the year 2000 Cardinal Giacomo Biffi had it moved to the Basilica of San Petronio, which already guarded the head of the patron saint of the city. thumb In the church there is also a water source which, in the symbolism of the Stefan complex based on the passion of Christ, is identified with the waters of the Jordan, and which from the archaeological point of view refers to the sacred source of the pre-existing isiac complex. Probably the temple of Isis was in this area, as it seems demonstrated, as well as by the presence of the source (the cult of the Egyptian goddess required the presence of a source of spring water), the persistence of seven Greek marble columns, coming from the city of Karistos (according to surveys made by the University of Geology of Padua), certainly from the Roman period; they have been reused, as you can clearly see, since the seven Roman columns, still standing, were flanked in the Middle Ages by as many brick columns, while where Roman columns were missing, destroyed by the Hungarians raids, new columns were built more robust. A column of black cipollino marble, of African origin and of the Roman era (also certainly reused from a previous building), offset from the others, symbolizes the column where Christ was scourged and, as stated in a scroll, guaranteed 200 years of indulgence to each and every time you visit this place. The vault and the walls of the church originally had frescoes with biblical scenes created by Marco Berlinghieri (son of Berlinghiero Berlinghieri) in the mid-thirteenth century, almost entirely eliminated in 1804 to be replaced by new frescoes in Baroque style made by Filippo Pedrini, in turn eliminated by subsequent restorations of the late nineteenth century; what remains of the original thirteenth-century frescoes (a scene representing the Strage of the Innocents) is visible in the basilica museum.  Church of the Saints Vitale and Agricola  thumb It is the oldest of the complex. This basilica-shaped church, without a transept, with a salient façade and triconca apse, is dedicated to the patron saints Vitale and Agricola and since its construction it housed the relics of the two saints, respectively servant and master, the first two martyrs from Bologna times of Diocletian (305 AD). In 393 the remains are moved from Ambrogio to be taken to Milan (a fact that testifies that the basilica was already built) and also in the fifth century a messenger was sent by Namazio, bishop of Clermont, to have relics of the Bolognese protomartyrs. At the beginning of the XV century a paleochristian sepulcher with the inscription \\"Symon\\" had been found and the rumor had spread that it was the tomb of Simon Peter, that is of Saint Peter. This news, devoid of any historical foundation, had attracted many pilgrims, distracting them from Rome, the classic destination of pilgrimage. The pope, Pope Eugene IV, then reacted vehemently: he made the church open, he had it filled with earth and left it in this state for about seventy years. Subsequently, through the intercession of the archbishop Giuliano Della Rovere, the church was restored and reopened for worship. An inscription on the side door recalls the event: \\"JUL. CARD. S. P. AD VINC. RESTITUIT\\". Inside the church there are some interesting finds: remains of Roman mosaic floor, visible through a glass. Then, in the two side apses, two early medieval sarcophagi attributed to Vitale and Agricola, with figures of animals (lions, deer and peacocks) in a raised relief. In the right aisle, on the wall, a cross is identified as that of the torture of St. Agila (in reality it dates back to a later period). The main altar, made up of a turned pagan altar, is set against the back wall (according to the pre-conciliar liturgy, when the celebrant gave his back to the faithful during the celebrations).  Courtyard of Pilate  thumb At the Cortile di Pilato, so called to commemorate the lithostrotos, the place where Jesus was condemned, is accessed by exiting the church of the Sepulcher. The courtyard is bordered to the north and south by two porticoes in Romanesque style with characteristic cruciform columns in brick and brings to the center a limestone basin resting on a pedestal (more recent, 16th century) the so- called \\"Pilato's Cat\\" : this basin is a Longobard work dating back to 737-744 and bears an inscription under the edge of which is reported the most accredited transcription: « + UMILIB(US) VOTA SUSCIPE D(OMI)NE D(OM)N(ORUM) N(OST)R(ORUM) LIUTPRAN(TE) ILPRAN(TE) REGIB(US) ET D(OM)N(O) BARBATU EPISC(OPO) S(AN)C(TE) HECCL(ESIE) B(O)N(ONIEN)S(I)S. HIC I(N) H(ONOREM) R(ELIGIOSI) SUA PRAECEPTA OBTULERUNT, UNDE HUNC VAS IMPLEATUR IN CENAM D(OMI)NI SALVAT(ORI)S, ET SI QUA MUN(ER)A C(UISQUAM) MINUERIT, D(EU)S REQ(UIRET) » Under the portico, in the center of a window, on a column, there is a stone rooster dating back to the fourteenth century, called \\"Gallo di S. Pietro\\" to remember the evangelical episode of the denial of Jesus. Always under the portico is It is possible to observe some mortuary tombstones including one, with a pair of real scissors in the center, belonging to a tailor. Significant for the symbolism of the passion of Christ is that the distance between this courtyard and the nearby church of San Giovanni in Monte (so called because it stands on the only natural protuberance of the central dish of Bologna) would be the same that there is in Jerusalem between the Holy Sepulcher and Calvary.  Church of the Trinity or of the Martyrium  Also called the Church of the Holy Cross or of Calvary or Trinity. Originally it had to be built in the form of a basilica with 5 naves, with an apse in front of the holy garden (Pilato's courtyard) and the façade to the east, exactly as it was originally the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem wanted by Constantino. Probably due to lack of funds, Petronius could not complete the building that remained unfinished. Later, with the advent of the Lombards, it would become a Baptistery. At the beginning of a thousand, during the reconstructions made by the Benedictines, there were several uncertainties about how to finish the work, considering that the original Holy Sepulcher had been heavily altered and in those years the Fatimite Caliph al-Hakim was working its destruction . So having lost the historical references of what it was originally, the Benedictines could not complete it. After the late nineteenth-century renovations, currently it is divided into 5 naves, with the façade facing the courtyard and the apse facing east, both built in neo-Romanesque style on the model of the Holy Sepulcher built by the Crusaders. From the time of the Crusades and until 1950, a relic of the Holy Cross was kept in the central chapel. Of great interest, in the last little chapel, entering on the right, there is permanently placed the large wooden group of the Adoration of the Magi, with man-sized statues. It is the oldest known crib in the world made up of statues in the round. [5] A detailed study of the work published in 1981 by Massimo Ferretti, at the end of the first major restoration carried out by Marisa and Otello Caprara, has identified that the sculptor of the statues is the same Master of the Crucifix 1291 kept in the Art Collections of the City of Bologna . The work was first sculpted by trunks of lime and elm, perhaps in the last decade of the thirteenth century by an anonymous Bolognese sculptor. The work remained colorless until 1370, when it was commissioned by the Bolognese painter Simone dei Crocifissi who took care of the rich polychrome and gilding with his very personal Gothic style. The 1981 restoration brought out the splendid polychrome, which had darkened over the centuries, as you can see in the photos before that restoration. But with the subsequent passing of years the humidity of the Church, in which the work was exhibited throughout the year, had begun to ruin the polychrome again. For this reason, at the beginning of 2000 the statues were taken a couple at a time and were restored again, until 2004, when all the work was exhibited in the Pinacoteca di Bologna, where it remained until Christmas 2006, when it was reported to Santo Stefano. Finally, on 21 January 2007 the complete work was inaugurated inside a large electronically controlled humidity and temperature case, equipped with shatterproof glass, which houses the entire group in a permanent and permanent form. In this church there are also pieces of frescoes from the 14th century, in particular a fragment showing Sant'Orsola with her companions of martyrdom and a pregnant Madonna who, besides being of exquisite workmanship, touches the loving gesture with which she caresses her bursting belly; the other hand of the Virgin holds a book. The last little chapel on the right has been dedicated, in recent times, to the Bersaglieri, but is devoid of artistic content. Layout of the Basilica 1-3. Church of the Crucifix 2. Crypt 4.

Chapel of the Bandage (\\"Cappella della Benda\\") and museum Scholarly interest The focus of scholarly discussion has been for many years the supposed similarity between the so-called \\"New Jerusalem\\" rebuilt here, according to a vita written in 1180, by Saint Petronius in the 5th century, and the largely lost 4th-century complex erected by Constantine the Great at the purported site of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Unfortunately the archaeological evidence from Bologna dates primarily to the 11th and 12th centuries, leaving the question about an earlier date still unanswered (at least until 1981). On the other hand, archaeology has meanwhile delivered many answers regarding the Constantinian church complex from Jerusalem, therefore the main interest presented by the 12th-century parts of the Church of Santo Stefano might much rather be their similarity to the almost contemporary Crusader Church of the Holy Sepulchre from Jerusalem, of which not all parts are preserved.

Controversy YS Chowdary was under media scanner for an allegation by the Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd of Mauritius on the grounds that the company defaulted on the Rs 1.92 billion loan it availed through its subsidiary. This allegation popped up a day after the Rajya Sabha MP-cum-industrialist was sworn in as a Union minister. A clarification from the MPs office later said that he had not secured loan from the Mauritius Commercial Bank. It was his group firm – Sujana Universal Industries —that borrowed the funds and he only stood as a guarantor to the loan obtained by that step-down subsidiary. On 23 and 24 November 2018, searches were conducted by Enforcement Directorate, at the residence and office of Sujana Chowdary in Hyderabad and Delhi. The agency claimed, the group of companies belonging to him defrauded banks to the tune of Rs 57 billion. The documents seized by the agency indicated that the group was controlling over 120 companies that were only on paper without any genuine business activities. Chowdary alleged that he was being targeted for political reasons and said he would take legal recourse against the ED. He claimed his companies were maintaining all records and the allegations made by the ED were baseless. Personal life Chowdary married Padmaja on 6 August 1989. The couple have two children, Y. S. Karthik and Y. Naga Chandini.

Within a career spanning more than two decades, he wrote 20 screenplays and 12 plays. Biography Sasi was born at Arattuvazhi in Alappuzha district as the son of Arjunan Pillai. He liked writing plays while still only in school. His first professional stage play was Kolayaali (The Murderer). Later, when Sasi was studying at Sanatana Dharma College, Alappuzha, the craze for writing plays besieged him again. He wrote plays and sent them to the All India Radio. Sasi shifted home base to Thiruvananthapuram, where he worked first as a journalist with magazines such as Kudumbakatha and Kuttikatha. He then set up his own advertising agency, Primary Colours. He wrote some of his notable stage plays during this time. Inspired by various screenplays of M. T. Vasudevan Nair, he developed a keen interest in writing screenplays for films. He made his film debut with Kaladharan’s Nettipattom (1991). But the film failed both critically and commercially. He was then approached by Rajasenan, for whom he wrote the family drama Ayalathe Adheham. The film became a resounding hit. With this film, Sasi gained a place with the top-grade screenwriters of Malayalam. He went on to write screenplays for 18 more films, including the cult classic Yoddha, comic thriller CID Unnikrishnan B.A., B.Ed., family drama Kaliveedu, and the hilarious Cheppadividya. Yoddha, which released on 4 September 1992 is widely regarded as his master piece. The film became a landmark film in the history of Malayalam cinema, with its story, scenes, characters and music gaining cult status. Sasidharan Arattuvazhi died on 21 January 2001 at the age of 45. He was suffering from kidney related diseases for four years .He is survived by his wife Sudhakutty and two daughters.

Education and career Murray Boren received his B.M. and M.A. in composition from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1975 and 1977 respectively. He received a Doctor of Musical Arts in composition from the City University of New York in 2002. Boren began his academic career as department head at the College of Education in Uyo, Nigeria from 1970 to 1980. He became professor of composition and theory at BYU in 1980, a position he held for four years. After this he worked in administrative positions at the City University of New York and New York University from 1984 to 1994.

Boren has written nine operas, adapting them from religious texts and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) history as well as medieval mystery plays. Orson Scott Card was the librettist for Boren's opera Abraham and Isaac based on Genesis 22 in the Bible. Boren wrote the opera Emma about Emma Smith wife of the founder of the LDS Church, Joseph Smith. Emma received mixed reviews. It was praised for its freshness but criticized for being overly chromatic. Allan Kozinn of The New York Times praised the vocal performances and the unique orchestral music; however, he criticized the opera's slow pace stating that, \\"the sustained slow-motion caterwauling of the first five minutes was ample warning that this would be a very, very long evening.\\" Boren has collabored with librettist Glen Nelson on three operas. The Dead was a one-act opera adaptation of James Joyces Dubliners first staged in New York in 1993. They also collaborated on The Singer's Romance, a three-act opera inspired by a Willa Cather short stories. In 2005, Boren and Nelson collaborated to create The Book of Gold, an opera about Joseph Smith. In addition to opera, Boren has written over 100 songs and chamber compositions. He wrote the music for the Joseph Sonnets which were created in co-operation with Sally Taylor. Several of Boren's pieces were first performed by orchestras directed by Kory Katseanes.

In 2007, Demers became the focus of mass media attention regarding his unique relationship with a captive Pacific walrus named Smooshi. Their relationship garnered the attention of such television programs as CBC's The National, Inside Edition, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Demers left his position at Marineland citing allegations of negligent treatment of the animals and unhealthy conditions.

This archetype describes the degenerative pattern that develops when two subjects cooperating for a common goal, accidentally take actions that undermine each other's success. It is similar to the escalation system archetype in terms of pattern behaviour that develops over time.Senge, P. et al. (1994). The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook. New York: Doubleday Currency. Archetype description The archetype describes a pattern where two subjects have decided to work together because they will benefit from the alliance.Braun B. (2002) The System Archetypes Each take actions believing that it will bring benefit to the other and if the cooperation works, they will both benefit from it. Problems start arising when one or both of the subjects need to fix a local gap in performance, maybe due to external pressure. They initiate action to fix the gap and accidentally undermine each other's success. The result of these activities may produce a sense of resentment or frustration between the subjects or it may even turn the subjects into adversaries (hence the archetype name), thereby destroying the alliance. =History= The original set of system archetypes were published in The Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge. The exact source of these generic structures is not known. However \\"Accidental Adversaries\\" has a clear origin. It is derived from observations made by Jennifer Kemeny, a colleague of Senge's and a contributor to the original archetype descriptions. In her consulting work in the late 1980s she was intrigued at how often potential strategic alliances were unsuccessful, or devolved into outright hostility. Such a recurring phenomenon suggested a structural cause. The essential elements of the archetype were first described during a session Kemeny facilitated. It was the first meeting of the first ever alliance between Walmart and Procter and Gamble. Employees diagrammed how their protective business policies caused unintentional damage to the other company – which responded with similarly defensive actions. The net effect of these \\"back and forth\\" behaviors was lower profit and less goodwill – which for a long period of time had overshadowed the possibility of mutual benefit between the organizations. An early description of \\"Accidental Adversaries\\" is in The Fifth Discipline: Fieldbook, by Senge, et al. =Description of the model= By way of example, two parties A and B have realised that by uniting forces, they can increase their success, whatever that may be. At a certain point in time, say B, takes corrective actions in order to counteract a decrease in performance due to external pressure. Although B's actions are important for B, their impact on A are not understood or not considered. The result is that now A feels that he is being betrayed and reacts to diminish the negative effects of B's actions. Ironically, A's new actions now obstruct B's success. If this situation persists and the results worsen, the alliance breaks down. A vicious circle is created and each partner has now even forgotten the original purpose of the alliance. A and B's actions now only focus on counteracting the hostile actions taken by the other. A and B thus 'accidentally' become adversaries.Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype at SystemsWiki.org. Causal Loop diagram The causal loop diagram in Figure 1 shows the pattern dynamics of the system.Accidental Adversaries at Systems-Thinking.org. http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/saa/aa.htm Figure 1. Causal loop diagram The pattern of behaviour begins with the outer reinforcing loop R1 where A and B have formed a synergistic alliance that benefits both. An action taken by A in favour of B increases B's success and vice versa. At some point in time, though, say B, initiates a series of corrective actions in order to adjust its performance. The actions taken increase performance, whose effects balance the number of corrective actions required. This results in the creation of a balancing loop, B2. These actions also unintentionally obstruct the other party's success, and result in the formation of the negative reinforcing loop R2 that undermines the virtuous reinforcing loop R1. Now each corrective action taken by B causes A to start taking corrective measures as well, thus activating its own balancing loop B1. The formation of R2 is the critical point at which the dynamics of the system go out of control, resembling the Escalation archetype. Stock and flow diagram Figure 2 shows the stock and flow diagram for this archetype. Figure 2. Stock and Flow diagram Alternative model An alternative form of the model is shown in Figure 3. The differences are in the two reinforcing loops R3 and R4. Here, A and B specifically take actions to improve their growth, not, as before, to adjust their performance to a pre-determined target. By seeking improvement through R3 and R4, A and B suppress the effects of R1 and establish the negative-effect reinforcing loop R2, that in turn, completely takes over B5 and B6. The two balancing loops B5 and B6 are formed by, respectively, :B's success->B's actions in A's favour->A's success->A's actions to improve A's success->A's unintended obstruction of B's success and :A's success->A's actions in B's favour->B's success->B's actions to improve B's success->B's unintended obstruction of A's success. Figure 3. Alternative Causal Loop diagram. Model behaviour The archetype behaviour over time is shown in Figure 4.Figure 4. Behaviour over time Both parties show a similar trend in direction and rate of change of success, with one trailing behind the other one due to system delays. Even though the pattern shows stable periods, the overall trend follows a downward direction. The above simulation can be run from InsightMaker. Possible leverage points It is possible to achieve leverage by introducing or re-emphasising a link between each party's success,Wolstenholme E. F. (2003) Towards the definition and use of a core set of archetypal structures in system dynamics thus re-establishing the outer virtuous reinforcing loop shown in Figure 3. Kemeny proposes a list of seven action steps to deal with the unintended consequences of each party's actions, given their mental models:Kemeny J (1994) \\"Accidental Adversaries\\": When Friends Become Foes, The Systems Thinker, Vol. 5, No. 1 * Reconstruct the conditions that were the catalyst for collaboration. * Review the original understandings and expected mutual benefits. * Identify conflicting incentives that may be driving adversarial behaviour. * Map the unintended side effects of each party’s actions. * Develop overarching goals that align the efforts of the parties. * Establish metrics to monitor collaborative behaviour. * Establish routine communication Example A classic example of the Accidental Adversaries system archetype is that of Procter and Gamble supplying Wal-Mart. When Procter and Gamble's profits decline, they introduce promotions. This results in extra costs and decreasing profitability for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's responds by stocking-up – buying large quantities of products during the discount period – and then selling them at regular prices when promotions end, thereby increasing its margins. Procter and Gamble's production now faces great swings in volume because Wal-Mart does not need to order products for months, which adds to P and G's costs. To improve their situation, Procter and Gamble pushes even more on promotions, blaming at the same time Wal-Mart for their problems. Wal-Mart reacts by stocking-up even more. Eventually, Procter and Gamble finds itself putting a lot of effort into promotions, at the expense of new product development, while Wal-Mart concentrates solely on buying and storing promoted products rather than improving their operations. The situation is described by the causal loop diagram in Figure 5. In the Procter and Gamble/Wal-Mart case, leverage was achieved by bringing both parties together to understand the structure they had unintentionally created, even though each party 's action was completely rational and understandable from their local perspective.

Between 1947 and 1953, Morton and fellow geologist Rene Wetzel worked together in Iraq for the Iraq Petroleum Company [IPC], carrying out extensive field work and mapping the Mesozoic outcrops. This work was later incorporated in the Stratigraphic Lexicon of IraqStratigraphic Lexicon of Iraq: Tertiary by R.C. van Bellen; Mesozoic and Palaeozoic by H.V. Dunnington, R. Wetzel and D.M. Morton, under the direction of Louis Dubertret,. which remains a key reference.Geology of Iraq edited by Saad Z. Jassim and Jeremy C. Goff, Geological Society (2008) , p. 21. Pre-war geological investigations in Iraq had been suspended as a result of civil disturbances, and were not resumed until 1946 when 'a planned campaign of stratigraphic research was set afoot'. Under the overall charge of Colonel Henson, the project involved a vast amount of fieldwork and laboratory studies. René Wetzel directed most of the work in Kurdistan, the Sinjar and the western desert, assisted by Morton and a number of other geologists such as Dr R.G.S. Hudson ('Doc'), Charles André, Harold Dunnington and Henry Hotchkiss over a period of six years. Deeper wells were drilled to locate older deposits: this resulted in oil being discovered in the Middle Cretaceous at Ain Zalah, Kirkuk and Bai Hasan.F. E. Wellings, unpublished manuscript cited in In 1957, after various postings in the Middle East, Morton was appointed IPC's Senior Geologist, Persian Gulf. In 1959, he attended the 5th World Petroleum Congress and delivered a paper entitled The Geology of Oman'’ which became a standard reference for those studying the geology of Arabia.Morton, D.M., \\"The Geology of Oman\\", 5th World Petroleum Congress, New York. This was described by the Chief Geologist of IPC, N.E. Baker as \\"a major contribution to the geology of southern Arabia, ranking along with Lees' (George Martin Lees) early work on the geology of Oman.\\"Quoted by F.E. Wellings, 1965 in Owen, E.W., Trek of the Oil Finders, Tulsa (1975), pp. 1347–8. Morton's paper touched on one of the most intriguing aspects of the geology of Oman: how oceanic crust, known as the Semail Ophiolite, came to occur all around the Hajar mountains and Jebel Akhdar, the \\"Green Mountain\\". The theory supported by Morton and others – Tschopp (1967)Tschopp, R.H., 1967, \\"The General Geology of Oman\\", Seventh World Petroleum Congress Proceedings, Mexico, 2, 231–242. and Wilson (1969))Wilson, H., \\"Late Cretaceous Eugeosynclinal Sedimentation, Gravity Tectonics and Ophiolite Emplacement in Oman Mountains, Southeast Arabia\\", AAPG Bulletin, 1969, 53, 626–671; \\"Late Cretaceous Nappes in the Oman Mountains and their Geologic Evolution: Discussion\\". AAPG Bulletin, 1973, 57, 2282–2298; \\"The Age of the Hawasina and Other Problems of Oman Mountain Geology\\", Journal of Petroleum Geology, 2000, 23, 345–362. – was that these igneous rocks had essentially flowed into position. Lees (1928)Lees, G.M.,\\"The Geology and tectonics of Oman and of parts of south-eastern Arabia\\", The Quarterly Journal of the Geographical Society, 1928, 336, pp. 585–670. had earlier proposed a huge thrust sheet, the Semail Nappe, based on his observations in the Oman Mountains, and on his knowledge of the Alps and of the Zagros. As evidence of plate tectonics grew, a development of Lees' theory (Glennie (1974)) emerged.Glennie, K.W., Boeuf, M.G.A., Hughes Clarke, M.W., Moody-Stuart, M., Pilaar, W.F.H. and Reinhardt, B.M., Geology of the Oman Mountains, Verhandelingen van het Koninklijk Nederlands Geologisch Minjbouwkundig Genootschap (1974) . This postulated that, as the continents moved together, a slab of ocean crust from the ancient Tethys Ocean had been pushed over the continental margin for hundreds of kilometres about 87–76 million years ago. However, a leading proponent of the 'in-situ' theory, Hugh Wilson, observed that the major displacement surfaces were not prominent in the field and that he had seen more evidence of extension than compression in the Oman Mountains.”The Age of the Hawasina and Other Problems of Oman Mountain Geology, Journal of Petroleum Geology, 2001, discussion by Glennie, 24, 477–484. Glennie (2001) remains a spirited critique of most of Wilson’s arguments. Almost all later authors interpret the Semail ophiolite as thrust, or obducted, probably due to a short period of subduction close to the margin of the Arabian plate.Searle, M. and Cox, J., \\"Tectonic Setting, Origin, and Obduction of the Oman Ophiolite\\", GSA Bulletin, 1999, 111, 104–122. In 1971, Morton was appointed deputy leader of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) expedition to the Musandam Peninsula in Oman. This followed the lifting of a 50-year ban on foreigners being allowed to visit the area on account of tribal sensitivities.

Released by RCA Records on June 23, 2009, it was recorded before a live audience at the Palacio de los Congresos in Madrid, Spain, on April 24, 2008.Fito Páez — No Sé Si es Baires o Madrid (CD liner notes). RCA Records. 2009. The album includes featured performances by Pereza, Diego del Morao, Sabú, Dani Noel, Joaquín Sabina, Pablo Milanés, Ariel Rot, Gala Évora, Marlango, Mavi Díaz and Coki. To promote the album, Páez released \\"Contigo\\", a duet with Joaquín Sabina, which was their first joint performance in ten years. They recorded Enemigos Intimos in 1998. The album received positive reviews, earned Páez a Latin Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Album, and was certified gold in Argentina. Background Fito Páez recorded No Sé Si es Baires o Madrid, his third live album, following Euforia (1999) and Mi Vida con Ellas (2005), at the Palacio de los Congresos in Madrid on April 24, 2008. Initially, Páez did not plan to release the performance for sale, but after realizing that \\"the show was beautiful\\", opted for the release. The album title is a phrase from the song \\"Petalo de Sal\\", included on Páez' El Amor Después del Amor, and also from the singer's sentiment of having Joaquín Sabina share the stage with him. Sabina and Páez recorded Enemigos Intimos in 1998, with both singers' fighting during the album recording sessions. Afterward Sabina did not speak to Páez for more than 10 years. After their reconciliation in Argentina, they played together in some concerts, and when Paez' team made phone calls to see who wanted to participate in the album, Sabina agreed. Repertoire Páez recorded the album alone on-stage with his piano; half the selections are duets with Spanish and Cuban performers. Eight tracks are taken from El Amor Después del Amor (the title track, \\"Dos Días en la Vida\\", \\"Pétalo de Sal\\", \\"Un Vestido y un Amor\\", \\"Tumbas de la Gloria\\", \\"La Rueda Mágica\\", \\"Creo\\", \\"Brillante Sobre el Mic\\"); \\"Mariposa Tecknicolor\\" from Circo Beat; \\"11 y 6\\" and \\"Dar es Dar\\" were first included on Euforia; \\"Al Lado del Camino\\" was recorded for Abre; \\"Contigo\\" is a song written by Joaquín Sabina. Reception The album received positive reviews. Mariano Prunes of Allmusic said that Páez's rethinking of his own work is always worthy of attention, and the album is \\"an evening with the singer, his piano, his (Madrid) friends, and his songs.\\" Prunes also praised \\"Contigo\\", a duet with Joaquín Sabina, and \\"Yo Vengo a Ofrecer Mi Corazón\\" with Pablo Milanés. He said Páez's creative and intriguing readings of his classics keeps things interesting, while his guests compound the emotional effect of the performance. Páez earned a Latin Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Album. No Sé Si es Baires o Madrid received a gold certification in Argentina.

It was founded in Cologne on 20 January 2005 after Pro Cologne members had been elected to the Cologne City Council. Manfred Rouhs, treasurer of the Pro Cologne movement and former candidate of the German League for People and Homeland and the National Democratic Party of Germany, was elected its first chairman. The federal party convent decided at its ninth ordinary meeting in Wuppertal on 11 November 2017 to dissolve the party. The party was linked to the citizens' movements Pro Cologne and Pro NRW that are only active in the city of Cologne and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, respectively. Program The party advocated law and order; lowering the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12 years of age; deportation of illegal immigrants, and the segregation of students with insufficient German language proficiency. It was critical of multi-national corporations, in particular banks and other financial institutions. German parents are promised a child check worth €5,000 and a family loan up to €20,000. Structure The headquarters of pro Germany were located in Berlin. The first state party was formed in Berlin (Pro Berlin Citizen's Movement). Pro NRW and Pro Cologne are only active in North Rhine- Westphalia and Cologne, respectively. The \\"Pro Movement\\", organised as an association, serves as an umbrella organisation to co-ordinate the activities of the formally independent parties.\\"Pro-Bewegung als offizieller Dachverband gegründet\\" (\\"Pro Movement established as official umbrella association\\"), press release of the Citizen's Movement Pro NRW, www.pro-nrw.de, 15 June 2010. Retrieved on 19 Oct 2011. The party has been endorsed by the Freedom Party of Austria but lost this endorsement, once the FPÖ decided to not support any other parties in Germany besides the AfD. Elections The party's regional branch in Berlin contested the state election on 18 September 2011. Its electoral campaign has attracted considerable attention of the media. On 25 July, three days after the Norway attacks, Pro Germany supporters gathered for a \\"silent vigil\\" in front of the Norwegian embassy. Governing Mayor Klaus Wowereit sharply protested against the perceived disturbance of the commemoration. Later the former state treasurer Thilo Sarrazin successfully filed a suit against Pro Germany because they had used his name in their slogan \\"Wählen gehen für Thilos Thesen!\\" (Go to the polls for Thilo's theses!\\").\\"Pro Deutschland\\" darf nicht mit Sarrazin werben, Tagesschau.de, 11 August 2011. Retrieved on 19 Oct 2011. On 11 August, two Pro Germany campaigners were arrested. According to the police and media reports, they had charged at a migrant passerby with a hammer handle and assaulted a police officer with fists and pepper spray. Eventually, Pro Germany won 1.2% of the votes.Final results of the 2011 elections of the House of Representatives of Berlin, Berlin's state elections administrator, www.wahlen-berlin.de. Retrieved on 19 Oct 2011. Therefore, they failed to surmount the 5% threshold and did not win any seats in the House of Representatives. Pro Cologne Citizen's Movement The Pro Cologne Citizen's Movement () was formed in 1996 as an offshoot of the extreme right-wing German League for People and Homeland. The far-right publisher Manfred Rouhs and the lawyer Markus Beisicht have been active in the association from its start. In the 1999 mayoral election, the party presented Stephan Flug as its candidate who won 0.3% of the votes. When the municipality planned to erect a mosque in Cologne's Chorweiler district, the citizen's movement organised a collection of signatures petitioning against the project. They were able to present 28,000 signatures against any mosque construction site in Cologne to the committee on petitions only shortly before the 2004 local elections. With the tailwinds from the signatures campaign, the voter's association was able to win 4.7% of the votes and four seats in the Cologne city council. In 2005, a fifth councillor joined Pro Cologne's group. The electoral success initiated the expansion of the party to the state and federal level. In 2007 the movement ran another signature campaign against the Cologne Central Mosque in Ehrenfeld. They showed more than 23,000 signatures, however at least 7,000 of them were not valid and the citizen's initiative failed. In September 2008, Pro Cologne organised the Anti-Islamisation Congress, inviting Mario Borghezio and Filip Dewinter among others. Counter-protests and blockings prompted the police to cancel the congress and rally. The congress was repeated in May 2009. In the 2009 Cologne local election, the party won 5.4% of the votes and was able to defend its five council seats.Official result of the 2009 local election, Cologne municipality, www.stadt-koeln.de.

From 2004 to 2010 it has presented it in its annual reports for the suspicion of right-wing extremist aspirations. In October 2005, Pro Cologne filed a suit against the state to get the mention of the party removed from the annual report. Thereupon the Higher Administrative Court has ruled that there are sufficient factual indications for the suspicions, that justify the observation and mention in the report. Since 2011 the intelligence service has stated that the indications for anti-constitutional aspirations went beyond the scope of mere suspicion.

Where multiple manuscripts have been combined (through for example cut and paste or quotation).  Overview  Whereas traditional scholarly editing can be seen as constructing a new document drawing together and comparing many source documents to cast light on a work, genetic editing closely examines a single extant manuscript and traces back each aspect to cast light on the work. Genetic editing is named by analogy with genetics manuscripts (individuals) are derived from other manuscripts (or previous states of the same manuscript) and with the derivation tree being a partial ordered tree.  Genetic editing models  Genetic editing is strong in European, particularly French and German, textual scholarship. The German genetic editing, which has been associated with synoptic telescoping has a different method of presentation from the Anglo- American model. The primary model and test case of German editions has been Johann Wolfgang von Goethe while in England and the United States it is William Shakespeare, who did not leave manuscripts of his works.

It was turned into a movie in 2018 featuring Lily James as Juliet Ashton. The book is set in 1946 and is an epistolary novel, composed of letters written from one character to another. Plot In January 1946, 32-year-old Juliet Ashton embarks on a cross-country tour across England to promote her latest book. Written under her pen-name Izzy Bickerstaff, the book is a compilation of comedic columns she wrote about life during World War II. Despite the fact that she was initially contracted to write another Izzy Bickerstaff book, Juliet writes to her publisher that she wants to retire the pseudonym. On her tour, Juliet is greeted with flowers from the mysterious Markham V. Reynolds, Jr. Her best friend and publisher, Sidney, warns Juliet that Mark is a wealthy American trying to establish a publishing empire and looking to poach her. Reynolds makes it clear that he is a fan, and she and Reynolds soon begin dating. Juliet receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a complete stranger from Guernsey who has come into possession of her copy of Essays of Elia and who wants to know more about the author, Charles Lamb. Juliet helps to send him further books by Lamb. She is also intrigued that Adams is part of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and inquires about the group's name. After learning that the society began as a cover for residents breaking curfew during the German occupation of Guernsey, Juliet begins a correspondence with several members of the Society, hoping to work them into an article she is writing on the benefits of literature for The Times Literary Supplement. Mark proposes as Juliet is preparing to leave for Guernsey and she delays giving an answer, not wanting to repeat the error of her previous engagement. Juliet also learns that Elizabeth McKenna, the Society's beloved founder, was arrested and sent to a prison in France by the Germans and has yet to return home. The members of the Society are raising her child, Kit, among themselves until Elizabeth returns. As she continues to write to the members of the Society and they to her, Juliet begins to plan a trip to Guernsey to conduct research for a book about the group and their experiences of the war. In Guernsey, Juliet is treated like an old friend and soon helps to watch Kit. She is also there when the members of the Society receive a letter from Remy Giraud, a French woman who was in the Ravensbrück concentration camp with Elizabeth. She informs them that Elizabeth is dead, but several members go to see her and encourage her to visit Guernsey with them, to which she eventually agrees. Juliet decides to center her book on Elizabeth's experiences on Guernsey during the occupation, as told by her friends. While she is writing, Juliet is visited by Mark. Realizing that she has feelings for Dawsey and has since they first met, Juliet definitively rejects Mark's second proposal. As she continues to write, Juliet also realizes that her time spent with Kit means that she now thinks of Kit as a daughter and wants to adopt her. She also longs to be with Dawsey but fears that he has fallen in love with Remy. Remy eventually announces her plans to return to France and train as a baker in Paris. Isola Pribby, a member of the Society, believes that Dawsey is in love with Remy and, using Miss Marple as a model, offers to clean Dawsey's home to find proof he is in love with Remy to convince her to stay in Guernsey. Isola's plan is a failure, and she goes to Juliet to complain that she was unable to find anything that would signify his love for Remy, but instead found numerous pictures and tokens that belong to Juliet. Realizing that he is pining for her, Juliet runs to Dawsey and asks him to marry her. Juliet ends by asking her publisher and friend Sidney to return to Guernsey in time for her wedding in a week's time. Creative background The primary author Mary Ann Shaffer, an American, planned to write the biography of Kathleen Scott, the wife of the English polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott. While researching the subject, she travelled to Cambridge, England, but was discouraged to find that the subject's personal papers were nearly unusable. While dealing with this frustration, she decided to spend some of her planned stay in England by visiting Guernsey in the Channel Islands, which are notable for being geographically closer to continental France than Great Britain. However, as soon as she arrived, the airport was shut down due to heavy fog. Shaffer, therefore, spent her visit in the airport's bookstore, reading several histories of the German occupation of the islands during World War II.A principal source of information was Dorothy Pickard Higgs, Life in Guernsey Under the Nazis, 1940–45 (1979); see amazon.com. It was 20 years before Shaffer began a novel dealing with Guernsey. She had abandoned her plan to write the Scott biography, and said: \\"All I wanted was to write a book that someone would like enough to publish.\\"\\"Afterword\\", The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (paperback edition, 2009), p. 285. After the manuscript had been accepted for publication (2006), the book's editor requested some changes that would require substantial rewriting. However, around that time Shaffer's health began to deteriorate dramatically, leading to her eventual death on February 16, 2008. She asked the daughter of her sister Cynthia, Annie Barrows, an established author of children's literature, to finish the editing and rewriting. Barrows did so and is credited as co-author of the novel. Notable characters Characters of importance include: *Juliet Ashton, author and protagonist *Dawsey Adams, Juliet's first Guernsey correspondent and close friend *Sidney Stark, Juliet's London-based publisher and friend *Sophie Strachan, Sidney's sister and Juliet's best friend *Amelia Maugery, Guernsey resident and hostess of the dinner party that started the Society *Isola Pribby, Guernsey resident, quirky Society member, and vegetable and herb vendor *Eben Ramsey, Guernsey resident and former postman *Eli, Guernsey resident and Eben's grandson *Will Thisbee, Guernsey resident and creator of the first potato peel pie *Kit McKenna, Elizabeth's adorable, ferret-loving daughter *Elizabeth McKenna, London-born young lady who was caught on Guernsey at the war's outset, and the quick-witted founder of the Society *Remy Giraud, a Frenchwoman and friend of Elizabeth's in a German concentration camp Reception The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was reviewed by The Washington PostThe Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, August 3, 2008 and The Times, among other outlets.Vine, Sarah. \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer – A perfectly cooked delight: a charming epistolary novel about the wartime German occupation of Guernsey\\", August 8, 2008.

August 2, 2009. Stevie Davies, writing for The Guardian, said, \\"Shaffer's Guernsey characters step from the past radiant with eccentricity and kindly humour, a comic version of the state of grace. They are innocents who have seen and suffered, without allowing evil to penetrate the rind of decency that guards their humanity. Their world resembles Shakespeare's Ephesian or Illyrian comedies; but its territory incorporates both Elysium and Hades.\\" Publishers Weekly said of the book, \\"The occasionally contrived letters jump from incident to incident—including the formation of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society while Guernsey was under German occupation—and person to person in a manner that feels disjointed. But Juliet's quips are so clever, the Guernsey inhabitants so enchanting and the small acts of heroism so vivid and moving that one forgives the authors (Shaffer died earlier this year) for not being able to settle on a single person or plot.\\" Kirkus Reviews said of the book, \\"Elizabeth and Juliet are appealingly reminiscent of game but gutsy '40s movie heroines. The engrossing subject matter and lively writing make this a sure winner, perhaps fodder for a TV series.\\" Adaptations A film adaptation, directed by Mike Newell and starring Lily James as Juliet Ashton, was released in 2018. It premiered and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom in April 2018 and in France in June 2018. The film grossed $15.7 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics. It was distributed in other international areas by Netflix on 10 August 2018 as an original film.

At noon on 8 January, a 21-gun salute was fired from the Sixtus Battery at Holmen Naval Base in Copenhagen and from Kronborg Castle in North Zealand to mark the arrival of a royal child. Vincent and his sister were baptized on 14 April 2011, at the chapel of the Church of Holmen. His name was announced as Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander.

The software was originally developed by VMware, transferred to Pivotal Software (a joint venture by EMC, VMware and General Electric) but brought back into VMware at the end of 2019 with VMware's take over of Pivotal.  History  Originally conceived in 2009, Cloud Foundry was designed and developed by a small team at VMware led by Derek Collison and was originally called Project B29. At the time, a different PaaS project written in Java for Amazon EC2 used the name Cloud Foundry. It was founded by Chris Richardson in 2008 and acquired by SpringSource in 2009, the same year VMware acquired SpringSource. The current project is unrelated to the project under SpringSource, but the name was adopted when the original SpringSource project ended. The announcement of Cloud Foundry took place in April 2011. A year later, in April 2012, BOSH, an open source tool chain for release engineering, deployment, and life-cycle management of large scale distributed services, was publicly launched. In April 2013, Pivotal was created from EMC and VMware, to market assets including Cloud Foundry, RabbitMQ and Spring. By February 2014, it was announced that there would be an open governance foundation established with seven Platinum members and two Gold members. In May 2014, there was an announcement of expanded membership with the addition of eight new companies. By December 2014, the membership had increased to 40.  Cloud Foundry Foundation  In January 2015, the Cloud Foundry Foundation was created as an independent not-for-profit 501(c)(6) Linux Foundation Collaborative Project. Following the creation of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, the Cloud Foundry software (source code and all associated trademarks) was transferred to be held by the open source software foundation. It is primarily written in Ruby, Go and Java. As of February 2019, the Foundation had 65 members. The foundation serves as a neutral party holding all Cloud Foundry intellectual property. Once intellectual property is contributed to Cloud Foundry, it becomes property of the Foundation and these assets cannot be transferred to for-profit entities, as per the laws governing 501(c)(6) organizations. The Foundation holds two contributed types of intellectual property: trademarks and a copyright on the collective work of the community. It also has a license to use and re-license all code contributions, but does not own copyright on those contributions.  Usage  Cloud Foundry is promoted for continuous delivery as it supports the full application development lifecycle, from initial development through all testing stages to deployment. Cloud Foundry’s container-based architecture runs apps in any programming language over a variety of cloud service providers. This multi-cloud environment allows developers to use the cloud platform that suits specific application workloads and move those workloads as necessary within minutes with no changes to the application.  Services  Applications deployed to Cloud Foundry access external resources via an Open Service Broker API, which was launched in December 2016. In a platform, all external dependencies such as databases, messaging systems, file systems and so on are considered services. Cloud Foundry allows administrators to create a marketplace of services, from which users can provision these services on-demand. When an application is pushed to Cloud Foundry the services it needs may also be specified. This process puts the credentials in an environment variable.  Software  The development of Cloud Foundry is supported by the Cloud Foundry Foundation, through the governance process agreed to by its members. The source code is under an Apache License 2.0. and contributions are made based on the Cloud Foundry contributors' licenses for individuals and corporations. Born on a container- based architecture, Cloud Foundry is able to support innovation in containers through collaboration with other projects and standards such as Open Container Initiative (OCI) and Container Network Interface (CNI). Languages and frameworks that can be deployed using the buildpack lifecycle include:.. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"width: auto; text-align: left; font-size: 95%; table-layout: fixed; line-height:1.25\\" - !

Cloud Foundry Application Runtime can be deployed to many different infrastructure providers, including VMware’s vSphere, OpenStack, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud and others using the Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) capability of the Cloud Foundry BOSH project. It is also possible to install Cloud Foundry using a BOSH-Lite Vagrant virtual machine.. Platform The Cloud Foundry platform is available from either the Cloud Foundry Foundation as open-source software or from a variety of commercial providers as either a software product or delivered as a service. Cloud Foundry is open-source software, and hence, it is available to anyone. Deploying Cloud Foundry involves interfacing with the underlying infrastructure using the Cloud Foundry BOSH deployment system, another open- source tool governed by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. In December 2015, the Cloud Foundry Foundation announced the “Cloud Foundry PaaS Certification program” which delineated criteria to be considered a Cloud Foundry Certified Provider.

He presented each year in the official order of precedence, the list of members of the royal family of France, the princes of blood, and the main body of the kingdom, great crown officers, senior clerics, abbots of large abbeys (with income of each abbey), marshals of France, colonels and general officers, ambassadors and consuls of France, presidents of the main courts, state councilors, bankers, etc.. Despite the fact that it could appear indigestible because of the many lists that it contained, the publication enjoyed a wide circulation with a readership consisting primarily of financiers, politicians, and all persons who had an interest in knowing the administrative organization of France. Although his edition is due to the initiative of a private publisher, included in the lists of the Almanac was a royal official and abuse were therefore punished. Thus, a Poitevin, Pierre Joly, was interned in the Bastille at the end of the eighteenth century to have usurped the banking profession by being registered as such in the Almanach Royal. His edition was in regular format in-8 o editor with a binder leather adorned with a sprinkling of fleur de lys gold. History =Founded at the request of King= Laurent d'Houry imagines a calendar or Almanac 1683. The first edition contained only a few pages with a calendar and omens for the coming year. The last edition in this form, in 1699, already shows some lists that foreshadow the upcoming Royal Almanac. Thus we find lists of counselors of state with their ordinary homes, the commissioners of the Board, auditors general and stewards of finances, the Chancellor, archbishops and bishops of France, universities, and the list of major exhibitions, sessions of the courts of Paris and the log of the Palace, and finally addresses the messengers and items indicating the day of departure. In 1699, Louis XIV asked him what the author describes in detail his work. Here as his widow explains these beginnings : :\\"Louis XIV, who wanted this glorious memory Almanac, made him ask the author, who had the honor to present to Her Majesty's what induced him to give the title of Royal Almanac, & to make it his principal occupation of this work. \\" The same year Louis Tribouillet, chaplain of the king and canon of Meaux, publishes its State of France. This book describes in detail the functioning of the Court of the King, all his ministers, the treatments they receive, the various expenses of the state, clergy, etc.. The first edition of the Almanac Royal appears in 1700, at the same time as another book, Calendar of the Court of John Colombat, one of the printers of the King. Parisians have a choice between three books with similar content: the Almanach Royal Houry, Calendar of the Court of Colombat and the State of France Tribouillet. At that time, the yard around Louis XIV is highly stratified and since the expansion of the Palace of Versailles in 1684, it continues to grow. In this context, recognition of peers is a valuable asset \\"if someone has just placed a new post is an overflow of praise in its favor during the floods and the Chapel (...) but c is that while envy and jealousy talk like adulation.. One can understand the need to maintain directories so that everyone can follow the evolution of all these people. The multiplicity of these publications so says the king's will want to \\"officially\\" referencing his courtiers to charges created to keep beside him at Versailles, and maintain the jealousies of each other. Even if the king gave his approval, publishing such a book is not without risk. In December 1708, Laurent d'Houry is being prosecuted for having established a printing press in his house and forced to sell its equipment two months later. Then, in February 1716, he was imprisoned in the Bastille on complaint of the Earl of Stair, the British Ambassador, \\"to be disrespectful in his almanac, the King George by not naming him not as king of England, or rather from Great Britain, and mention the king as son of Jacques II Stuart, exiled to St. Germain. =Affirmation of a monopoly= The Almanac and the Royal Court Calendar coexist peacefully for ten years and a lot of money to their authors, but from 1710, Laurent d'Houry integrates more and more topics like the book Colombat Biblio. The abscess broke out in 1717 when Houry Almanac releases its Abstract that will follow the format of the Calendar of the Court and simultaneously filing a lawsuit against its competitor. A Judgement of Solomon is made: if it is allowed to Houry now to continue the publication of its abstract and to counterfeit the Court Calendar, Colombat is obliged to freeze its calendar format and forbidden 'expand content. This stops any changes in the calendar of the Court, leaving the way open to the Almanac. Upon the death of Laurent Houry in 1725, his family is destitute. Revenues from sales of the Almanac are not sufficient to cover expenses of printing and bookselling. In these circumstances, his widow, Elizabeth Dubois, took over the business. Their son Charles-Maurice, who had hitherto been a mere proofreader of the Almanac, is trying to evict her mother and she is suing cons. It prepares the edition of 1726 but a ruling forbade him to publish it in his name alone. The ruling of 11 December 1726 forbids even disturb the affairs of his mother and to participate directly or indirectly to the development of the Almanac. That is why Charles-Maurice is mentioned as editor of the Almanac on the edition of 1726. In 1731, she filed a new lawsuit against Colombat which increased its schedule despite the prohibition of 1717. Unsuccessful, she resumed the publication of the Abstract and Colombat complaint in turn, she then accepts to abandon the publication of the Abstract \\"if returned to Colombat format from 1718. \\"The disputes have become extinct with the death of the parties. The privilege of the Almanac is about to expire, Charles-Maurice d'Houry tries one last time to seize it, but a royal letter of 27 March 1744 confirmed definitively André-François Le Breton as sole heir. A family of hegemony 131 years =Directorate of André Le Breton= In 1728, the widow of his grandson, Houry combines son André-François Le Breton, who was 18 years old and an orphan under the guardianship of Charles-Maurice d'Houry. Andrew Francis had inherited, according to the will of the estate of Lawrence Houry, half of the rights of the Almanac, and his widow, the rest. Under his leadership, the Almanac takes a new breath and adds new sections, which sometimes does not go without punishment. For example, in 1768, he has trouble with Voltaire, who sent him a letter incendiary: :\\"I say as much to Le Breton, the Almanach royal printer: I'll pay him Almanac point that sold me this year. He had the rudeness to say that Mr. President... Mr. advisor..., remains in the cul-de-sac to Menard, in the cul-de-sac of the White Coats in the ass -de- sac de l'Orangerie. (...) How can you say that president remains in a serious ass?\\" In 1773, Le Breton moved his print shop in a wing of the former Hotel d'Alegre, at 13 rue de Hautefeuille, he acquired William Louis Joly de Fleury and was previously occupied by Ambassador Portugal. In the late eighteenth century, the weather is bad and bad wheat harvests. The price of this staple increases disproportionately. Recently, a rumor that the government would have the monopoly wheat, thus perpetuating the high cost of food. This rumor became official when accidentally in his edition of 1774, Le Breton added a \\"Treasurer's grain account of the King\\" in the person of Sr. Mirlavaud. The edition of the Almanac had yet been proofread and approved by the Chancellor, but was still sentenced to close his shop for 3 months and publish a revised edition, without the line in question,. In 1777, Le Breton was again accused of inserting information deemed subversive. It has, according to its critics, cited \\"the Floral & Pranks Vergès & Vaucresson, among the prosecutors and attorneys general of the Parliament of Paris, who had been involved in a reform of parliament made by Maupeou against the venality of Parliament desired by Louis XV, but annulled by Louis XVI. In rebuke, Le Breton was sentenced to \\" carton \\"section on the Almanacs that had not yet been sold, and replacement cost, the Almanac issue of those who so request it.\\" He died on 4 October 1779 and his cousin, Charles-Laurent Houry, son of Charles-Maurice d'Houry, took over the business. =French Revolution= The privilege granted to the family of Houry for the Almanac has been threatened in 1789 when Camille Desmoulins, in his speech at the Lantern to the Parisians, says it will cease in favor of Baldwin, another Parisian publisher. This threat has not been brought into effect since the Almanac remained in Houry. Looking at the publications of the time, we can nevertheless see that Baldwin got the impressions of the National Assembly and other organs of state. =Last generation Houry= Following the death of Joan Nera, widow of Laurent-Charles Houry, the Almanac is echoed by Jean-François-Noël Debure, husband of Anne- Charlotte d'Houry, their daughter. Debure is from a prominent and wealthy family of Parisian booksellers, especially combined with the Didot family. It is a printer since 1784 with the title's printer Duke of Orleans. Debure takes time printing of the family of Houry, but his other business is in trouble and he is forced to file for bankruptcy. To keep the property inherited from his family, Anne-Charlotte d'Houry hires a separation procedure. In November 1791, the bankruptcy is declared and it is opposed to the creditors to preserve his legacy, and this opposition is futile and a ruling allows creditors to seize his furniture, but that does not appear to have been necessary because a subsequent decision allows him to recover property that creditors have not taken her husband. Francois-Jean-Noel Debure dies 1802 in Loiret. However, it is focused died from 1795 through various sources. Maybe it was just left without leaving an address. Stephen Lawrence Testu worked as a clerk in the family home Debure since 1788, and had gradually won the confidence of the household. Because of the absence of Mr. Debure, Anne-Charlotte is alone with his two son. Despite their age difference, he is 20 years younger than she, she married Testu July 1795. Testu few highlights its knowledge in the profession to convince him to transfer the management of printing. It accepts in 1797 and offered him priority over the rights of the Almanac in exchange for a perpetual annuity of 800 francs, then she completely abandons the Almanac. This influx of money seems to turn the head Testu who play games and learn to enjoy the easy life, neglects the direction of its establishment and constantly running out of money, he contracted many loans that gradually ruining his business. Relations were strained with his wife because he left the marital home in September 1801 and the only ties that bind the couple are now linked to multiple trials they s'intentent. In 1810, Testu secretly sold the rights of the Almanac in which he partnered with Guyot. Anne-Charlotte d'Houry opposes this sale she saw as a usurpation, but loses the case in 1812. She gets in return a pension of 1 200 francs Testu does not pay. Indeed, a decree of 1820 declares the debtor more than 90 000 francs... In 1814, due to the large sums invested by Guyot in the case, an order confirming the owner of the Almanac, a copy of this order is also printed at the end of the following books. Testu still gets Guyot repayment of its debts and an annuity of 2,400 francs. Guyot dismisses Testu business in 1820 and continues even to pay his annuity. The latter, again running out of money turned in 1823 against his wife, calls it reaches the marital home and she pays all household expenses, or alternatively, that she pays rent of 6000 francs. Judges déboutent Testu the marital home, since he himself had deserted 22 years earlier and has no housing to offer his wife even though she already lives in a very beautiful but still require his wife, yet very rich, to pay him a pension of 1,800 francs by invoking the solidarity between spouses. The hegemony of the family of Houry on the Almanac established in 1683 has finally ceased in 1814 when, by order, the company is transferred to the association Guyot-Testu. Anne- Charlotte d'Houry died 22 July 1828 aged about 83 years. =Judgement of publishing= In 1867, edition of the Almanac is transferred to the widow Berger-Levrault, who had already published the Yearbook of the French empire diplomatic, and military Yearbook of the French empire, both published as the Almanac according to documents provided by the administration. The edition of the Almanac stops definitively in 1919 after four years of interruption due to war, the latter number includes the years 1915 to 1919. Not found in the literature the reasons that prompted the shutdown of publication, but it can be assumed that the combination of very large volume of the book (more than 1650 pages in 1900) and the hard times that the Economics and French policy at that time was to make the management of such a volume of information extremely complex and unprofitable for the publisher. It is also possible that the new government formed after elections in 1919 no longer supported the development of the Almanac. Changing content =The topics in the Almanac= The Almanac or Calendar, as he was called in its early editions, was just a simple calendar which were associated topics on astronomical events, the days of fairs, the newspaper of the Palace, the residence of messengers The departure of the mails, the price of currencies and the list of collectors' offices. After his presentation to the king in 1699, many items are constantly being added including the clergy, the royal family of France, then the families of other sovereign nations, officers, ambassadors, etc.. In 1705, Houry added to the list of knights of the Holy Spirit and peer and marshal of France. In 1707, it is the state of the clergy and, in 1712, the birth of kings, princes and princesses of Europe. After the death of Louis XIV, the Duke of Orleans, became the Regent, is added to the list of members of the royal family of the members of the House of Orleans. Later, he put more of his own, the full house of the Queen and princes. It is not possible to describe all items contained in an almanac as there, so the contents of 1780 covers ten pages: The Almanac also stands abreast of scientific advances. In the middle of the eighteenth century, improving the accuracy of clocks and many wealthy fans begin to observe and study the stars. It is indispensable to know precisely the difference between true solar time of sundials, and mean solar time clocks, especially since the advent of clocks seconds. This is the equation of the pendulum, also called the equation of time, the table is added shortly before 1750. With the French Revolution, the Almanac exchange of title and its content is modified to match the new institutions. The abolition of all distinctions requires overhaul the topics, timing of the vulgar era is replaced by the Republican calendar, the place reserved for kings and princes of Europe is replaced by a note on the friendly powers of France, the administrative organs of royal power are replaced by new ministries. The content changes again with the reforms of the Consulate and the Empire, the Restoration, the Hundred Days, the July Monarchy, the Second Republic followed the Second Empire and the Third Republic who sees the end of the edition of Almanac. In each case, the bindings are supplied with the times. As the number of entries is increasing, the number of pages follows the same trend: they numbered one hundred in 1699, nearly five-hundred in 1760, and seven-hundred just before the French Revolution. The course of a thousand pages is taken in 1840 to over 1000-6-cents in 1900. On average, about thirty names are listed per page, the total number of people or places listed annually in the tens of thousands, but no table patronymic does quickly find a particular name. All changes in the Almanac makes it a very useful book for historians that may follow, year after year, ministries and other administrative bodies, movements of people in these offices, and retail organization public services to a resident of Paris (such as places of mailboxes, timetables and fares for ticks and royal messengers ). =Chronology of the 237 years of publishing Almanacs= After the death of Laurent Houry, his descendants continued his work until 1814. The edition was continued until 1919. It would be tedious to describe in words the evolution of the Almanac of the 237 years that have elapsed since the first edition by Laurent d'Houry in 1683, hence the choice of this table layout. Throughout its existence, the Almanac has crossed 11 schemes political editor changed the title 14 times and 9 times. Publication =Collecting information= Since its inception in 1700, following a royal demand, the Almanac invented by Laurent d'Houry aims to be an official handbook. Until the French Revolution, contributors are cordially invited to provide information to the bookseller, as pointed note of the printer in the first pages of the Almanac. In 1771, for example, we read in the Journal History of the Revolution that the Bar Association in the person of a certain Gerbier, asserted that \\"there would be no change in the order of the table, and that it would be printed in the Almanac as Royal was last year, leaving out only the dead.\\" With the French Revolution, the order was given to government to provide all information to the publisher. In 1802, Testu gets even exclusivity. Later, the collection of information for the Almanac is even part of the operating budget of the ministries and can be seen in order of December 31, 1844 signed by Louis-Philippe I \\"on the organization of the Ministry Administration Navy \\"Article 6 of which list the items in the budget\\" the formation of the Royal Almanac. Typography The print quality improves significantly when Laurent d'Houry became printer. It multiplies the bands and tail-lights to decorate and titles for sections. The Almanac is still very poor prints because the image is not its goal. Only that the reader can find are patterns explaining the oppositions of the planets and eclipses are present every year, and the map of departments of France editions of 1791 and 1792. Despite the short time to prepare the book, the printer treats the presentation and uses in the case of many variations in size and shape of characters for easy reading of long lists, special characters to emphasize certain lines, compositions tables or columns and clusters in braces. That Le Breton, grand son of Laurent Houry, who brings more to the book. It increases greatly and restructures the Almanac, and also improves its presentation in order to preserve readability. Many notes are added to guide the reader and help in understanding the operation of certain administrative bodies. The Almanacs modern nineteenth-century advantage of technological advances. Cartoon characters are modernized and the use of fonts to graphics customizable multiplies, sometimes to excess: we can count at least 7 in 11 fonts fonts differ on the cover page of the National Almanac 1850 printed by Guyot et Scribe! Announcements, the ancestors of advertising, are introduced by the publisher Berger-Levrault in the late nineteenth century. Well-to- shoot The deadline for submitting this information to the editor is set to \\"first ten days of October (or November). The last-minute changes are incorporated in an erratum end of the book. When they are too large, they may even delay the release. In late December, an event is sent to the administration for approving the content. This approval is required before the sale. It leaves only two months to integrate the information of the year in the text of the previous edition and call all of the pages before submitting the book for the right to shoot. The editing step, at least for the test in 1706, has not been done with great care as can be seen by very many shells and mistakes which have crept into the table of contents presented in thumbnail to the right. Once the administrative agreement obtained, it is inserted end of the book, the Almanac is stapled or bound and is then distributed to customers at the end of the year. =Printing= Early Almanacs were not printed by Laurent d'Houry. The Almanac of 1706 and is printed by Jacques Vincent, installed Huchette street, at the sign of the Angel. November 15, 1712, Laurent Houry became printer and immediately began printing his work. Then all the almanacs will be printed by their publishers. Draw There is no source that explains the draw of the Almanac. The only figures available are the annual rents generated by sales. In 1782, Mercier said a pension of more than 40 000 francs. Diderot, at the same time, puts the figure at 30,000 pounds. For a price of sale of 5 to 6 pounds, the draw must necessarily be greater than about 7500 almanacs. Around 1820, during the trials that have brought the widow and Debure Testu, income of the Almanac was estimated between 25 and 30 000 francs. In 1834, another almanac, the Almanac of France, said that its cost is 35 cents for a sale price of 50 cents. Booksellers then purchase the item at prices of 38 cents, to resell a suggested retail price of 50 cents. The publisher earns so 3 cents per pound sold, the bookseller earns 12 (minus shipping costs, dependent). If one considers - arbitrarily - a four Almanac is sold directly into the library Testu (priced at 10 francs 50) the remainder being passed through intermediaries, we can prorate that to generate an annual income of 30 000 francs Testu must sell approximately 25 000. In the absence of more precise information, we can only estimate at about 15,000, the number of copies sold per year between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Binding The almanac is sold either stapled or bound by the printer. The paperback version allows the purchaser to connect his book as he wishes, and so it is possible to find books with bindings very ornate, with lace, weapons of families, many colors brightened or gilding Biblio 24, etc.. The bound version provided by the printer is usually presented in a bound in calf or Morocco, full, and lilies in the boxes back. With the revolution, the lilies are replaced with Phrygian caps in roundels Library 25. Distribution The Almanac is normally available from the bookseller, but it can also be found in the province in other bookstores that serve as intermediaries, for example in 1816, at Pesche, bookseller at Le Mans Ref 17, or by correspondence through the Sorbonne, as did Voltaire Ref 18. =Readership= The Almanac has a very great interest because of the number of subjects it addresses the organization of the French administration. In 1785, Mairobert wrote that \\"the Almanach Royal is in the hands of everyone and is among the Princes, the King's office, the foreign ministers would cater Ref 19. Louis-Sebastien Mercier in a pamphlet, the Tableau de Paris that stands in 1782 Ref 20 explains that \\"Those who are thrown into the paths of ambition, study Almanac Royal with serious attention,\\" \\"more a beautiful royal consult the almanac to see if her lover is a lieutenant or sergeant,... \\", that\\" everyone is buying the almanac to find out exactly where they stand. \\"And finally\\" even Fontenelle said, that it was the book which contained the greatest truths.\\" Adages use the almanac as a reference. According to Jean- François de La Harpe is \\"the only book to read to get rich is the Royal Almanac Ref 21, Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin uses the phrase\\" having the memory of a Royal Almanac Ref 22 \\" or the Memoirs of the Academy of hawkers Ref 23 explains that \\"it is enough to read the Almanac for education.\\" In the eyes of justice, the book can be used as a basis for comparison: during a police investigation in 1824 Ref 24, a defendant defends himself by explaining that the volume of documents he was accused of having carried \\"could be equal to that of a royal Almanac almanac or a related trade.\\" Whether to have a certain level of resources to purchase this item, the customer extended beyond the financial and political world. Competition The Royal Almanac is competing at its inception with the Almanac of the Court of Colombat who can not make it evolve since 1717. In fact, bibliographers consider that the Royal Almanac is one of the \\"oldest and most helpful Ref 25\\". If it essentially describes the royal court and the Parisian institutions, other major cities also have their almanacs, such as the city of Lyon equally voluminous Ref 26. The Almanac is however considered a reference book. In 1780, a notice of a bookseller named Desnos inserted at the end of the Gazette of 27 offers for courts Ref 8 pounds to \\"the statesman, letters, and generally all persons attached to the service of the King (... ) Almanach Royal, Calendar of the Court, said Colombat, Mignone Strennas-Note 22, Ref 28, the State Military Note 23, the four connected units, with shelves & stylus to write, which makes the closure \\": the Royal Almanac ranks first in the collection. =The Court Calendar= Since 1717, the Calendar of the Court can not change, its sections are limited to an ephemeris of the celestial motions (30 years) increased by astronomical tables with sky conditions, and timing of the court to the family and royal house, lists of boards, departments and secretaries of state finances, births and deaths of kings, queens, princes and princesses of Europe, the knights of various orders, the archbishops and bishops of the kingdom and Cardinals of the Sacred College. It is primarily sought for its ephemeris of the celestial motions and astronomical tables of events =The Almanac of Commerce= The Almanac of Business, published by Sébastien Bottin in the eighteenth century contains, besides the addresses of shops in Paris, many useful statistics financiers. It is supplementary to the Almanach royal, which concerns only the French administration. =The State of France= Some have criticized the Almanach Royal of being a plagiarism of the State of France, another administrative directory, the first publication seems to have been made in 1619 and is still published in the middle of the eighteenth century Ref 30. However, the edition of 1736 of the State of France said it was a \\"periodical whose audience has applied for renewal from time to time, and had been published until 1699, 1702, 1708, 1712, 1718 and 1727 Ref 31. The latest editions of 1727 and 1736 five volumes contain over 500 pages each. Offices are described down to the smallest detail Note 25, the state of France is a companion volume of the Almanach royal use by those who wish to deepen their knowledge on the functioning of the French administration. Examples of information contained in the Almanac Further details concerning the organization of the administration of the French state, and persons who occupied positions, many other topics are discussed in the Almanacs, for example in the eighteenth century: =The cost of construction in Paris= This section is only found in the Almanacs of the early eighteenth century, and stops just before 1726. There are prices for masonry, carpentry and joinery, roofing, locksmithing, painting and glazing that are usually in Paris, for example: :\\"Walls of circular pits, with layers of stone studded with low excess moilon quilted 18 inch thick, 22 pounds fquare fathom, and more in proportion to the depth of the wells, or other difficulties that may encounter.\\" With these data, the historian is able to quantify fully the construction of a building in Paris at that time. =The official ceremonies= The Almanac explains in great detail some official ceremonies: * Opening Ceremony of the Annual Courthouse :\\"The Entry of Parliament is the day after the S. Martin, 12 November, which day Presidents in red dresses holding their furs & Mortar Note 26, & Gowns Gentlemen Consultants red, after attending the solemn Mass that are usually said by a Bishop in the grand hall of the Palace, receive oaths of Lawyers & Counsel. The first president made this day a speech to thank those who celebrated the Mass, which responds to him by another harangue Note 27.\\" * Procession of the University, whose description takes three pages of the Almanac Note 28 :\\"The Rector of the University at the end of its Rector, who regularly is only three months, indicating a general procession which assists the whole body. It is a ceremony that deserves to be seen. We will mark the place here What the doctors take the four faculties Note 29 that comprise the university, all the graduates of these faculties, with the Religious Orders Note 30. Procession from the Church of Religious Trinitarians, otherwise known as Maturin. (...) The procession is closed by the booksellers, papermakers, bookbinders, Parcherminiers, illuminators, writers swear by the University.\\" The detailed description of the ceremonies to stop mid-eighteenth century to make room for a still more comprehensive directory. A reference is then made towards the end of the book \\"guides for all kinds of ceremonies to be observed in the receipt of any office or employment whether in dress or in the Sword.\\" =Transportation= Transportation of persons is ensured by the coaches, carriages, wagons and other carriages. Found in the Almanac schedules and rates of major roads. In 1715, a passenger wishing to travel from Paris to Caen will go rue Saint-Denis on Monday at six o'clock in the morning. He has previously \\"sent his clothes the night before early.\\" Fifteen years later, the starting time is advanced to 5 am in summer and in 1750, the departure is 5 hours throughout the year. In 1780, two flights are scheduled Tuesdays and Fridays at 23:30 and the journey takes two days. A van, slower, except Sunday at noon and made the trip in four and a half days in summer and five days in winter. In 1790, transportation is now provided by the General Department of stagecoaches and mail royal France. Three coaches liaise on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and the van on Sunday. The departure is now Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. Rates are rarely reported but in 1725 and 1761 is 18 pounds per person tournaments. He is 21 pounds in 1770 to reach 42 pounds in 1790 (fortunately for the traveler, it is stated that the \\"sleeping bag weighing 10 pounds is\\" free\\"). =Company guards of the King Pumps= In 1716, the king appoints François Perrier Dumouriez as Director General of public pump to remedy fire, without the audience is obliged to pay anything. In 1722, he founded the Compagnie des Gardes Pumps du Roy, under the direction of the same. This company later became the Brigade of firefighters in Paris Note 32. The Almanac of 1719 lists these pumps and their wardens and deputy wardens. We then learned that a brigade is made up of four guards and four sub-custodians who are responsible for maintaining the material deposited in each district. What became three years later the Society of King's Guards Pumps were not at that time that 41 people, 17 pumps distributed in groups of 8 men and 4 or 3 pumps in the City Hall, the convent of the Grands Augustins The Carmelite convent in the Place Maubert, Convent of Mercy, and the Fathers of Little Place des Victoires, in addition to a pump at the Director General of the pumps, Rue Mazarine. Except Dumouriez guards pumps are not professional fire but shoemakers, carpenters, locksmiths, etc.. Considerations bibliophiles =Availability= Almanacs are found regularly in auctions and in the antiquarian booksellers. Given their importance documentary and the fact that there are beautiful copies, these books are particularly sought after by historians, writers, bibliophiles and enthusiasts. Volumes in the first round of the seventeenth century often exceed several thousand euros Ref 32, the other is generally negotiated between a few tens and five hundred euros, sometimes more, depending on their rarity, condition and quality bookbinding Note 33. Just over half are however available for free download on Gallica or Google Books: =Notes handwritten readers= Almanacs contain some handwritten notes left by their readers. The value of the book can then be influenced upward or downward depending on the quality and content of these notes, and especially the person who wrote them - when you can identify it. They are usually found on page intentionally left blank for the ephemeris. Some of these notes can provide very interesting information, such as notes written on the page in August 1715 a copy of the BNF. It relates the circumstances of the death of Louis XIV, who was suffering from gangrene Note 34: :\\"We thought the death dez Roy Lundy 25. He marched :better a day or two quoyque hopeless.

She was the eldest daughter of Katsunuma Nobutomo (勝沼 信友), a samurai of the Sengoku period. She lived as a nun on Daizen-ji temple at Mount Kashiwao and is most notable for her military history, Rikei-ni no Ki, or \\"Nun Rikei’s Account.\\" Influence In 1582, the daimyō (大名) or warlord Takeda Katsuyori (武田 勝頼) rebelled against the rival Hojo clan, but because of his poor leadership skills, he was defeated by Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu. He, his young formal wife, and about ninety of their followers, mostly women, fled to Rikei's nunnery. However, because of Katsuyori's failure as an administrator, no one wanted to welcome or pity this retinue. Rikei, on the other hand, pitied their fate. She was familiar with the style of military tales, so she wrote Rikei-ni no Ki or \\"The Nun Rikei's Account\\" to honor them so that their names at least could remain. The Rikei-ni no Ki is one of three military accounts written by women in this time period (1600s), the others being the Oan Monogatari and the Okiku Monogatari. Rikei's work starts with a description of the Takeda clan's genealogy, and then she moves into a description of the killings and ritualistic suicides that the retinue committed in order to preserve their honor and avoid capture. She also incorporated a myougouka, or prayer verse, in her account. After describing the death of Katsuyori's formal wife, she lists seven poems. The beginning of these verses form the acrostic \\"na-mu-a-mi-ta-hu-tsu,\\" which is a Buddhist prayer that translates loosely to \\"Glory to Amitabha\\" or \\"May they rest in peace.\\".

Previously known as Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists (SCP) it changed its name in 2018. The charitable subsidiary of the organisation is the College of Podiatry which was formed in 2012. The union originated in 1912 as the Society of Chiropodists, the first organisation of chiropodists in Europe. In 1916, it was renamed the Incorporated Society of Chiropodists, and in 1919, it established examinations for potential new members. Several rival organisations emerged: the Northern Association of Chiropodists, the Chelsea Chiropodists Association and the British Association of Chiropodists. These merged with the Incorporated Society in 1945, the new body once more taking the name Society of Chiropodists. It was recognised as a negotiating body by the National Health Service in 1948, but did not register as a trade union until 1978. In 1993, it took its current name, recognising the membership of podiatrists, and in 1997, it affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. In 1998, the Association of Chief Chiropody Officers and the Podiatry Association both merged with the society. Vision The objectives for which the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists is established are as follows: *be the pre- eminent membership organisation for podiatrists and regulated/supervised support workers in the four UK countries; *endeavour to ensure that podiatry in all its forms is recognised as a core component of national and local health planning and delivery; *represent and meet the needs of members in the four UK countries as a trade union and provider of benefits and services; *play a leading role in the international Federation, particularly in relation to European matters, and contribute to creating a strong and active global membership; *be on a firm and sustainable financial footing with a diversity of income streams; *benefit from a motivated and highly trained secretariat who will take responsibility to lead in their area of responsibility- engage with service users to ensure that policies being pursued by the Society are designed to meet their needs.

He was born in Sheffield. He began his career in local football with St Mary's and Shirebrook. After a spell in the Midland League with Rotherham Town, Laycock signed as a professional with Sheffield Wednesday in March 1923. However, he failed to make a first-team appearance for the club and moved on a free transfer to Football League Third Division North side Barrow the following year. At Holker Street, Laycock scored 10 goals in 31 league matches. Said to be an outstanding header of the football, his form for Barrow attracted other clubs to his signature. At the match against Rotherham County on 16 March 1925, the final day for transfers in the 1924–25 season, several clubs sent representatives to sign the player. While the game was in progress, Laycock was called from the field of play to sign for Third Division North rivals Nelson, before completing the rest of the match for Barrow. Both Laycock and Nelson were later fined over the incident, Laycock receiving his punishment for illegally representing Barrow while contracted to a different club. Laycock made his Nelson debut four days later in the 2–0 win against Hartlepools United at Seedhill. He scored his first goal for the club the following week in the 1–0 victory away at Rochdale, the team's third consecutive win. However, Nelson's form then faltered as they took just one point from the next three games. Laycock netted twice in the 7–0 defeat of Crewe Alexandra on 13 April 1925, the biggest winning margin Nelson ever achieved in the Football League.Dykes (2009), pp. 78–79 Later in the month, he scored four goals in two matches against Wrexham and Southport. Laycock continued his goalscoring form into the following season, but was then dropped to the reserve team. He scored 18 goals in the Lancashire Combination as the Nelson reserves won the league for the first time. Laycock returned to the first-team in April 1926 and scored three goals in the last five matches of the 1925–26 campaign, including two in the 3–3 draw with Chesterfield. In the summer of 1926 Laycock moved into non-League football with Mansfield Town, where he spent one season before returning to the Third Division North with New Brighton. He had a record of a goal every other game for the Wallasey- based club, ending the 1927–28 season with 14 goals in 28 appearances. Laycock switched club again in September 1928, joining Southern Football League club Peterborough & Fletton United on a free transfer. Another move to Darlington in the summer of 1929 meant a third spell in the Football League for Laycock. His record of 14 goals in 35 matches helped Darlington to a third-placed finish in the league, but Laycock was released at the end of the season and signed for York City. During a single season with the Fulfordgate club, he netted 12 times in 27 League appearances. Laycock moved to Third Division South outfit Swindon Town in May 1931, his 11th new club in as many years. He made his debut for them in the 3–2 defeat against his former club Mansfield Town on 29 August 1931, and scored his first goal for the side in the following fixture, a 4–1 victory over Watford at the County Ground. Despite playing regularly for the first three months of the season, he was used only sparingly in the latter stages of the campaign. Laycock scored his second and last Swindon goal on the final Football League appearance of his career, in the 4–0 win against Gillingham on 9 April 1932. After leaving Swindon in July 1933, he had a spell in Northern Ireland with Derry City before returning to the English non-League game with Witton Albion in October 1934. Laycock subsequently assisted several non-League sides, including Nuneaton Town and Cannock Town. He had trial periods with Northwich Victoria and Shrewsbury Town in 1936, and joined his final club, Hereford United, in January 1937. Laycock returned to Sheffield at the end of his playing career and died in the city on 19 September 1989, at the age of 92.

They began in 1979 as the Ortho-Tones, but changed their name to the Orthotonics in 1982. The group released three albums before splitting up in 1989. Eugene Chadbourne at AllMusic said the Orthotonics were \\"unusual\\" with material \\"of great interest from the standpoint of text as well as musically\\". Biography In 1975 Danny Finney (saxophone, vocals), Paul Watson (trumpet) and Pippin Barnett (drums) formed a jazz improvisation group, Idio Savant. Growing out of a local alternative arts community which centered around the Richmond Artists Workshop, Idio Savant released the avant-garde experimental LP album Shakers in a Tantrum Landscape on Artifacts Records in 1979https://www.discogs.com/Idio-Savant-Shakers-In-A- Tantrum-Landscape/release/1686036, accessed March 24, 2018. Later in 1979, seeking a more accessible sound, the trio added Richmond musicians Rebby Sharp (guitar, vocals) and Phil Trumbo (bass guitar), and the group was reorganized under the name The Ortho-Tones, billed tongue-in-cheek as \\"corrective music\\". The Ortho-tones incorporated a lesser portion of free experimentation within a largely art rock mix. They recorded a 7-inch single, \\"Doo-Doo Cars / Woman Fish\\" which was released in 1981 by Artifacts Records. In 1982 Trumbo (who had designed most of the band's publicity flyers) moved to the West Coast to pursue a successful career as a graphic artist and was replaced by Tom Carson on bass guitar. At the same time, the group's name changed to the Orthotonics. Still drawing on experimental rock, free improvisation and avant-garde jazz, the Orthotonics' music was \\"densely rhythmic [and] beat-intensive\\", a style that attracted the attention of new wave music fans. In 1983 the group released a cassette-only album, Accessible as Gravity which reflected their interest in the Downtown music scene, and in particular English experimental musician and composer Fred Frith, who was active in New York City at the time. Frith liked the Orthotonics, and had regularly spent time with the group. Their first LP record, Wake Up You Must Remember was released in 1984, and was mixed by Frith. After Wake Up You Must Remember the group became inactive, but reformed again in 1986 as a trio of Sharp, Finney and Barnett, and recorded a new album, Luminous Bipeds, which Frith produced. AllMusic called this album their \\"most satisfying recording\\". In 1989 the Orthotonics disbanded. The three members were subsequently active to varying degrees in the long-lasting Richmond world music band The Ululating Mummieshttps://www.discogs.com/Ululating-Mummies-Sacred- Snacks/release/3566632, accessed March 24, 2018. Sharp and Finney later reunited in the alternative rock group, Rattlemouth. Sharp also released a solo album, In One Mouth and Out the Other in 1989, which Frith performed on. Frith's work with the Orthotonics and Sharp led to him using some of Sharp's lyrics on three of his songs on albums by Skeleton Crew and Cosa Brava.

Vegan nutrition refers to the nutritional and human health aspects of vegan diets. A well- planned, balanced vegan diet is suitable to meet all recommendations for nutrients in every stage of human life. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, and phytochemicals; and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long- chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. Preliminary evidence from epidemiological research indicates that a vegan diet may lower the risk of cancer. Background Vegan diets, compared to standard diets, tend to be higher in dietary fibre, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, and iron, and lower in calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, long- chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.Craig, Winston J. \\"Health effects of vegan diets\\", The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 89(5), May 2009, pp. 1627S–1633S (review article). Because plant foods do not provide vitamin B12 (which is produced by microorganisms such as bacteria), researchers agree that those on a vegan diet should eat foods fortified with B12 or take a dietary supplement.Mangels, Reed; Messina, Virginia; and Messina, Mark. \\"Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin),\\" The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets. Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011, pp. 181–192. *Mangels, Reed. \\"Vitamin B12 in the Vegan Diet\\", Vegetarian Resource Group, accessed December 17, 2012: \\"Vitamin B12 is needed for cell division and blood formation. Neither plants nor animals make vitamin B12. Bacteria are responsible for producing vitamin B12. Animals get their vitamin B12 from eating foods contaminated with vitamin B12 and then the animal becomes a source of vitamin B12. Plant foods do not contain vitamin B12 except when they are contaminated by microorganisms or have vitamin B12 added to them. Thus, vegans need to look to fortified foods or supplements to get vitamin B12 in their diet.\\" *\\"Vitamin B12\\", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health, accessed December 17, 2012. *Norris, Jack. \\"Vitamin B12: Are you getting it?\\", Vegan Outreach, July 26, 2006: \\"Contrary to the many rumors, there are no reliable, unfortified plant sources of vitamin B12 ... [There is an] overwhelming consensus in the mainstream nutrition community, as well as among vegan health professionals, that vitamin B12 fortified foods or supplements are necessary for the optimal health of vegans, and even vegetarians in many cases. Luckily, vitamin B12 is made by bacteria such that it does not need to be obtained from animal products.\\" Nutrition The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly known as the American Dietetic Association), Dietitians of Canada and the British Dietetic Association state that well-planned vegan diets can meet all human nutrient requirements and are appropriate for all stages of life, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, while the German Society for Nutrition does not recommend vegan diets for children, adolescents, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics adds that well-planned vegan diets are also appropriate for older adults and athletes, and that vegan diets may reduce the risk of certain health conditions, such as cancer. Special attention may be necessary to ensure that a vegan diet will provide adequate amounts of vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, iodine, iron, and zinc. These nutrients may be available in plant foods, with the exception of vitamin B12, which can be obtained only from B12-fortified vegan foods or supplements. Iodine may also require supplementation, such as using iodized salt.  Nutritional deficiencies  = Vitamin B12 = Vegan food pyramid based on suggestions from the American Dietetic Association Vitamin B12 is not made by plants or animals, but by bacteria that grow in soil, feces, dirty water, the intestines of animals or laboratories, so plant foods are not reliable sources of B12. The UK Vegan Society, the Vegetarian Resource Group, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, among others, recommend that every vegan consume adequate B12 either from fortified foods or by taking a supplement. Vitamin B12 deficiency is potentially extremely serious, leading to megaloblastic anemia, nerve degeneration and irreversible neurological damage. Because B12 is stored in large amounts in the liver, deficiency in adults may begin only years after adoption of a diet lacking B12. For infants and young children who have not built up these stores, onset of B12 deficiency can be faster and supplementation for vegan children is thus crucial. Evidence shows that vegans who are not taking vitamin B12 supplements do not consume sufficient B12 and often have abnormally low blood concentrations of vitamin B12. This is because, unless fortified, plant foods do not contain reliable amounts of active vitamin B12. Vegans are advised to adopt one of the following dietary options: * Consume fortified foods 2-3 times per day to get at least 3 micrograms of vitamin B12, * or take 10 micrograms of B12 as a supplement once per day * or take 2000 micrograms of B12 as a supplement once per week B12 is more efficiently absorbed in small regular doses, which explains why the quantity required rises so quickly as frequency goes down. The US National Institutes of Health recommends B12 intake in a range from 0.4 micrograms a day for infants, to 2.4 micrograms for adults, and up to 2.8 micrograms for nursing mothers. \\"Vitamin B12: Fact Sheet for Consumers\\" National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (retrieved Dec 9, 2016) The European Food Safety Authority set the Adequate Intake at 1.5 micrograms for infants, 4 micrograms for children and adults, and 4.5 and 5 micrograms during pregnancy and nursing.\\"Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for cobalamin (vitamin B12)\\" European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies. EFSA Journal 2015;13(7):4150 [64 pp.]. These amounts can be obtained by eating B12 fortified foods, which include some common breakfast cereals, soy milks, and meat analogues, as well as from common multivitamins such as One-A-Day. Some of the fortified foods require only a single serving to provide the recommended B12 amounts. \\"Don't Vegetarians Have Trouble Getting Enough Vitamin B12?\\" Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (retrieved Dec 9, 2016) Other B12 fortified foods may include some almond milks, coconut milks, other plant milks, nutritional yeast, vegan mayonnaise, tofu, and various types and brands of vegan deli slices, burgers, and other veggie meats. = Protein = Upon digestion, all protein foods supply amino acids. Varied intake of plant foods can meet human health needs for protein and amino acids. Foods high in protein in a vegan diet include legumes (such as beans and lentils), nuts, seeds, and grains (such as oats, wheat, and quinoa). = Omega-3 fatty acids = Flaxseeds are a rich source of ALA, the precursor to DHA and EPA, the omega-3 fatty acids Walnuts are another rich source of ALA, the precursor to DHA and EPA, the omega-3 oils Major vegan sources of the essential omega-3 fatty acid ALA include walnuts, flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, canola (rapeseed) oil, algae oil, hempseeds and hempseed oil, olive oil, and avocado. Diets without seafood are lower in non-essential long-chain omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA. Short-term supplemental ALA has been shown to increase EPA levels, but not DHA levels, suggesting limited conversion of the intermediary EPA to DHA. DHA supplements derived from DHA-rich microalgae are available, and the human body can also convert DHA to EPA. Although omega-3 has previously been thought useful for helping alleviate dementia, , there is no good evidence of effectiveness. While there is little evidence of adverse health or cognitive effects due to DHA deficiency in adult vegetarians or vegans, fetal and breast milk levels remain a concern. EPA and DHA supplementation has been shown to reduce platelet aggregation in vegetarians, but a direct link to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which is already lower for vegetarians, has yet to be determined. = Calcium = It is recommended that vegans eat three servings per day of a high-calcium food, such as fortified plant milks, green leafy vegetables, seeds, tofu, or other calcium-rich foods, and take a calcium supplement as necessary. Many studies have examined possible correlation between veganism, calcium intake, and bone health. The EPIC-Oxford study suggested that vegans who consumed 525 mg or less of calcium per day have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, but that vegans consuming more than 525 mg/day had a risk of fractures similar to other groups. Overall, the entire group of vegans had a higher risk of fractures. A 2009 study of bone density found the bone density of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant. Another study in 2009 by the same researchers examined over 100 vegan post-menopausal women, and found that their diet had no adverse effect on bone mineral density (BMD) and no alteration in body composition. Biochemist T. Colin Campbell suggested in The China Study (2005) that osteoporosis is linked to the consumption of animal protein because, unlike plant protein, animal protein increases the acidity of blood and tissues, which he believed was neutralized by calcium pulled from the bones resulting in hypercalciuria. Campbell wrote that his China-Oxford-Cornell study of nutrition in the 1970s and 1980s found that, in rural China, \\"where the animal to plant ratio [for protein] was about 10 percent, the fracture rate is only one-fifth that of the U.S.\\"Campbell, T. Colin. The China Study. Benbella Books, 2006, pp. 205–208. Calcium is one component of the most common type of human kidney stones, calcium oxalate. Some studies suggest that people who take supplemental calcium have a higher risk of developing kidney stones, and these findings have been used as the basis for setting the recommended daily intake (RDI) for calcium in adults. Calcium intake through food sources is preferred over supplementation given inconclusive but growing evidence to suggest that supplementation carries no health benefit or might be harmful. = Iodine = One study reported a \\"potential danger of iodine deficiency disorders due to strict forms of vegetarian nutrition, especially when fruits and vegetables grown in soils with low [iodine] levels are ingested.\\" Vegan diets typically require special attention for iodine, for which the only substantial and reliable vegan sources are sea vegetables, iodized salt and supplements. The iodine content of sea vegetables varies widely and may provide more than the recommended upper limit of iodine intake. = Iron = It is recommended for vegans to eat iron-rich foods and vitamin C daily. In several studies, vegans were not found to suffer from iron-deficiency any more than non-vegans. However, due to the low absorption rate on non-heme iron it is recommended to eat dark leafy greens (and other sources of iron) together with sources of Vitamin C. Iron supplementation should be taken at different times to other supplements with a 2+ valence (chemistry) such as calcium or magnesium, as they inhibit the absorption of iron. = Choline = Due to lack of evidence, no country has published a recommended daily intake for choline, which is a vitamin-like essential nutrient. The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union national nutrition bodies note there have been no reports of choline deficiency in the general population. There are, however, Adequate Intakes such as the European Union's number of 400 mg/day for adults, and the US's number of 425 mg/day for adult non-pregnant women and 550 mg/day for adult men. Choline deficiency, as created in lab conditions, can lead to health problems such as liver damage, a result of liver cells initiating programmed cell death (apoptosis), as well as an increase in neural tube defects in pregnant women. In a study, 77% of men, 44% of premenopausal women, and 80% of postmenopausal women developed fatty liver or muscle damage due to choline deficiency, showing that subject characteristics regulate the dietary requirement. There is also some evidence that choline is an anti-inflammatory as well, but further studies are needed to confirm/refute findings. It is worth noting that many multivitamins do not contain the Adequate Intake of choline. Although many animal products, like liver and egg, contain high amounts of choline (355 mg/3 oz and 126 mg/large egg, respectively), wheat germ (172 mg/cup), brussel sprouts (63 mg/cup), and broccoli (62 mg/cup) are also good sources of choline. Other sources include soy lecithin, cauliflower, spinach, firm tofu, kidney beans, quinoa and amaranth. = Vitamin D = The main function of vitamin D in the body is increased absorption of calcium, therefore it is good for the bones. It also connects with receptors in the prostate, the heart, blood vessels, muscles, endocrine glands and others. Sunlight, fortified foods, and supplements, are the main sources of vitamin D for vegans. Humans produce vitamin D naturally in response to ultraviolet light (UV). Complete cloud cover reduces UV penetration by up to 50%, and outdoor shade reduces UV penetration by 60%. UV light penetrates the skin at wavelengths between 290 and 320 nanometers, where it is then converted into vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 can be obtained from fungi, such as mushrooms exposed to sun or industrial ultraviolet light, offering a vegan choice for dietary or supplemental vitamin D. Although vitamin D3 is produced in small amounts by lichens or algae exposed to sunlight, industrial production in commercial quantities is limited, and there are few supplement products as of 2019. The recommended daily allowance in vitamin D for adults under the age of 70 years old is between 600 and 4,000 IU, and for adults over 70 years old, 800 to 4,000 IU. Reports on exactly how much vitamin D is produced by exposure to sunlight are wild and varied, across the board.

This genus occurs almost worldwide and contains about 180 species ; new species are still being described and discovered regularly. Formerly, many similar moths of superfamilies Alucitoidea, Copromorphoidea and Pterophoroidea were also placed in Alucita. The genus Alucita was established by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as a subgenus of Phalaena, . Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775 seems to have been the first author to consider Alucita a genus in its own right, and it remains so until today. However, some subsequent authors believed Linnaeus' name to be invalid, and established alternative names for this genus, but, while the oldest of these, Pierre André Latreille's Orneodes, was used instead of Alucita for a long time, all these subsequent names are today recognized as junior synonyms.

Registered Charity (1175160) and Company Limited by Guarantee (10722435) in England and Wales. It aims to increase the happiness in the world by bringing together like-minded people from all walks of life and supporting them to take practical action to build a happier and more caring society, drawing on the latest scientific research. The patron of Action for Happiness is the Dalai Lama. The movement has over 190,000 members in 180 countries and over 1,000,000 subscribers on facebook. Formation AfH was co-founded in 2010 by Richard Layard (Director of the Wellbeing Programme at the Centre for Economic Performance and Emeritus Professor of Economics at LSE), Sir Anthony Seldon (Historian and Vice- Chancellor of the University of Buckingham), Geoff Mulgan (CEO of Nesta and former CEO of the Young Foundation) and Dr Mark Williamson (who has been its Director since the start). AfH was originally created and incubated within The Young Foundation, before becoming an independent registered charity in January 2018. Definition of Happiness Poster from Action for Happiness on \\"Ten keys to happier living\\" AfH states that \\"Happiness means feeling good about our lives and wanting to go on feeling that way. Unhappiness means feeling bad and wanting things to change.\\"http://www.actionforhappiness.org/about- us/answers-to-the-sceptics Thus AfH tends towards a subjective well-being definition of happiness. Approach to increasing happiness AfH adopts positive and direct action-oriented methods to increase happiness. AfH supports people to understand that everybody has an inner world and mental health, and that everybody can choose to take action to look after their mental health, in good times as well as bad times. Just like choosing to look after our physical health by exercising and eating good food, you can look after your mind by developing skills to be happy. AfH does not advocate a positivity only approach, instead it promotes emotional intelligence, being able to recognise, express and manage all feelings and emotions, be they pleasant and joyful or difficult and uncomfortable. AfH encourages people to see life as it is and to focus on fostering positive emotions. =10 Keys to Happier Living= AfH promotes 10 Keys to Happier Living which were created by Action for Happiness, led by Vanessa King, and are based on the latest research in positive psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics and biology. Their research evidence suggests these Ten Keys are areas which are in the influence of the individual and consistently tend to have a positive impact on people's happiness and well-being. They keys spell out GREAT DREAM. The first five keys Giving Relating Exercising Awareness and Trying Out (GREAT) are about a person's interaction with the outside world. They are based on the Five Ways to Wellbeing developed by the New Economics Foundation on behalf of the Foresight Project on Mental Capital and Wellbeing The second five keys Direction Resilience Emotions Acceptance Meaning (DREAM) relate to the inner world and the person's attitude to life. Activities and Products =Exploring What Matters Course= AfH activities include running 8-week \\"Exploring What Matters\\" courses, which have been organized by volunteers at over 250 places around the world and have been \\"wholeheartedly supported\\" by the Dalai Lama. The course brings like-minded people together to learn how to increase their own happiness and the happiness of people around them. Participants learn from experts through videos, exercises and a course handbook. They also join in group discussions and are given actions they can take to increase happiness. In 2020 the Exploring What Matters Course was evaluated by a full Randomised Control Trial (RCT) carried out by academic experts from the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford and University College London as part of the evidence programme of the What Works Centre for Wellbeing. The RCT course evaluation found that, relative to a control group, the course provides large and statistically significant benefits in three areas: personal wellbeing, mental health and pro-sociality. Participants in the course showed improvements in subjective wellbeing, reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety and enhanced levels of compassion and social trust. In terms of personal wellbeing, Life Satisfaction increases by around one whole point on the 0-10 scale, from an average of 6.4 out of 10 before the course to 7.4 after the course. This increase (+1.0) is greater than those from other major life events such as being partnered as opposed to single (+0.59) or being employed as opposed to unemployed (+0.7), when compared with findings from other cross-sectional studies of wellbeing in the UK. In terms of mental health, the trial found the course significantly decreased depression by about 50% of a standard deviation, and decreased anxiety by 42%. Prior to the course, participants reported average scores corresponding to a clinical symptomatology of mild depression and anxiety. After the course, these scores reduced to a symptomatology of minimal depression and anxiety, the lowest category for both measures. In terms of pro-sociality, the trial found that participating in the course can make participants more likely to act in ways which help others, with large and statistically significant increases in levels of compassion and social trust. The course evaluation was covered by The Guardian newspaper and featured on the BBC News at Ten. =Monthly Action Calendars= AfH produces monthly calendars with one suggested action that people can take each day to improve their happiness. These daily actions are based on the Ten Keys to Happier Living and distill peer reviewed evidence on what makes people happy into simple actions anyone can take. Each month the calendars are translated into 25 languages and shared around the world on social media. The calendars can be printed out and are used to boost wellbeing at home, work, schools, universities, hospitals and doctor's surgeries. The calendars were downloaded by 2.5 million people in 2018. =Action for Happiness App= In 2019 AfH released The Action for Happiness app for iOS and Android. The app is based on the themes and daily actions from the monthly calendars. The app sends a daily action each morning and an inspiring message towards the end of the day. =Happy Cafes= AfH coordinates a network of \\"Happy Cafes\\" across the UK and around the world. Happy Cafes are \\"a friendly and welcoming place to meet other people with a shared interest in promoting happiness and wellbeing.\\". Happy Cafés have a range of literature, posters, pamphlets and postcards relating to happiness on display - and Action for Happiness supporters can identify themselves to each other by wearing a lapel badge available at the Café. =Public Events with Expert Speakers= AfH runs monthly events in London with expert speakers from around the world presenting on themes related to happiness. An archive of the public talks including sessions with Thupten Jinpa, Dr Kristen Neff, Dr Ranjan Chattergee, Andy Puddicombe, Jeff Sachs, Dr Maria Sidios, Martin Seligman, Matthieu Ricard, Claudia Hammond, Mo Gawdat and Jon Kabat-Zinn are available on the charity's YouTube channel. Board and expert advisors The AfH board includes Prof Richard Layard, Sir Anthony Seldon, Geoff Mulgan, Vanessa King and Dr Mark Williamson. The AfH expert advisory group includes Daniel Kahneman and Martin Seligman. Local and national groups There are local groups and hubs in many countries. In Australia, Italy and Germany, there are national groups that are legal entities in their countries. Linkage with prevention of mental illness Richard Layard's 2011 book \\"Happiness: Lessons from a New Science\\" included research showing that mental illness is the main cause of unhappiness.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Happiness-Lessons-New-Science-Second- ebook/dp/B004TRQAS6/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1521575888&sr;=1-3&keywords;=richard+layard In 2016 Mark Williamson said, regarding the increasing number of people being in treatment with mental illnesses, \\"What we believe is that you can help people develop better habits before that happens. We’ve got the beginnings now of a culture in preventative approaches to physical health problems, with anti-smoking and obesity drives. I think the next 20 years is going to be about massively proactive ways to look after your mental health and your social and emotional well-being, and to really think about what happiness means and how it can be achieved.\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/good- news/2016/06/11/can-you-teach-yourself-to-be-happy/ Reaction and criticism AfH has been praised as reclaiming happiness from capitalism by helping people to seize the means of the production of wellbeing arguing for \\"a new science of happiness that focuses on social behaviour and personal relationships, rather than material possessions and outward appearance.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/12/happiness- capitalism AfH has also been criticised for pursuing an individual approach to happiness, rather than focusing on societal negative issues such as inequality. Journalist Janet Street-Porter attended the AfH 8 week Exploring What Matters course in 2015, she said \\"I've really enjoyed the company of these strangers—which is a first. I heartily recommend the course if you're feeling lonely or miserable.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-nvTbSvbo References External links * Official site * Action for Happiness Australia * Action for Happiness Italy * Action for Happiness Germany Mental health organisations in the United Kingdom Health charities in the United Kingdom Charities based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Action for Happiness"},{"id":"31485791","text":"Hebdomactis is a genus of moths in the family Alucitidae.

Christopher Hyndman, playing for England under-21s and Northampton Saints with Craig Willis and Adam Radwan playing for Newcastle Falcons. History Billingham Rugby Club was formed in 1924http://www.billinghamrugby.co.uk as the rugby section of the Synthonia Sports Club at Synthetic Ammonia and Nitrates Company, which later became Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). Once established, the club became a force in Durham County Rugby Union, especially after the Second World War and the first team was very strong during the 1950s and early 1960s. The early 1970s saw a downturn in the chemical industry and with the decline of ICI, the rugby club suffered. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s the club became somewhat nomadic in its socialising, although still playing on Central Avenue. 1989 was an important year in the life of the club. The youth section was founded and boys and girls from the age of eight upwards playing mini-rugby. Since then, this section of the club has gone from strength to strength and has provided several current members of the first XV squad. The 1990s saw an upturn in the club's fortunes and three teams were regularly playing each week with socialising based at the Synthonia Cricket Club. The club moved to play on Greenwood Road in 1996 although until late 2000 there were no facilities whatsoever, just three pitches. For these years we had a three-site existence, changing, playing and socialising in different locations. However, December 2000 and a £750,000 lottery grant brought the opening of the new clubhouse giving the club a solid base and identity and we hope that it will serve as a stepping-stone to future success.

The monasteries played an important role in the recruitment conducted by Christian aristocracy during and after the progress of the Reconquista, with the consequent decline in the Muslim south of the peninsula. Their presence in the peninsula dates from the early centuries of Christianity, when the original hermit life gave rise to the formation of religious communities and the construction of small monasteries by Hispanics in the sixth and seventh centuries. Many of these buildings reflect the traditional style of Mozarabic. The second phase was developed with the arrival of the Benedictines of Cluny, during the Reconquista and several new orders developed at this time: Cistercian, military orders, Premonstratensian, Carthusians, Jeromes, Augustinians, Camaldolese and beggars. Monastic communities of various sizes sprang up from Catalonia to Galicia; some of these structures remain while others were abandoned or destroyed. Most of the monasteries in Spain are distributed in the northern half in line with the historical discourse of the zone in the Middle Ages. Monasteries are much less numerous in the south, Andalusia and the Canary Islands. The establishment of monasteries during the Middle Ages was paramount from a social and cultural standpoint, benefiting the arts and agriculture. The Camino de Santiago proved an important factor in locations of these monastic orders, as often an important objective was to support the pilgrims traveling along this route. Characteristics and evolution of the monastery in Spain The first reference to a monastery in Spain was in a letter from St. Augustine to the abbot of the Monastery of Cabrera, written in 398. In 410, the monk Baquiario first used the term monastery in a text written in Hispania. He, as a monk, and Egeria, and the nun Etheria, perhaps more properly a consecrated virgin, were the first such members of religious houses whose names are known. The first monasteries arose in the fourth century and were humble buildings erected in the shadow of shrines dedicated to or graves of beloved local martyrs. Many of these monastic people were troglodytes, or cave dwellers, as hermits or recluses who served as models for later monastic culture preferred to live in caves equipped to be shelters or shrines. Such is the origin of the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla, which preserves as a shrine the cave where Aemilianus, also known as Millán, lived. The caves served as dwellings for disciples of this saint. The practice of living apart from the world was transformed by monks belonging to monasteries; although they lived in communities, the individuals within the community maintained their ascetic practice, living in a remote location, often in the desert. The quantitative success of monasticism in the Visigothic period led to clashes with the secular clergy, and they brought this dispute to the Councils of Toledo. Much of this conflict derived from the social and economic benefits that were accorded as privileges of the monastic life. In some cases, as in the area of El Bierzo, monasteries, such as Compludo and Ruphianensi Monasterium, accepted whole families. Others which served as foundations of Fructuosus of Braga had the appearance of real villages. In other areas, such as Andalusia, monasteries were segregated by gender. Some sources also attributed more extreme features of the hermit movement, such as social protest, to the more extreme features of the hermit movement, especially in areas such as Burgos, Álava and Logroño. This is in parallel with other religious movements as heresy Priscillianist, which survived in Galicia and other areas into the sixth century. In the following centuries, Hispanic monasteries emerged and expanded, developing their own set of similar characteristics, with a purely Hispanic artistic style. With the arrival of the monks of Cluny in the eleventh century, and the order of St. Benedict and observers of their rule, the Spanish monastery complex took on new importance and influence. This is the era of quintessential monastic life and notable edifices. Many of these clusters of buildings have survived to the modern era in various states of repair, although many are now used for purposes unrelated to monasticism. The political role of Cluny and its link with the monarchy and noble houses was decisive in the Europeanization of the Christian kingdoms of the mainland and the formation of feudal society in Spain. With regard to the social and economic role of the Benedictine monasteries, the classic materialistic interpretations—that of a feudal lord overseeing and creating the monastery—are tempered by recent historiography. This study includes other aspects of the communities, such as inclusion in legal and sociological networks, using the methodology of cultural anthropology and microhistory. Following the momentum of Cluny, Cistercians arrived with new works and reforms, followed by the Carthusians. In the thirteenth century the Franciscans and Dominicans, Premonstratensian and Jesuits, arrived. Some of these groups have remained quite monastic. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, numerous monasteries and convents arose, such as the Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen. Recent monasteries founded and built in Spain were: *Monasterio de Santa María de Viaceli (Cóbreces, Cantabria), promoted and sponsored by the brothers Manuel and Antonio Bernaldo de Quirós and Pomar and Cistercian foundation in 1909 *Convent of San Lorenzo in Oñati, Guipuzcoa, in 1928 *Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen (Abbey of the Holy Cross in the Valley of the Fallen), 1940–1958, under draft Pedro Muguruza and Diego Mendez. *House of Spirituality of the Dominican Fathers (Caleruega, Burgos), 1952 . *Roll Monastery (or Monastery of the Immaculate Conception ) in Salamanca 1961, created by the architect Antonio Fernández Alba . *Monasterio de Santa Maria de las Shallots (Hornachuelos, Córdoba), 1986 =Foundations= Monasteries in this area were historically founded mainly by kings, bishops and nobles. There were a number of reasons individuals might found a monastery, largely self-serving ones: to reserve a burial there, which came with perpetual prayers by the monks on behalf of the founder's soul, sheltering a princess, widow, unmarried or bastard, in the case of kings. Sometimes there were political reasons for founding or protection of a particular monastery; many of the religious houses who protected were located in border areas where battles often raged, such as Castile and León or Navarre, as was the case Matallana monastery (in the Valladolid), or Bujedo- Navarre. Bishops had an interest in building a monastery on which to exercise their authority, especially in the feudal period, as this guaranteed an income. The nobility desired salvation for themselves and his family, plus a demonstration of political influence through sponsoring one of these great works. The monastic vows (poverty, chastity and obedience) were considered an appropriate vocation for younger sons, regardless of the sincerity or otherwise of his vocation, in order to reduce the likelihood of disputes over the inheritance of the firstborn, who would then hold undivided estates according to the institution of primogeniture. This close identification between the clergy and nobility, both privileged classes, survived as an enduring connection during the Middle Ages and the Modern Age to the end of the ancien regime. Other monasteries arose without intervention from the above-mentioned members of society, when a community formed around a shrine. This is the case of the monastery of San Juan de Ortega which originally was a humble chapel founded by the saint to preserve relics of St. Nicholas of Bari Over time, sufficient people arrived to care for the shrine to require the formation of an official community. Or from hermits, in some cases doubling, that were left to be guided by any rule, as the Royal Monastery of Santa María de Vallbona (Vallbona de les Monges), the monastery of Santo Domingo de Ocaña (Toledo) of the sixteenth century has the distinction of being founded by a neighbor who wanted to be close to the preachers. There are recent foundations, of the twentieth century, whose intent is very clear from the outset, as is the spiritual community of the Dominican Fathers of Caleruega (Burgos), in 1952, destined for the convent-school-house of spirituality. The Monastery of Our Lady of the Angels of Palma de Mallorca, in 1914, can be included as a religious house of education, as it was conceived as a major seminary, Novitiate House, Ecumenical Centre College and routinely providing Evangelical Protestants Lutheran Germans. =The first Hispanic monasteries= During the sixth and seventh centuries, the Hispanic Visigoth cultures are evidenced in a wealth of monastic communities in which ancient tradition still flourished and where the monks themselves supported monastic rule by living it. Many monasteries arose in this period. Some sources consider the Monastery of St. Victorian of Asan (in Sobrarbe, Huesca province) as the first monastery founded in Spain, but more likely, given the existence of references to previous monasteries, the first initiative for foundation of churches sprang from the Visigoth king Gesalec in 506. Other possible inspirations are attributed to Swabians in the northwest, with the activity of San Martín de Dumio, from Pannonia. Other founding saints such as San Donato, came from Africa Játiva. San Fructuoso de Braga founded the monastery of Compludo in the early seventh century and twenty other foundations from Galicia to Andalusia. During the same century, San Leandro and his brother St. Isidore composed their own monastic rules. Morphologically, Hispanic monasteries are clearly distinguished by two concepts: *Enclosing the community, which is known by the name of claustra *Cloistered units, called domus. The cloister was an enclosure that isolated and protected the monastery and its residents, which is very important to the religious life being cultivated. In one chapter, the San Isidoro rule states: \\"The mill of the monastery on its premises only have one door and one wicket to leave the garden.\\" It was later advised that the city remain separate from the cloister, and respect that separation. This suggests the building of an enclosure or wall surrounding the buildings and gardens of the monastery. This first is called monastic enclosure or cloister. The second concept is referred to the domus, i.e. the group of houses which constitute the monastery. Documents refer to two different places within the monasteries: domus domorum, or ultimate home, which refers to the church building, and maior domus, which is the served as bedrooms and community activities. According to the surviving descriptions and annotations, the maior domus should be a dependency of high architectural quality and large size, standing next to the church, at the height of the atrium. In the domus as a whole, there were several required dwellings such as the cilla, nursing, the punishment cell, the novitiate, the gatekeeper's shelter. What would be called a chapter house centuries later among the Benedictines was referred to at this time as a conference room in these early Hispanic monasteries. Many documents mention this space and its utility but historians are not certain where it was located. It is known that minor issues monks gathered in the choir. Documentation of these early Hispanic monasteries is abundant and descriptive. However, only a few of the cloisters have been preserved; the rest of the sites are lost and archaeological evidence is inconclusive. =Repopulation of the monasteries= Many monasteries arose in the tenth century on land reclaimed in hitherto barren areas, no man's land, or abandoned places in the basin of the Duero and Bierzo in León. The monasteries might construct new buildings or small churches, or restore those crumbling and neglected earlier that new monks transformed and supplemented with monastic dependencies. In many cases, these areas were found to be inhabited by small groups, pastoralists, and farmers attached to their land. The monks who created this kind of monastery came from both the South (especially Cordoba, at a time of persecution of Christians in that city) and the North, bringing with them the influence of their region of origin, but without forgetting the traditional Spanish-Gothic forms. The architectural heritage survived almost two centuries despite the abandonment will be restored by these people repopulating. The lands of the Duero valley will witness the revival of architecture over the neo-visigothic 10th and 11th centuries, while the first Romanesque building started in Catalan lands in the year 1000. This is demonstrated in small churches, the only remains of the monasteries of that period that have survived until today (2008). Many of these religious buildings took advantage of those surviving from the Visigothic period and mosques, especially in Aragon first and, later, Andalusia. Building components and ornaments Buildings of this age have much in common, so some generalizations can be made about elements of construction and ornamentation. Primary materials are rubble, stone and wood. Walls are constructed of either masonry or courses of stone blocks. The latter is typical of places with nearby quarries, as slate is often used where it is common. When the building is of masonry, lintels, corners and windows will be reinforced with stone blocks. Vaults, roofs, arches and columns often presented a problem. The builders' ideal was to construct ceilings in stone barrel vault, but this was not always possible, whether because of the high cost of the labor or other technical difficulties. Very few edifices managed to use barrel vaults throughout the building; stone vaulting was often used only in the apses and wooden framing was used in the rest of the building. Smaller churches tried vaulting, but were forced to economize with poor materials, such as tufa stone, brick and masonry. The horseshoe arch design of the vaults is in the tradition of Asturian architecture with some influence from Visigothic art, and in some cases following influence of the Mozarabic Cordoba. The influence of Cordoba art on these buildings is manifested in the ribbed vaults. Santiago de Peñalba is an example of Mozarabic alfiz arches. The arch is a common architectural design, though the Moorish horseshoe arch differs from the Spaniard in that it cannot be close to 2/3 of the ratio Sometimes the same building may include both styles, as in San Miguel de Escalada. The columns utilize techniques used in other buildings and styles, usually Romans. Its discovery by the builders, ownership and carry is a fact and the usual great convenience. Sometimes come from places far from their final destination. Many of the capitals are also reused, those developed specifically for the building following a Corinthian tradition of drawing the characteristic necking stranded (such as wreathed Asturias). Ornamental architecture did not reach a great development. Eaves were decorated, and the openings of the windows filled with beautiful stone lattices. Many times the doors and windows were framed with alfiz. But there are very many entries as a decoration paramental, they are of all kinds; funeral, consecration, foundation, etc. Are written in good handwriting and on the basis of good material, usually marble. Painting Painting was the final step in construction of a church; the building was not considered finished until the walls were painted inside and out. Only a few traces of paint have been preserved over the centuries since, not only is paint the least resistant decorative element over time but also nineteenth century restorations removed or covered up these murals. If the exterior was plastered, the plastering was often scraped off to reveal the underlying material. This trend continued throughout the twentieth century and continues into the twenty-first century. Buildings were often painted with a specific tone and the details on arches, moldings, capitals, imposts and other architectural components would have been picked out in a different color. It is known that the Church of Santiago de Peñalba had a red painted base, 73 cm in height, both outside and inside. Geographical locations of churches of the repopulation *Monasterio de San Miguel de Escalada, in the province of León, which was founded by the abbot who arrived from Cordoba, existed at the time of Alfonso III. It was an ancient temple dedicated to San Miguel. The monastery was consecrated in 913 by Bishop Gennadius of Astorga. *Monasterio de San Cebrián de Mazote in Valladolid, a town in of Mazote San Cebrián, founded during the reign of Ordoño II by monks who came from Cordoba. *Monasterio de San Román de Hornija. It is known from documents, Chindasvinto died in 653 and was buried in a monastery that existed here. In the twelfth century it was a priory of the monastery of San Pedro de Montes in the region of Bierzo, León. =Cluny in Spain= The church of Santa Maria de Piasca (Cantabria) is one of the most important priories in the service of the Cluniac monastic order of Sahagún. In Catalonia, the abbot Oliba had strong ties with the Abbey of Cluny, but it was strictly a spiritual relationship, and had no legal connotations. Via this abbot, King Sancho III of Navarre established relations with the abbot St. Odilon de Cluny, which resulted in a Cluniac abbot being put in charge of the monastery of San Juan de la Peña. As a result of this action the Cluniac influence spread through monasteries that were in the domains of Sancho III. The spiritual relationship with the Abbey of Cluny continued with the descendants of Sancho III until the reign of King Alfonso VI with whom the relationship moved from being a purely spiritual sympathy to one which has economic ties and political and religious influences. The monastery of Sahagún in León was a central one, as it was the biggest propagator of the Cluniac observance. Alfonso VI became the center of Cluny and became its protector. It was called \\"The Spanish Cluny\\", the abbey being more powerful in the kingdoms of León and Castile, which had nearly 100 monasteries. Alfonso was owner of the land ranging from the Cantabrian Sea to the River Duero. Sahagun was a central influence in Spain of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. =The Cistercians in Spain= The Moreruela monastery (Zamora) was the first Cistercian enclave on the Iberian Peninsula; it was founded in 1133 in the reign of Alfonso VII, followed by the Fitero in 1140, Santa María de Sobrado, 1142, (in Sobrado dos Monxes, La Coruña) and the monastery of Poblet (1150) in Catalonia, sponsored by Count Ramón Berenguer IV of Barcelona. Moruela was part of the great Cistercian group of abbeys consisting of Clairvaux (in the valley of Absinthe, France), the Great Forest (in Languedoc), Fontfreda (near Narbonne) and Poblet. The first cloister for women was that of Santa Maria de la Caridad in Tulebras (Navarra). From this monastery, nuns departed to found the communities of Perales (Palencia), of Gradefes, Cañas (La Rioja), Trasobares in Zaragoza, Vallbona, Lleida and Las Huelgas in Burgos. Cistercian monasteries, both female and male, spread throughout the peninsula. =Monasteries of the mendicant orders= The mendicant orders (also called preachers) emerged in the early thirteenth century, with the Dominicans and Franciscans. They emerged as a spiritual response, necessary in a time when monastic orders had relaxed the norms and behavior. These mendicant orders proposed a novel mode of action based on direct action toward the faithful and the organizational system that was based on division by provinces. The convents and monasteries of these monks were always very close to or within cities. They were also placed alongside roads, especially in the Camino de Santiago, in order to provide care and support to travelers. The complex of buildings used for the mendicant groups is in keeping with the usual monastic style, but differences arise according to the needs and the work of these monks. Many of the foundation buildings were donations of houses more or less adapted to life in community. The churches were built specifically for the monastic community, or in some cases expanding some existing chapel or shrine), with its own characteristics. The building's acoustics were a primary criterion in construction, as the sermons and talks with the faithful were common practice. Churches were divided into two parts, one for those attending mass and another for the monks' enclosures. These churches did not continue a distinct style but adapted to the current fashion and geographical needs. Another feature was the small number of chapels in the wings, in contrast to the Cistercian churches. This is because the rules do not oblige each monk to say daily Mass, quite the contrary. Francis of Assisi said in the General Chapter \\"In places where the monks dwell be held one Mass a day [...] but if somewhere has many priests, with a love of charity is happy listening to the mass of the other.\\" Construction materials are typically poor, with a few severe facade sculptures, a polygonal apse with large window openings. The monasteries adapted and assimilated local building traditions to the community's needs, so churches vary depending on geographic location. In Spain there were two models: buildings with a Latin cross and buildings with a single nave with chapels between buttresses. In Navarre there was a proliferation of mendicant convents during the reign of Champagne, especially with Theobald II was defined as chief patron and protector. In Castilla y León were many convents but most which have survived to the twenty-first century are badly deteriorated. =Paired Monasteries= Paired monasteries were those made jointly by male and female communities, within the High Middle Ages achieved considerable importance. These monasteries had their origin in the monasteries turned into family homes where whole families decided to benefit from religious rules and form a monastic community whose members spent the rest of their days without leaving the house. It was a kind of exalted fashion and later came to commit errors and excesses such that they were reprimanded by the religious leaders. There was a text, Regula Communis, written for these monasteries. This rule made clear the changes in architectural design made necessary by this combining of communities: all spaces should be double so that the female community was separated from the male; they might share only the chapter, but must sit apart. As for the bedrooms, not only ordered that they were separated but well away from each other. In time, these monasteries came to be officially removed, but still, in the twelfth century, a group of thirty-one nuns nicknamed tuquinegras lived with a large number of monks, men who were supposed to protect and who were known by the name of milites. No buildings have been preserved from these monastic communities other than the churches. =Monasteries of military orders= The Military Orders built their own monasteries which served also as a fortress of defense, though otherwise the houses followed the monastic premise as other monasteries did. A typical example of this type of monastery is the Calatrava la Nueva, headquarters of the Order of Calatrava founded by the Abbot of Fitero, Raymond, at the behest of King Sancho III of Castile, to protect the area restored to the Muslims. Other orders as Order of Santiago, Knights Templar and Canons of the Holy Sepulchre devoted much of their efforts to protect and care for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago. *Monasterio de Uclés (in the current province of Cuenca) was the headquarters of the Order of Santiago since 1174. *Montesa Castle (now the province of Valencia) came from the Aragonese Order of Montesa. *The Conventual de San Benito de Alcántara was of the Order of Alcántara. *Ponferrada Castle of the Knights Templar. =The monasteries on the Camino de Santiago= Although many monasteries emerged along the Camino de Santiago, some have disappeared altogether. Typical of the monasteries' aid to travelers are the thirty-two hospitals or hospices governed by a small community of monks belonging to different orders, but many of the monasteries of this route have also attached their own hospitals. Here is a list of the most important monasteries of this route: Huesca *San Juan de la Peña. Affiliated with the Aragonese monarchs and Navarre. Navarra *Leyre Monastery, Benedictine, the focus of the Reconquista and refuge of kings and bishops of Navarre. It has an attached guesthouse for pilgrims. *Convento de Santo Domingo (Estella), foundation of Theobald II of Navarre in 1259. *Monastery of Our Lady the Royal Irache, which is not along the road's route but in a detour from Ayegui. It is one of the oldest Benedictine monasteries in Navarre; it is possibly of Visigoth design. The hospital was founded by García Sánchez III of Navarre in 1051. La Rioja *Convent of San Anton in Navarrete, of which only ruins remain. *Monastery of Santa María la Real de Nájera, founded by García I of León along with a hospital for pilgrims. Alfonso VI joined the monastery at Cluny in 1079, to promote the pilgrimage, in opposition to the bishop of Nájera who moved to Calahorra in protest. This monastery is the tomb of the kings of Navarre. It has been run by Franciscan friars since 1895. *Cañas Monastery (home of Santo Domingo de Silos). Female Cistercian abbey founded in 1170. Burgos *Monastery of San Félix de Oca on the hill of San Felices which dates from the ninth century. In 1049, it was annexed to San Millán de la Cogolla. According to tradition, Diego Porcelos, the founder of the city of Burgos, is buried here. The apse is the only remaining structure from this monastic community. *Monastery of San Juan de Ortega. San Juan de Ortega founded this place to resemble a pilgrims' hospital rather than a monastery. In 1170, Alfonso VIII relinquished the hospital to the jurisdiction of Burgos, and in 1432 the Church of Burgos took over the Order of St. Jerome. *Monastery of San Juan Evangelista, outside of Burgos, a former hospital complex that Alfonso VI began in 1091 under the protection of the Benedictine Abbey of Chaise-Dieu in the Haute-Loire, with San Lesmes as prior. Only the chapter house and cloister remain of the monastery, while only the facade remains of the church convent. *Monastery of las Huelgas, which ran the King's Hospital, founded by Alfonso VI on behalf of the pilgrims. *The Benedictine monastery of Rocamador was dependent on donations and privileges granted by Alfonso XI of Castile. It was founded to assist pilgrims with a difficult passage between Hornillos del Camino to Castrojeriz. *Convent of San Antón de Castrojeriz. This convent was founded by Alfonso VII of León and Castile in 1146 for the Order of St. Anthony, of French origin. The monastery had been reduced to ruins in the fourteenth century with the exception of a Gothic arch to the left of the great portal, under which the road passed. *The Cistercian monastery of Castrojeriz emerged in conjunction with the Pilgrims' Hospital founded by Count Nuño Pérez de Lara and his wife Teresa. It was near the Fitero Bridge (Pons Fiteria) the river Pisuerga. Palencia *The Benedictine monastery, founded by the lady Mayor in 1035 in the town of Frómista, of which remains only the church of San Martín, a good example of the Romanesque architecture of the twelfth century. *Monastery of Santa Clara (Carrión de los Condes), founded in the thirteenth century. *Former Abbey of Santa Maria de Benevívere, twelfth century. Only ruins remain. *Monastery of San Zoilo, on the Carrión river near Carrión de los Condes, a great center of refuge for pilgrims; the tombs of the Infantes of Carrión are located here. *Monastery of Santa María de las Tiendas, also founded in the eleventh century, belonging to the order of Santiago, near Tiendas. Only vestiges of the monastery remain, which the present farmhouse incorporates. Leon *Monastery of San Benito el Real de Sahagun, whose Cluniac monks arrived in 1080. This was the main abbey on the peninsula, which expanded to 60 beds for pilgrims in their own hospital. *Monastery of San Agustin in Mansilla de las Mulas, disappeared, leaving only the Arco de San Agustín near Pilgrim Street. Lugo *Samos Monastery, Benedictine, with a shelter for pilgrims of high rank. The masses were housed in separate houses of the abbey. *Monastery of la Magdalena, in Sarria, founded by two Italian priests of the Order of St. Augustine. As of 2007, this monastery is in charge of priests belonging to the Orden de la Merced, and as is traditional, welcome pilgrims. Their adjunct hospital had a reputation for caring for pilgrims. *Monastery of Santa María de Loio, in the small village of Loio Lugo. The hermit dwelling was restored by a monk named Limerick. It was the birthplace of the Knights of Santiago to 1170. Almost no traces of its original location remain. *Monastery of Villar de Donas, past a place called Ligondé, it is necessary to deviate from the road to get here. It was originally a small convent for members of the Arias family of Monterroso and in 1184 belonged to the Order of Santiago. In 2007, only the church, which houses paintings from the fourteenth century, remains standing. La Coruña *Monastery of San Martín Pinario in Santiago de Compostela, former Benedictine monastery, now a major seminary. *Caaveiro Monastery, in the Fragas do Eume. *Monastery of Sancti Spiritus (Melide) at the front entrance to the Melide Hospital. All that remains is the Romanesque church of Santa Maria, which dates from the eighth century, and is the current parish. *Augustinian Convent (Arzúa) with its own hospital in the town of Arzúa; all that remains is church of the Magdalene and part of the fabric of the hospital. =Palaces in monasteries= The royal palace in this institution is one of the characteristics of the Spanish monastery. Occasionally, already constructed buildings were willingly converted into a palace. Such is the case of Tordesillas, Miraflores and Paular. In other instances, the monastery offered a residence to the king or the nobility when they traveled for matters relating to their own Reconquista or to follow the travels of the courts of Castile and Aragon. In some monasteries the palatial residence required building a new building inside the compound, as in the monasteries of Poblet, Carracedo and Yuste. The monastery of El Escorial was conceived from the beginning with a specific architecture and set of structures to house the monks and the king and his court. =Monasteries as palaces= Many Spanish monasteries were built from scratch in order to house the tombs of royal families or members of the nobility. To this end, the patrons made large donations of land, money and men. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it was considered of vital importance that the monks keep in their prayers the memory of the dead buried near them in churches, cloisters, or cemeteries, and not only consider this important for the salvation of souls but as a perpetual reminder to future generations how important those buried were. Among the great monasteries which possessed noble or royal mausoleums are: *San Juan de la Peña and San Pedro el Viejo in Huesca, in which are buried the kings of Aragon until Aragon joined Catalonia. In the aforementioned monastery, kings of kingdom of Pamplona are buried, when the territory was part of Navarre. *Santes Creus and Poblet, kings of the Crown of Aragon. *Ripoll, with the counts of Barcelona, before its union with Aragon. *Najera and Leyre, monasteries elected by the dynasties of Navarra. *San Isidoro de León, at which are buried many of the Kings of Leon. *San Salvador de Oña (Burgos), converted into a county and regional cemetery in the second half of the twelfth century. *Las Huelgas Reales de Burgos, chosen by the Castilian monarchs. *Cartuja de Miraflores at Burgos, where Juan II of Castile chose to be buried, along with his second wife and his son Alfonso. *The Salesians in Madrid, where lies Fernando VI (the founder) and his wife Barbara of Braganza. *El Escorial, considered as a prototype for the funeral aspects, but is the most modern of all. There are the mausoleums of the royal families of the Habsburg and Bourbon. *San Román de Hornija, in Valladolid, which was originally a monastery founded by Chindasvinto Visigoth for his own burial and his wife Reciberga (or Reciwerga). Among the monasteries, cemeteries and burial of the family of the nobility, there are: *Loeches Monastery where are buried the Count-Duke of Olivares and his descendants the Dukes of Alba. This is a side chapel. *San Francisco de Guadalajara, where the Dukes of Infantado built a crypt. *San Jerónimo de Granada, whose founder, Grand Master, declined to be buried there. *San Jerónimo de Cotalba in Alfahuir, (Valencia), in which are buried the Infantes Don Juan and Doña Blanca de Aragón. *Monastery of Parral in Segovia, which holds the tomb of the Marquis de Villena. *Monastery of Santa Paula in Seville, with the Marquis de Montemayor. *Santa María la Real de Nájera, which has an important pantheon of the Knights. *Porta Coeli monastery in Valladolid, in which is buried its promoter and benefactor Rodrigo Calderón, Count of Oliva, favorite of the Duke of Lerma. *Monastery of San Pedro de Cardena, where El Cid was buried and where his wife and daughters took refuge during his exile). In the War of Independence, the monastery was sacked by the French army and his grave desecrated. =Monasteries (or convents) as a learning center= Some religious communities have education as their main activity. The agencies and the religious way of life is no different from other monasteries, only instead of cultivating the land, their work is channeled to instruction and education. Examples of such religious houses are the Convent of Santo Domingo as the University of Orihuela (known as the Colegio de Santo Domingo) and the convent of San Esteban de Murcia. The major universities (University of Salamanca, Universidad de Valladolid and University of Alcalá) were closely linked to the regular clergy by religious orders who controlled their schools, mostly Dominicans and Augustinians, and the Jesuits from the sixteenth century. In university towns, there were important monastic or conventual foundations, such as the Dominican Convent of San Esteban de Salamanca. =Urbanised Monasteries or Convents= Some monasteries and convents are located within developed areas; these tend to belong to the so-called mendicant orders, but should not be taken as a general rule. Occasionally, religious houses were built adjacent to communities, neither inside the community or in the countryside, such as Benedictines and Cistercians, and occasionally small hermitages. These urban monasteries are similar to traditional monasteries but have their own architectural characteristics. The buildings are not in most cases surrounded by a wall or fence that isolates, the only walls being those that encircle the garden or orchard. The windows look out onto the streets of the city so it is necessary to protect those inside with blinds. Secular residents of the surrounding community have direct access to the building of the church inside of which there is a closed off area for the monks or nuns. Inside the church, the pulpit becomes a central element because these congregations have as a main goal to instruct and speak directly to the faithful. There are other elements that distinguish convents from monasteries Female convents there are other elements that characterize them, as the existence of a wheel, the only element of contact the religious residents of the community have with the outside. The church building sometimes has an elevated choir and a choir under the feet or a choir under the side of the chancel, separated by a communion rail. Most of these urban monasteries proliferated during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throughout the Spanish territory. =Decline of the Spanish monasteries= Many of the Hispanic monasteries were abandoned, forgotten and lost, over time. The medieval monasteries were maintained, although some were plundered and burned, to recover from these tragedies only with new reconstructions. The nineteenth century was crucial for the conservation of these monastic buildings. The Spanish War of Independence brought many calamities; French soldiers were quartered in the buildings in some cases the churches were turned into stables or kitchens. Fires were set for heating and cooking, with the inevitable consequences. Many of the tombs were desecrated in search of possible treasures or for the mere pleasure of destroying, apart from robbery and theft of works of art in wartime. In some cases, it was believed that the destruction would bring about social transformation, as was the case with the demolition of thirty-seven convents in Madrid and the convent of San Francisco (Valladolid). After years of peace, and of building restoration and recovery of scattered pieces, monasteries were again involved in the events of the Carlist Wars, the identification of the Carlist and the clergy, most notably the burning of convents and monasteries in 1835, which included a massacre of monks. Finally, in this century, the various confiscations ended with the realized heritage of most medieval monasteries. Many of their churches were spared because they took on a new life by becoming parishes. In some cases, other provincial institutions and individuals came forward to museums with recovered pieces, including parts of the churches' architecture. The monastic ruins went on to become a commonplace instance of romanticism, and poets and musicians seeking inspiration in them; notable artists include Frédéric Chopin and George Sand in the Cartuja de Valldemossa and the Bécquer brothers Gustavo and Valeriano in the Cistercian Monastery Veruela (Zaragoza). In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with the Restoration, there was a political climate more favorable to the founding of new religious orders and the restoration of the old. Some monasteries were able to revive the monastic life. In the first third of the twentieth century, political and social critical junctures brought back to light the old Spanish anticlericalism which culminated in Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909. In 1910, the Law of the lock prevented the establishment of new religious congregations. In 1931, shortly after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, came a new burning of convents, but much more serious was the destruction during the Spanish Civil War, with thousands of victims among the clergy. In the last quarter century, both the Spanish state and companies became aware of the great ruined monastic heritage was lost, great buildings abandoned or poorly maintained but still remained standing part of its architecture and began the quest to give them a meaning and relevance, such as rehabilitation for museums, cultural centers, or schools. The architectural complex of Spanish monasteries The monastery and its dependencies eventually consolidated with the Benedictine Order of Cluny in Romanesque period in the early Middle Ages. The monks of Cluny spread throughout Europe and founded the monasteries whose architectural structure would henceforth be an example to follow, with minor variations in some monastic orders, taking into account possible regional differences. =External Signs of buildings= In many monasteries and convents it was traditional to construct a transept and small chapels that served as a shrine, located in the vast expanse of the garden. Fountains and wells which is usually open in the center or side of the courtyard. A common image was that of the patron saint of the warrant or the title holder of the church. Sometimes the title is kept original to the foundation of the monastery and sometimes switches to receive the relics of a saint local or foreign. Sculptural decoration shields were common, signifying the monastic order as appropriate, those of kings or noble founders or sponsors, bishops (where applicable) and the arms of the city. It is also common to see figures representing the founder. An important addition is the tower or steeple with a bell serving as the municipal clock. The language of the bells was very important during the Middle Ages and Renaissance as well as representing the time, as was the town crier announcing events. =The church= The churches of the monasteries have some features that differentiate them from those of secular clergy, especially in regard to the chorus, vestries and penitential cells. In all other respects, they follow the same rules and practice space is dedicated to the liturgy, with the center of spiritual life and religious communities. Churches are always oriented to the east, like other Christian churches (except in cases where the place names force a placement). Its plan is a Latin cross transept and apse or apses. They usually have three gates: the main foot, which gives access to outdoor and one in the side wall to access the cloister, used exclusively by the monks, and a third located in the transept, which leads to the sacristy. Side chapels and shrines Monasteries placed several chapels or simple altars in small spaces due to the requirement that the monks had to say daily Mass each. However, in the convents, this need did not exist because there was only one chaplain for the entire community. This reasoning applies to the sacristy, which were more spacious in monasteries than convents. Presbytery The altar would be placed in this part of the church. Placement of the altar was usually connected with a sculpture of the patron saint of the monastery. In some religious houses, this image is tucked into a niche suitable for pilgrims to visit, such as the monastery of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Choir The choir was customarily located in the middle of the nave in the Spanish monasteries, separated from the chancel by the transept. It might also be located in the apse behind the main altar, surrounded by a circular wall. The choir in the middle of the church is an enclosed space that is usually surrounded by a screen. Inside, it is furnished with seating with ornamentation used to instruct artists. Both armrests and backs are profusely decorated with carvings that are iconographic animal symbols, mythology, allegories, genre scenes and so on. In the center of the choir is lectern furniture that supports the great liturgical choral music book, written in large characters that can be read from afar by the monks. The organ was placed in a lateral. =The cloister= The quintessential medieval Spanish cloister is the Benedictine whose pattern spread throughout Christian Europe. Its construction consists of four galleries called pandas, one of them attached to the south or north nave of the church. One gallery is dedicated always to the chapter house and another small unit. The west gallery houses usually the cilla and laymen, and the gallery border to the church has the refectory and kitchen calefactory. In some monasteries, the profundis room is replaced by the refectory where the monks chant Psalm \\"De profundis ad te Dominum clamavi ...\\" Psalm 130 (129) =Infirmaries, herbal medicine and herb garden= One of Saint Benedict's foremost edicts concerned caring for the ill indigent residents around the monasteries. To this end, the monasteries established hospitals both inside the monastery grounds and elsewhere in the community. Inside the monastery, there was an infirmary which treated the friars themselves and on occasion, ill visitors. As a complement to this infirmary, monasteries often had stores of herbal or botanic medicines, supplied by the monastery's garden. In some cases, this infirmary and associated medical stores might expand beyond the needs of the monastery and the surrounding community. This is true of the monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos, which was founded in 1705 at the request of the town of Silos. It became a famous chemist and recognized in the region, which is today quite well preserved; it is a museum for those who wish to study what these infirmaries were like. One particular display is that of a collection of jars produced in Talavera de la Reina, for the center, with the coat of arms of the monastery. There are many documents about these aromatic gardens cultivated by the monks. In the monastery of Santa Maria de Matallana in the province of Valladolid, reconstruction of the ruins revealed the space that monks had devoted to this garden, growing plants. Another major herbarium was the monastery of San Julián de Samos in the province of Lugo. The apothecaries were served by the monks, themselves specialized. They carried out all relevant tasks for the manufacture of medicines, ointments, and spirits both medicinal and otherwise. Many of these pharmacies have conserved tools such as the stills used for distillation. =Scriptorium and library= In the High and Late Medieval period, much learning and literature was in the hands of the monasteries. It was there that knowledge was preserved, books were copied and translations made. Many of these monasteries had a scriptorium in addition to a library, furnished with benches, desks and shelves and equipped with pens, parchment, inks and other tools needed for writing and painting miniatures. Judging by the illuminated manuscripts preserved in Catalonia, there is evidence that desks were abundant. The Royal Monastery of Santa María de Vallbona had not only a significant library but some furniture of the period. The library of the monastery of Montserrat has 400 incunabula, despite the ravages of time, and the Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda in Aragon still retains its scriptorium space. Another significant library of the period was that of Santa María de Huerta, Soria, built in the twelfth century and decorated in the seventeenth. In the monastery of Valvanera, the rich library survives, in which there are records which refer to the Polyglot Bible Valvanera, which Philip II removed to El Escorial where it was destroyed in a fire. In Galicia, the famous monastery of San Julián de Samos had a great library that was burned in a fire in the late twentieth century. =Cemetery for monks= Usually the monks were buried in the cloisters' crypt. The Cistercian monks were buried directly in the ground (without a coffin) and face down. The abbots were buried in the chapter house. =Other units= One of the most important areas in a monastery is the garden, large or small. It supplied both food and a place for monks to come do penance or for spiritual retreats. The large monasteries had similarly large gardens with all kinds of facilities, from fountains, canals and wells. In some minor orders, the gardens had simply small chapels or oratories. Sometimes inns were built outside the closure area. Over time and with the growing authority of the abbot, the religious houses were wont to build their own house, where the abbot might receive important guests. Larger monasteries provided not only the means for the monks' subsistence but for a strong local economic base, with workshops, foundries, mills, potteries, wineries, and other small businesses. Heritage Despite the great vicissitudes suffered by the Spanish monasteries—fire, theft, plundering, confiscations, laziness—there still remains still a considerable heritage of artistic furnishings. The monasteries tried to move away from the heritage of austerity required of ascetics, without exhibiting any external signs of wealth. Maintaining this position was virtually impossible because of the desire of lay founders, sponsors and donors that their gifts be visible as indications of their power, generosity and position. All these monasteries developed a rich collection of art, and this display did not escape the strictest order in this regard, the Carthusian Order. In the Renaissance and Baroque period, the great chapel altars and those of smaller subsidiary chapels, following the new concept of post-Counter liturgical life. Thus arose the sculpted altarpieces, such as that by Damián Forment in the monastery of Poblet, which resulted in such an extravagant expenditure that the monks rebelled against the abbot. Another example of a huge altarpiece was in the monastery of San Benito el Real de Valladolid, a masterpiece of Berruguete Alonso, which is kept at present at the National Museum of Sculpture in the city. The vestries were enriched not only with the necessary furniture but adorned with works of famous painters, often in valuable frames. Also paintings of kings and nobility often hung on the walls of the churches or cloisters as symbols of or to attract their patronage. Many monasteries have liturgical pieces, and large pieces of jewelry displayed in glass cases along with textile items, such as vestments and clothing. Some monasteries are by themselves a veritable museum of art, like the Descalzas Real in Madrid. Others have opened up within its walls (taking advantage of old farms) where to place a museum and recovered missing pieces, such is the case of Poblet whose museum occupies the area that was the Palace of King Martin the Humane in Poblet. Counted among their treasure are valuable books. Some notable monasteries Some monasteries have historical significance or are simply interesting. The short listing here does not imply that these monasteries are the best or most important, but simply interesting histories. =Monastery of San Benito el Real de Sahagún= This monastery was important enough that it was referred to as the Spanish Cluny. It was the most powerful and influential Benedictine monastery of the Middle Ages in the Kingdom of León. It was protected and promoted by King Alfonso VI which, among other privileges granted to preserve the protected Urraca also gave the monastery the right to mint its own currency and the Jews of the town as vassals by King Alfonso VII. Its heritage spanned the provinces of León, Valladolid, Palencia, Zamora and Cantabria, thus counting a far larger number of subjects under their jurisdiction than the holdings of other important figures of the time. From the religious point of view, Sahagun was the center from which sprang at the behest of Pope Gregory VII the new Roman liturgy which replaced Spanish Mozarabic Rite. Father Sandoval and Father Yepes listed fifty to sixty monasteries and a large number of churches which depended on Sahagún. The monastery's influence stretched from Toledo and from Cantabria Rioja to Galicia. =Monastery of San Benito el Real Valladolid= Its founding in 1389 brought a new reform of the Benedictine order under the royal protection of Juan I and the blessing of Pope Clement VII; the \\"black monks\\" had relaxed their strictures, forgetting Saint Benedict's strictures so far as to sleep outside the monasteries. This monastery instilled its members with a respect for the example of Saint Benedict. The cloister was the property of the monastery, not only from the spiritual perspective but the physical, with a double gate installed in the entries. The principle was established with toughness and authority of perpetual abstinence, fasting and severity in the monk's practice and in their habitations; it also enforced generosity to the needy in the form of sharing food, money and fuel. Valladolid took the lead in the fifteenth century reforms of the Benedictine orders in Spain, and other Benedictine monasteries became dependent on it Valladolid, as did the Congregation of San Benito de Valladolid, after the papal bull of Pope Alexander VI. To this end, many chapters drafted the relevant constitutions. =Monastery of Poblet= Poblet was founded by the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV. It was one of the four great Cistercian abbeys of Christendom, along with Clairvaux, in Absinthe, France; the Great Forest, in Languedoc; and Fontfreda, near Narbonne). In 1340, Peter ordered the crypts for royalty and nobility to be created, which became an important center for burial. The abbots of Poblet became a very powerful part of the clergy who participated in Parliament; one abbot even became president of the Generalitat. The involvement of the abbots in Catalan wars became apparent. =Monastery of La Rabida= This is a Franciscan monastery in the town of Palos de la Frontera, in Huelva province. This was an important place in the history of Spain since its participation in the negotiations which took place between the friars and Fray Antonio de Marchena Friar Juan Perez and Colon during the four visits he made. The monks helped and supported Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs, and as such the monastery is part of what is termed \\"Columbus's Places\\" in Andalusia. =Monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla= In this small and humble monastery were first written the annotations or glosses called Emilian Glosses written in \\"romance\\", a little- studied form of Castilian derived from Latin, and two or three in Euskera. It is considered the cradle of these languages. =Monastery of Guadalupe= It had a famous scriptorium which produced a series of illuminated books, many of which are preserved in the museum of the monastery. The medieval image of the Virgin of Guadalupe which was taken by the discoverers of Extremadura to the Americas. This images is particularly venerated in Mexico. Many well known historical figures passed through the monastery as pilgrims: Christopher Columbus, Hernán Cortés, King Sebastian of Portugal, Teresa de Jesus Buenfil, Lope de Vega and Pope John Paul II (in 1982.) =Monastery of Santo Toribio de Liebana= Founded in the sixth century in the Cantabrian region of Liébana, this monastery held from the eighth century a relic of the True Cross, supposedly the largest fragment preserved. At the same time, the monk Beatus of Liébana wrote two works of great significance: the Commentary on Revelation, of which several valuable illuminated illustrated copies are held, and the refutation of heresy that had spread among Mozarabic Christians under Muslim occupation and Elipando, bishop of Toledo. The monastery regularly celebrated a Jubilee or Holy Year Liebana. =Monastery of San Salvador de Tabara= This was a two-part monastery of monks and nuns in the Visigothic tradition, founded by Abbot Froila, under the patronage of Alfonso III and located 43 km northeast of Zamora. The excavations brought to light two columnar towers and an arch that led to the lower room of the tower. In this tower was the scriptorium where the monk Emeterio finished illuminating the Beatus miniatures Tabara, initiated by his master, Magio. Emeterio himself writes the following account: \\"Oh Tábara tower, high tower of stone! It's there in the top and into the first room of the library, where sat Emeterio and hunched over his homework, over 3 months, and all the members crippled by the work of the pen. 52 was finished this book 6 of the Kalends of August, the year 1008 was Hispanic, 53 to the facet hour.\\" This phrase, along with an illustration of the tower workplace, have been highly valued for depicting how such work was in the monasteries. =Monastery of El Palancar= Founded by San Pedro de Alcantara Acim Pedroso (Cáceres (province)) in 1557, this was considered the world's smallest religious house. Subsequently extended, it retained the original area under the name of the convent. In a tiny space, were built several structures a chapel for the offices large enough to fit only the officiant and an acolyte, to which is attached the founder's cell, which describes Santa Teresa de Jesús this way: It seems they were forty years, he told me he had slept one hour and a half between night and day, and it was the greatest work of penance that had in the early to beat the dream and it was always or kneeling or standing. I was sitting and sleeping head leaning against a maderillo he had driven into the wall. Lying, even if I wanted, I could not because his cell as we know, was not longer than four feet and a half. =Monastery of El Escorial= Designed to be not only a monastery but a royal residence and as a pantheon of kings of the houses of Austria and Bourbon. It is a monastery known and admired worldwide. Herrera architecture was revolutionary in Spanish art, and El Escorial retains great treasures and its library and art gallery spaces are considered to hold very rich and valuable collections. =Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen= Located in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range near Madrid, this led in the years after its building to a great social impact, not only by the vast proportion its construction but its later role in burials. Spanish monasteries in the 21st century Many monasteries have crumbled over the centuries, leaving no trace of their existence. However, some may be described by researchers who have access to related documents. In some cases, these documents only speak of history, but in other cases, contracts or purchases remain fairly accurately related to the buildings. A large number of the monasteries have only the church as a witness of the complex that might be. At other times, ruins remain which are being transformed to a fruitful use. Occasionally buildings which remained intact over the centuries have been converted into a hotel, a school or a restaurant. In none of these cases, has the modern business retained the property the garden or nearby buildings. Also many of these medieval monasteries have regained their original function and survive as a community of monks or nuns. In the absence of patronage and custom or donations, these religious people adapt to modern life with modern media and subsist on the work undertaken by the community's members: confectionery, wine and spirits, cheese, bee hives, poultry farms, textiles and fiber arts, writing scores, dissertations, obituaries, advanced computing, pottery of all kinds, decorated white porcelain, artisanal food, farming, vestments, textiles, caring for sick and elderly, schools and daycare. In addition, about 250 monasteries have a guest house for lay people who must follow some basic rules, with minimal cost.

I think in this way writing is very much like dreaming. We don't go to bed at night with an idea of what we're going to dream about. It's a very strange and mysterious and unconscious process. Thirty years ago, twenty years ago, ten years ago, I could have talked your ear off about my mother but I could not have written about her. And then, suddenly, the material came. Things circle around, they appear on the page when they do, on their own time in a sense...everybody can relate to that in terms of dreaming; you have weird dreams that appear out of left field and we don't control it.

The movie was eventually completed and released direct to video by Chosen One Productions RS LLC. Reception =Critical response= Film Critics United, a pseudo-anonymous on-line movie review website, wrote that Schneider gave a good performance, but the film failed due to other factors including its muddled plot. Brian Orndorf described it as an attempt at a more serious dramatic role, but was critical, finding the film a failure.

Mammadov specialized in Eastern philosophy, and focused mostly on the history of Azerbaijani philosophy. He had refuted the thesis ‘no professional philosopher lived in Azerbaijan in Middle Ages except for Bahmanyar’.Zakir Jabbar Bey Mammadov. Bibliography. Azerbaijan’s science and cultural workers. Baku-“Elm”-2010  Life  Mammadov was born in Seyidli, Agdam on August 16, 1936. His mother was Husnu Murtuza bey qizi Mammadbeyova, and his father Jabbar bey Ismayil bey oglu Valibeyov. His father was a descendant of the Baharli tribe. Mammadov grew up under political persecution and used his mother's surname. His last name was Mammadov, not Mammadbeyov. Mammadov graduated from secondary school No.1 of Agdam earning medal and entered Arabic philology section, recently established within Faculty of Oriental Studies of Azerbaijan State University (now Baku State University). While Mammadov was first year student, i.e. on 29 November 1957 his father Jabbar bey was exonerated by the decision of Supreme Court of Azerbaijan SSR. While studying at university he was awarded certificate of merit by Az.LKGI for excellence in education and public work. He published verses and translations from Arabic on university newspaper with large editions. Having learnt Arabic from Alasgar Mammadov, great personality, polyglot scholar, and founder of Arabic studies in Azerbaijan, Mammadov graduated from university in 1962. In August of that year Mammadov embarked on working as junior research fellow in Institute of Oriental Studies of ANAS. From September 1962 to September 1963 he was the first Azerbaijani interpreter who worked in construction of Aswan dam in Egypt (UAR). Having learnt local dialect in a year he also collected rich scientific literature in Arabic. Upon return to his motherland he started teaching Egyptian dialect first time in Azerbaijan State University (now Baku State University) and due to his scientific interest toward books obtained about Eastern philosophy began working in Philosophy section of Azerbaijan AS (now Institute of Philosophy and Law of ANAS). Mammadov died on March 2, 2003. Mammadov's life and writings were broadly depicted in Orkhan Mammadov's book titled ‘Agdam’s renowned pedagogues and scholars’. At the same time more than thirty articles about Mammadov's scientific activities were published in periodical press. Khatira Guliyeva published a monograph called ‘Great Azerbaijani philosopher Mammadov (Baharli)’ with reference to his life and writings. Scientific activity Mammadov attained philosophical specialty ‘science of the sciences’ in Azerbaijani language and Arabic philology through working present-day Institute of Philosophy and Law since January 1, 1964. Hereby Mammadov revealed the richness of our national philosophical legacy thank to his knowledge of Eastern languages and philosophy, because till his researches it was supposed that no professional philosopher lived in the East, Bahmanyar who left few materials among his works in our hand is exception. Through approximately forty years Mammadov carried out explorations, revealed Azerbaijani philosophers’ and thinkers’ (who wrote in Eastern languages) rich legacy published in various countries of the world, as well as preserved as manuscript, worked out their philosophy (theory of existence and knowledge theory), logic, socio-political and ethical views. Philosophy turned out to be ‘bondmaid of theology’ in Christian world in Middle Ages which is considered the age of ignorance and unawareness, there was not scientific philosophy, only scholasticism and mysticism were poorly spread. Mammadov proved that alongside with religious philosophy scientific philosophy existed in East and also Azerbaijan at that time. He found out that one of three essential scientific philosophical doctrines – Eastern Peripateticism was founded by Turkic philosopher Al-Farabi (873-950), the other two ones, Pantheism and Illuminationism were founded by Ayn al-Quzat Miyanedji (1099–1131) and Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1154–1191) respectively. Doctrines of skilful Azerbaijani philosophers became pattern for talented philosophers throughout ages in Moslem countries of the East by growing into philosophical schools. Their ideas didn't confine to Islamic world and later spread across European countries as well. In a word, history of world philosophy didn't lack scientific philosophical vision owing to the East, particularly Azerbaijani philosophers in Middle Ages (for the duration of thousand years). All these were expressed by Mammadov in more than thirty books (published and not published) and 250 articles. In 1969 Mammadov succeeded the defence of his postgraduate dissertation ‘Sirajeddin Urmavi’s logical views’ which he had completed in 1967. Although his doctoral thesis ‘11-13th Centuries Philosophical Thinking in Azerbaijan’, which had been completed in 1974 was published as a book in 1978, he accomplished the defence 16 years later. Having founded the section for history of Eastern philosophy in 1997 Mammadov chaired the section till the end of his life. He was elected corresponding member (associate member) of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences in 2001. Mammadov worked in the post of academic editor (part-time) for Azerbaijan Soviet Encyclopaedia from 1969 to 1970, made efforts so that materials concerning our national philosophy were widely incorporated into encyclopaedia. Azerbaijan's professional philosophers were included in this ten volume work only attributable to him. Moreover, Mammadov engaged in pedagogical activities, taught philosophy, history of Azerbaijani philosophy and history of Eastern philosophy in higher education institutions. Mammadov was a member of expert council on ‘History, theology, philosophy, psychology and pedagogical sciences’ of High Attestation Commission under President of the Republic since 1997. Because Mammadov's whole researches were based on primary sources, he did his utmost for bringing those works to Azerbaijan. Till his researches Bahmanyar's two small size treatises ‘The Subject of Metaphysics’ and ‘Degrees of Beings’ had been known. The researcher revealed his large size work ‘Education’ (Kitab at-tahsil). Due to his numerous requests from related organizations the treatise was brought into Azerbaijan. Thus the scholar incorporated the entire ‘Education’ into research first time. Along with treatises ‘The Subject of Metaphysics’ and ‘Degrees of Beings’ Bahmanyar's ‘Education’ (Kitab at-tahsil) was fully translated into Azerbaijani. Small part of ‘Education’ (Kitab at-tahsil) and two other treatises were completely published in his book titled ‘Eastern philosophy (9-12th centuries)’ (BDU publishing, 1999). Mammadov was acquiring the Eastern, especially Azerbaijani philosophers’ works, microfilms of unique manuscripts, printed copies mostly at the expense of his own and sometimes his friends’ allowances to order. In Azerbaijan he was the only scholar that researched the doctrines of Eastern philosophers comprehensively and extendedly on the basis of those sources. Besides researching the legacy of our world-famous philosophers he also sought for their public recognition. On Mammadov's initiative the Presidium of Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences adopted decision on commemoration of 800th anniversary of Shihab al-Din Suhrawardi, the founder of Illuminationism on April 2, 1991. In accordance with this decision the jubilee of illuminationist philosopher was marked in Institute of Philosophy and Law (now Institute of Philosophy, Sociology and Law) on 25 December 1991. While Mammadov, the only researcher of Shihab al-Din Suhrawardi's philosophical legacy translated his numerous treatises into Azerbaijani, merely two of them were issued. The researcher translated Shihab al-Din Suhrawardi's ‘Philosophers’ creed ’ into Azerbaijani and Russian in cooperation with Tariyel Hasanov and this translation was published initially in 1986 and second time in 1999. By translating philosopher’s treatise ‘The Temples of Light (Hayakal al-Nur)’ Mammadov published it initially in 1989 and second time in 1999 with his own fund. Upon Z.Mammadov's initiative the Presidium of Azerbaijan AS and Cabinet of Ministers adopted decision on the commemoration of the 1000th anniversary of Bahmanyār’s birth in 1993. On this occasion three scientific sessions were held in Institute of Philosophy and Law and conferences in a number of higher education institutions. Upon Mammadov’s initiative the Presidium of Azerbaijan AS adopted decision on the 800th anniversary of Sirajeddin Urmavi’s birth in 1998. He made up articles with regard to the 800th anniversary of Afzaladdin Xunaji and Sirajeddin Urmavi’s birth and to the 900th anniversary of Ayn al-Quzat Miyanedji and published them in journal and newspapers. Mammadov attended a variety of scientific sessions, conferences in Baku, Tashkent, Samarkand, Fergana and Dushanbe. He gave a talk in 5th (1968) and 12th (1975) scientific sessions of Azerbaijan AS’s Coordination Council, academic conference dedicated to methodological issues and development history of Transcaucasian peoples’ medieval philosophy and session devoted to the 700th anniversary of Ottoman Empire (1999). He delivered speeches regarding the anniversaries of scientific and cultural coryphaeus – Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Nizami Ganjavi, Nasimi, Abbasgulu Bakikhanov, Mirza Fatali Akhundov, Muhammad al-Bukhari and Ahmad Fargani. He was elected member of State Jubilee Commission organizing the Nasir al-Din al-Tusi’s 800th anniversary. ‘History of Azerbaijan Philosophy’, Mammadov's masterpiece of great importance among his writings is an outline of his researches concerning Azerbaijani philosophers’ and thinkers’ rich philosophical legacy revealed by him for more than thirty years. The book traces the development path of Azerbaijani philosophy's history. Ideological trends, doctrines, vision of their Azerbaijani proponents are analysed in the context of Eastern philosophical thinking. It is shown that though merely religious philosophy (mysticism and scholasticism) was spread in Christian world during feudalism, there existed non-religious philosophical doctrines such as pantheism and Illuminationism founded by Azerbaijani philosophers, as well as East Peripateticism in Muslim countries and these enriched philosophical history of the mankind.
