It starred Martin Shaw as Rhodes, and was written by Antony Thomas. Rhodes received its British television debut on 15 September 1996, and concluded on 3 November. It was produced by Scott Meek and Charles Salmon, and directed by David Drury. Background At the time of its production, Rhodes was the most expensive project ever undertaken by a British television broadcaster, costing ¬£10 million to make, and was seen as a huge gamble by the BBC. In addition, development, filming and production took a decade to complete, and the series employed over 10,000 extras. Forming part of BBC1's Autumn 1996 television programming, its opening episode was preceded by a high-profile publicity campaign. However, it quickly began to attract relatively poor viewing figures. Although 7.6 million tuned in for the first episode, by the following week viewing figures had fallen to 4.8 million. The series was also quickly panned by critics. On 26 September 1996, a report by The Independents Marianne MacDonald suggested one of the series' biggest issues was that it assumed its viewers would already have a prior knowledge of Cecil Rhodes' life and achievements, something which it turned out many of those watching it did not possess. In response to these concerns, the BBC produced a 32-page booklet to accompany the series that provided some background details about Rhodes, and which could be purchased for ¬£4.99. However, copies of this book would not be available until at least four weeks into the series, by which time MacDonald felt that many viewers would have given up on it. Following the 2000 adaptation of Gormenghast, Mervyn Peake's series of fantasy novels, which also proved to be unsuccessful with viewers and critics, Rhodes was included in a list of notable British television flops compiled by The Guardian. Synopsis The series tells the story of Rhodes' life through a series of flashbacks of conversations between him and Princess Catherine Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, and also between her and people who knew him. It also shows the story of how she stalked and eventually ruined him. In the serial, Cecil Rhodes is played by Martin Shaw, the younger Cecil Rhodes is played by his son Joe Shaw, and Princess Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç is played by Frances Barber. In the serial Rhodes is portrayed as ruthless and greedy. The serial also suggests that he was homosexual. Criticism Because of the dramatic slide in ratings, Rhodes was quickly deemed to have been a failure, prompting MacDonald to observe that the series was \\"in danger of becoming a flop as colossal as its hero's exploits\\". It was also quickly rounded on by a number of critics, who were equally as scathing. Writing for The Sunday Times, A. A. Gill suggested it \\"started with everything against it and then they made it all worse\\", while David Aaronovitch of The Independent on Sunday opined the overuse of background music, observing \\"The BBC's Rhodes is a man who cannot take a leak without the assistance of the Berlin Philharmonic\\". Paul Johnson, writing for the Daily Mail felt Rhodes had been misrepresented by the series: \\"In nine tendentious hours, Rhodes is to be presented as a corrupt and greedy money-grabber, a racist and paedophile, whose disgusting passion was to get his hands on young boys ... the BBC has spent ¬£10m of our money putting together a farrago of exaggerations and smears about this great man.\\" However, despite the series' troubles the BBC were hopeful that it would enjoy more success internationally: A spokeswoman for BBC Worldwide said of Rhodes, \\"It's obviously very disappointing about the ratings but it doesn't really affect international sales. Overseas broadcasters ... tend not to go on what critics say here.\\" Media releases The complete series of Rhodes was released on VHS in 1997. It was subsequently released on DVD by Acorn Media UK on 3 March 2008.

Originally gifted to the then ruler King Moshoeshoe I by a British man known only as \\"Mr Howell\\" in the late 19th century, these blankets quickly gained popularity in the Lesotho region. The way that Lesotho men wear these traditional blankets is founded on the traditional Kaross, an animal skin cape, although their transformation to \\"factory-woven textile\\" is attributed to King Moshoeshoe I. By 1860 securing sufficient skins for Karosses was increasingly difficult and by 1872 a large majority of sheepskin covers had been replaced by poor quality cotton or wool. The King secured the production of \\"special blankets\\" in 1876 after meeting with Scottish textile manufacturer Donald Fraser. These new blankets were not only sturdier but they could also be fashioned in a way which more resembled the Kaross and they therefore quickly replaced the poor quality imported cloth that the people of Lesotho were previously wearing.  Ceremonial use  Across the kingdom, a variety of these blankets are worn by the people of Lesotho to represent the different rites of passage in society. The Moholobela is a fertility blanket worn by young Sotho men in preparation of their transition to manhood. After the initiation ceremony, the young men in Lesotho will don a different blanket known as the Lekhokolo, which confirms that they have reached adulthood. In preparation for the wedding ceremony, Lesotho women ordinarily wear a Motlotlehi blanket on their wedding day, they will traditionally gift their wife a Serope blanket when their first child is born. Seana Marena:Myrtle Karstel, Culna, Volume 1991, Issue 41, Oct 1991, p. 25 ‚Äì 26 Means chief's blanket or to swear by the king: This particular blanket is exclusively worn by the king and his chiefs, it has the highest status of all Basotho blankets. Lehlosi: A Chiefly blanket made of patterns from the skin of wild cat or leopards. At present, one will often observe chiefs wearing commercially manufactured blankets bearing the print of a leopard, rather than actual leopard skins. Victorian/ Malakabane: In 1897 Queen Victoria visited the Lesotho during her inaugural year. She gave King Lerotholi a gift, which happened to be a blanket. He wore the blanket with elegance, in a manner that represented the Poncho, over his shoulders and there the blanket wearing tradition began. The blanket was named Victoria England. The Sotho people had a great love and respect for Queen Victoria and the Victoria England blanket has become a sought after status symbol. Motlatsi: designed and produced to pay tribute to the birth of Prince Lerotholi. Motlatsi means \\"successor\\".

Controversy  Louis Vuitton's designs for the 2017 menswear collection featured designs from Basotho Blankets which caused controversy in South Africa with accusations of cultural appropriation.  In popular media  In the 2018 films Black Panther and in Avengers: Infinity Wars, W‚ÄôKabi and his tribesmen appear in many scenes wearing what looks like the Basotho blanket. Given that the actors in the film were not from Continental Africa, several continental African groups viewed the appropriation of these cultural symbols as inappropriate for use by diasporic Africans.

In opera, she has sung both soprano and mezzo-soprano roles and is often associated with the role of Carmen. Early life Clarey was born in Smithfield, Virginia. At the age of ten she moved with her family to Rocky Mount, North Carolina. As a child, Clarey sang in choirs for her school and the family's church. Education After graduating from high school in 1966, Clarey went to Howard University in Washington, D.C. to study music. She earned her bachelor of music degree in 1970. Clarey then enrolled at the Juilliard School in New York City. She initially intended to pursue a career in musical theater, not opera, leading to Clarey walking out of a master class with opera singer Maria Callas when questioned on the matter. Despite this conflict with the school faculty, Clarey continued at the school and earned a postgraduate diploma in 1972. Career Opera Clarey made her debut with the American Opera Center singing the role of Pamina in Mozart's Magic Flute. She worked professionally as a chorister in New York City for a time, singing for shows like Carmina Burana and the Alvin Ailey Dance Company's Revelations. In these early years as an African-American performer, Clarey recalls incidents of racial prejudice, including a time when a director wanted to remove a black chorister from a scene because \\"she did not look authentic to Mozart.\\" Clarey then moved to Binghamton, New York and joined the Tri- Cities Opera Company. This is where Clarey first sang the character of \\"Carmen, a Gypsy Girl\\" in Georges Bizet's opera Carmen. Carmen became a signature role for Clarey, and she went on to perform it across the United States and globally. In 1984 Clarey made her European operatic debut singing in L'incoronazione di Poppea at the Glyndebourne Festival. Two years later, she returned to Glyndenbourne in Porgy and Bess as Serena. Clarey later spoke of the challenging nature of this role. She expressed respect and admiration for early African-American opera singer Ruby Elzy, who originated the role in 1935 with a demanding weekly performance schedule. \\"Serena's music is so difficult to sing,\\" Clarey said, \\"and when you have to act the role too it's overwhelming. ... I can't imagine having to do a role and an opera this difficult, and then have to perform in them eight times a week\\". Clarey is featured on a recording of the Glyndenbourne cast of Porgy and Bess, with Simon Rattle conducting the London Philharmonic. This 1989 release was nominated for a Grammy Award and is considered one of the best classically- oriented recordings of the opera. Clarey also performed with the Royal Opera House in London, the Op√©ra-Comique (Paris), the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Bayerische Staatsoper (Bavarian State Opera, Munich), the Teatro Municipale (Reggio Emilia), the Teatro Real (Madrid), the Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro), the Teatro Nacional de Sao Carlos, the Toronto Opera and the CAPAB Opera (Cape Town).

She is best known for her work in Manchester, England. At the time of her death in 1870, she was one of the richest women in the nineteenth century. Life Atherton was born on 14 February 1782 and was the oldest surviving daughter of Henry Atherton (1740‚Äì1816), a barrister, and Ann Byrom (1751‚Äì1826). Atherton inherited her wealth from several family members. She lived half the year at the Byrom family home at 23 Quay Street in Manchester and half at the family's country home Kersal Cell in Kersal. Kersal Cell Atherton also owned land in London, Cheshire, Lancashire, and Jamaica. The land that Atherton, along with her younger sister Lucy Willis, inherited in Jamaica from their uncle, William Atherton of Jamaica, included slaves. Philanthropy During her lifetime, Atherton is estimated to have annually donated several thousands of pounds to charities in and around Manchester every year. She is thought to have given away a total of around ¬£100,000 between 1838 and 1870. The charities that she donated money to usually concerned religion, children, the sick or the elderly. In 1841, Atherton funded the building of the Holy Trinity Church in Hulme, Manchester, and St Paul's Church in Kersal, built between 1841 and 1843. In 1860 she paid for the restoration of the Jesus Chapel in Manchester Cathedral as well as later contributing to the restoration of the cathedral tower. Several other members of her family funded the building and restoration of various churches and Atherton later bequeathed ¬£5,000 to St John's Church in Manchester which her grandfather, Edward Byrom funded. As well as religious buildings, she also donated funds to various medical buildings in Manchester including St Mary's Hospital, Manchester Royal Eye Hospital and institutions which helped people who were terminally ill. Atherton funded several buildings in memory of family members including the new wing of a Manchester ragged school in memory of her aunt, Eleanora Byrom, and almshouses in Prescot in memory of her sister, Lucy. Atherton died on 12 September 1870 in her home in Quay Street where she had been confined for three years. She was buried in St Paul's Church in Kersal, one of the churches which she had funded. She died one of the richest women in the nineteenth century having left ¬£400,000. Atherton was a slave owner and profited from the use of slaves on her Jamaican estates. After the abolition of slavery in Britain she applied two times for compensation for the loss of 182 slaves (for which she received ¬£3466 8S 8D) and another 544 slaves (for which she received ¬£1972 17S 9D).

Bahay na bato (Tagalog, literally \\"house of stone\\") is a type of building originating during the Philippines' Spanish Colonial period. It is an updated version of the traditional bahay kubo. Its design has evolved throughout the ages, but still maintains the bahay kubos architectural basis which corresponds to the tropical climate, stormy season, and earthquake-prone environment of the whole archipelago of the Philippines and fuses it with the influence of Spanish colonizers and Chinese traders. Thus created was a hybrid of Austronesian, Spanish, and Chinese architecture with American influence during the American era, supporting the fact that the Philippines is a result of these cultures mixing together. Its most common appearance is that of an elevated, overhanging wooden upper-story nipa hut (with balustrades, ventanillas, and capiz shell sliding windows) that stands on Spanish-style solid stone blocks or bricks and posts as foundation instead of just wood, bamboo stilts, or timber posts. Roofing is either Chinese tiled roof or thatch (nipa, sago palm, or cogon), of which many today are being replaced by galvanized or other modern roofing. It followed the bahay kubo's arrangements such as open ventilation and elevated apartments used as living space with the ground floor used for storerooms, cellars, and other business purposes. Like bahay kubo, much of this ground level was reserved for storage; in business districts, some spaces were rented to shops. Horses for carriages were housed in stables called caballerizas.http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v2/v3.pdf The Spanish Colonial Tradition. Bahay na bato had a rectangular plan that reflected vernacular Austronesian Filipino traditional houses integrated with Spanish style. It was popular among the elite or middle-class, and integrated the characteristics of the nipa hut with the style, culture and technology of Chinese and Spanish architecture. The 19th century was the golden age of these houses, when wealthy Filipinos built fine houses all over the archipelago. The same architectural style was used for Philippines' Spanish-era convents, monasteries, schools, hotels, factories, and hospitals, and with some of the American-era Gabaldon school buildings, all with few adjustments. This architecture is still used during the American colonization of the Philippines. After the Second World War, building these houses declined and eventually stopped in favor of post-World War II modern architecture. Today, these houses are more commonly called ancestral houses, due to most ancestral houses in the Philippines being of bahay na bato architecture. An example of bahay na bato Philippine architecture  Etymology  Though the Filipino term bahay na bato means \\"house of stone\\", these houses are not fully made up of stone; some are even dominated more by wooden materials, and some more modern ones use concrete materials. The name got applied to the architecture as generations pass by, because contrary to its predecessor bahay kubo, which are fully made of organic materials, it uses stone materials.  History  A perfume factory built in the bahay na bato style along the Escolta Precolonial Philippine architecture is based on the traditional stilt houses of the Austronesian people of Southeast Asia. The first buildings during the early years of Spanish occupation were of wood and bamboo, materials with which the pre-Hispanic indigenous Filipinos had been working expertly since early times known as bahay kubo (later named by the Americans as \\"nipa hut\\"). Bahay kubo's roofs were of nipa palm or cogon grass. In its most basic form, the house consisted of four walls enclosing one or more rooms, with the whole structure raised above ground on stilts. Its resemblance to a cube earned its description in Spanish, cubo. Clusters of these wooden houses clearly were predisposed to fire. The Spaniards then quickly introduced the idea of building more permanent communities with the church and government center as a focal points. By the mid-1580s, through the efforts of Domingo Salazar, the first bishop of Manila, and of the Jesuit Antonio Sede√±o, edifices began to be constructed of stone. Fr. Sede√±o built the first stone building, which was the residence of Bishop Salazar. By 1587, Governor General Santiago de Vera required all buildings in Manila to be built of stone. For this purpose, the Chinese and the indigenous Filipinos were taught how to quarry and dress stone, how to prepare and use mortar, and how to mold bricks. Thus began what has been called the first golden age of building in stone. This new community setup made construction using heavier, more permanent materials desirable. Some of these materials included bricks, mortar, tiles and stone. Glowing accounts of towering palaces and splendid mansions reached the peninsula. However, the ambitious plans of the Spaniards were dashed in 1645 when a terrible earthquake struck Manila. The twin dangers of fire and earthquake gave rise to another type of architecture. Finding European construction styles impractical in local conditions, Spanish and Filipino builders quickly adapted the characteristics of the bahay kubo of the natives and applied it to Spanish Colonial architecture. This type of construction was soon called bahay na bato or as Jesuit Ignacio Alzina calls it, \\"arquitectura mestiza\\" or ‚Äúmixed architecture‚Äù.Calle Sebastian (now Hidalgo Street; with the San Sebastian Church in the background), once dubbed as the most beautiful street in Manila. Manila during the early 1900s was filled with majestic bahay na bato architecture on its streets Under more than three centuries of Spanish initiative, buildings of wood, stone, and brick were constructed all over the archipelago, from the Batanes Islands in the north to Tawi-Tawi in the south, from Palawan in the west to Samar in the east. During the Second World War, many of these houses were destroyed by both the American and Japanese forces.  Styles  left Different styles depend on each house's individual appearance. For example, some Bahay na bato do not have ventanillas, some do not have Capiz windows, and some lack both. Some have galvanized roofs, some have tiled roofs, and some have nipa or cogon roofs. First-level walls may be made of bricks, adobe stones, or coral stones; more modern structures uses concrete or wood. Although retaining the basic form, the 19th-century bahay na bato reflected changing tastes through the incorporation of motifs from the prevalent styles. https://www.scribd.com/document/252360021/Bahay-Na-Bato Bahay na bato. Houses like the Vega Ancestral House that have almost fully wooden materials even to the first level walls are still considered Bahay na bato; the name Bahay na bato was applied to this architecture as generations passed by, as most of these houses use stone materials, contrary to the precolonial era that used no stones at all. The same principle applies to the nipa hut ‚Äì not all nipa huts use nipa materials; some use cogon. Its local name, bahay kubo, means \\"cube house\\", though not all are of a cubic shape. These houses have an unprecedented mixing and matching of architectural styles, such that a Bahay na bato can have Neogothic and Neo-Mudejar (Neo- Moorish) details in the same corners ‚Äî that is, on top of the Baroque (which may be of a particular style, e.g. the spare-by-comparison Viennese Secessionist style). These quaint mixes give the Bahay na bato an architectural style that evolved from both East and West, and thus makes it truly Filipino, as it corresponds to Philippine history of being a melting pot of east and west.http://filipiniana101.blogspot.com/2014/03/list-parts-of- bahay-na-bato.html List Parts of bahay na bato Although retaining the basic form, the 19th-century bahay na bato reflected changing tastes through the incorporation of motifs from the prevalent styles such as Victorian. Neoclassical decorations included columns, pilaster, caryatids, Atlases and friezes adopted from Greek and Roman architecture. The dawn of Art Nouveau era also has a big influence on the mixing of styles and aesthetics of these houses. Many latter Bahay na bato adapted the modernist designs such as Art Deco during Art Deco era and the shortly, Post-War Modernist designs, many of which was only a product of loosely restored Bahay na bato after the war that eventually led to its decline. Style may also vary by area. Each region evolved its own building style, which were in many cases dependent on the materials available. As construction techniques were developed, quarries opened, and kilns constructed, various parts of the country began to show a preference for specific building materials. As a result, Bahay na bato has several variations along ethnic lines. The Bahay na bato in Cebu, for example, differs from the one in Samar. The Ivatans in Batanes, however, have a very different Bahay na bato called Sinadumparan. This house is Native Ivatan architecture in principle, adopted to Philippine' Spanish colonial construction technology. Sinadumparan's main house, Rakuh, is very similar to the traditional Bahay na bato on the mainland. and has a crossbred appearance between Ivatan traditional house'and Bahay na bato from the mainland. Examples of regional variants: left  Metro Manila  Manila, the capital of the Philippines, has one of the most diverse style of Bahay na bato, ranging from the early period of Spanish colonization to the American era. Many were destroyed by World War II. However, the Metro Manila area still has one of the largest concentration of Bahay na Bato houses. Most of the buildings in Manila and Central Luzon were of adobe, a volcanic tuff quarried from the hills which is entirely different from the material of the same name found in Latin America (adobe in those Hispanic countries refers to mud and straw formed into rectangular blocks which are then dried in the sun). The largest, fanciest, and most prestigious companies were eventually established along a nearby street called the Escolta; by the second half of the 19th century this was the most important commercial district in the country. The opening of Manila as a free port encouraged British, Germans, French, and other foreigners to set up businesses on the Escolta and adjacent streets, and the majestic Bahay na Bato buildings were built.

The unique style of the north, commonly in the Ilocos Region, usually bases its design on brick materials, common in Bahay na bato, churches and other constructed buildings, walls, monuments and fortification of the area. Brick was the essential building material in northern Luzon; houses and churches of brick were also built in scattered areas of the Archipelago, all the way down to Jolo, Sulu. Unique designs of the north may include having the facade walls of the second level made up of stone material in many buildings, rather than the more common wooden second level facade. However, it still remains faithful to the Nipa hut principle. These non-wooden (stone) second level facade walls style are also present in some of the Bahay na bato of other regions besides the north, like the 1730 Jesuit house of Cebu in Visayas. The wooden second level facade Bahay na bato are still present in the North. In Vigan, capital of Ilocos Sur, many home owners chose to build both stories in brick, which was available in large quantities. With the massive walls, the volada disappeared in many residences and the kitchen became an extension in stone, with vents piercing the walls to let out smoke.  Calabarzon  Calabarzon is a region with some of the best preserved heritage houses. Towns along the coasts of Luzon, especially to Batangas, used roughly hewn blocks of coral and Adobe stone.

The most famous ones are in the Malolos, in its heritage core where ancestral houses are located. Since adobe lends itself to sculpture, houses in Bulacan had facades decorated with carved flowers, leaves, and religious symbols.  Bicol  Many constructions in the Bicol peninsula took advantage of the abundant volcanic stone.

Cebu, Bohol, Negros and Iloilo are famous for their Bahay na bato houses. Throughout the Visayas, the craft of cutting stone or coral was virtually elevated into a fine art, with blocks fitting so precisely into each other that not even a razor blade could be inserted between blocks. The material was so durable that it did not have to be protected with a layer of paletada. This art was brought by the Visayan settlers to the coastal towns of Mindanao.  Batanes  Ivatan people of Batanes have a very different style of Bahay na bato. They are called Sinadumparan. As the islands of Batanes was absorbed to the colonial nation the Philippines much later through Spanish conquest, the Sinadumparan was developed much laters as well. Combining Pre-colonial Ivatan style and Colonial Filipino style (Bahay na bato). Sinadumpraran house has two buildings; One is kitchen and Another is the living area building called Rakuh. The Filipino colonial style (Bahay na bato) influence is very evident in the Rakuh building.  Other buildings  Many convents, monasteries, schools, hospitals, offices, stations, etc. also adapted the Bahay Kubo architecture to the Spanish colonial style. As a result, many of these buildings ends up being a Bahay na bato as well, with very few differences such as size and proportion.

He was first Telugu scholar to translate Sanskrit version of Valmiki Ramayana into Telugu.Lal, Mohan (1992) Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature--Sasay to Zorgot. Subbarao, Vavilikolanu pp.4186-87. Sahitya Academy. New Delhi. His translation of Sanskrit version of Valmiki Ramayana into Telugu was entitled as \\"Mandaram\\". Early life Vavilikolanu Subbarao born on 23 January 1863 at Jammalamadugu, Kadapa in Andhra pradesh. His parents were Ramachandrarao and Kanakamamba. He married Ranganayakamma. They belonged to Golconda vyapari sect of Brahmins. He joined the revenue department as a revenue inspector and later got promotion as acting Tehsildar during 1883 to 1900.Sri Vasu Daasa Desika Vaibhavamu--Sri Vaasudaasa Swamivaari Jeevita Charitra. 1981.Mettapalli Sitapati Dasudu.p.46. Sri Kodandarama Sevaka Dharma Samajam, Dasakuti, Angalakuduru. Tenali.Andhra Pradesh. However, during his service in revenue department, he contracted tuberculosis and resigned from job. Between 1900 and 1904, Subba Rao stayed at Nellore. From here he has published a small magazine called Bharati. In 1904 he joined Madras Presidency College as Lecturer or Pandit in Telugu for teaching Telugu literature. Language Movements Vavilikolanu Subba Rao also regularly participated in Avadhana programmes. He had written a Telugu grammar book- Vyakarana Sarvaswam in three volumes.Sri Vasu Daasa Desika Vaibhavamu-- Sri Vaasudaasa Swamivaari Jeevita Charitra. 1981.Mettapalli Sitapathi Dasudu. pp 51-51. Sri Kodandarama Sevaka Dharma Samajam, Dasakuti, Angalakuduru. Tenali.Andhra Pradesh. He had also written Bhagavad Gita in Dwipada verse for easy and better understanding of laymen as well as students. He also wrote a series of books--Baalahita Charya, Kumarahita Charya, Patihita Charya, Kumarihita Charya, Satihita Charya, Garbhinihita Charya as a commentary on the morality and ethics of the-then society and contained his suggested improvements.Sri Vasu Daasa Desika Vaibhavamu--Sri Vaasudaasa Swamivaari Jeevita Charitra. 1981.Mettapalli Sitapati Dasudu.p.74-76. Sri Kodandarama Sevaka Dharma Samajam, Dasakuti, Angalakuduru. Tenali.Andhra Pradesh. Ramayanam Vavilikolanu Subba Rao has commenced translating the Valmiki Ramayana in 1902 and completed it by 1908. He intended to dedicate his translation of Valmiki Ramayana to Lord Rama of Vontimitta temple. Narayana Rao says that Andhra Valmiki's Ramayana (Mandaram) was a verse to verse true translation of Valmiki Ramayana in Sanskrit. In the words of Vavilikolanu Subba Rao, it is a yadha--valmika--ramayanamu‚Äîa Ramayana strictly according to Valmiki. Narayana Rao further says that in keeping with the popular belief that Valmiki's text of Ramayana has powerful mantric syllables embedded in it, Subba Rao attempted to bring similar mantric syllables into his Telugu text. Mettapalli Sitapati Dasudu's statement in Sri Vasudasadesika Vaibhavamu supports this view. Sitapati Dasudu has also mentioned that it was at the instance of Kottapalli Padmanabha Sastri that Subba Rao set off on the course of rendering a true translation, verse by verse, of Sanskrit Ramayana written by Valmiki. Subba Rao supplemented his translation with an elaborate multi- volume commentary. Mandaram has become an important literary magnum opus in the history of Telugu literature. Ram Temple at Vontimitta After retiring from his teaching job at Chennai in 1920, he moved back to Vontimitta following a dream he saw while at a choultry in Ghatikachalam to renovate a Lord Ram temple at Vontimitta .Sri Vasu Daasa Desika Vaibhavamu--Sri Vaasudaasa Swamivaari Jeevita Charitra. 1981.Mettapalli Sitapathi Dasudu. pp93-96.

Born in the village of Poropora in north Choiseul Island, Qilanoba completed her primary education at the Girls' Boarding School in Sasamungga, arriving there in 1948 after having it interrupted by World War II. She became a leader among her fellow students at the school, and took positions in the maternity ward, medical clinic, and nursery, allowing her to develop skills as a nurse and midwife and leading her to accompany medical field trips around the island. She also taught for several years at the same school. By the end of her education she had reached Standard 7, the only girl at the school to do so.Money, Lucy H., 'Ilula (Ula) Qianoba: First Solomons Deaconess', in Alan Leadley (ed.), Ever Widening Circles: Stories of Some Influential Methodist Leaders in Solomon Islands and Bougainville/Buka, Wesley Historical Society (New Zealand), Auckland, 2002d, pp. 55‚Äì56. When the Methodist Church decided to form an order of deaconesses in the Solomon Islands in 1963, Qilanoba was the first applicant. After training for a year she completed her probation at Kokeqolo and was sent first to Roviana and then to Simbo, later joining the Mono Circuit and working for a year under the Order of St. Stephen. She returned to Choiseul when a minister for Mono became available. She was then sent to Lale on Ranonga before being sent back to her home island once again, this time as catechist, with the authority to administer the sacraments, given by the church, and to conduct marriages, given by the government. More active than her male counterparts, she would often paddle long distances to isolated areas; unusually for a Choiseul woman she was a competent canoeist, and many men deferred to her authority. Upon her retirement Qilanoba returned to the village of her birth. She remained active as a community volunteer until her death, having suffered from poor health in the last years of her life.

It is based on Cura√ßaoan author Frank Martinus Arion's internationally acclaimed Dutch- language novel Dubbelspel. The title Double Play refers to a move in dominoes where a player can play a final domino on either end of the snake, earning that team double points. Plot Ostrik, now a grown man working as a doctor in the Netherlands, returns to his childhood home on the island of Cura√ßao and recalls his experiences with his family and neighbors there during a time of colonial unrest in the 1970s. Each Sunday his father Bubu would play dominoes with his friends while discussing a variety of issues as Ostrik would observe. After chasing bus drivers away from an important location for taxi cabs, Bubu becomes the likely choice for president of a newly formed taxi cab union. That Sunday the union meeting for the election is scheduled to be held at his house but the drivers witness Bubu experiencing a day-long losing streak at dominoes and they begin to lose confidence in him until he gives a rousing speech about revolution. Before he has the opportunity to become president, he gets into a fight with the man his wife is sleeping with and loses his life. Ostrik returns years later to confront his father's killer over a game of dominoes.

The album was released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label, Artemisia Records. The album was produced collaboratively with Randall Dunn and recorded primarily in their own recording studio Owl Lodge in Olympia, Washington, which the Weaver brothers built themselves, with the drums recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle. Thrice Woven received generally favourable reviews from music critics upon its release.  Background  Thrice Woven is the first black metal album by Wolves in the Throne Room since 2011's Celestial Lineage, which the band consider the final chapter in a trilogy of albums comprising Two Hunters, Black Cascade, and Celestial Lineage. The band regard their 2014 ambient album Celestite as being a companion piece to Celestial Lineage, rather than a successor, and have also stated categorically that Thrice Woven is not connected with the previous records; as a result, Thrice Woven can be considered the band's first 'true' album since 2011. It is also the first album recorded almost entirely in the band's home studio Owl Lodge, and is their first album to feature new permanent band-member Kody Keyworth on guitars and vocals.  Recording, production  The album was recorded almost entirely at the band's home studio, Owl Lodge, in Olympia, Washington. The band recorded the drums at Litho Studio in Seattle with Jack Shirley. According to Aaron Weaver, \\"Once we finished the drums, we brought the sessions back to our studio in Olympia, Randall Dunn showed up and we kind of made a plan on how to put the record together.\\" He also explained that \\"Me and Nathan would work by ourselves, tracking guitars, synthesizers, whatever then Randall would show up and kind of check it out and give suggestions. He tracked a lot of stuff too ‚Äî he always plays a little bit of synthesizer on our records. Once all the tracking was wrapped up, we met up with Randall again in Seattle and mixed at Avast! Studio\\". In a separate interview, Aaron Weaver explained that \\"About halfway through recording, we realized it was time to invite Kody Keyworth to be a full member of the band. He'd been playing guitar on the road with us for six years. As we were recording Thrice Woven, we just realized that Kody's got to be on this record ‚Äî he's a part of this band from now on.\\" As a result, Keyworth \\"added flavor to Thrice Woven but was uninvolved in the initial work on these songs.\\"  Musical style, writing  Thrice Woven has been described as significantly more aggressive and traditionally black metal than many of the band's previous albums, and both critics and the band themselves have noted the role of new guitarist Kody Keyworth in the album's sound. NPR Music wrote that the album's opening track \\"recalls the WITTR of Two Hunters and Black Cascade, but is immediately bolder, with a newfound ferocity that feels untethered to the past.\\" Decibel noted that the album \\"is defined in a good deal of traditionalism, specifically second-wave black metal traditionalism.\\" AllMusic's Thom Jurek likewise noted that \\"Thrice Woven re-engages with blackness, full signature riffs, epic tunes, and tales of pagan nature worship that established Wolves in the Throne Room's identity. This is a return to the pummeling, multi- layered power that made 2009's Black Cascade a masterpiece.\\"  Release, promotion, marketing  Wolves in the Throne Room announced the initial details (including the track listing, release date, and album cover) of Thrice Woven on June 28, 2017, along with a brief teaser trailer. On July 17, the band premiered their first ever music video for the song \\"Born from the Serpent's Eye\\", featuring the first half of the nearly 10-minute piece. According to the band, \\"We lit a bonfire and blasted through the first third of our song Born From The Serpent‚Äôs Eye. [sic] This is the first time we‚Äôd played the song with new guitarist Kody Keyworth and it fucking slayed. Peter and Nico captured the magic. May the good fires blaze!‚Äù On August 21 the band premiered the song \\"Angrboda\\" in full as part of Adult Swim's Singles 2017 series. On September 11, they also premiered the song \\"Mother Owl, Father Ocean\\" as a companion piece to the previously released \\"Angrboda\\". The album was officially released on September 22, 2017 through the band's own record label Artemisia Records.  Touring  The band have announced they will tour the United States throughout Fall 2017 with Pillorian from September 29 to October 25. They have also announced a European tour from November 15 to December 15, 2017 with support from Aluk Todolo and Wiegedood.  Critical reception  Thrice Woven was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Critics generally noted the considerably more aggressive and traditionally black metal approach of the album, particularly compared to the band's previous records. The A.V. Club wrote that \\"Not since acclaimed debut Diadem Of 12 Stars has Wolves In The Throne Room rocked this hard and steady; in its sustained racket, it approximates one of the band‚Äôs live shows, which tend to be all blistering blitzkrieg all the time, drone passages withheld\\", but noting that \\"this being a WITTR record, the fury comes in crashing waves, emerging monstrously from stretches of placid calm\\" Decibel named the album 'Best New Noise' and praised Thrice Woven as \\"a return to the glories of old\\", highlighting the strength of the songwriting in particular.

Mar√≠a G. \\"Chata\\" Sada (December 5, 1884 - July 13, 1973) was a Mexican-American businesswoman, informal educator and midwife in Boquillas Canyon. Sada ran the last store and restaurant in the Boquillas area, \\"Chata's Place\\" between 1901 and 1936. Eventually the land it stood on became part of the Big Bend National Park.  Biography  The Sada family in front of Chata's restaurant at left Sada was born in Iraxuato, Guanajuato. \\"Chata\\" is a nickname meaning \\"flat nose\\" or \\"cute.\\" She was raised in the Big Bend area of Mexico. Sada and Juan Sada moved to the Boquillas area in the 1880s and got married in 1901. The couple never had children, but adopted and fostered many children who needed homes. None of the children the Sadas raised were officially adopted, but were cared and look after according to Mexican custom. After securing a permanent visa, she moved to the Texas side of the Rio Grande where she and her husband built an adobe house that became a general store and cafe. Sada was in charge of the business, known as \\"Chata's Place,\\" because her husband ran a silver mine in Coahuila. In order to improve business, Sada learned English so she could better serve various people who came to Big Bend. Sada even cashed checks for her customers and kept beer cold in a \\"kerosene-powered refrigerator.\\" Visitors to the area could lodge at Chata's Place. She also prepared food for travelers. Sada was considered an excellent shot, and had protected her livestock from mountain lions and rattlesnakes. In addition to running the store and restaurant, she also started teaching and acting as the local midwife for people in both Texas and Mexico starting in the 1920s. In the late 1930s, Sada and her husband had the only store in Boquillas. Juan Sada died on December 24, 1936 and eventually Maria Sada closed down the business and moved to Del Rio a few months after. After she left, Big Bend National Park removed Chata's Place. In Del Rio, Sada lived with one of her sons. On July 7, 1960, she was invited to a ceremony at Big Bend National Park where she was greeted and remembered by the community. Sada died on July 13, 1973. Funeral rites were held on July 15 at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Del Rio.

Participants were expected from 11 countries in Southeast Asia. The games, patterned after the Paralympics, was to include athletes with various disabilities. This was supposed to be the second time Philippines hosted the ASEAN Para Games with the first being in 2005. The Games was initially set to be held in January 2020 but was rescheduled to March 2020, about three months after the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, due to financial and logistical constraints despite it is only five months prior to the 2020 Summer Paralympics. The sporting event was postponed for a second time, to October 3 to 9, 2020, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The Summer Paralympics was delayed to the following year for the same reason. The Games were formally canceled on May 8, after the Philippine government reallocated funds meant for the games to efforts against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines or indefinitely. Development Host selection It is customary for the host nation of the Southeast Asian Games to also host the ASEAN Para Games within the same year. In July 2012, Brunei was initially selected to host the 30th Southeast Asian Games; consequentially the 10th ASEAN Para Games. However, on 4 June 2015, Brunei withdrew its hosting rights to the Games due to absence of government support. The withdrawal of Brunei's hosting rights were also due to the country's lack of sporting facilities, accommodation, and preparation of their athletes. With Brunei's withdrawal, the Philippines and Thailand expressed its interest to host the games. Vietnam, the 2021 Southeast Asian Games host, was also offered to host the 2019 SEA Games, but declined. The Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) in July 2017 announced that the Philippines will be hosting the Games. However within the same month, the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) addressed the POC that it is withdrawing its support for the Philippine hosting of the 2019 Games, saying that government decided to reallocate funds meant for hosting to the rehabilitation efforts of Marawi, which was left devastated following the Battle of Marawi. It was later reported that the POC's insistence on handling all matters of the hosting; finance, security and the conduct of the Games as it did for the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, which led to the withdrawal of support by the PSC. However, on August 16, the Philippines, through the POC president Peping Cojuangco, confirmed that the country will hosting the 2019 SEA Games, after Cojuangco wrote to President Rodrigo Duterte and appealed for reconsideration. During the closing ceremony of the 2017 ASEAN Para Games in Kuala Lumpur, the symbolic ASEAN Para Sports Federation council flag was handed over by Malaysian Paralympic Council President SM Nasarudin SM Nasimuddin to the Paralympic Committee of the Philippines (PPC) president Michael I. Barredo. In contrast of other closing ceremonies held throughout the ASEAN Para Games, only a video promoting tourism and featured disabled athletes in the Philippines was presented instead of a grand presentation for the next host country. Preparations Officials of the ASEAN Para Sports Federation make a ceremonial toast to mark the one year countdown for the Games. Preparations for the Philippines' hosting of the 10th ASEAN Para Games officially began by April 2018. Then-Secretary of Foreign Affairs Alan Peter Cayetano is serving as the chairman of the 10th ASEAN Para Games organizing committee. The official one-year countdown for the 2020 ASEAN Para Games was held at the Novotel Manila Araneta Center in Quezon City on January 18, 2019; exactly one year before the scheduled opening of the games. Delays and cancellation Due to financial and logistical constraints the games were rescheduled for March 20 to 28, 2020. Malaysia formally protested the move, saying that postponing the games, affected their preparations for the competition including concerns over bookings for members of their delegation. The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) expressed that an undisclosed amount of television broadcast revenue from the 2019 Southeast Asian Games should be used to fund the hosting of the ASEAN Para Games. In February, the 2020 ASEAN Para Games was postponed for the second time, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially planned that the games be held sometime between March to June before it was tentatively scheduled for October 3 to 9, 2020. However the PSC on April 29 withdrew funding for the Games following a directive from the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases to defer sporting events in the Philippines until December 2020 and the government's call to redirect resources to deal with the pandemic. The ASEAN Para Sports Federation announced on May 8, the formal cancellation of the 2020 ASEAN Para Games. Venues Just like the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, the 2020 ASEAN Para Games was to be hosted in three hubs in Clark, Manila, and Subic The opening and closing ceremonies were planned to be held in Clark. Under the pretense that the games were to host 17 sports including a demonstration event; nine sports will be held at venues at the New Clark City and the Clark Freeport Zone, six sports at the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, tenpin bowling at the Santa Lucia Lanes in Cainta, Rizal and obstacle course at the SM Aura at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, Metro Manila. The Games Participating nations All 11 members of ASEAN Para Sports Federation (APSF) were expected to take part in the 2020 ASEAN para Games. Prior to the postponement of the games to March 2020, about 1,500 athletes are expected to participate with Thailand sending the biggest delegation. Below is a list of all expected participating NPCs.   Sports The ASEAN Para Sports Federation hosted a meeting at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, Metro Manila from June 8 to 9 which was to determine which sports are to be contested in the 2020 Para Games. The organizers had initial plans to host 14 sports. There were additional plans to host four more sports namely: 7-a-side (cerebral palsy) football, triathlon, wheelchair tennis and shooting By January 24, the host was targeting to organize around 500 events covering 16 sports and a demonstration event. * 20px Archery * 20px Athletics * 20px Badminton * 20px Boccia * 20px Bowling * 20px Chess * 20px Cycling * 20px 7-a-side CP Football * 20px Goalball * 20px Judo * 20px Powerlifting * 20px Sitting volleyball * 20px Swimming * 20px Table tennis * 20px Triathlon * 20px Wheelchair basketball * 20px Wheelchair volleyball * Wheelchair tennis ;Demonstration sports * 20px Obstacle racing See also *2005 ASEAN Para Games * 2019 Southeast Asian Games References ASEAN Para Games ASEAN Para Games 2020 ASEAN Para Games 2020 ASEAN Para Games 2020 ASEAN Para Games ","title":"2020 ASEAN Para Games"},{"id":"55325685","text":"Callanafersy is a stone ringfort (cashel) and National Monument located in County Kerry, Ireland.

Starting July 19, white men, many in the United States Army, United States Navy, and United States Marine Corps, responded to the rumored arrest of a black man for rape of a white woman with four days of mob violence against black individuals and businesses. They rioted, randomly beat black people on the street, and pulled others off streetcars for attacks. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. The city closed saloons and theaters to discourage assemblies. Meanwhile, the four white-owned local papers, including the Washington Post, fanned the violence with incendiary headlines and calling in at least one instance for mobilization of a \\"clean-up\\" operation. After four days of police inaction, President Woodrow Wilson ordered 2,000 federal troops to regain control in the nation's capital. But a violent summer rainstorm had more of a dampening effect. When the violence ended, 15 people had died: at least 10 white people, including two police officersODMP Memorials Wilson and Halbfinger; and around 5 black people. Fifty people were seriously wounded and another 100 less severely wounded. It was one of the few times in 20th-century riots of whites against blacks that white fatalities outnumbered those of black people. The unrest was also one of the Red Summer riots in America. Background Washington D.C. had evolved as one of the places in the United States where a significant number of successful African-Americans were living, with a particular concentration in the Le Droit Park area, near Howard University. This area had originally been segregated as a White-only zone, but students from Howard University had torn down the gates as part of a wider initiative to desegregate the suburb in 1888. The city as a whole was 75% composed of White Americans. To this racial mix newspaper publisher Ned McLean sought to undermine city authorities by publishing real or imagined crimes and \\"no crime was as salacious as a black attack on a white woman.\\" The white population were outraged by reports of black crime and during the summer of 1919 large mobs roamed streets attacking Black residents. The riot 1st night, July 19 Members of the U.S. 3rd Cavalry sent to quell rioting in D.C. in July 21, 1919 The race riot started on Saturday July 19 following an incident involving two African-American men and Elsie Stephnick, the white wife of an employee of the United States Naval Aviation Department. She was \\"jostled\\" near New York Avenue, and 15th Street Northwest. One of the men was arrested and questioned concerning an alleged sexual assault, but subsequently released. The preceding weeks had seen a sensationalist newspaper campaign concerning the alleged sexual crimes of a \\"negro fiend\\", which contributed to the violence of the succeeding events. A mob of White Americans formed and started attacks on several African Americans and also an African-American family home. 3rd day, Monday July 21 Alarmed by the press calling for armed intervention to crush the black population the city's black community groups spent $14,000 ($ in ) on guns and ammunition in order to defend themselves. Many blacks gathered with guns they had purchased from pawn shops or military rifles black soldiers had brought home from WWI, to make a stand at around Seventh and U streets, the black district in the capital‚Äôs northwest. There sharpshooters shot at targets while perched on the roof of the Howard Theatre. Many black citizens took to their cars cruising the streets and shooting up white targets. One vehicle driven by Thomas Armstead and five other passengers cruised north along 7th Street, guns blazing. Near M Street, they shot a police horse, hit the hat off a cop's head before being stopped by a group of police. Armstead and another passenger, 18-year-old Jane Gore, were shot dead, their companions escaped. 4th day, July 22 A 17-year-old black girl, Carrie Johnson, shot at white mobs from her New York Avenue window. Police raided her home and she fatally shot a white policeman, Detective Harry Wilson and claimed self-defense. A bullet caught her in the thigh and her father, Ben Johnson, was shot in the shoulder. She was arrested and charged with the shooting. In January 1921 a trial was finally heard, U.S. v. Carrie Johnson. Her father did not testify, but the prosecutor announced in front of the jury that charges against Ben Johnson had been dropped, implying that Carrie Johnson must have committed the crime. She was convicted of manslaughter, but a separate judge accepted the self-defense argument and overturned the verdict. To avoid a second trial all charges were dropped and Carrie Johnson went free on June 21, 1921. Aftermath The NAACP sent a telegram of protest to President Woodrow Wilson:New York Times: \\"Protest Sent to Wilson,\\" July 22, 1919. Retrieved January 21, 2010. November Park Riot On November 1, 1919, Albert Valentine Connors, 1014 Pennsylvania avenue southeast, a park policeman, was assaulted by a crowd of African- Americans in an alley near Seventh and K streets southeast, shortly afternoon. Connors was making an arrest when he was mobbed by the large crowd. After being stabbed and beaten he was able to call for more police and the crowd dispersed.

He won the title in his first year on the PBR Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) elite tour. He finished the 2009 season unridden with a bull score average over 46 points out of a maximum of 50, considered an exceptional score in bull riding. According to many notable sources and his career statistics, Code Blue had enormous potential, but a serious injury in the 2010 season cut his career short and his owners were forced to retire him.  Background  Code Blue was born April 4, 2004 near Gladewater, Texas, bred by Jones Farms. Alvin Jones, who is with Jones Rodeo Genetics, had a hand in determining the genetics that went into producing this world champion bull. He is a yellowish colored bull. He weighed between and was when he was competing as a bucking bull. He is co-owned by North Carolina stock contractors WW Bucking Bulls and Mandan, North Dakota, stock contractors Berger & Struve. WW Bucking Bulls is owned by business partners Rick Wagoner and Jimmy Walton. Berger & Struve is the partnership of Chad Berger and Clay Struve. Berger & Struve bought a half interest in the bull at the beginning of the 2009 season. Code Blue's sire was #240 Sky King. Sky King was a Don Kish- owned bull selected to buck at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in 1997. He was also a PBR World Finals bull. Code Blue's paternal grandsire was Kish's Buckin' Best #624 Wolfman. Wolfman was a Don Kish bull who was ridden by Wade Leslie for the only perfect 100 point combined rider and bull score ever awarded on the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association (PRCA) circuit. Wolfman also garnered several awards on account of his many qualifications to the NFR. Code Blues's maternal granddam was a #G79 Red Rocker daughter referred to as JG #20. Red Rocker is a seven-time NFR qualifier whose pedigree is sparse. His pedigree also contained a line to the champion bull Bodacious. He is also brother to the bull Apollo, who is also related to Bodacious and is the Championship Bull Riding (CBR) 2007 Bull of the Finals. Code Blue's home base was with Wagoner on his Silver Valley Ranch in Silver Valley, North Carolina, which Wagoner had been running for over 20 years at the time of Code Blue's competition days. Wagoner made adjustments to his life for Code Blue, mostly to travel around the country - bulls used for competition need time out of the trailer to relax and exercise, thus doubling the time necessary to get to their destination. Wagoner's partner, Walton, lives in Lexington, North Carolina. After Code Blue became a notable bull on the PBR circuit, his owners spoiled him. The bull typically consumed about of grain per day when he was competing. Along with his regular grain, they fed him waffles. He was kept in an enclosed area for feeding with an ample running area, as well as an area for resting and lying down that they labeled his \\"lounge\\". The bull developed a personality quirk on account of the transport trailer being parked next to his pen. If the trailer left, he wanted to be on it. They made sure to always have another trailer to take its place if he was not scheduled to go to an event. Otherwise, he got upset.  Career  Code Blue's owners first entered him in events sanctioned by the Professional Bucking Bull Association (PBBA). Code Blue finished his tour in the PBBA as the No. 5 ranked bull in the world. Code Blue then competed in the PBR for three years: from 2008‚Äì2010. For two years, he competed in the elite tour of the PBR, the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS): 2009 and 2010.  Early years  In 2006, Rick Wagoner was fighting an \\"uphill battle\\" to purchase Code Blue, who he considered to have great potential. The bull had excellent bloodlines, and he was considered very rank (difficult to ride) for a two-year-old. The bull's owner was an Oklahoma doctor who was averse to selling the young bull. However, when the doctor's wife developed health problems, he offered the bull for sale, but insisted that Wagoner purchase additional cattle. Wagoner, an experienced bull owner from North Carolina, was not deterred, even though doing so would strain his finances. Many of their family and friends thought they were crazy at the time, but their opinions soon reversed. Since the purchase of Code Blue was risky and involved the purchase of additional cattle, making the total purchase price more than Wagoner had in his bank account, Wagoner called in his friend Jimmy Walton to partner with him. Walton was not yet in the bucking bull business but had been considering it, and accompanied Wagoner to Oklahoma City. Upon seeing him, that cinched it; they absolutely wanted the bull. This was true even though Code Blue had been jerking bull riders down on his head, which he continued to do for the next year and a half. No bull rider could last more than two seconds. The bull had yet to have a rider on his back long enough to start spinning. The other cattle were a mixture of about 18-20 bulls, cows, and calves, which totaled roughly enough cattle to fill a semi- trailer. By the time they finalized the purchase of Code Blue, he had been bucked about 30 times. They ran Code Blue on the PBBA, which was convenient, since it conducted events in North Carolina. Code Blue worked his way up on the smaller circuit until he developed enough of a reputation to join the PBR in 2008. Walton believed that part of the bull's success was because he enjoyed his job. He seemed to deliberately change his bucking style when he went out, and bull riders were having a hard time figuring out his patterns. Wagoner had a difficult time convincing Cody Lambert, Director of Livestock, to give his bull, Code Blue, a shot in the PBR. Lambert had never heard of Wagoner or the bull, and was unimpressed by the video Wagoner sent him. Wagoner just talked about the bull until he convinced Lambert no one could ride him. \\"They didn't send me a good video of (Code Blue), but at least Rick was so convinced that they weren't going to ride him that he talked me into using him at Winston-Salem last year.\\"  2009 season  Code Blue debuted on the BFTS in January 2009 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He spent the first weekend bucking off two cowboys: Cody Campbell in Round 1, and Jared Farley in Round 2. At subsequent rodeos, he bucked off Renato Nunes three times and Ryan Dirteater twice. He also bucked off Ryan McConnel, Sean Willingham, Skeeter Kingsolver, and Edimundo Gomes one time each. At the end of September, PBR Livestock Director Cody Lambert started talking about the choice of world champion bull contenders. The contenders are selected by a vote of the top bull riders. The five bulls with the most votes become the contenders. Those contenders compete in the PBR BFTS World Finals, and the one with the highest cumulative score is named the World Champion Bull. Lambert included Code Blue in his list of probable candidates, as well as former champions Bones and Chicken on a Chain. He also mentioned Big Tex, Voodoo Child, Spitfire, and Uncle Buck (formerly I'm A Gangster). Lambert was not impressed with Code Blue initially. However, he noticed that \\"He always shows up and bucks the tops guys off.\\" On October 22, 2009, the world champion bull contenders were officially announced. The PBR decided to change their usual procedure and selected ten bulls instead of five for the first time. One of the bulls was selected by fan vote, which was also a first. Eight bulls were selected by a vote of the top 40 bull riders, and one bull was selected by Lambert. The PBR announced that the ten finalists were Big Tex, Black Pearl, 2008 winner Bones, 2007 winner Chicken on a Chain, Code Blue, Crosswired, Uncle Buck, Major Payne, Troubadour, and Voodoo Child. = PBR World Finals = On October 31, on Saturday night at the PBR World Finals eight of the ten world champion bull contenders competed. Two were out during this performance. Code Blue took the lead in the competition by bucking off Edimundo Gomes after 5.20 seconds and scoring 46.76 points. Voodoo Child tied with Big Tex for second when they each scored 46 points. Bones, the previous world champion, was ridden by Pete Farley for 93.25 points and scored 45.75 points to come in fourth and other bulls competed to end the second performance of the night. Code Blue \\"stole the show\\" that evening. He improved his BFTS record to 12-0. For 11 of his 12 outs that season, his score had been 46 points or higher. One of his co-owners, Wagoner, commented that the bull always does something different in each out. \\"He always puts in 110 percent effort and loves it.\\" On November 1, Sunday night, which was Championship Night, the championship races finished up. With the title at stake during the PBR World Finals, Code Blue bucked off Meier that night as his third buckoff to win the championship. In total he bucked off Edimundo Gomes for 46.75 points, Cody Nance for 46.50 points, and Austin Meier for 47.50 points during the two-day championship rounds on Saturday and Sunday. He clinched the title with a three-ride aggregate tally of 140.75 points. He had the highest aggregate score of the world champion bull contenders who had each competed in three rounds. Code Blue beat out second place finisher Voodoo Child, with an aggregate score of 139.5, by 1.25 points. Big Tex followed at third place with an aggregate score of 138.75. Lambert said that Code Blue had been the best bull throughout the season. Nance selected Code Blue in the Round 5 draft because he believed he had the \\"right combination to crack his code\\", but only lasted 4.3 seconds. Code Blue received a bull score of 45.5. The bull's other two scores were 46.75 and 47.5, for a three-ride aggregate of 140.75. Nance made it clear he felt Code Blue had all the skills it takes to be a world champion bull. = Season summary = Code Blue stayed unridden throughout his entire first season on the BFTS. He finished his season with a 14-0 record against the bull riders. His career outs at all levels for 2009 is 17-0 with a BFTS score average of 46.23. He has a career average buckoff time of 4.41 seconds. Counting trips out of the bucking chute (\\"outs\\") that occurred before he joined the PBR circuit, he bucked off riders 52 straight times by the end of 2009, and his owners believe that was unprecedented. Wagoner was highly optimistic about his bull. \\"Riders have said all year they are going to ride him, but nobody has yet. The bull doesn't have a set pattern, and the riders are having trouble figuring him out.\\" J.B. Mauney finished No. 2 in the world the last two years, and he's (Code Blue) thrown J.B. off two times. He's going to come and he's going to buck. He'll never let you down. He'll buck 110 percent and he loves it\\". Code Blue's unridden streak also garnered him the respect of PBR World Champion Bull Rider Michael Gaffney. \\"He's very athletic, and he has all of the attributes of a rank bucking bull,\\" Gaffney said. \\"He leaves (the chute) really hard and he leaves there with a lot of authority\\". Chad Berger, one of the bull's co-owners, was pleasantly surprised Code Blue went the entire 2009 season without being ridden, but commented that the bull hasn't \\"had a bad day\\". He noted that riders like Renato Nunes or Chris Shivers, who fit his bucking style, were just unable to ride him because he burst forward to get the rider leaning back and then would snap them off. PBR co-founder and PRCA World Champion Ty Murray evaluated the bull as the \\"total package\\" to compete for the championship, explaining that \\"he's big. He's strong. He's stout and he's smart. He jumps high, kicks hard, spins fast.\\" Lambert compared Code Blue to Kody Lostroh and J. B. Mauney, then the No. 1 and 2 ranked bull riders, due to his competitiveness. Dave Fournier, another PBR co-founder, became impressed with the bull after seeing him toss Edimundo Gomes on October 31. He agreed with Lambert's assessment and said \\"he was the real deal.\\"  2010 season  Wagoner intended to enter Code Blue in around 15 events for the 2010 season. He had taken into consideration travel time in his planning as time on the road takes a toll on a bull's energy. The bull had also been used for breeding the previous year and had five calves on the ground. On January 10, 2010, Friday evening, at the New York City Invitational in Madison Square Garden, in Round 1, Code Blue bucked off Austin Meier. On Sunday in the Championship Round, J.B. Mauney finally became the first bull rider to score a qualified ride on Code Blue. Mauney rode Code Blue in the BFTS Championship Round for 76.25 points. The ride was ugly: Mauney's leg apparently got caught in his bull rope, which could have caused a serious accident. Mauney was able to stay on the bull for the requisite time, but earned a \\"subpar\\" score. On January 31, 2010, at the Tampa Invitational, in the championship round, rookie Fabiano Viera was bucked off by Code Blue. The Brazilian unintentionally picked the bull, due to speaking almost no English and not having prepared which bull to pick for the round. In February, Valdiron de Oliveira rode Code Blue for 4.5 seconds at Dallas Cowboys Stadium at the first-ever Iron Cowboy event, to win $260,000. The Iron Cowboy event is one where the bull riding competitors advance if they make it to the 8-second buzzer, while those who do not are out until there is only one rider left. At the end, the winner is determined by who rides for the most seconds. Just before Valdiron rode, Travis Briscoe was in first place with a ride of 3.6 seconds. In March 2010, Code Blue bucked off Vince Northrop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for 46.75 points. In April 2010, Code Blue bucked off Billy Robinson in New Orleans, Louisiana, earning 45.50 points. Trouble occurred shortly after when Code Blue apparently injured himself coming off a truck. In June, Chad Berger confirmed that Code Blue had been held out of a Touring Pro competition in Bismarck, North Dakota, due to worries of a pinched nerve in his back, which negatively impacted his balance. Berger added that the bull was going to be examined by a veterinarian and a chiropractor to see if something was out of alignment and pinching a nerve. On August 21, 2010, Code Blue made his return to the BFTS at the Memphis Invitational in Nashville, Tennessee, after his injury four months ago in June, which laid him up. He bucked off Sevi Torturo with a bull score of 45.25 points. Then on August 21, 2010, at the Memphis Invitational, Mauney scored a second qualified ride from Code Blue for 85 points. After Mauney dismounted, the bull bucked one extra time. But then, while trying to turn left toward the gate his back legs could not support him. He fell down once before walking the alleyway. His owners managed to load him onto their trailer and left the parking area immediately. Walton phoned in about an hour later to explain that \\"We know he‚Äôs hurt. We just don‚Äôt know how bad\\". They were trying to decide when to call a vet in. On August 22, according to Wagoner, Code Blue remained relaxed on the trailer during the 11-hour ride home from Memphis to North Carolina. He said they did not yet have a definitive diagnosis: in the arena it appeared to be a problem with his legs in the arena, but once on the trailer it appeared to be his hip. The vet said the bull's ability to swing his tail indicated that the issue was more likely nerve rather than bone-related. On Monday, August 23, Code Blue's vet examined him. Dr. Truman Sanner's prognosis was not encouraging regarding future bucking. \\"Guarded,\\" said Sanner. \\"It'll be tough for him. I wouldn't want him to return to bucking, but that's not what Rick wants to hear.\\" The vet \\"observed bilateral high limb weakness\\" and left open the possibility for nerve damage, alongside other potential diagnoses such as spinal damage affecting nerve impulses. However, he added, \\"There are a million reasons that could have happened. That's one you'll never know, but you can't rule out he hurt himself bucking.\\" Code Blue's record that year to date was 13 outs and two qualified rides, both by Mauney. On August 28, Lambert announced his take on Code Blue's status. He mentioned the bull's last out with Mauney, stating it was a \\"decent out\\", but then adding it wasn't the Code Blue of 2009 given that he was \\"obviously hurt\\". He then went on to say that he had talked with the bull's vet, Sanner. \\"The vet in North Carolina [who examined Code Blue] has actually called me and told me the problem,\\" said Lambert. \\"He's a great bull, had a great career, but as far as I'm concerned, it's over\\". He indicated the bull should be employed only in breeding.  Career summary  Code Blue was the PBR BFTS World Champion Bull in 2009, his first year on that elite tour. He was ridden only twice in 27 career outs on the BFTS tour. He was ridden only twice in 33 outs at all levels of competition on the PBR. He has a career average bull score of 45.81 points. The two times he was ridden were by Mauney in 2010. He holds a 93.94% buckoff percentage. His rank in the BFTS all time ranking is 9th. His rank in the historical ranking is 31st. His rating in the ProBullStats Power Rating is 93.23 percent which puts him in 12th position. Current PBR bull Sky Harbor is a grandson of Code Blue, being the son of a Code Blue heifer and PBR star Pearl Harbor.  Retirement  Code Blue was retired on account of his 2010 injury. He was not able to compete at the 2010 World Finals and defend his title. In March 2018, stock contractor Chad Berger acquired the 3 year-old-bull Sky Harbor from T-Ray Bulls and Paradigm Bull Company. He is the son of PBR Brand of Honor bull Pearl Harbor. He is also the grandson of three-time PBR World Finals qualifier Black Pearl and a grandson of Code Blue. Sky Harbor is currently competing in the ABBI with the goal of winning the Classic title.

John Purling Purling's parentage is unknown but he may been a native of St Helena. Mr or Captain John Purling was allowed by the East India Company to travel there in 1750 at his own expense. He entered the Company's shipping service and was commander of the Indiaman Sandwich from 1753 to 1759, and Neptune from 1760 to 1762. Following his last highly profitable China voyage. he resigned the service, and in April 1763 was elected a director of the Company. In 1770, Purling became Deputy Chairman of the East India Company and purchased the estate of Bradford Peverell in Dorset. Also in 1770 he stood in a by-election at New Shoreham in opposition to two other members of the East Indian Company, Thomas Rumbold and William James. Although Purling came second on the poll he was declared elected Member of Parliament by the returning officer who was concerned at the level of bribery and corruption by other candidates. However he was unseated on petition. In 1771 he became Chairman of the East India Company. In a by-election in 1772 he was returned unopposed as MP for East Looe on the interest of John Buller senior. In 1772 the East India Company ran into financial difficulties, and Purling as its chairman was criticized for misleading the proprietors about their position. Although the control of the Company's affairs really rested with Sulivan and Sir George Colebrook and Purling's responsibility was largely nominal, he refused to stand for re- election as Chairman in 1773. In a speech in Parliament on 23 March 1773, he welcomed parliamentary investigation into the Company's affairs. In 1774 he took the lead in pressing for the compensation of East India commanders adversely affected by the shipping reforms resulting from the Regulating Act of 1773. In 1774 he was returned unopposed for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He became a director of the EIC again in 1777 and remained until 1780. In 1780 he was returned for Weymouth unopposed. He was a member of the St. Alban's Tavern group, which tried to bring about a union between Pitt and Fox. He was returned unopposed for Weymouth again in 1784 but did not stand in 1790. Purling died on 23 August 1800, aged 78. His will mentions property near Weymouth and Ramsay in Huntingdonshire, and also at St. Vincent in the West Indies He built up a large collection of works of art by Raphael, Correggio, Carracci, Guido, Parmegiano, Claude Titian, Tintoretto, S.

They consisted of a pair of long barrack ranges, linked by arcades at either end to form a narrow quadrangle, with a separate Officers' Quarters and Mess Establishment to the south-west: 'a highly Picturesque, free-style composition, very un- English, which included a central clock tower, stairs in detached, conical turrets, and a billiard room in a sort of Great Hall at the back'. The first unit to arrive was the 1st Battalion, the South Lancashire Regiment (who were transferred there gradually, as the buildings were completed, from the old Clarence Barracks which lay within the lines).Smythies, p. 438 The plans for the officers' quarters (dated 1885) suggest that it was intended to transfer the name Clarence Barracks to the new buildings, but in the event the name Victoria Barracks was used. (Clarence became the designation of a new Artillery barracks, begun in 1890; these were built alongside Victoria Barracks to the west, in place of the old barracks and over the now-demolished fortifications). Between the new Clarence and Victoria Barracks a large parade ground was laid out. The central tower of the Officers' Quarters was hit by a bomb and seriously damaged during the Second World War. The nearby Guard House was also bomb damaged, and subsequently rebuilt. After the war the barracks were taken over by the Royal Navy and used for seven years as a training establishment for new recruits. The buildings were eventually demolished in 1967. The site was subsequently developed for residential use and is now known as Pembroke Park.

He entered Parliament on 28 February 1735 as Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis when George Bubb Dodington decided to sit for Bridgwater. He succeeded his father in 1739 and like his father, he followed Dodington, joining him to take control of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis from Walpole in 1741. Dodington was a general political fixer. In 1744 Tucker became cashier to Treasurer of the Navy. He did not stand in the 1747 general election because his post became incompatible with a seat in the Commons under the Place Act of 1742. He lost his post in 1749, when Dodington joined the Prince of Wales faction. In about 1750 Egmont described him to Frederick as the ‚Äòabsolute creature‚Äô of Dodington. In 1754 Tucker was Mayor of Weymouth and in the 1754 general election was elected MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis.He was appointed Paymaster of the Marines in 1757 and held the post until his death. He was re- elected MP for Weymouth in 1761. In May 1762, a seat was required for George Grenville, and Dodington undertook to persuade Tucker to vacate his seat. Tucker was unwilling and two months later July 1762 Dodington died and Tucker was left in undisputed control at Weymouth. Dodington left all his property at Weymouth and Melcombe Regis to Tucker. Tucker retained control until his death, giving two seats to Government at each general election. He was Mayor of Weymouth again in 1763. In 1768 he was re-elected at Weymouth. He was appointed Keeper of the King's private roads in 1770 and held the post until his death. He was Mayor of Weymouth in 1772.

The first individual encountered was in 2007. It was described as a new species in 2014.Hassanin, A. (2014). Description of a new bat species of the tribe Scotonycterini (Chiroptera, Pteropodidae) from southwestern Cameroon. Comptes Rendus Biologies, 337(2), 134-142. Only three individuals have ever been encountered. Taxonomy and etymology It joins the short-palated fruit bat as a member of the genus Casinycteris. It has been suggested that Pohle's fruit bat should be moved from its current genus Scotonycteris to this genus as well. It differs from other bats of the Casinycteris and Scotonycteris genera by its intermediate body mass and skull morphology. The species name campomaanensis is a reference to Campo Ma'an National Park, which is close to where the first individual was found. Description They weigh approximately and have forearm lengths of . Their dorsal fur is rusty brown in color, while their ventral side is a lighter brown. Their throats, breasts, and bellies are whitish. They have several white markings on their face, such as a spot on the top of the snout, a chevron from the outer corner of each eye, a broad band around the lips, and an indistinct tuft in front of each ear. The skin of the snout is greenish-yellow with the exception of the nostrils, which are distinctly reddish. Their upper and lower eyelids are also greenish-yellow. The patagium of the wings is brown, while their finger joints are yellow. They lack a tail. They have 28 teeth in total, with a dental formula of . They have robust skulls with pronounced zygomatic arches. Range and habitat This species is found in the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests, an ecoregion of Central Africa. This region is hilly, with elevation ranging from above sea level. It is thought that at least some of the bat's habitat occurs in Campo Ma'an National Park, which is protected land. So far, it has been definitively identified in Cameroon, although a bat specimen collected in the past could mean that it is also present in Republic of the Congo. It has possibly been identified in Nigeria as well. Conservation As nothing is known about its range size, population number, or population trend, the IUCN lists it as data deficient.

History Building a republic and failure Fabre Geffrard's government held office until 1867, and he encouraged a successful policy of national reconciliation. In 1860, he reached an agreement with the Vatican, reintroducing official Roman Catholic institutions, including schools, to the nation. In 1867 an attempt was made to establish a constitutional government, but successive presidents Sylvain Salnave and Nissage Saget were overthrown in 1869 and 1874 respectively. A more workable constitution was introduced under Michel Domingue in 1874, leading to a long period of democratic peace and development for Haiti. The debt to France was finally repaid in 1879, and Michel Domingue's government peacefully transferred power to Lysius Salomon, one of Haiti's abler leaders. Monetary reform and a cultural renaissance ensued with a flowering of Haitian art. The final two decades of the 19th century were also marked by the development of a Haitian intellectual culture. Major works of history were published in 1847 and 1865. Haitian intellectuals, led by Louis-Joseph Janvier and Ant√©nor Firmin, engaged in a war of letters against a tide of racism and Social Darwinism that emerged during this period. The Constitution of 1867 saw peaceful and progressive transitions in government that did much to improve the economy and stability of the Haitian nation and the condition of its people. Constitutional government restored the faith of the Haitian people in legal institutions. The development of industrial sugar and rum industries near Port-au-Prince made Haiti, for a while, a model for economic growth in Latin American countries. This period of relative stability and prosperity ended in 1911, when revolution broke out and the country slid once again into disorder and debt. From 1911 to 1915, there were six presidents, each of whom was killed or forced into exile. The revolutionary armies were formed by cacos, peasant brigands from the mountains of the north, along the porous Dominican border, who were enlisted by rival political factions with promises of money to be paid after a successful revolution and an opportunity to plunder. The United States was particularly apprehensive about the role of the German community in Haiti (approximately 200 in 1910), who wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. Germans controlled about 80% of the country's international commerce; they also owned and operated utilities in Cap Ha√Øtien and Port-au-Prince, the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and a railroad serving the Plaine de Cul-du-Sac. The German community proved more willing to integrate into Haitian society than any other group of white foreigners, including the French. A number married into the nation's most prominent mulatto families, bypassing the constitutional prohibition against foreign land-ownership. They also served as the principal financiers of the nation's innumerable revolutions, floating innumerable loans-at high interest rates-to competing political factions. In an effort to limit German influence, in 1910‚Äì11, the US State Department backed a consortium of American investors, assembled by the National City Bank of New York, in acquiring control of the Banque Nationale d'Ha√Øti, the nation's only commercial bank and the government treasury. In December 1914, the U.S. military seized the Haitian government's gold reserve, urged on by the National City Bank and the National Bank of Haiti (which was already under foreign direction). The U.S. took the gold to National City Bank's New York City vault. In February 1915, Vilbrun Guillaume Sam formed a dictatorship, but in July, facing a new revolt, whom he massacred 167 political opponents, and was lynched by a mob in Port-au-Prince. United States occupation In 1915, Philippe Sudr√© Dartiguenave was appointed by US authorities to the Presidency of Haiti. Martial law was declared, and persisted until 1929. A treaty, which allowed the US government complete control over cabinet positions and Haiti's finances, was passed by the legislature in November 1915. The treaty also established the Gendarmerie d'Ha√Øti (Haitian Constabulatory Force), Haiti's first professional military. Dartiguenave dissolved the legislature in 1917 after its members refused to approve a new constitution. A referendum subsequently approved the constitution, which allowed foreigners to own land, something which had been forbidden by Haitian law since independence in 1804. The US occupation was a costly period in terms of human life. A revolt by disgruntled citizens was put down in 1918, with an estimated 2,000 killed. White foreigners, many with deep racial prejudices, dominated public policy, which angered the historically dominant Mulattos. However, Haiti's infrastructure, including roads, telephone lines, and plumbing, were repaired. Lighthouses, schools, hospitals, and harbors were built. Louis Borno replaced Dartiguenave as president in 1922, after he was forced out of office. He ruled without a legislature until elections were permitted in 1930. This newly formed legislature elected St√©nio Vincent, a mulatto, as president. By 1930, Haiti had become a liability to the United States. A congressional inquiry, known as the Forbes Commission, exposed many human rights violations, and while it praised improvements in Haitian society, it criticized the exclusion of Haitians from positions of authority. By August 1932, with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt as US President, American troops withdrew and authority was formally transferred to local police and army officials. Post-occupation, World War II and collapse Vincent took advantage of the stability to gain dictatorial power. Vincent expanded his economic authority by referendum, and in 1935, he forced a new constitution through the legislature. This constitution gave him power to dissolve the legislature and reorganize the judiciary at will, as well as the power to appoint senators. He also brutally oppressed political opposition. Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo had come to power in 1930 in the neighboring Dominican Republic. In 1937, Trujillo attacked the border with Haiti, his forces killing an estimated 20,000 Haitians. This attack Vincent interpreted as an attempted coup against himself, and thus he purged the military of all officers suspected of disloyalty. Many of these later joined the Dominican military. In 1941, √âlie Lescot, a mulatto who was an experienced and competent government official, was elected as President. Despite high expectations, his tenure paralleled Vincent's in its brutality and marginalization of opposition. He declared war on the Axis powers during World War II, and used this as an excuse to censor the press and repress his opponents. Lescot also maintained a clandestine cooperation with Trujillo, which undermined his already-nonexistent popularity. In January 1946, after Lescot jailed editors of a Marxist newspaper, protests broke out among government workers, teachers, and business owners. Lescot resigned, and a military junta, the Comit√© Ex√©cutif Militaire (Executive Military Committee), assumed power. Haiti elected a legislature in May 1946, and after two rounds of voting, Dumarsais Estim√©, a black cabinet minister, was elected president. He operated under a new constitution which expanded schools, established rural farming cooperatives, and raised salaries of civil servants. These early successes, however, were undermined by his personal ambition, and his alienation of the military and elite led to a coup in 1950, which reinstalled the military junta. Direct elections, the first in Haiti's history, were held in October 1950, and Paul Magloire, an elite black Colonel in the military, was elected. Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954, which devastated the nation's infrastructure and economy. Hurricane relief was inadequately distributed and misspent, and Magloire jailed opponents and shut down newspapers. After refusing to step down after his term ended, a general strike shut down Port-au-Prince's economy, and Magloire fled, leaving the government in a state of chaos. When elections were finally organized, Fran√ßois Duvalier, a rural doctor, was elected, on a platform of activism on behalf of Haiti's poor. His opponent, however, Louis D√©joie, was a mulatto and the scion of a prominent family.http://countrystudies.us/haiti/16.htm Duvalier scored a decisive victory at the polls. His followers took two-thirds of the legislature's lower house and all of the seats in the Senate.

Completed between 1851 and 1853, it shows Pauline de Broglie, who adopted the courtesy title princess, and married Albert de Broglie, the 28th Prime Minister of France in 1845. Pauline was aged 28 at the time of its completion. She was highly intelligent, widely known for her beauty, but suffered from profound shyness, and the painting captures her melancholia. Pauline contracted tuberculosis in her early 30s and died in 1860 aged 35. Although Albert lived until 1901, he was heartbroken and did not remarry. Ingres undertook a number of preparatory pencil sketches in preparation for the commission, each of which captures her personality and sense of taste. They show her in various poses, including standing, and in differently styled dresses. The eventual painting is considered one of Ingres' finest later- period portraits of women, along with the Portraits of Comtesse d'Haussonville, Baronne de Rothschild and Madame Moitessier. As with many of Ingres' female portraits, details of costume and setting are rendered with a chilly precision while her body seems to lack a solid bone structure. The painting is held in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is signed and dated 1853. Commission Jos√©phine-√âl√©onore-Marie- Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B√©arn (1825‚Äì1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville.Naef (1966), p. 274 Albert, 4th duc de Broglie, the 28th Prime Minister of France Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eyewitness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\" Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions.Tucker (2009), p. 13 This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Tinterow (1999), p. 449 Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Mus√©e Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\". Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis. After her death, Albert published three volumes of her essays on religious history.Tinterow (1999), p. 447 Albert (who in 1873 became the 28th Prime Minister of France) lived until 1901, but was heartbroken and did not remarry. He kept her portrait for the remainder of his life draped in fabric and hidden behind a velvet curtain, only lending it to select exhibitions. After his own death, the painting passed within the family until 1958 when it was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art via the banker and art collector Robert Lehman,Tinterow (1999), p. 454 and is today held in the Lehman Wing. The family kept most of the jewelry and accessories seen in the painting, although the marabou feathers were sold to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum. Preparatory studies There are comparatively few extant preparatory sketches for the de Broglie painting compared to other of his later period portraits. Ingres' usual technique was to use sketches both to plot the final work and to provide guidance for assistants on whom he relied to paint in the less important passages. Some others may have been lost or destroyed.Brettell et al (2009), p. 452Tucker (2009), p. 17 The extant sketches date from 1850 to 1853 and are drawn with graphite on paper or tracing paper. They vary in elaboration and detail, but show Ingres thinking through the eventual form and pose of the sitter. The earliest consists of a brief sketch of the princess in a seated pose.Tucker (2009), p. 16 There is a full-length study of a nude standing in essentially the final pose, in which Ingres experimented with two different positions of the crossed arms. A second full-length study shows a clothed figure. Two others are focused on her hands. A highly finished drawing of the princess standing with her left hand at the neck and dressed in a simpler costume than in the painting, may be a study for the painting or an independent work. Besides these five or six extant sketches, about the same number are known to be lost.

Graphite and red chalk on paper, 27.8 x 17.5 cm. Location unknown The painting's central motifs were already established in the earliest studies, in which her oval face, arched eyebrows, and habit of folding her arms with one stuffed into the opposing sleeve appear. Ingres found the sittings difficult and agonised over every detail. He wrote to his friend and patron Charles Marcotte that he was \\"killing [his] eyes on the background of the Princesse de Broglie, which I am painting at her house, and that helps me advance a great deal; but, alas, how these portraits make me suffer, and this will surely be the last one, excepting, however, the portrait of [his second wife] Delphine.\\"The painting of his wife Delphine was to be his last female portrait. See Wolohojian (2003), p. 206 Description Painting Detail showing pearl earrings and draped pearl laced marabou feathersTaylor (2002), p. 122 The Princesse de Broglie is shown in three quarters view, her arms resting on a lavishly upholstered, pale gold damask easy chair. Her head is tilted to the viewer's left, black hair tightly pulled back and bound by blue satin ribbons.Tucker (2009), p. 11 She is located in the family home at 90 rue de l'Universit√© in Paris, in an evening dress that implies she is about to depart for the evening.Marandel (1987), p. 72 She is dressed in the height of contemporary Parisian fashion,Naef (1966), p. 276 in particular the opulent Second Empire fashions then current in clothing, jewelry and furniture. She wears a gold embroidered evening shawl, and an off- shoulder pale blue satin hoop skirt ball gown, with lace and ribbon trim. Her hair is covered with a sheer frill trimmed with matching blue ribbon knots. Her adornments include a necklace, tasseled earrings and bracelets on each wrist. Her pendant with cross patt√©e signifies her piety and was perhaps designed by Fortunato Pio Castellani or Mellerio dits Meller.Amory, Dita (2016). \\"Jos√©phine-√âl√©onore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B√©arn (1825‚Äì1860), Princesse de Broglie\\". Catalogue Entry. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 23 September 2017 Her earrings are made from cascades of small natural pearls. Her left wrist contains a bracelet of roped pearls; the one on her right is made of red enameled and diamond set gold links. The necklace is held by a double looped chain holding a gold pendant, which appears to be an original Roman bulla.McConnell (1991), p. 38 Detail with lace dress trimmings, jewelry, rings, tucked hand, elongated fingers, and yellow gold chair As with all of Ingres' female portraits, her body seems to lack a solid bone structure. Her neck is unusually elongated, and her arms seem boneless or dislocated, while her left forearm appears to be under modeled and lacking in musculature.Harris, Beth; Zucker, Steven. \\"Ingres, Princesse de Broglie\\". Khan Academy, October 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2017 Her oval face and facial expression are idealised, lacking the level of detail given to other foreground elements, although she was widely known as a great beauty. The painting is composed from grey, white, blue, yellow and gold hues.Rosenblum (1990), p. 118 The costume and decor are painted with a supreme precision, crispness and realism that art historians have compared to Jan van Eyck.Rosenblum (1990), p. 32 In many ways the painting is austere; art historian Robert Rosenblum describes a \\"glassy chill\\", and \\"astonishing chromatic harmonies that, for exquisite, silvery coolness, are perhaps only rivaled by Vermeer.\\"Rosenblum (1990), p. 37 Her facial features are statuesque and in passages display the quality of porcelain. The painting contains a number of pentimenti, including around the contours of her hair, and the yellow chair. The horizontal bands are about 2.5 cm wide, and composed from yellow paint on either side of her head near the earrings. They seem to have been used to plot the positioning of the moldings. The black hat on the chair seems to have been a late addition. There are visible passages of underdrawing where the artist seems to trace out shapes and positions, established in the preparatory sketches, onto the grounded canvas. These include squared lines around the left shoulder and chest areas. There are lines mapping out the throat and top edge of the bodice.Hale (2000), p. 206 Coat of arms combining the heraldics of the de Broglie and de Bearn families Compared to the Portrait of Comtesse d'Haussonville, or most of Ingres' later portraits, the background is flat and featureless, probably to place emphasis on the coat of arms.Davies (1934), p. 241Martin Davies described the background as \\"snobbishly bare\\". See Davies (1934), p. 241 It comprises a neutral soft pale grey and evenly textured wall, with a linear structured gilded wood mouldings, and a fictitious coat of arms combining the heraldics of the de Broglie and de Bearn families. The grey wall is underlined with a barely discernible deep blue pigment. This minimalist approach reflects the \\"ascetic elegance\\" of his early female portraits, where the sitter was often set against featureless backdrops. The precisely rendered details and geometric background create an impression of immobility, while subtle movement is implied by the tilt of her head and the shimmering folds of her dress.Tucker (2009), pp. 11‚Äì13 Frame The Louis XIII style Ovolo frame, c. 1950‚Äì1960 The current frame measures 157 x 125.6 cm at the exterior and is made of pink-orange bole pine,Newbery (2007), p. 344 lined with a garland of gilt-plastered ornament flowers. Its ornaments lie on ovolo molding. It was produced in the United States between 1950 and 1960 (around the time the Metropolitan acquired the work) in the French Louis XIII style fashionable in Ingres' period. It is similar to, and probably modeled on, the frame used for Madame Moitessier, which is most likely an original and is dated 1856.Tinterow (1999), p. 452 The original de Broglie plaster frame was completed at latest c. 1860, and is thought to have been similar to the current. Reception Madame Moitessier, 1856. National Gallery, London The painting remained in Ingres' possession until 1854,Naef (1966), p. 275 when it was first exhibited that December in his studio, alongside his unfinished Madame Moitessier (c. 1844‚Äì56), Portrait of Lorenzo Bartolini, and c. 1808 Venus Anadyomene.Tinterow (1999), p. 451 One critic wrote that the painting showed Pauline as \\"refined, delicate, elegant to her finger tips...a marvelous incarnation of nobility\\". In general it is held in the same high regard as his Comtesse d'Haussonville, and Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild. The work was an instant critical and popular success, and widely admired and written about. Most critics understood the artfulness of physical deformations, although one writer, writing under the byline A. de. G., and representing a minority, academic view, describes her as a \\"puny, wilted, sickly, woman; her thin arms rest on an armchair placed in front of her. M. Ingres has rendered in an unheard-of manner these large, veiled eyes, deprived of sight. He has given this face a negative expression that he must have seen in real life, and reproduced it with a sure touch.\\" The majority of critics noted Ingres' attention to detail in describing her clothes, accessories and decor, and saw an artist at the height of his creativity, with a few invoking the precision of van Eyck.Tinterow (1999), pp. 451‚Äì52 Some writers detected a hint of melancholy in de Broglie's eyes and expression.

The displays range from prehistoric times to the Victorian era. The building and its garden railings beside the river front have been Grade II listed since 1988. Design Grade II listed The garden railings form part of the building's listed status The structure was built in 1872 for William Thorne, but sold to the Barnstaple Bridge Trust in 1876 who then sold it to William Frederick Rock. Constructed in red brick with dressings of stone and terracotta, the hipped and slated roof has a flat central section which is set with ornamental iron railings together with 5 red brick chimneys with stone caps. The building is square and is built round an internal courtyard with on the right on the building's North side a small service wing which may actually be a former coach-house with a walled courtyard behind. Inside is a fine wooden staircase in the Jacobean style with twisted balusters and large carved newels with a Gothic stone fireplace in the entrance hall. Behind the building on the river front there is a small garden enclosed by iron railings having spearhead uprights and standards; these railings form part of the listed status for the property. The gate piers and gates with the bases of dolphin lamp posts adjacent to the building are separately listed. History The museum was founded as the North Devon Athen√¶um in 1888 by William Frederick Rock, who intended it to serve as a replacement for the Barnstaple Literary and Scientific Institute he had created in 1845. In addition to functioning as a library and museum, the building served as an informal records office for Barnstaple. An innovation unusual at that time was that men and women shared the reading rooms as Rock believed that separate facilities would encourage women to gossip rather than read. The Librarian lived in the building, a requirement that lasted until the 1930s. The Devon County Library Service occupied the main floor from 1956, relocating from much smaller premises in the Bridge Buildings across the road. In 1988 the library collection was moved to the specially built North Devon Library and Record Office. The museum collection remained, and was loaned to the Museum of Barnstaple and North Devon, which took over the space. The Collection The museum's collections and displays cover the natural and human history of North Devon. Galleries include the Tarka Gallery, the Story of North Devon, the Regimental Collections of the Royal Devon Yeomanry and the Royal 1st Devon Yeomanry, furniture by Shapland & Petter and a collection of 17th century pewter and ceramics from the area including Art Pottery by Brannam Pottery, William Leonard Baron and Alexander Lauder. Also on display is a full-size recreation of the front half of the Barnstaple Elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus), a rare straight-tusked elephant which became extinct in the UK around 115,000 years ago and the fossil of which was excavated in Barnstaple in February 1844. On display in the prehistory gallery are some tusk and bone fragments while whole teeth were taken to the Natural History Museum in London. The museum was among ten candidates shortlisted for the ¬£100,000 Gulbenkian Prize for Museum of the Year in 2005 for its work investigating the history of Shapland & Petter, a Barnstaple manufacturing company. In November 2017 the museum was targeted by thieves who broke into the museum and smashed display cabinets, making off with two limited edition Royal Mint collections of gold coins, thought to be worth around ¬£15,000. The museum includes a Gift Shop, Tearoom, Tourist Information Centre and Visitor Reception. In May 2018 the museum closed so that an extension could be built.

In order to perfect her work, she moved to Italy and in 1783, in Rome, began studying encaustic painting with Joseph Pignatelli. In 1785, in Florence, she practiced encaustic painting at the salon of Irene Parenti Duclos and thanks to her, Hooker began to attend the Royal Gallery. Career She returned to London in 1786, and in the following year, published Curios discovery of the ancient grecian method of painting on wax. Greenland also exhibited her self-portrait, at the Royal Academy of Arts in London as an Honorary Exhibitor. Her first communication to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce of London, with examples of this mode of painting, was made in the year 1786, one example of which was preserved in the Society's rooms at the Adelphi. For her very successful efforts in encaustic painting, Greenland was presented with a gold palette by the Society in 1786. Her account was printed in the 10th volume of the Society's Transactions for the year 1792. In the year 1807, she made a farther communication to the Society of the result of no less than 50 experiments per day, during more than four months. It was proposed that this methos painting should be called the Hookerian method. From 1801, with her husband, she directed a school for young aristocracy in Sussex, which included the grandchildren of the Duke of Wellington and Napoleon Bonaparte as students. Greenland's music career gave her great satisfaction as when Johann Christian Bach dedicated to her six sonatas for piano and violin. Her father was a witness to Bach's will and Emma wrote her name on the title page of each document and at the head of each movement. Emma may have been a pupil of Bach's.

Career   Style  Berman painted realistic impressions inspired by her experiences on New York‚Äôs Lower East Side with ‚Äúa directness that is distinctive,‚Äù remarked one reviewer. The art critic Henry McBride praised her ‚Äúuntrammelled imagination‚Äù, something the art historian Alfred Werner attributed, at least in part, to her own cultural marginality as part of a Jewish community that, during the 1920s and 1930s, ‚Äúformed a curiously disadvantaged enclave‚Äù as ‚Äúawkward outsiders in New York‚Äôs largely Gentile Art Establishment.‚Äù The artist worked in other mediums including etching, and lithography.

Berman is described in this article as a painter and supportive friend of Gould's, more specifically a sympathetic saviour to Joe Gould. \\"...Gould remained a man of the street. He was often dirty, dizzy, and drunk, cold, loused, and hungry. He had no teeth and cadged his meals, eating free ketchup by the spoonful in diners. And when, in the spring of 1944, a painter Gould knew, Sarah Ostrowsky Berman, happened upon him seated on the steps of a tenement on Bleecker Street, with a bad cold and a hangover and sores on his legs, she was heartbroken.

Life and career O'Grady trained as a jackaroo and worked as a stockman at Wallal Downs station pastoral lease some north-east of Port Hedland from 1949 to 1955. From 1952 he carried out linguistic studies, focusing particularly on the Nyangumarta language and people. Challenging the received notion that Aboriginal languages were lexically impoverished, O'Grady gathered some 4,000 roots which, together with Helmut Petri and Gisela Odermann's list of 6,550 words compiled at Anna Plains, gave proof of a rich language that could appropriate by assimilation and grammatical modification many concepts that were exclusive to the domain of Western civilisation. Over two months in March/April 1961, O'Grady and the visiting American linguist Ken Hale made a sweeping survey tour of coastal languages spoken from Port Augusta in South Australia to Broome in Western Australia, and managed to record significant quantities of material from 26 languages.

They recorded two albums but split up in 1987 due to a lack of commercial success. History Zerra 1 were formed in 1982 by vocalist and keyboardist Paul Bell, guitarist Andreas Grimminger, bassist Adrian Wyatt and drummer Mike Mesbur. That year, the band supported The Cure on their UK and European tour in April-June, and released \\"Let's Go Home\\" as their debut single. It was released by Top Hole Records in the Netherlands only. Later in December, the band supported U2 for five dates. Two singles were released in the UK during 1983 on the Second Vision label. Although \\"The West's Awake\\" and \\"The Banner of Love (How I Run to You)\\" did not generate any major commercial success, the latter single reached No. 33 on the UK Independent Singles Chart. In February-March 1984, the band toured as a support act of The Boomtown Rats. The same year saw the band signing to Mercury. Their first single for the label was \\"Ten Thousand Voices, Message from the Peoples\\". That year, their self-titled debut album was also released, which spawned the singles \\"Tumbling Down\\" and \\"Mountains and Water\\". Released across Europe, the album was produced by Todd Rundgren, but failed to give the band their commercial breakthrough. A revised version of the album was released in Canada in 1985 on the Vertigo label. It was re-titled Mountains and Water. A remix of \\"Rain\\", taken from the debut album, was released in the UK in 1985. Mesbur was replaced by Korda Marshall during 1984. Recording sessions for the band's second album spanned from May 1985 to April 1986, however by this time both Marshall and Wyatt had left the band. Wyatt was replaced by Eamo Doyle, making the band a trio. On the album, drums were mostly provided by Pete Thomas and Gavin Harrison. \\"Rescue Me\\", the first single from the album, was released in October 1985 and reached No. 82 in the UK in early 1986. However, the band were unable to capitalise on the chart entry. The album, The Domino Effect, was not a commercial success, along with two further singles \\"Forever and Ever\\" and \\"Domino Effect\\". In late 1986, the band supported Ultravox. They focused on trying to break the American market in 1987, but disbanded later that year.

It was also known as St Mary's Barracks. History The facility were originally built as a garrison hospital in 1680 and converted into a barracks in 1694. The barracks were named after a type of wild cabbage which was prevalent in the local area. The barracks were home to the Army Service Corps, responsible for supplies, transport and accommodation, during the First World War. After the war, the barracks fell into disrepair and were demolished to make way for an expansion to Portsmouth Power Station in the late 1920s. Description The barracks were described in the Chronicles of Portsmouth (1823) as: : \\"...presenting a fine range of buildings, three stories high, having in front a parade-ground of large size, at one extremity of which is a building corresponding in style, formerly used as an armoury. In the front is a bold armorial sculpture of the English arms in alto relievo. Behind is a second space of ground with ranges of stabling; and on the opposite side, the apartments of the officers of the Royal Artillery. [‚Ä¶] On the site of the barracks anciently stood a Conventual building dedicated to the Virgin Mary; and the large burial-ground called St. Mary's was the colewort or cabbage garden or close\\". The aforementioned 'cabbage garden', which gave the barracks its name, was still in use as a burial-ground in the early 19th century, long after the conventual chapel of St Mary had been demolished.

Like many other riodinids, the caterpillars are myrmecophilous and have tentacle nectary organs that exude a fluid similar to that produced by the host plant Calathea ovandensis. This mutualistic relationship allows ants to harvest the exudate, and in return provide protection in the form of soil shelters for larvae. The larvae communicate with the ants by vibrations produced by the movement of its head. The species was described and given its binomial name by the German lepidopterist Hans Stichel in 1910.  Life cycle  As in all butterflies, E. elvina are holometabolous and have four distinct development stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. It takes a total of 45 days for an adult to eclose from an egg.  Egg  The females lay the eggs on the upper surface of leaves, leaf petioles, or on the inflorescence of neotropical plants such as Calathea ovandensis. The eggs are not laid in a clutch, but are generally isolated. Sometimes, however, they may be found in widely spaced groups of five or fewer eggs. It takes, on average, 3 days for the first instar of larva to hatch out of the egg. Larval stages The butterfly goes through five distinct larval instars. The instars vary in terms of their distinct morphological structure and size differences. Characteristic of myrmecophilous riodinids, all the larval stages possess Tentacle Nectary Organ (TNO) on the eighth abdominal segment. This organ plays an important role in the species' interactions with ants.DeVries, P. J. (1991). Ecological and evolutionary patterns in myrmecophilous riodinid butterflies. =First instar= The first instar emerges from the egg by chewing through the micropyle. The body of the caterpillar is pale-yellow in color with a black head capsule. This coloration acts as a camouflage against the corolla of the host plant (Calathea spp.) on which the caterpillars are found. They feed on all parts of the flower and grow from a length of 1.5 mm to 4.5 mm. The dorsal setae of this instar are much longer than those of the other instars. The first instar period lasts for an average of 4.5 days. =Second instar= The second instar is similar to the first instar in its body coloration, with the exception of the head capsule, which is brownish- yellow in color. The foremost segment of the thorax is covered by a protective black shield into which the head of the caterpillar is partially retractable. The caterpillar possesses dark red segments on its mid-dorsal and lateral sides. Similar to the first instar, the second instar possesses dorsal setae that arise from the hardened cuticle (chalazae) of the caterpillar. The diet of this instar includes buds, flowers, and the developing fruits of the host plant. During this development period, the larvae grow from 4.5mm to 7mm in length. They molt to the third instar on an average of 4.2 days. =Third instar= The third instar is similar to the second instar except that it is larger in size. When freshly molted, the caterpillar is pale-cream in color, but it gradually changes to a brownish-yellow, and the dorsal bands turn maroon as the stage progresses. The dorsal chalazae may or may not be prominent (visible) in this instar. This instar feeds on the buds, flowers, and developing fruits of the host plant. It grows from a size of about 7 mm to 10 mm during this stage. This instar lasts for an average period of about 6.6 days. =Fourth instar= The body color of the fourth instar varies from a light to dark avocado green. The head is completely retractable under the black and tan prothoracic shield. The dorsal setae and chalazae are reduced. The fourth instar has a similar diet to the previous instars and grows to a length of 14 mm. This stage lasts for an average period of about 6.5 days. =Fifth instar= The final instar is very similar to the fourth instar, but is larger in size (about 20 mm). This instar possesses a similarly bicolored prothoracic shield and reduced dorsal setae. There are dense black dots found laterally along the length of the caterpillar's body during this stage. This instar is bright green in color, which mimics the color of the host plant. This stage lasts for an average period of about 11 days. Pupa The pupa is bright green, matching the colors of the young leaves of the host plant on which it is found. It has an incompletely extended white proboscis which resembles a tail. The proboscis eventually extends completely and changes from dark green to brown like the rest of the pupa. The adult emerges from the pupa after approximately 9.5 days. Adult The complete metamorphosis from the egg to the adult takes approximately 45 days. The length of the adult ranges from 18.2 ‚Äì 19.6 mm. In comparison, the proboscis is long, about 33.5 ‚Äì 38.5 mm, as is characteristic of the genus Eurybia. The adults drink floral nectar from the host plants. The host plants are typically members of the genus Calathea and Ischnosiphon pruniosus.DeVries, P. J., Chacon, I. A., & Murray, D. (1992). Toward a better understanding of host use and biodiversity in riodinid butterflies(Lepidoptera). Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera, 31(1), 103-126.  Pollination  The long proboscis of the adult does not touch the stigma or the pollen of the plant while feeding on C. ovandensis. Thus, they never pollinate the host flowers. Such visits are expected to be detrimental for plant reproduction, as the loss of nectar reduces the plants' success of pollination during future visits. This may also lead to tripping of flowers with no pollen exchange, resulting in reduced fruit-set. However, it has been observed that Eurybia elvina rarely trip flowers. It was found that their ineffective pollination in the study system did not significantly reduce fruit-set. Thus, the adult interaction with the host plant is commensal. Mutualism with ants The larval stages of E. elvina have been found in mutualistic associations with several ant species, such as the electric ant, Brachymyrmex musculus, Paratrechina spp. and fire ants among others. This type of an association is generally referred to as Myrmecophily. The Tentacle Nectary Organ (TNO) found that the eighth abdominal segment of the larval stages plays a special role in this interaction. This organ secretes exudates rich in sugars and amino acids which is harvested by the ants. This secretion has been found to be biochemically similar to the nectar produced by the host plant (C. ovandensis). The later instars of the caterpillar position themselves in the inflorescence such that the TNO is presented to the ants at roughly the same level of the nectaries of the flower. Some species of ants build soil shelters around the later instars on the inflorescences. The pupal stages were also attended by ants even though they produce no exudates. It is thought that the association with ants may protect the caterpillar from enemies.  Physiology   Sound Production  A number of riodinid species are known to produce audible signals using epicranial granulations. An experiment to see if this behavior exists in E. elvina was conducted in Soberania National Park, Panama using E. elvina caterpillars and the ant species Ectatomma ruidum. The caterpillar was observed producing 12-15 pulses of sound per second when walking and foraging, either when alone or when accompanied by E. ruidum ants. As they produced sound, the caterpillars oscillated their head laterally, and the sound stopped when the oscillations ceased or when the head region was not in contact with the substrate (branch). The investigators of the experiment were able to discern that E. elvina caterpillars produce sound by oscillating their head in order to scrape the teeth that cover their cervical membrane against the epicranial granulations located on the surface of their heads.Travassos, M.

Even though women can develop long-term psychiatric symptoms after a miscarriage, acknowledging the potential of mental illness is not usually considered. A mental illness can develop in women who have experienced one or more miscarriages after the event or even years later. Some data suggest that men and women can be affected up to 15 years after the loss. Though recognized as a public health problem, studies investigating the mental health status of women following miscarriage are still lacking. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop in women who have experienced a miscarriage. Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage include emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of social support. Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop. Clinical depression also is associated with miscarriage. Past responses by clinicians have been to prescribe sedatives. Recurring miscarriage may increase the incidence of intrusive thoughts in women and their partners. Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One disorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This psychological trauma can develop as a response to early pregnancy loss. Anxiety can also develop as a result of a miscarriage. Women describe the medical treatment that they receive contributed their distress. Intrusive thoughts can develop after the loss. Panic disorder and obsessive thoughts may also develop as a response to a miscarriage. Men may experience pain and psychological effects but react by adopting \\"compensatory behaviours\\" such as increasing consumption of alcohol. Because men can consider their role to be supportive, they may not have their loss recognized. Posttraumatic stress disorder Women who have had clinical depression before the miscarriage are more likely to develop PTSD. Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with miscarriage along with other traumatic events associated with pregnancy. Those who experience recurrent miscarriage (>3) have a greater risk of developing PTSD than those who have experienced miscarriage once. An association between the gender of the infant lost through miscarriage exists whereby there is an increased chance of developing PTSD if the infant was a male. Knowing the cause of the miscarriage does not reduce the risk of developing PTSD. Finding a 'meaning' for the loss reduces the risk of developing PTSD. A negative outlook regarding the world in general is correlated with increased levels of PTSD. Poor self-esteem is also related to developing PTSD after the loss. If memories of the loss are considered intense, risk for PTSD is increased. There are concerns that PTSD in mothers may have a negative impact on children born after the event. Though the development of PTSD in women and families after the loss has been identified, the presence of PTSD in a woman who is pregnant is detrimental. Women with PTSD are thought to be at a higher risk of prenatal loss, perinatal loss, pregnancy complications, ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth and growth abnormalities in the fetus. PTSD in a mother is suspected to increase the risk of autism, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes in a child. Depression and anxiety 43% of women who miscarry are found to have depression, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Complicated grief is an atypical response to a miscarriage. It differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in a predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most (59%) do not fit this pattern. Cognitive behavior therapy has been found to be helpful if it is begun immediately after the loss.  Epidemiology  A woman who miscarries has a 2.5 times greater risk for depression than those who have not. In the US, estimates of PTSD related to miscarriage are thought to be 150,000‚Äì200,000 acute and 24,000‚Äì32,000 chronic PTSD cases. PTSD in fathers may be significant but remains unaddressed.

For blustering Jack Palmer is a successful Trade Union leader who conceivably could be living in more affluent surroundings. However, he has so identified himself with the workers that to move to a house with a bath, for instance, would look like treachery. Thus, naturally, he fights every inch of the way for the union rights of the considerable West Indian element in his care and it is only when his own daughter [Kathie] falls in love with a Jamaican [Sonny Lincoln] that he is pulled up in his steps. Nell, his wife, whom he has consistently neglected over the years, has centred her whole life on her daughter, and approaches the problem with a blind hysterical prejudice.\\"Frances Stephens, Theatre World Annual (London) Number 10, London: Barrie & Rockliff, 1959, p. 81.

It was bought by the public, following threats to the beauty spot of Cissbury Ring and the surrounding farmland, which led to a public campaign purchases in the 1930s. It is currently owned and managed, on behalf of the public, by Worthing Borough Council. Location The land lies in the north of the borough of Worthing in West Sussex. To the north lies Cissbury Ring, which is owned by the National Trust; to the west lies the Worthing suburb of Findon Valley and to the south lies Charmandean Lane in the Worthing suburb of Broadwater. Three golf courses lie to the south and were formerly part of the Worthing Downland Estate. Two golf courses are part of Worthing Golf Club and a further course forms part of Hill Barn Golf Club. Ancient history Plough disturbed sites at Mount Carvey and High Salvington remain a possible sites of neolithic flint mines. The downs north of Worthing held the greatest concentration of flint mines in neolithic Britain. The remains of a trackway that follows the ridge of Tenants Hill can be seen. It was in use from the early Iron Age to Roman periods (between around 800BC to 409AD). The trackway extends south to Charmandean Lane, which in Broadwater turns into a footpath known as the Quashetts, which becomes Worthing High Street and finally the Steyne before reaching the sea. It is likely that Worthing's Roman grid system of centuriation would have been based on this ancient track. To the north the track extended to Cissbury Ring and from there continued northwards to Chanctonbury Ring and into the Weald. The track would have been used as a droveway for the seasonal movement of livestock or transhumance in the summer months into the forest of the Weald. One of the track's northern destinations would have been 'Little Broadwater', to the north of Broadwater and about north of Worthing seafront. This area, which includes the remains of Sedgwick Castle, remained an outlying part of the parish of Broadwater until its amalgamation with the parish of Nuthurst in 1877. Modern history Purchase in 1930s Throughout the 1920s and 1930s large the Brighton and Eastbourne Corporations bought up large tracts of downland to protect them from development. It was at this period that concern about development also saw the formation of groups such as the Society of Sussex Downsmen (later the South Downs Society and now the Friends of the South Downs ). In the 1930s geographer Vaughan Cornish advocated a national park for the South Downs between the rivers Arun and Adur, believing that the eastern downs would be looked after by Brighton and Eastbourne Councils and the western downs were too wooded to be representative of the South Downs. At Findon Valley, Thakeham Rural District Council has approved considerable building of bungalows and this was seen as threatening the integrity of the Iron Age hillfort of Cissbury Ring. With the help of Worthing residents, the National Trust bought land at Cissbury Ring in 1925 to protect it from development. Worthing Corporation (the forerunner to present-day Worthing Borough Council) continued this trend around Worthing in the 1930s. Between 1933 and 1939, the Worthing Corporation purchased acres of open downland north of Worthing, mostly in the parish of Broadwater and at High Salvington. In 1939 the Worthing Corporation purchased acres of land at High Salvington. This land adjoined another acres that were purchased around the same time. When land at High Salvington had been threatened with development, Worthing resident, the actress Nancy Price, wrote to The Times newspaper which raised money by public subscription which allowed the Worthing Corporation to purchase the land. Nancy Price raised almost ¬£7,000, included donations from Caroline Kipling and Ada Galsworthy, the wives of Sussex-based novelists Rudyard Kipling and John Galsworthy. At the time of the transaction the Town Clerk of the Worthing Corporation stated, ‚ÄúMost of it is land over which the public is free to roam at will and which will remain undeveloped for ever. It is a tremendous and valuable lung in view of the continuous encroachment of bricks and mortar on all parts of the south coast.‚Äù Open access designation in 2000s Following the death of a tenant farmer in 2009, Worthing Borough Council proposed to sell-off the public land. On 14 November 2009 hundreds of people gathered on the downland to the north of Worthing to protest against the proposed sale of the land. Following the protests, the decision was taken on 3 December 2009 to be withdrawn from sale. On 29 November 2015 Worthing Borough Council dedicated the land at Mount Carvey and Tenants Hill as open access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to be used in perpetuity for public access and enjoyment. The decision followed a six-year public campaign led a group called the Worthing Downlanders (formerly the Stop the Cissbury Sell Off group). Worthing Council agreed to long-term leases rather than selling freeholds on farm buildings and land. Biodiversity The site forms part of the North-east Worthing downs Biodiversity Opportunity Area. Tenants Hill forms part of the Tenants Hill and Reservoirs Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI). Further SNCIs are located adjacent to the Worthing Downland Estate at the Cissbury Ring SNCI and the Worthing and Hill Barn Golf Courses SNCI. The land is lowland calcareous grassland. Species present include slow-worm (anguis fragilis), tree pipit (anthus trivialis), dusky brocade (apamea remissa), common toad (bufo bufo) and adder (vipera berus).

He was commissioned with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the war. He was awarded the DSC in 1942, much of his wartime service being with Ian Fleming's 30AU (assault unit), whose primary role was to pinch enemy technology and information. He took part in the attack on St Nazaire whilst commanding MGB314, he was also on the Dieppe Raid, the capture of Algiers, and led his 'Curtforce' onto the beach on D-Day+1. In the final days of the war, whilst taking control of the Blohm & Voss works, Commander Curtis accepted the surrender of the city of Kiel. He was appointed CBE in 1963.

It is launched from a sonobuoy canister with the wings deploying in early flight phase. The system can operate up to one hour and is designed for interchangeable payloads. It is used by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for hurricane tracking, and is being assessed by the United States Air Force and Army as an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance asset, as well as for delivering kinetic payloads. Design and development A company named Advanced Ceramic Research, of Tucson, Arizona, originally developed the Coyote, Manta and Silver Fox UAS under small business contracts from the U.S. Office of Naval Research. British defense contractor BAE Systems acquired the company in 2009, then sold it back to one of the former owners under the name Sensintel. Raytheon acquired Sensintel in 2015 and folded the company into its Tucson- based Missile Systems business. The Coyote first flew in 2007 while still under ACR development, being launched from a Beechcraft C-12 Huron.

Production Background In 1992 then-Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) booker and match maker Antonio Pe√±a left the company alongside a number of wrestlers to form the Mexican professional wrestling, company Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n, later known simply as \\"AAA\\". Over the next decade- and-a-half Pe√±a and the team behind AAA built the promotion into one of the biggest wrestling companies in the world. On October 5, 2006 Pe√±a died from a heart attack. After Pe√±a's death his brother-in-law Jorge Roldan took control of the company with both his wife Marisela Pe√±a, Antonio's sister, and Dorian Roldan (their son) also taking an active part in AAA. On October 7, 2007,AAA held a show in honor of Pe√±a's memory, the first ever \\"Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show\\" (Homenaje an Antonio Pe√±a in Spanish). The following year AAA held the second ever \\"Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show\\", making it an annual tradition for the company to commemorate the passing of their founder. In 2008 the show was rebranded as H√©roes Inmortales (Spanish for \\"Immortal Heroes\\"), retroactively rebranding the 2007 and 2008 event as H√©roes Inmortales I and H√©roes Inmortales II. AAA has held a H√©roes Inmortales every year since then, with the 2017 version of the show being H√©roes Inmortales XI (11). The H√©roes Inmortales hosts the Copa Antonio Pe√±a (\\"Antonio Pe√±a Cup\\") tournament each year, a multi-man tournament with various wrestlers from AAA or other promotions competing for a trophy. The tournament format has usually been either a gauntlet match or a multi-man torneo cibernetico elimination match. For the 2017 show the winner of the Copa Antonio Pe√±a would also win the AAA Latin American Championship. Storylines The H√©roes Inmortales XI show featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

He attended City College of New York and then graduated with an LLB jurisprudence in 1925 from Harvard Law, where he was a \\"Frankfurter favorite.\\" Career In 1930, Greene co- authored Labor Injunction with Frankfurter, well received at the time as \\"at once scholarly and interesting... Mechanically the book is perfect\\" and also \\"comprehensive.\\" Practice According to The New York Times (but without specifying when, for whom, or in what capacity), Greene \\"advised many members of the New Deal Administration on labor legislation.\\" In the 1930s, Greene became a partner in the New York law firm of Cook, Nathan & Lehman (also known as \\"Lehman & Greenman\\"‚ÄìLehman was the brother of New York state governor Herbert Lehman). He worked there until the 1940s. While there, Greene became mentor Joseph Flom, later a partner in Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. (Louis M. Loeb was a prominent partner in that period.) In the 1950s, he served as special counsel to Lazard Freres & Co. and joined the Development and Resources Corporation or \\"D&R;,\\" founded in 1955 by David E. Lilienthal. (Lilienthal, leader of the Tennessee Valley Authority or \\"TVA,\\" also worked for Lazard Freres and then formed D&R; as an engineering and consulting firm which shared some TVA objectives, i.e., in supporting major public power and public works projects for overseas clients, including: Iran, Colombia, Ghana, India, Italy, Morocco, Nigeria, South Vietnam, and Venezuela.) International Juridical Association (IJA) By 1932, Greene had become a member of the International Juridical Association (IJA), whose members included: Carol Weiss King, Osmond Fraenkel (ACLU), Joseph Brodsky (lawyer) (ILD), Roy Wilkins (NAACP), Paul Frederick Brissenden, Jerome Frank, Karl Llewelyn, Charles Erskine Scott Wood, Floyd Dell, Yetta Land, Shad Polier, Thomas Emerson, Alger Hiss, Nathan Witt, Lee Pressman, Abe Fortas, and Joseph Kovner. Of King, Greene said: > She made you feel that unless you took the case or wrote the brief, the guy > would be deported and maybe killed in his home country. Once you grudgingly > committed yourself, you got interested in the legal problems themselves and > they kept you going and doing the best you could. Im a lazy guy myself, but > I really worked on cases Carol got me into. With Joseph Kovner, he edited issues of the International Juridical Association Bulletin. Through the IJA, he came to know prominent Communist union officials, including Ben Gold and Irving Potash. He helped them prepare for legal cases, and then he wrote about those cases in the IJA Bulletin. Of the Bulletin, Greene commented said that the editor tried \\"to understand the day-by-day and month-by-month movements in freedom's ride and to convey this understanding to others.\\" In 1937, with other IJA members, Greene helped write an amici curiae on behalf picketers, whom the U.S. Supreme Court had bared during Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union. In 1938, unlike many other IJA members, Greene refused to help fund a habeas appeal for Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458. In 1939, Greene helped draft a statement for King in her defense in Re Harry Bridges. In 1940, Greene made a speech (soon published as \\"Civil Liberties and the NLRB) at an IJA annual fundraiser dinner in New York City, in which he stated: In the speech, Greene also criticized the ACLU, which \\"hoped that on a level playing field, workers' private collective strength could effectively counter the power of capital. Its onetime allies [i.e., including the IJA] reminded it, unavailingly, that background inequalities made its vision fanciful ‚Äì that employer speech was \\"a protected commodity in a monopoly market.\\" In 1945, King had Greene write the brief for Bridges v. Wixon. \\"In essence, the King-Greene case theor argued that a denial of due process occurred because the government had already litigated the case (via the Landis decision), thereby resulting in a form of double jeopardy. In addition, the law due process was violated since Congress had passed the law under which he was prosecuted after Bridges' earlier legal victories. Personal and death Greene married Rosalinda Fleming; they had one daughter. According to Carol Weiss King's biographer Ann Fagan Ginger, Greene was \\"absolutely convinced, from his work on the injunction book, that workers and unions are essential to democracy.\\" He was director of the American Civil Liberties Union or \\"ACLU,\\" to which he developed a model bill to submit to state legislatures that would curb state courts when issuing labor injunctions. (Also in 1933, IJA co-member Abe Isserman recommended use of the Fifth Amendment for clients during testimony). He was also a director of Roosevelt Field (airport) on Long Island. He was a member of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and of the Harvard Club of New York. Greene died age 62 on October 30, 1964, at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City. Legacy Greene was a Progressive lawyer on par with James Landis, upon whom people like CIO general counsel Lee Pressman called for expert advice. Greene (usually in his works with Frankfurter) remains quoted by legal experts (as cited above). Another quote is: \\"The law must not be asked to be a pioneer in either in ethics, but it ought not to lag behind the common feelings of justice.\\" Works In 1930, Greene co-authored The Labor Injunction with Frankfurther while he was still at Harvard. The book provides \\"an excellent treatment of the reasons underlying the anti-injunction laws.\\" The article was \\"a learned and effective plea against the use of injunctions to curb the self- help methods of organized labor and in favor of the then pending Norris- LaGuardia Act.\\" Rather than withhold withhold from remedy for the wrongs, Greene and Frankfurter argued as follows: > No such interpretation is possible for the proposed bill, which explicitly > applies only to the authority of United States courts 'to issue any > restraining order or injunction.' All other remedies in federal courts and > all remedies in state courts remain available. In their 1931 article \\"Congressional Power Over the Labor Injunction,\\" Greene and Frankfurter wrote: > Is the denial of all adequate judicial remedies in case of an illegal strike > a denial of due process of law? The question is not pertinent, for the bill > only withdraws the remedy of injunction. Civil action for damages and > criminal prosecution remain available instruments. Illegal strikes are not > made legal.

The game was developed by TecMagik, while additional programming was carried out by Head Games Inc for the Genesis version, and by Manley & Associates Inc for the SNES version. Both versions of the game are similar in theme and aesthetics, but different in layout and game mechanics; both versions are ‚Äúone player‚Äù only. Gameplay Super Nintendo Entertainment System When the game is started, the player is taken to a level titled ‚ÄúHoney, I Shrunk The Pink‚Äù (a homage to 1989's Honey, I Shrunk The Kids), which serves as the hub that leads to all the other levels of the game; here, the Pink Panther ‚Äì who, of course, serves as the ‚Äòplayer character‚Äô ‚Äì is shrunken down to the size of a billiard ball, and the player must navigate him through a house to access the other levels whilst avoiding rats, which serve as this level's hazards. The Pink Panther himself starts each level - including ‚ÄúHoney, I Shrunk The Pink‚Äù - off with one unit of extra health, which is represented by a hat he is wearing - the style of hat changes to match the theme of the level the Pink Panther is in. If the Pink Panther runs into or is hit by a hazard, he loses one unit of extra health. If the Pink Panther doesn't have any extra health left, he will not be wearing a hat; and if he runs into or is hit by a hazard without any extra health, he will perish and the player will lose one life ‚Äì the same thing will happen, regardless of the amount of extra health the Pink Panther has on hand, if he falls into an abyss. The player can increase the Pink Panther's extra health by collecting spare hats that have been placed around each level, and the player can gain extra lives by collecting icons shaped like the Pink Panther's head that are also placed around each level. To eliminate hazards, the Pink Panther is equipped with a ‚ÄúFlit Sprayer‚Äù, which the player actuates by pressing ‚ÄòA‚Äô; the player can also eliminate many hazards by having the Pink Panther jump of them. Most hazards will perish when jumped on or sprayed just once, but a few hazards ‚Äì notably bosses at the ends of some levels - will need to sprayed or jumped on multiple times before perishing. Also, throughout each level, the player can also collect ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù that can be used to help eliminate or avoid hazards; the player presses ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù to select a ‚ÄúTrick‚Äù (there are multiple sorts of ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù - e.g. a stoplight causes nearby hazards to freeze, making them easier to avoid or hit), and presses ‚ÄòX‚Äô to execute it. Each trick, when used, will vanish and cease its effect after a certain period of time. Also, to help navigate each level, the Pink Panther can collect tokens that are placed throughout each level and use them to activate ‚ÄúTolls‚Äù that are also placed throughout each level. There are multiple types of tokens that each do something different when deposited in a ‚ÄúToll‚Äù; a token that has stairs on it, for example, will make a flight of stairs appear in front of a ‚ÄúToll‚Äù when deposited in said ‚ÄúToll‚Äù. In addition to regular levels, a bonus area titled ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù can be accessed by collecting one of multiple Star-shaped icons that have been placed throughout most levels of the game, including in ‚ÄúHoney, I Shrunk The Pink‚Äù; ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù takes place in a city-themed nighttime setting - very similar to ‚ÄúCat On A Hot Pink Roof‚Äù, although on the ground instead of on the rooftops - and the only objective is to avoid falling hazards (namely: anvils, safes and grand pianos) and collect useful items (namely: ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù and extra lives) that occasionally spawn were a hazard had fallen after it disappears. This level finishes automatically when the timer ‚Äì which is set to 30 seconds ‚Äì runs out; the player is then sent back to the level from where they collected the Star icon that sent them to ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù. Each time a level is started or re-entered (including ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù), a title screen is briefly shown, where a man holds up a clapperboard that bears the level's title as well as the number of takes (this number increases each time a corresponding level is reentered or retried); the man claps the clapperboard, the screen fades out, and the level then starts/continues. When the player finishes a level, a screen is shown where the player's final score is counted and extra lives may be granted if the player is awarded with enough extra points; with the exception of ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù, this will only happen when the player finishes a level the first time, and will not happen again if the player finishes a level an additional time. Just like with most platform games, the player gets a ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù when the Pink Panther perishes and doesn't have any more extra lives to re-spawn; but rather than being a simple menu that asks if the player wishes to continue, the ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù screen is a level in itself: This ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù level, which starts and ends like any other level in the game (though does not award the player with enough extra points to grant extra lives), takes place in a Studio; the Pink Panther spawns in an area with 2 studio doors, one on ground level marked ‚ÄúExit‚Äù and one high up on a girder marked ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù. Going through the door marked ‚ÄúExit‚Äù will clear the level and reset the game; going through the door marked ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù will take the player back to the level they were on and also replenish the Pink Panther with 5 extra lives, but to get to this door, the player needs to collect a token that has stairs on it - which is placed right above the Pink Panther at the start of the level - and use it at the nearby ‚ÄúToll‚Äù to spawn a staircase that the Pink Panther can climb to get to the door. The timer is also set to 30 seconds, and the game will reset if the player lets it run out; the game will also simply reset if the Pink Panther ever perishes in this level. A secret area behind the doors can also be accessed by activating the debugging mode (see below) and scrolling rapidly to the left side of the screen; this area has multiple unusual icons on high up girders that add extra time to the clock. To complete the game, the player must navigate the Pink Panther through all the levels that can be accessed from ‚ÄúHoney, I Shrunk The Pink‚Äù as well as 4 additional levels that are accessed from within other levels ‚Äì Pink Ranger: Hotel is accessed from within Pink Ranger; Stuffing Battle and Pink Lemonade are accessed from within Refrigerator; and Pink Chill is accessed when Refrigerator is finished. Once the player has cleared all of these levels at least once, a mouse hole will spawn on the bottom right of ‚ÄúHoney, I Shrunk The Pink‚Äù; entering it will complete \\"Honey, I Shrunk The Pink\\" and take the player to another level: \\"Polterpink\\" ‚Äì a haunted castle-themed level. Here, the player must navigate the Pink Panther though said haunted castle, clear another level accessed from within \\"Polterpink\\" - \\"Pinkenstein\\", a Frankenstein laboratory themed level ‚Äì and finally battle and defeat the ghost boss at the end of ‚ÄúPolterpink‚Äù, which will finish the game. What's especially notable about this version of the game is the amount of debugging functionality the developers left intact. Although the game is ‚Äúone player‚Äù only, a second controller can be plugged into the SNES unit and used to activate ‚Äì by pressing ‚ÄòB‚Äô on the second controller ‚Äì a debugging mode which will let the Pink Panther move freely around each level - including in mid air, and through walls and platforms; additionally, the Pink Panther will instantly warp to the other side of the level if he's moved past the left or right edge. This can be used to easily and quickly finish each level. In addition to that, the player can also skip to the next level - in order of level ID - by holding down ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù and pressing ‚ÄúStart‚Äù (note that this cheat will not work while either in ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù or ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù); ‚ÄúPolterpink‚Äù cannot be reached via this method, but it's sub-level, ‚ÄúPinkenstein‚Äù, can be reached via this method. Even with these cheats, however, the ghost boss will not appear at the end of ‚ÄúPolterpink‚Äù unless every other level (excluding ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù, ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHoney, I Shrunk The Pink‚Äù) is cleared at least once; otherwise, a glowing steal gate will remain shut over the door from which the final boss emerges, and it will cause instant and continuous harm to the Pink Panther if he makes contact with it. Sega Genesis Like in the SNES version, The Pink Panther also starts the game shrunken down and inside a house, which also serves as the hub that leads to all the other levels of the game; but unlike the SNES version, the hub isn't a level that's supposed to be finished, and there are no hazards nor abysses that can harm the Pink Panther. From here, the player can navigate the Pink Panther to all the other levels. With the exception of ‚ÄúRefrigerator‚Äù and its sub-levels, after the Pink Panther selects a level, he is taken to a ‚ÄúSound Stage‚Äù that leads to a door ‚Äì with the name of the level on a sign next to it ‚Äì that leads to the start of the level; throughout the ‚ÄúSound Stage‚Äù are multiple hazards, such as falling sandbags and cameras and spotlights that move by themselves ‚Äì which was cause harm to the Pink Panther if he comes in contact with them. After the Pink Panther completes a level, he is taken back to the main hub and a barrier that reads ‚ÄúSet Closed‚Äù lands in front of the completed level's entrance. The Pink Panther has more units of health in this version than he does in the SNES version, and the amount on health he has is indicated to the player via a health bar at the top of the screen. The Pink Panther will loose some of this health if he runs into or is hit by a hazard without; and if he runs out of health, he will perish and the player will lose one life ‚Äì the same thing will happen, regardless of the amount of extra health the Pink Panther has on hand, if he falls into an abyss. The player can increase the Pink Panther's extra health by collecting square icons with a heart on them that have been placed around each level, and the Pink Panther can also gain brief invincibility (which is indicated by the Pink Panther flashing) by collecting square icons with a paw-prints on them. The Pink Panther's health resets to 100% when he/she enters or completes a level. To eliminate hazards, the Pink Panther is equipped with an ‚Äúextending boxing arm‚Äù with which he uses to punch said hazards; this has a slightly wider range than the ‚ÄúFlit Sprayer‚Äù he uses in the SNES version, and this range can even be extended for a short time by collecting a special icon. Some hazards need to be punched multiple times before perishing. Similar to the SNES version, the player can also collect and execute ‚ÄúTricks‚Äù to eliminate hazards, but there are fewer tricks in the Genesis version than there are in the SNES version. Similar to the ‚ÄúTolls‚Äù in the SNES version, hidden ‚ÄúToll Booths‚Äù will pop up when the Pink Panther walks to the right spot, and these help the player navigate to certain parts of a level; to make it work, a player needs to have collected at least one pink icon ‚Äì similar to the tokens which activate the ‚ÄúTolls‚Äù in the SNES version ‚Äì with one of multiple symbols on it (each one activates something different), and the player must use one with the booth to activate the needed transport. Using an icon with an Umbrella on it, for example, makes the booth spawn an Umbrella that the Pink Panther grabs onto and takes him higher up. A score is kept like in the SNES version; but unlike the aforementioned version, the score is always displayed at the bottom of the screen, and it is increased every time the player punches a hazard to collects certain items - most notably, Star Icons that are similar to those in the SNES version that take the Pink Panther to ‚ÄúSafe Area‚Äù (this bonus level is not present in the Genesis version).

He described 260 species and over 70 genera of wasps. Hedqvist was born on 18 July 1917 in Bodarna of V√§sterbotten County in northern Sweden. In 1939, he took his first insect-related job as a field assistant looking at forest pest insects. Retaining a focus on forest entomology, he moved to Stockholm for further studies and an assistant position at the Swedish Forest Research Institute from 1949. In this capacity, he travelled extensively around Sweden, working on pest management. At the same time he was accumulated up a large personal insect collection and started publishing widely (from 1945) on faunistics and applied entomology, on a subjects across the major insect orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Hemiptera. In 1951 he married and settled in Vallentuna, north of Stockholm. He and his wife eventually had two children. In the mid 1950s, Hedqvist embarked upon his career as a taxonomist, describing first a new bark beetle and then what would become a very large number of Hymenoptera species and genera. In 1959 he was employed as a research assistant position at the Swedish Museum of Natural History (NHRM, for Naturhistoriska riksmuseet), where he had the opportunity to focus more on taxonomy. Nevertheless he left the position in favour of employment as a field entomologist back at the Swedish Forest Research Institute in 1963. In 1971, he moved back to the NHRM, holding a newly established position as a taxonomist with special focus on parasitoid wasps, funded by the Swedish Research Council. Hedqvist received an honorary doctorate from Uppsala University in 1977 for his work on the taxonomy of parasitoids. During his time at NHRM he supervised two successful PhD students in the systematics of parasitoid wasps. Hedqvist stayed at the Stockholm museum until his retirement in 1984. After retirement, he kept up his taxonomic and faunistic work from home, as well as his active involvement in the Stockholm Entomological Society, including serving as president, but published only a few more taxonomic contributions. In 2003 he published a checklist of chalcid wasps of Sweden, based primarily on his own collection, that is known as likely the most comprehensive database of Swedish chalcids. He died on 27 December 2009. In 2011 his collection of more than 50,000 Hymenoptera from around the world was purchased from his relatives by the Natural History Museum, London. At least six species of wasps have been named for Hedqvist.

It replaced the excessively long toe of the crakow but also tended to become impractical, as it became enlarged with stuffing and horns and so could be a foot wide, giving the wearer a waddling gait.

E. M. Davis\\"; April 12, 1844 - January 1, 1909) was an American poet, writer, and editor. From the age of 14, she wrote regularly for the press and other periodicals. A critic said of her that she was \\"more thoroughly Texan in subject, in imagery and spirit than any of the Texas poets,\\" and that scarcely any other than a native Texan could \\"appreciate all the merits of her poems, so strongly marked are they by the peculiarities of Texas scenery and patriotism.\\" In 1889, Davis became editor of the New Orleans Picayune. Early years and education Mary Evalina Moore was born in Talladega, Alabama, April 12, 1844. She was the only daughter of Dr. John Moore and Lucy Crutchfield. Her father, born at Oxford, Massachusetts, after receiving classical training and graduating in medicine, had removed to Alabama and there entered upon the practice of his profession. Her mother's family, from a Virginia family, was resident in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and two of her maternal uncles, Thomas and William, attained the rank of colonel, the former in the Confederate, the latter in the Union army. Her father distinguished himself as pioneer in the manufacture of iron in Alabama, discovering the ore in 1848, smelting it with charcoal, and forging it into bars under a trip hammer operated by water power. A few years before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Dr. Moore removed to Texas with his family and engaged in the planting of cotton. It was there at La Rose Blanche Plantation, in Hays County on the banks of the San Marcos River that the early years of Davis were passed. La Rose Blanche Plantation, she received her education from private tutors, and there her talent for versification began to display itself. With her brother, she learned not only to read, but to ride, shoot and swim. Career Molly E. Moore In 1874, she married Major Thomas Edward Davis, for many years the editor of The Daily Picayune. The removed subsequently to New Orleans, and took up their residence in the centre of the old French Quarter. Here, for nearly a generation, Davis dwelt in a house historically famous. Admitted from the first by her rare gifts of mind and manner into the innermost circle of the most exclusive Creole society, she enjoyed advantages for the study of it. These opportunities she exploited to the utmost, making herself for many years a vital part of that society, whose charms she learned to understand, to love, and to reproduce with rare fidelity in a long series of affectionate studies. At the same time, not being to the manner born, but drawing the streams of her life from distant and alien sources, she was able to maintain a certain detachment and objectivity in point of view that lent especial value to her appreciations and characterizations. She was also careful to lay a solid foundation of accurate knowledge beneath her most imaginative constructions, not hesitating to dedicate months of preliminary study to the ascertainment of some historical circumstance or the elucidation of some obscure tradition or custom connected with the plot of her story. Poetry Minding the Gap A Christmas masque of \\"Saint Roch\\", \\"P√®re Dagobert\\", and \\"Throwing the wanga\\" (1896) Davis' first volume of poems, entitled Minding the Gap, and Other Poems (Houston, Texas) was published in 1867, and passed through further editions after being enlarged and corrected. Among the best known and most admired of Davis' short poems were \\"Going Out and Coming In,\\" \\"San Marcos River,\\" \\"Stealing Roses Through the Gate,\\" \\"Lee at the Wilderness,\\" and a few others found in collections of American verse. The mystic prose poem, \\"The Song of the Opal\\", the classical \\"Pere Dagobert,\\" \\"Throwing the Wanga,\\" \\"The Center rigger,\\" and \\"The Elephant's Track,\\" were written for Harper's Magazine, while many poems and sketches were published in other periodicals. Short stories It is in the short-story that Davis has perhaps achieved her most eminent success. Many of these were written for the northern monthlies, and a goodly number were collected and republished in An Elephant's Track and Other Stories. Here she introduced a great variety of motifs as well as of incidents and characters. The lighter and more humorous aspects of life were her favorites, but the stern and terrible problems were occasionally handled with ruthless fidelity and power. As a prose writer, Davis attracted as many readers and as much admiration as when she indulged in verses. Her short stories, such as \\"The Song of the Opal,\\" \\"The Soul of Rose Dede,\\" and \\"A Miracle,\\" were flatteringly received, and a volume of Sketches entitled In War Times at La Rose Blanche (Boston, 1888), elicited such commendations from the press as to call for a French translation for the columns of La Revue des Deux Mondes. \\"Keren Happuch and I\\" was a series of sketches contributed to the New Orleans Picayune. \\"Snaky baked a Hoe-Cake,\\" \\"Grief\\" and others, contributed to Wide Awake in 1876, were among the first, if not the very first, African American Vernacular English stories which appeared in print. Novels The series of works in which Davis has portrayed the life of Texas and Louisiana was the following: In War Times at La Rose Blanche Plantation (Lothrop and Company, Boston); Under the Man-Fig (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, Boston); An Elephant's Track, and Other Stories (Harper and Brothers, New York, 1897); The Story of Texas Under Six Flags (Ginn and Company, Boston, 1898); The Wire Cutters (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1899); The Queen's Garden (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, Boston, 1900); Jaconetta (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, Boston, 1901); The Little Chevalier (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, Boston, 1905); The Price of Silence (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, Boston, 1907); The Bunch of Roses (Small and Maynard, Boston). Of these In War Times at La Rose Blanche Plantation and 'Jaconetta were largely autobiographical, both dealing with the early years of the author's life, but in a modest and unobtrusive fashion that enlisted the liveliest interest of the reader in the many other characters that crowd her pages rather than in her own. Jaconetta\\" was Davis's childhood nickname at La Rose Blanche during the American Civil War. The Story of Texas under Six Flags Under Six Flags is a charmingly written child's history of the \\"Lone Star State\\", in which the romantic features are brought out distinctly, and the mere annalistic details, without sacrifice of historical accuracy, are subordinated to humanistic interests and dramatic effect. It is in fact a Tendenzschrift well calculated to arouse the State pride of the Texan youth and stimulate him to achievement worthy of the descendant of such ancestry as he finds therein described. Under the man-fig The life in Texas furnishes the background for two other books in this list: Under the Man-Fig and The Wire Cutters, both to be numbered with her more important works, both ably written, and both developing ingenious and rather complicated plots through which love stories of grace and charm are guided safely to the end. Davis' novel Under the Man-Fig, was described by a reviewer as \\"a tale at once strongly dramatic, clean and artistic,\\" while her work generally is described by the same writer as being \\"characterized by a keen sense of humor, a fine restrained pathos and a delicate play of fancy.\\" 'In the 'Queen's Garden' (a sweet flower exhaling its fragrance amid the tombs), is an idyl whose scene is laid in New Orleans, agonizing in the paroxysms of one of those fearful visitations of yellow fever, now, thanks to the explorations of science, numbered with the past forever. It is in 'The Little Chevalier,' by many regarded as her masterpiece, and 'The Price of Silence' that Davis has made the most minute and painstaking study of Creole life, manners, and character. The former deals with those early days, in the middle of the Eighteenth Century, when the boundless colonial ambition of France stretched a long thin line of possessions, following the water courses of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a motley web of intrigue, ambition, adventure, war, treachery, devotion, death, with a great variety of incidents and characters, French, Indian, and African, and through all runs the golden thread of a romantic love. 'The Price of Silence' deals with the New Orleans of to-day, though the roots of the story reach back two generations into the past. The theme is not altogether pleasant; the tragedy of color is evoked and only deftly evaded at the close. Not every one will find the treatment satisfactory. Alone among Davis's works this seems to bear some traces of haste in composition. Nor should this circumstance give occasion to wonder; for the book was written on a couch of pain, while the writer was suffering daily and almost continually from an excruciating malady. Produced under such conditions, it seems the most noteworthy of her creations, as in fact it surpasses the rest in boldness of conception, in dramatic situations, and in sustained intensity of interest. But it may be questioned whether any of these longer works show the author at her very best. Literary style and themes In all of her stories, both short and long, it is the pictorial effect that is chiefly sought and most successfully attained. Davis leaves subtle psychological analysis to others, while clearly recognizing, she is little concerned with the problems of heredity and environment, of character evolution, and of the shuttlecock play of emotions and motives. The great elemental feelings in general suffice for her purposes. But she is especially desirous of producing a vivid picture in the mind of the reader. She wishes to depict a situation that shall be convincing in its lifelikeness and verisimilitude. To this end, she summons all the resources of her own personal knowledge and observation, and employs all her powers of animated description. We know or may know the exact appearance of each of her multitudinous characters, the color and curl of the hair, the shape of the nose, lips, and chin, the poise of the head, the cut of the coat, the tone of the voice, and the thousand other details that set themselves together to make up the external personality. Not only this, but she reproduces with the minute exactness of a photograph all the topographical, botanical, and meteorological conditions of the moment in question‚Äîjust how the road wound through the forest, how the river gleamed, how the shadows flitted, how the wistaria bloomed, the arbutus trailed, the magnolia breathed, the banana tree nodded; what streets were overflowed, what signs filled the shop windows, what portraits hung on the walls. One is reminded of some painting of Ernest Meissonier, some battle of Eylau, where the very buckles on the shoes of the grenadier are painted with microscopic care and conscientiousness. These descriptive passages are adorned with frequent felicity of epithet, and bear witness not only to a closely observant eye, but to a nature quickly responsive to the moods and suggestions of the outer world. Almost equally prominent with this pictorial quality is the joy in narrative. The story- telling instinct is indeed very strong in Davis. She plunges with her readers eagerly into the stream of events and is never more delighted than when borne along at its full flood. Very happy, too, is she in the employment of Afro- American superstitions, which she uses not merely for artistic purposes, to enliven a scene or to impart local color to a situation, but also effectively often as causal agencies in the interlinkage of incidents constituting the plot of her story. She understands the Afro-American character well, and loves to depict it. Her management of the Afro-American dialect is good, but she is discreetly sparing, however happy, in her use of such forms of illiterature. \\"Always delicately moving\\" along the upper walks of Creole society, she makes no attempt to vie with \\"Jack Lafaiance\\" in rendering the humbler and more amusing aspects. But especially in 'The Price of Silence', she has given some striking impressionistic sketches of the Creole temperament and peculiarities, and has introduced into the conversations certain Creole idioms and pronunciations, unobtrusively, but with fine artistic effect. Here, as elsewhere, she has held a tight rein upon herself, has offended no propriety, carefully observing due metes and bounds and remembering the ancient wisdom. No sectional feeling shows itself in Davis's writings. The character, Sidney Cortlandt, may possibly appear unnecessarily detestable, but he is not a Northerner, he is a Southern renegade and degenerate. The gentleness of her nature appears in the fact that she is loth to visit great punishment even upon the chief of sinners, but often allows them to escape with less than poetic justice. Personal life In 1874, she married Major Thomas Edward Davis, of Virginia, for many years associated with the Houston Telegram, who later served as editor-in-chief of the Picayune. In 1880, the couple made their home in New Orleans, and every year their historic house in Royal Street received people in town, both French and American residents. With all her social cares, she found time for reading and study and hospitality. She was an accomplished French scholar as well as a lover and student of Spanish literature. She was president of the \\"Geographies\\", a literary circle, and vice-president of the \\"Quarante\\", a large and fashionable literary club. In both those organizations, she was recognized as a mental guide, philosopher and friend. Moore died at her home in New Orleans on January 1, 1909.

Photo by Notman.Charles Macdonald (19 July 1828 - 11 March 1901) was a Scottish- Canadian mathematician and educator. Born in Aberdeen, Scotland, Macdonald studied at King's College, Aberdeen, earning degrees in the arts and divinity. The Church of Scotland named Macdonald the chair in mathematics at Dalhousie College in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which he held until his death in 1901. He was an advocate for education reform in Nova Scotia, and was a significant presence for Dalhousie in Halifax. Dalhousie's first library, Macdonald Memorial Library, was named in his honour by former students who raised money to build it. Early life and education MacDonald attended King's College, Aberdeen and studied arts and divinity. In 1850 he was awarded the Hutton Prize, which was reserved for the student who had performed best in the arts curriculum. He earned a Master of Arts, and then studied divinity, earning a licentiate in the Church of Scotland. Career After earning his licentiate, MacDonald became an educator. He was teaching at Aberdeen Grammar School when in 1863 he was named by the Church of Scotland to hold the chair of mathematics at Dalhousie College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. During his first lecture at Dalhousie, Macdonald criticized the existing system in Nova Scotia of different colleges run by Christian denominations, and called for a unified university for Nova Scotia. Macdonald's speech sparked a debate in Nova Scotia in the 1870s about education reform, and was cited in the 1920s as Nova Scotia began a new education reform process. Macdonald was considered the most popular member of the faculty at the time. He was the strictest professor with the students, but was known for his wit. He was a frequent public speaker in Halifax, and he increased the presence of Dalhousie in the town. The Macdonald Building commemorates Professor MacDonald Personal life Macdonald married Maryanne Stairs in 1882 in Halifax. She died in 1883 during childbirth, and Macdonald lived alone with their son, not remarrying. Death and legacy  Macdonald caught a cold and died of pneumonia on 11 March 1901. He was still teaching five days before his death. Macdonald left Dalhousie $2,000 to buy books for its library. Following his gift, alumni who had been his students raised funds to build a library at the university to honour him, and in 1914, the cornerstone for Macdonald Memorial Library was laid. It would serve as the primary library for Dalhousie until the 1970s.

Background Joseph Kovner was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, circa 1910. He had at least one sister, Florence. In 1934, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale Law School, where he was editor of the Yale Law Review. Career From 1934 to 1936, Kovner worked in private practice in New York City. In 1936, he moved to Washington, DC, where he served as counsel on the U.S. Senate Committee on Railroad Finance. International Juridical Association In 1932, Kovner became editor of the International Juridical Association Bulletin, who recruited Nathan Greene to join him. In 1941, Kovner's name appeared in an \\"Investigation of Un-American Activities and Propaganda\\" special report as former editor of the IJA Bulletin. By 1941, his name appeared as a member of the national committee of the National Lawyers Guild. (By 1941, the IJA had merged into the NLG.) Congress of Industrial Organizations In February 1937, Kovner joined Lee Pressman, already general counsel, as assistant counsel for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). By mid-1937, Kovner had pulled in Anthony Wayne Smith, another Yale Law School graduate, who had worked for Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot (1934‚Äì1937) and then the law firm of William Donovan (where fellow IJA colleague Nathan Witt had also worked). Kovner and Smith were \\"legal technicians\\" to Pressman's development of policy and strategy. In early 1937, prior to the outbreak of the Little Steel Strike, Kovner wrote an early report that persistent, entrenched anti-union efforts by steel industrialists throughout the 1930s rendered the CIO dependent on \\"decisions and administrative rulings of a reinvigorted NLRB\\" and on support from the courts. He noted that court decisions did not take note of a company's union status.\\" Also, issues like \\"union bargaining and minority rights were not answered.\\" Later, Kovner recalled that the CIO viewed the NLRB \\"as essentially doing the work of the CIO.\\" Later in 1937, Pressman sent Kovner and Meyer Bernstein into towns affected by the Little Steel Strike. When the CIO held its first constitutional convention in 1938, Kovner was secretary of the committee which drafted the constitution.Heads Ignore Desertion by Garment Unit, The Pittsburgh Press (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) November 11, 1938, page 1, accessed September 26, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14011767/ In 1939, Kovner, Smith, and Bernstein helped Pressman prepare CIO testimony against the American Federation of Labor and against industrialist charges against the National Labor Relations Act. Later, Kovner recalled: > Pressman was the power guy. He was the man who would push things on the > power front. He would take a position and go forward with it, and would > catch up with the law. In 1941, Kovner and Smith broke with Pressman as factionalism developed with the CIO over its policies. A central issue was CIO's foreign policy, heavily influenced by Pressman's push for pro-Soviet stance. For example, after the Hitler-Stalin Pact became public in September 1939, Pressman remained pro- Soviet, while Kovner and Smith let anti-Nazism guide them. In early years of World War II, the pact led Pressman to oppose the Lend Lease Act. Kovner and Smith also supported the policies of the CIO's new president Philip Murray, while Pressman remained loyal to founding president John L. Lewis. Smith moved to work with John Brophy, while Kovner moved over to work with Allen Haywood. Pressman replaced them with Eugene Cotton. In 1948, Kovner appeared before the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. Kovner was again in front of a Senate committee in February 1949 during debates over the CIO supported repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act which restricted union power. Kovner proposed setting up a new commission to, for six months, study different forms of compulsory union membership and to determine what regulations, if any, should be made to protect workers rights. While the commission was working, the Taft-Hartley Act could be repealed and less stringent limits on unions put in place, and Kovner believed that unions would be unlikely to act radically during that period.Childs, Marquis.

Her appointment book of 1938 showed a list of attendees (at a Communist-affiliated conference by the Industrial Relations Institute in Mexico City) that included Joseph Kovner, CIO lawyer. In 1953, Kovner left the CIO and returned to private practice, based out of Concord, New Hampshire. In Concord, Kovner continued to have a public face, during the visit of a congressional committee, Kovner spoke out against militarism and in favor of foreign aid.Congressmen Hold Grass Roots Hearing on Foreign Aid in N.H.

By the time he retired 16 years later in 1974, he was assistant chief of the Court of Claims Section of DOJ's Tax Division. National Wildlife Federation After his retirement in 1974, Kovner served as volunteer lawyer for the National Wildlife Federation. Personal and death In 1942, Kovner married Mary Helen Gion (died 1992); they had three children, including scientist Ellen Kovner Silbergeld. (One biography of Silbergeld mentions that Joseph Kovner \\"was a liberal lawyer who was ousted from his government job by the House Un-American Activities Committee\\" who then moved to New Hampshire and only returned to Washington \\"when the political climate had changed enough.\\") Kovner and his wife were Quakers. In Washington, they were members of the Florida Avenue Friends Meeting and the Bethesda Friends Meeting. Later, in Guilford, Maryland, they joined the Homewood Friends Meeting. Carol Weiss King's biographer Ann Fagan Ginger describes Kovner as \\"very bright, able, and decent, a compassionate person amid the sharks of the New York legal world\\" who, leading the IJA Bulletin editors, \\"argued out the jurisdiction and style of their new periodical with care.\\" Kovner died age 84 on April 30, 1994, of congestive heart failure following pneumonia in Brooklandville near Baltimore, Maryland.

Biography Little is known for certain about Bernal's background, life, or career. Sources say that he was a native of Santiago de Compostela, which is in the modern Spanish Province of A Coru√±a. He mentions a place called \\"Bonaval\\" in several of his poems. The original Galician- Portuguese texts of Bernal's eight surviving cantigas d'amigo, with scholarly notes. It has been suggested that he was born outside the mediaeval city walls of Santiago, because \\"de Bonaval\\" may refer to the Convent of San Domingos de Bonaval, which is outside those walls. It has also been suggested that \\"Bernal de Bonaval\\" and (in Latin) \\"Frater Bernardus, prior Bone Uallis\\" (\\"Brother Bernardus, prior of Bone Uallis\\") may have been one and the same. If that suggestion is correct, then Bernal may have been a friar in the Dominican Order, and \\"de Bonaval\\" may refer to the convent rather than to his birthplace. He was active in the 13th century. Some sources suggest that he may have been born in the 12th century. He was known at the courts of Fernando III and Alfonso X (kings of Galicia 1231-1252 and 1252-1284 respectively). A poem of 1266 by King Alfonso X directed at the troubadour mentions Bernal: \\"V√≥s nom trobades come proen√ßal, / mais come Bernaldo de Bonaval; / por ende nom √© trobar natural / pois que o del e do dem'aprendestes\\" (\\"You do not compose like a Proven√ßal / but like Bernaldo de Bonaval / and therefore your poetry-making is not natural / for you learned it from him and from the [D]evil\\"). Bernal was also mentioned in verse by the troubadours , Jo√£o Baveca and Pedro (Pero) da Ponte. It has been suggested in recent times by one author that Bernal may have had a reputation as a passive homosexual, and may have been the same man as the one nicknamed \\"Bernal Fundado\\" (i.e. \\"Bernal the Split\\").A modern claim that someone in mediaeval times was or may have been homosexual should perhaps be treated with caution unless there is convincing contemporary evidence. In those days, an accusation that a rival or enemy was guilty of the sin and crime of sodomy seems not to have been uncommon. For example, it was made in the 13th century during Bernal's lifetime against the Cathars in the Albigensian Crusade in the south of France. Works He is one of the earliest known xograres or segreis (Galician troubadours). Nineteen of his works have survived: ten ' (on the theme of courtly love), eight cantigas de amigo, and one tens√≥n. He introduced popular motifs and realistic features into what had been a scholastic form of poetry. He has been called \\"Villonesque\\", even though Fran√ßois Villon lived two centuries later. His songs have been preserved in the Cancioneiro da Vaticana (CV 660) and the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional (CBN 1003). Legacy and critical reception R√∫a de Bernal de Bonaval (a street) in Santiago de Compostela is named after him. In 1961, Brazilian scholar ranked him among the principal troubadours. The 1971 album Cantigas de Amigos includes a duet between Portuguese artists Am√°lia Rodrigues and Ary Dos Santos called \\"Vem esperar meu amigo\\". It is a version of Bernal's cantiga de amigo \\"Ai, fremosinha, se ben ajades\\", named from its refrain rather than from its first line.That source does not name the author of the original text which it quotes, but it is identical to that of Bernal's \\"Ai, fremosinha, se ben ajades\\". Spanish musician included his version of Bernal's \\"A dona que eu amo\\" on his 1984 album Leliadoura. In 1985, Portuguese scholar Ribeiro Miranda published an academic paper analysing Bernal's importance. In 1994, Galician writer Castelao named Bernal among the notable Galicians. In 2012, Galician scholar Souto Cabo called him \\"uma das personalides po√©ticas mais c√©lebres dos nossos cancioneros\\" (\\"one of the most famous poets in our songbooks\\").

Michael the Black Man can be seen holding a sign, reading, \\"Blacks for Trump 2020.com\\". Michael the Black Man (born Maurice Woodside), also known as Michael Symonette and Mikael Israel, is an American political figure from Miami, Florida. An outspoken supporter of current President of the United States Donald Trump, he is known for appearing at Trump's rallies both before and after the 2016 election and is often seen holding a \\"Blacks for Trump\\" sign at these rallies. Biography Membership in Yahweh ben Yahweh cult Woodside first met Hulon Mitchell Jr., better known as Yahweh Ben Yahweh, in 1980. Along with his brother, Ricardo, who joined the cult before he did, Woodside was reported to have played \\"a big role in the rise and fall of the Yahweh Ben Yahweh cult\\" (part of the Black Hebrew Israelites movement). His mother, Johnnie Simmons, was also a devout member of the cult; he later left the cult with his sister after his mother died. He was one of 16 members of Yahweh ben Yahweh arrested and charged with one count of murder and one count of attempted murder in 1990. He was found not guilty of these charges by a Florida jury in 1992, although Yahweh himself was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in prison. At the trial, Ricardo testified that he and Maurice attempted unsuccessfully to murder Eric Burke, a dissident member of Yahweh's cult, and that Maurice had also helped beat another cult member, Aston Green, unconscious. Later career and reinvention Woodside subsequently became a rabid opponent of the Democratic Party, changed his name to Michael Symonette, and began a career as a musician. He later started a radio station, BOSS 104.1 FM, before reinventing himself as \\"Michael the Black Man\\". He briefly came to media attention in September 2008, when he accused Oprah Winfrey of being the devil, and Barack Obama of being endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, at one of Obama's speeches in Coral Gables. In 2012, he spoke to the audience at a Rick Santorum campaign rally in Coral Springs, where he said that the Democrats were \\"the worst thing that ever happen [sic] to the black man.\\" As of August 2017, he runs multiple conspiracy theory-promoting websites, including Gods2.com, which he frequently promotes on his shirt at Trump rallies.

She belonged to the most successful business entrepreneurs of Stockholm and described as the center figure of Stockholm fashion trade during the Gustavian age. Life Barbara Pauli was reportedly of French origin, daughter of the French court jeweler Pierre Pauli. In October 1775, she was given royal permission to open a fashion shop in Stockholm and manufacture, import and sell fashion items. She was at that point 22 or 23 years old and unmarried. Her trade permit was given by the crown, and was thereby in fact a dispensation over the head of the Silk- and Clothing Guild, who objected to it. It was common for women in Stockholm to be given a dispensation by the crown to manage a business, because such permits were otherwise normally issued by the Guilds, and it was hard for women to be given a trade permit by the guilds because it was difficult (albeit not impossible) for them to become guild members, so most businesswomen sidestepped the guilds by an appeal to the crown instead, and such appeals were normally successful. However, the case of Barbara Pauli was unusual because other women in her position motivated their appeal by claiming that they only wished to start a small business to support themselves: Pauli, on the other hand, stated no such reason in her application, and her business were not to be a small business for self-support, but a big and hugely lucrative business enterprise which seriously threatened her rivals in the guilds. Temple du Go√ªt Her fashion shop was named Temple du Go√ªt and situated at the V√§sterl√•nggatan street by the square Mynttorget not far from the Royal Palace, and side by side with the business of Mrs Holming, which was one of the first Konditorei in Sweden. Pauli owned and managed her fashion shop, and imported and sold the latest French fashion items. She also manufactured such items in the latest French style by the help of orphan girls from the Stora Barnhuset, who were pupils in the fashion trade, and whom she used as assistants in her trade. In 18th-century Sweden, the professional making of clothing was under monopoly of the Taylor's Guild, and professional seamstresses were formally not allowed to make entire clothes, only to remake old models or make parts of clothes, but in practice, this regulation was not respected nor did the authorities enforce it. Formally, however, the Pauli workshop only manufactured French models of caps, shawls, ribbons and other fashion accessories. Barbara Pauli is described as the most famed fashion trader in contemporary Stockholm, and her Temple du Go√ªt as the center of fashion of Gustavian age Stockholm. In 1780, her success is evident from the fact that only one of the traders of Norrmalm was taxed for more than her, and only two of the Norrmalm tailors was taxed as much as she. In literature Barbara Pauli was a well known figure in contemporary Stockholm. She is mentioned in the poem R√•d i en angel√§gen sak ('Advice in a Difficult Task') by Anna Maria Lenngren from 1780; in the poem Ny√•rsvers ('New Year's Verse') by Johan Henric Kellgren from 1781, and in the first part of the history- and topography book of Stockholm by Johan Elers, Stockholm from 1800.

In June 2017, members of the group were present at an ACT! for America-sponsored \\"March against Sharia\\" protest in front of the downtown Federal Building in Syracuse, New York. The event was met by a larger group of counter-protesters. The Light Foot Militia group stated \\"they did not support either side, but were there to make sure all sides were able to excise their First Amendment rights.\\" In August 2017, members of the NYLFM, along with militiamen from several other states, were present during the \\"Unite the Right rally,\\" a far-right gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia. The group carried rifles at the event. Although the groups were initially invited by the white nationalist organizers of rally, the militia groups said that they had come \\"in a neutral stance.\\" The NYLFM's \\"commanding officer,\\" George Curbelo, criticized the Charlottesville Police Department for failing to separate opposing sides during the rally. Mother Jones magazine reported that \\"a group of assault-rifle-toting militia members from New York State, wearing body armor and desert camo, played a more active role in breaking up fights\\" than police did. In October 2017, the New York Light Foot Militia was named as one of several defendants in a lawsuit filed by the Georgetown University Law Center's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection on behalf of the City of Charlottesville and several Charlottesville businesses and neighborhood associations.

It was active as a US military base between 1945 and 1994. The facility was occupied after World War II and designated Ferris Barracks in honor of Second Lieutenant (2LT) Geoffrey Cheney Ferris. Ferris Barracks was closed on 28 June, 1994, and officially turned over to the German government. Though largely dismantled, certain historic buildings and monuments have been preserved and converted for alternative use. The area has undergone extensive construction and is now referred to as R√∂thelheimpark.  History   Early Use  Until the 18th century, soldiers stationed in Erlangen were quartered by private citizens. After its transition to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, Erlangen tried several times to become a garrison town. Beginning in 1868, several small kaserne (English: barracks) were established. In 1890, the 19th Royal Bavarian Infantry Regiment (German: K√∂niglich Bayerisches 19. Infantrie Regiment), part of the III Royal Bavarian Corps (German: III. K√∂niglich Bayerisches Armee-Korps), was permanently stationed in Erlangen. To accommodate regimental units, a drill area of 150 hectares (370 acres) was purchased and set aside as an Exerzierplatz (English: drill area), and construction began on a new infantry kaserne along Luitpoldstra√üe (present day Drausnickstra√üe), to the north of the drill area. In 1893, a hospital was established for the garrison in the northwest corner of the drill area. In 1901, the 10th Royal Bavarian Artillery Regiment (German: K√∂niglich Bayerisches 10. Feldartillerie-Regiment) was relocated to a new kaserne built on the northern edge of the drill area. This new kaserne was called simply Artillerie-Kaserne (English: Artillery Barracks). Through 1904, additional buildings were erected on the artillery kaserne including staff buildings, guard houses, a stockade, hay-, straw- and oats-magazines, wagon houses, a scale, stables and other workshops. In 1912 the Offizierspeiseanstalt (English: Officer's Mess), also called the Kasino, was built. During World War I, both regiments fought on the front lines. The drill area was used as a Prisoner of War (POW) camp during the war. In 1915, the number of Russian, French and Italian prisoners interned there was approximately 3,600.  Weimar Republic  With the armistice on November 11, 1918, most soldiers were discharged and were released into private life. After the war, Erlangen retained its status as a garrison town, however due to restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, only select smaller training units remained at the garrison. The original infantry barracks fell into disuse by the military and control of that facility reverted to the city. It was later used to house refugees. Beginning in 1923, the garrison hospital was converted to a skin clinic used by the Friedrich-Alexander University. On 1 October, 1922, a monument was erected in front of the Kasino, named Gefallenendenkmal f√ºr das 10. Feldartillerie-Regiment (English: Memorial to the Fallen of the 10th Field Artillery Regiment).  World War II  The reintroduction of conscription in 1935 and subsequent rearmament led to a massive expansion of military facilities in Erlangen. On 16 March, 1935, construction began on a second artillery kaserne located on the northeast corner of the drill area to the east and adjacent to the original Artilleriekaserne. On 1 October, 1935, two batteries from the 17th Artillery Regiment occupied the new artillery kaserne. In 1936, the Wehrmacht (English: defense forces) took control of these facilities. In 1938, a new panzer (English: tank) kaserne complex was constructed on the drill area south of the original garrison hospital along Hartmannstra√üe. Originally called Panzerkaserne, it was occupied by the 25th Panzer Regiment, along with regimental and department staff, and included a new hospital. It was later renamed Villers-Brettoneux-Kaserne, after the Second Battle of Villers-Bretoneux in the first world war, which saw the first use of German tanks in battle. The two artillery kaserne were also renamed. The original artillery kaserne, which had been home to the 10th Field Artillery Regiment was renamed St. Mihiel-Kaserne, after the town of St. Mihiel, France, where the 10th Field Artillery fought for nearly two years during the first world war. The new artillery kaserne was named Rheinland Kaserne, in honor of the remilitarization of the Rheinland in March of 1936 by the German Army. In total, approximately 48 buildings and structures were erected on the drill square between 1935 and 1938. The outbreak of the second world war brought construction on these sites to a standstill. The Villers- Bretonneux-Kaserne was home to the Panther tank training center from 1943, due to its proximity to the tank's manufacturer, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N√ºrnberg AG (MAN), in Nuernberg, and to the Grafenwoehr training area. Most Panther officers, drivers, driving instructors and repair technicians of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS were trained in Erlangen at the Panzer-Ersatz und Ausbildungs- Abteilung 25 (English: Tank Replacement and Training Unit 25). Buildings on the St. Mihiel-Kaserne were used to quarter soldiers and units undergoing Panther tank training. Plaque honoring Ohly and Lorleberg in Lorlebergplatz in Erlangen At the close of World War II, the defense of Erlangen fell under the military authority of Oberstleutnant (English: Lieutenant-Colonel) Werner Lorleberg, a pastor's son and professional soldier. After many exchanges, the Oberb√ºrgermeister (English: Lord Mayor) of Erlangen, Dr. Herbert Ohly, convinced Lorleberg that Adolf Hitler's order to fight on at all costs was pointless. On 16 April, 1945, Ohly and Lorleberg offered to hand over the city of Erlangen to the 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, 7th US Army without a fight. Lorleberg explained that there were approximately 120 soldiers in the Thalerm√ºhle mill complex who refused to surrender. The US colonel rejected the offer to surrender and gave Lorleberg until 2:00 PM to convince these soldiers to surrender peacefully, or he would fire on the city. Lorleberg, along with police lieutenant Andreas Fischer and their driver, Thomas Pfannenm√ºller, went by car under a white flag to the Thalerm√ºhle mill complex in the Regnitzwiesen. The driver remained with the vehicle while Lorleberg and Fischer went inside the Firma Mobius to order the soldiers to surrender. Lorleberg did not managed to convince the soldiers to surrender, and he was killed, whether by suicide or by a disgruntled soldier, as he walked out of the building. The police officer, who waited in front of the building, heard a single shot as Lorleberg was approaching the exit. A memorial was erected in 1955 near the place where he fell. In his honor, Kaiser Wilhelm Platz in Erlangen was renamed to Lorlebergplatz on November 1, 1945. The city of Erlangen was spared further destruction, and US forces soon occupied what then became known as Ferris Barracks; bounded on the west by Hartmannstra√üe, on the north by Artilleriestra√üe, on the east by present day Kurt-Schumacherstra√üe and on the south by present day Staudtstra√üe.  2LT Geoffrey C. Ferris  Geoffrey Cheney Ferris was born on 8 April, 1918, in New Haven, Connecticut. He was the youngest of four children born to Walter Lewis Ferris and Alice Josephine Cheney. Next to his photograph in his high school yearbook is printed \\"None but himself can be his parallel\\". Prior to joining the Army, Ferris joined the Connecticut National Guard as a private on 19 September, 1940. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 24 February, 1941, holding that grade until his separation on 4 December, 1941. Ferris enlisted in the Army as a private on 23 January, 1942, at Hartford, Connecticut. After Officer Candidate School Class 23-42 at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and served as an artillery observer assigned to the 6th Battalion, 33rd Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. On the morning of 6 May, 1943, Lieutenant Ferris reported to Company E, 26th Infantry Regiment. Seeing that it was impossible to secure a suitable observation post in the area occupied by Company E, Lieutenant Ferris, carrying a field phone and wire reel, advanced several hundred yards beyond the front lines before being mortally wounded by enemy fire. He died the next day. Initially interred in Tunisia, he was re- interred at the Long Island National Cemetery in New York. Lieutenant Ferris was posthumously awarded the Silver Starand the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. The citation for his award reads: File:Award of Distinguished Service Cross to 2LT Geoffrey C. Ferris.jpgDSC Award File:General Order 39 HQ 1st Infantry Division - 14 August 1943.jpgSilver Star Award Ferris Barracks was named in his honor and he was further honored in the Congressional Record on 17 June, 2003, during a ceremony dedicating the Headquarters Building, 1st Battalion, 33rd Field Artillery Regiment in Bamberg, Germany in his name. Soldiers who undergo Basic Training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, are eligible for the Geoffrey C. Ferris Award upon graduation. It is given for ‚Äúunwavering dedication to the mission and perseverance in the face of adversity, emulating the highest ideals of bravery and heroism.‚Äù  Naming  The facility was officially designated Ferris Barracks in honor of Second Lieutenant (2LT) Geoffery C. Ferris on 11 May, 1949, by General Lucius D. Clay, then head of the European Command. The facility may have been known informally as Ferris Barracks before that date; purportedly named by General George S. Patton upon his arrival in Erlangen on 22 April, 1945. Excerpt of General Order 41.  Closure  Ferris Barracks was selected for closure as part of the general drawdown of forces in Germany at the end of the Cold War. A ceremony was held on 16 September, 1993, marking the departure of the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division from Ferris Barracks. At the beginning of the drawdown there were approximately 3,500 soldiers stationed there. On 28 June, 1994, Ferris Barracks was closed and officially handed over to the German Government. The city of Erlangen acquired the former installation. Older structures from the original Artillerie-Kaserne as well as monuments were protected under the Denkmalschutz (English: monument protection), with most modern buildings being demolished. Historic buildings have been refurbished and converted for alternative use such as businesses, restaurants, shopping and university buildings.

One of the first homes constructed in the area, lumber for its construction was transported from McFadden's Wharf in Newport Beach, California, by horse-drawn wagon. The gravel for the cement foundation was hauled from the beach at what is now Huntington Beach. The Newland ranch contained vegetable gardens, orchards, a variety of farm animals, and pet peacocks; it covered more than 500 acres of land. Celery and sugar beets were the main product of the ranch's gardens, though other crops were also grown. The outbuildings contained a large barn, stables, corrals and bunkhouses for ranch hands. During the early years, water was obtained from a natural spring near the present day intersection of Adams Avenue and Beach Boulevard. William Newland later developed a water well closer to the Newland House and constructed a water tower.City of Huntington Beach Public Library archival records The water tower was reproduced in the 21st Century by the Huntington Beach Historical Society in the back yard of the Newland House.

His mother died in 1869, leaving him orphaned at age 19. He went to work on the farm of John M. DeLapp, whose daughter, Mary Juanita DeLapp, he married six years later.California of the South Vol. III, by John Steven McGroarty, Pages 131-135, Clarke Publ., Chicago, Los Angeles, Indianapolis. 1933. A biographical account of William Taylor Newland in 1933 noted, Mary Juanita DeLapp was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1859, and was married to William Taylor Newland in 1875. She served on the local school board for sixteen years, founding the Huntington Beach Township's first parent-teacher organization in 1908. She was a charter member of the Huntington Beach Woman's Club and in 1939 was named \\"Woman of the Year\\" in recognition of her community service. The Newlands moved from Illinois to California during the land boom of the 1880s. William purchased five-hundred acres of the former Rancho La Bolsa Chica in 1897, paying carpenters $2.50 per day to clear the land and begin construction of the Newland's home.City of Huntington Beach public library archival records The Newlands moved into their home in the summer of 1898. William Newland died of a heart attack on his ranch in 1933 at age 83.\\"W.T. Newland, Pioneer, Dies at H.B. Ranch\\", Santa Ana Register, May 20, 1933 Mary Juanita DeLapp Newland continued to live in the home until her death in 1952, at the age of ninety- three. Ten Newland children were raised in the house and two born in the house.

Located in southwestern Idaho in Elmore County, the base is southwest of Mountain Home, which is southeast of Boise via Interstate 84. The base is also used by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), which has a detachment of F-15SG fighters on long term assignment to the base and a squadron composing of RSAF and USAF personnel.https://www.mountainhome.af.mil/News/Article- Display/Article/309555/republic-of-singapore-air-force-unit-activates/ The host unit at Mountain Home since 1972 has been the 366th Fighter Wing (366 FW) of the Air Combat Command (ACC), nicknamed the \\"Gunfighters.\\" The base's primary mission is to provide combat airpower and combat support capabilities to respond to and sustain worldwide contingency operations. Constructed in the early 1940s during World War II as a training base for bombers, after the war it briefly had transports, then was a bomber and missile base. It became a fighter base in 1966. Part of the base is a census-designated place (CDP); the population was 3,238 at the 2010 census. History Crews started building the base in November 1942 and the new field officially opened on 7 August 1943. Shortly thereafter, airmen at the field began training U.S. Army Air Forces crews for World War II. The 396th Bombardment Group (Heavy) was the first unit assigned and its planned mission was to train crews for the B-17 Flying Fortress. However, before the first B-17s arrived, plans for the field changed and the 396th was transferred to Moses Lake AAF, Washington. leftInstead of training B-17 crews, Mountain Home airmen began training crews for the B-24 Liberator. The first group to do so was the 470th Bombardment Group (Heavy), which trained at Mountain Home from May 1943 until January 1944, when the unit moved to Tonopah AAF Nevada. The 490th Bombardment Group (Heavy) replaced the 470th and trained B-24 crews until it deployed to RAF Eye England in April 1944. The 494th Bombardment Group then replaced the 490th, once more training Liberator crews. The base was placed in inactive status in October 1945. Postwar era The base remained inactive for over three years, until December 1948, when the newly independent U.S. Air Force reopened the base. The 4205th Air Base Group, was activated on 12 December to prepare the newly re-designated Mountain Home Air Force Base for operational use. Three wings of the Air Resupply and Communications Service used the base in the early 1950s. In 1953, the base was transferred to Strategic Air Command which assigned its 9th Bombardment Wing to Mountain Home. The 9th relocated to Mountain Home AFB in May 1953, and began flying B-29 bombers and KB-29H refueling aircraft. The 9th began converting to the new B-47 Stratojet bomber and the KC-97 tanker in September 1954, keeping alert bombers ready for war at a moments notice and continuing its mission as a deterrent force throughout the Cold War years of the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1959, construction of three SM-68 Titan missile sites began in the local area. The 569th Strategic Missile Squadron controlled these sites and was assigned to the 9th Bombardment Wing in August 1962. To prepare for the addition of missiles to its bomber forces, the U.S. Air Force redesignated the wing as the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing in April 1962. A few years later, the Strategic Air Command mission at Mountain Home began to wind down, and in November 1964, the U.S. Air Force announced that the missile sites would be closed. In late 1965, the U.S. Air Force also began phasing out the aging B-47 bomber and announced plans to bring the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing to Mountain Home. 366th Fighter Wing The 366th Fighter Wing (in various designations) has been the host unit at Mountain Home for over 35 years, following its return from the Vietnam War in late 1972. Before the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing's arrival at Mountain Home, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical Fighter Squadrons had returned from South Vietnam, joined the 347th, and began converting to F-111A aircraft. For the first time since it left for Vietnam, the wing once again had its three original flying units. During 1969, a tenant unit began operating at the south end of the base, using part of the original SAC alert area, and about half of the Mole Hole alert facility, sharing the other half with an NCO leadership school from the main base. Det. 1, 320 BW carried out an alert mission with two B-52 bombers and two KC-135 tankers. The unit disbanded in the spring of 1975 and returned to Mather AFB. Operations continued unchanged for several years. The wing tested its readiness in August 1976 when a border incident in Korea prompted the U.S. to augment its military contingent in South Korea as a show of force. The 366th deployed a squadron of 20 F-111 fighters, which reached Korea only 31 hours after receiving launch notification. Tensions eased shortly afterward and the detachment returned home.EF-111A Raven in 1987 In early 1991, the Air Force announced that the 366th would become the Air Force's premier \\"air intervention\\" composite wing. The wing would grow with the addition of a squadron of EF-111A Raven electronic warfare aircraft and a squadron of B-1B Lancer bombers to become a dynamic, five squadron wing with the ability to deploy rapidly and deliver integrated combat airpower. The air intervention composite wing's rapid transition from concept to reality began in October 1991 when Air Force redesignated the wing as the 366th Wing. The wing's newly reactivated \\"fighter squadrons\\" became part of the composite wing in March 1992. The 389th Fighter Squadron began flying the dual-role F-16C Fighting Falcon, while the 391st Fighter Squadron was equipped with the new F-15E Strike Eagle. These two squadrons provide Gunfighters round-the-clock precision strike capability. Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the resultant initiation of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), the 366th Wing once again got the call. While the 34th Bomb Squadron deployed to Diego Garcia as the B-1 component of the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing, the wing sent a Base Operations Support package to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, to transform the bare base into a fully functional airfield for large-scale combat operations. In October 2001, the 391st Fighter Squadron deployed to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, while the 389th Fighter Squadron went to Al Udeid in November. Following the wing's return from Southwest Asia, the Air Force began consolidating its B-1 Lancer and KC-135 Stratotanker forces. This led to the reallocation of the wing's bombers and tankers. The 22 ARS' aircraft began transferring to McConnell AFB, Kansas, in May 2002 and the squadron inactivated the following August. The 34 BS' B-1Bs began moving to Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, in June and the squadron officially moved in September. Following the departure of these assets, the Air Force re-designated the 366th as a Fighter Wing. With these changes, the wing's 10-year mission as the Air Force's only standing air expeditionary wing came to an end. A continued reconstruction of the 366 Fighter Wing was official with the 2005 base realignment, coinciding with the large scale integration of the 150+ F-22 Raptors. After the F-16 departure, Mountain Home AFB was chosen to become an F-15E installation because of its ideal training terrain range that is suited for air-to-ground, and air-to-air training missions. =Thunderbirds crash= F-16C at MHAFB on 14 September 2003. The base was the site of a Thunderbirds crash on 14 September 2003 in which no one was killed. Captain Chris Stricklin, flying Thunderbird 6 (opposing solo, serial #87-0327), attempted a \\"Split S\\" maneuver (which he had performed over 200 times) immediately after takeoff based on an incorrect mean-sea-level elevation. Similar in desert appearance, MHAFB is higher than the Thunderbirds' home at Nellis AFB near Las Vegas, Nevada. Climbing to only above ground level (AGL) instead of , Stricklin had insufficient altitude to complete the descending half-loop maneuver. He guided the F-16C aircraft down runway 30, away from the spectators and ejected less than one second before impact. His parachute deployed when he was just above the ground and Stricklin survived with only minor injuries. No one on the ground was injured, but the $20 million aircraft was destroyed. Official procedure for demonstration \\"Split-S\\" maneuvers was changed, and the USAF now requires Thunderbird pilots and airshow ground controllers to both work in above mean-sea-level (AMSL) altitudes, as opposed to ground control working in AGL and pilots in AMSL, which led to two sets of numbers that had to be reconciled by the pilot. Thunderbird pilots now also climb an extra before performing the Split S maneuver. This article includes a link to the cockpit video of the ejection.

Episodes of After Trek were released on All Access after each episode of Discovery was released, beginning with that show's premiere on September 24, 2017, and running through to its season finale on February 11, 2018. In addition to guest interviews, each episode of the aftershow also included live interactive polls and behind-the-scenes segments. By June 2018, CBS had decided to re-imagine After Trek for the second season of Discovery. In January 2019, After Trek was canceled and replaced by The Ready Room, a new interview-based aftershow hosted by Naomi Kyle and streamed on Facebook Live. Development By July 2016, CBS was working on an aftershow companion series to its new CBS All Access television series Star Trek: Discovery, similar in format to AMC's The Walking Dead companion series Talking Dead. The show would air live on All Access after each episode of Discovery, and would feature \\"celebrity Trekkies\\", former Star Trek actors\\", as well as cast and crew members from Discovery. The companion series was confirmed in May 2017, with the title Talking Trek. In August, CBS revealed that Embassy Row, the company behind popular aftershow companion series Talking Dead and Talking Bad, would be producing Talking Trek. Michael Davies was set to executive produce alongside Roddenberry Entertainment's Rod Roddenberry and Trevor Roth, with the show's episodes planned to run for 30‚Äì40 minutes. The next month, Matt Mira was announced as host of the aftershow, which was renamed After Trek. Format Each episode of the series is filmed in a studio, on a set that was constructed in two days and features different Discovery-inspired decorations. Mira discusses the Discovery episode, and other aspects of the series, with the After Trek guests for that week, while graphics are displayed featuring trivia about Discovery. Commercial breaks are book-ended by Star Trek trivia questions that the audience members watching the live stream could participate in answering using interactive polls at the website aftertrek.tv. Each aftershow episode also includes pre-preoduced behind-the-scenes segments about the making of Discovery, and ends with a preview clip of the next episode of Discovery. Episodes Release After Trek premiered on September 24, 2019, streaming live on CBS All Access following the release of the first Star Trek: Discovery episodes. Episodes are also available to stream on demand by All Access subscribers. Outside of the United States, episodes were aired on Space in Canada following the broadcast of Discovery there, and they are available on demand on Netflix for another 188 countries where Discovery is also made available on demand within 24 hours of the U.S. debut. Cancellation In June 2018, after production on the second season of Discovery had begun, a CBS spokesperson said the network was \\"reimagining\\" After Trek for the next season. The statement added that the next iteration of the talk show would \\"continue to have all the fan-driven elements that Star Trek: Discovery viewers enjoyed this season and more.\\" In January 2019, it was announced that After Trek had been canceled and was being replaced by weekly Facebook Live events to be streamed the day after each Discovery episode was released. These Facebook Live events were soon revealed to be a new interview-style aftershow named The Ready Room, hosted by Naomi Kyle.

The Belgian Anti-Slavery Society was founded in 1888, mainly by catholic intellectuals, led by count Hippolyte d'Ursel. The founders were inspired by the preaching of Charles Lavigerie, a French Cardinal, held at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in August 1888. By January 1889 the society counted 700 members and had a working capital of 300.000 francs at its disposal. The abolitionist ideology of the Anti-Slavery Society was, however, closely linked with imperialism. From 1890 to 1899 the Soci√©t√© antiesclavagiste de Belgique organized and funded four military expeditions, sent to fight the Arab/Zanzibari slavers of the eastern Congo Free State regions. Belgian anti-slavery expeditions * 1890-92: Hinck-Kerckhoven- Ectors Expedition, on the Congo and Lomami River, early setbacks led to a premature end of the expedition. * 1891-92: Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude- Storms-Docquier-Renier-Vrithoff, founded Albertville (Kalemie) and fought Rumaliza in the eastern Congo region . * 1892-93: Long-Duvivier-Demol expedition, launched their expedition from the Indian Ocean and came to the aid of the Jacques and Docquier expedition, managed to end hostilities directed at Albertville. * 1893-96: Descamps-Miot-Chargois expedition, followed the Zambezi upstream and cooperated with Jacques, Dhanis and Wouters. After the defeat of the Zanzibari slavers during the Congo Arab war by the Congo Free State, the Descamps expedition fought against the last pockets of slave traders resistance in the area.  Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889‚Äì1890  The Belgian Anti-Slavery Society published the journal Le mouvement antiesclavagiste (redaction by Louis Delmer), in 1899 it merged with the Oeuvre des Missions Catholiques au Congo. The society was also a close supporter of the internationally attended Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889‚Äì90 which eventually led to the Brussels Conference Act of 1890. They also organized a follow-up conference at the Academy Palace to put pressure on the countries that had rejected the anti-slavery act thus far, mainly the Netherlands and the Ottoman Empire., The Age of Internationalism and Belgium, 1880-1930.

Winged Victory is located in front of the Insurance Building and adjacent to the Washington State Capitol in Olympia, Washington. Completed in 1938 by Alonzo Victor Lewis, it is dedicated to military personnel from Washington who died in World War I and is notable for its inclusion of a Red Cross nurse in the group of figures depicted. History Winged Victory pictured in 1938 Background In March 1917, anticipating the United States declaration of war on Germany that would come the following month, Governor of Washington Ernest Lister ordered the mobilization of the Washington National Guard, whose units had only recently returned from service in California during the Mexican border emergency. On August 5 of that year the 2nd Washington Infantry Regiment was pressed into federal service, later joined by the 146th Field Artillery. During the year-and-a-half in which the U.S. was engaged in hostilities, a total of 60,617 Washington men served in deployed National Guard units, or in the United States Army, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, or United States Coast Guard. During the conflict 1,642 were killed or died of disease. Funding and construction In 1919, following the conclusion of hostilities, Lister called for the erection of a monument to the citizens of Washington who were killed during the war. The Washington State Legislature subsequently appropriated $50,000 for its design and construction, with funds partly raised through the sale of a state forest. The balance of the $100,000 cost of the monument was provided in grants from the United States government. Seattle artist Alonzo Victor Lewis, who already had a popular reputation in the state, was commissioned for the sculpture. His plans for it were approved in 1927 and the statue was completed in 1938. It was formally dedicated in a ceremony held on May 30, 1938, and it was unveiled by the mothers of two Washington soldiers who had been killed in action. Stephen Chadwick, then chairman of the American Legion's Americanism Committee and later National Commander of the American Legion delivered the ceremonial charge. Later history Following the completion of Winged Victory, which was Alonzo Victor Lewis' third World War I memorial statue, he was named the state's Sculptor Laureate. The statue was sandblasted in 1979 to remove staining on its surface. In 1988, the sculpture was painted with a coating of brass powder in an acrylic base, giving it a golden hue. This layer was removed in 2012 and the statue was restored to its original bronze color. Centennial observances of the end of World War I were held at the Winged Victory memorial in 2017, which were keynoted by Lorraine McConaghy. Winged Victory has been called \\"one of the most recognizable structures\\" on the campus of the Washington State Capitol. Design Detail view, 2020 A side view of Winged Victory pictured in 2006, a period during which the statue was painted in a golden hue. Alonzo Victor Lewis's name is prominently visible at the rear of the statue near its base. The bronze statue is elevated on a granite base; it features a Winged Victory from Classical mythology standing, with wings displayed, behind a United States soldier, a sailor, a Marine, and an American Red Cross nurse, all of whom appear to be marching towards the east. The Winged Victory motif was a popular theme for World War I monuments of the era, though the inclusion of a Red Cross nurse makes the Olympia statue more complex than most. Each of the four sides of the statue's granite base is inscribed. On the east side, which is inlaid with a bronze representation of the Seal of the State of Washington, the inscription reads: On the north side is a Biblical quotation from John 15, verse 13: On the west side: On the south side: File:Washington State Capitol - Winged Victory pedestal inscription 01.jpgTO THE MEMORY OF THE CITIZENS‚Ä¶ File:Washington State Capitol - Winged Victory pedestal inscription 02.jpgGREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN‚Ä¶ File:Washington State Capitol - Winged Victory pedestal inscription 03.jpgTHEIR SACRIFICE WAS TO VINDICATE‚Ä¶ File:Washington State Capitol - Winged Victory pedestal inscription 04.jpgTHEY FOUGHT TO SAFEGUARD‚Ä¶ See also * American Doughboy Bringing Home Victory (1932), another World War I monument by Alonzo Victor Lewis * National World War I Museum and Memorial (Indianapolis, Indiana) * National World War I Memorial (Washington, D.C.)

Muthoni Nyanjiru was born in Weithaga, Murang'a, although her date or year of birth are not recorded. By the time she was shot and killed in 1922, she lived in Nairobi with her stepdaughter, Elizabeth Waruiru.\\"Subsistence Trade Versus World Trade Gendered Class Struggle in Kenya, 1992-2002\\" , Leigh S. Brownhill and Terisa E. Turner. Canadian Woman Studies/Les Cahiers de la Femme. 2002 Spring-Summer; 22(1):169-177.  Background  Nyanjiru was an associate and supporter of Harry Thuku. Thuku, secretary and Young Kikuyu Association (later known as the East African Association) was known throughout Kikuyuland as \\"chief of women\\" mainly for his vocal support of women especially around the issues of physical and sexual abuse, as well as forced labor.  Harry Thuku Protests  Thuku was arrested on March 14, 1922 over concern for his increasing militancy and the growing number of his supporters. The day following Thuku's arrest a strike was called by the EAA and thousands peacefully marched to the Nairobi police station, where Thuku was being held. The strikers came to demonstrate and secure his release. After praying for Thuku's safety the crowd dispersed. That evening, women supporters engaged in a practice called oathing, a custom exclusive to men. Oath-taking by women violated Kikuyu tradition as women were considered to be mentally unfit and bodily unable to endure the ordeal of taking oath. Elizabeth Waruiru, in her account of the events on the evening of March 15th named James Njoroge, a member of the EAA as the oath-giver. Oaths were administered to over 200 women in the crowd, in essence, binding them to execute a specific plan of action. Historically, tribal oaths were not used by governmental institutions, the EEA was the first to do so. Whether oathing raised their political awareness or a sense of discipline, women acted in unity the following day when it was clear that Thuku would not be freed. On the morning of March 16th a delegation of six men were chosen from the crowd to meet with Sir Charles Bowring, the Colonial Secretary, who assured them that Thuku was in no danger and was only being detained while waiting for the government to grant him a full hearing. The government hearing would fairly decide Thuku's fate. The delegation was encouraged to return to the crowd to ask them to peacefully disperse. Upon their return, they announced that Thuku was to be tried instead of released, then urged the strikers to go home. As many in the crowd were incensed, this was fruitless. It was then that a large group of agitated women started pushing forcefully toward the gate, some shouting at the men that they were cowards and making accusations of bribery to the delegation. Hearing this, the men who had started to disperse changed their minds and returned. ‚ÄúMary Muthoni Nyanjiru leapt to her feet, ran to the front of the crowd, lifted her dress over her head, and cried, \\"You take my dress and give me your trousers. You men are cowards. What are you waiting for? Our leader is in there. Let's get him.\\" The tactic, called guturamira ng‚Äôania, was considered a serious insult among the Kikuyu, who view it as a curse to see a woman the age of one's mother naked; rarely used, it indicates that the authority of men is no longer recognized in the situation, and is considered a powerful symbol of women's defiance. As Nyanjiru's actions unfolded, many of the women present ululated their approval in response, and the crowd surged forward until the police or askaris opened fire. Nyanjiru was among the first people killed.  Aftermath  The total number of dead is given in various sources as between twenty-eight and over one hundred. There has been no evidence that the askaris were ordered to fire by the officers in charge‚Äù, though there are accounts stating that the askaris were on duty for eighteen continuous hours in the heat while being subjected to harassment by the crowd. The official number of casualties were given as twenty-one Africans killed, four of whom were women and an additional twenty-eight injured. Thuku's own account of the day, having seen events unfold from his cell, relates that as the police fired from the front, other European settlers who had gathered at the Norfolk Hotel began shooting into the crowd from behind. Other accounts substantiated Thuku's claim; settlers were drinking on the veranda of the hotel near the scene and joined in the shooting and were responsible for many of the deaths. Little is known about the other women that were involved, even killed, in the Harry Thuku disturbance, and Nyanjiru is the only woman for whom there is any background information. She is the sole woman named in the protest. Men connected to the protest do have their names recorded in respect to this incident, while women are largely anonymous.  Legacy  Mary Muthoni Nyanjiru's death brought little immediate change to the colonial regime, still, she is remembered as a heroine in folklore, song and poetry. The song Kanyegenuri, memorializes the actions and bravery of Nyanjiru and was sung during the Mau Mau resistance as an anthem of opposition. This and other anthems of heroic African women were banned as they were considered to be a political threat. Nyanjiru is memorialized again in the poem, Mother Afrika's Matriots, the verse pertaining to Nyanjiru reads: \\"Mary Muthoni Nyanjiru who reignited a retreating volcano of workers\\". Additionally, Nyanjiru's story was featured in an experimental theater production about Kenyan heroes and heroines titled, Too Early for Birds.

An apolitical and independent thinker, he is considered to be a major inspiration for the various French ecological movements. His name is regularly mentioned by French academics. as well French green party leaders. The underlying idea inspiring his books and articles is that \\"the link that attaches individual persons to society is so strong that, even in the so called 'individualistic society', people struggle to exercise the critical thinking needed to resist mass trends, and end up readily consenting to the annihilation of what they cherish most: their freedom\\". In the 1930s, he associates economic development to a form of dictatorship and becomes recognized as a pioneer in political ecology. Skeptical about all forms of partisanship, including in the area of ecology, he lays out the foundation of a new type of society based on personal experience, in rupture with 20th century most accepted ideologies. He shares many of the personalist views of his six decade old friend Jacques Ellul regarding technological progress, which they mostly see as a source of conformism and a threat to freedom.  Biography  Charbonneau was born in Bordeaux in 1910 in a bourgeois family from Lot et Garonne. His father was Protestant and his mother Catholic. The life in a large city quickly made Young Charbonneau feel oppressed. From his own admission, he was an average student. He obtained a baccalaureat in French literature and attended the University of Bordeaux to study history and geography. At the age of 24, he started his teaching career and received agr√©gation the following year. At the end of World War II, he preferred to leave town and settle in the countryside, skipping the opportunity to further his academic achievements in a large city. He accepted a teaching position in a small normal school in Lescar, near Pau, in the Pre-Pyrenees (currently Lycee Jacques Monod). He stayed there until he retired. He produced a strong impression on his students. He enjoyed the proximity to nature and lived a spartan life near the Gaves de Pau then Oloron. Charbonneau died in 1996 of liver cancer in the hospital of Saint Palais. He is buried on his property in \\"Le Boucau\\" in Saint-P√©-de-L√©ren. On his grave, one can read this adapted citation from the book of Ruth: \\"wherever you go, I'll go; wherever you stay, I'll stay and your God will be my God.\\" After his death, his wife, Henriette Louise Daudin took care of publishing his unpublished writings. She died of cardiac arrest in December 2015. Charbonneau has had four children: Simone, Juliette, Catherine and Martine. In 2006, the personal archives of Charbonneau were transferred to the library of the Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Bordeaux.  Thoughts and life achievements  Charbonneau started various discussion groups, some with Jacques Ellul who was his friend for his entire life, with the aim to talk and think about the changes resulting from scientific and technical progress. \\"As young adults, Ellul and his friend Charbonneau already had the intuition of what would be the architecture of their entire works. Their works were parallel if not common. If, unlike Ellul's, Charbonneau's work was not fully known to the public at the time, Ellul knew exactly how much he owed to Charbonneau. Ellul admits that without his friend who was a genius and taught him how to think, he would never have understood the technical society phenomenon\\" explains Patrick Troude-Chastenet\\". Jacques Ellul, friend of Charbonneau for 60 years Following the creation by Emmanuel Mounier of the magazine Esprit in 1932, Charbonneau decided to join the French personalist movement and renamed his group \\"le groupe personaliste du Sud-Ouest\\". Charbonneau was careful about not confining his group in pure theories but making it experience personalism in practice. He took his friends in long hikes in Galicia, the Canary Islands, in the Spanish Pyrenees as well as in the Aspe valley and in Saint-P√©-de- L√©ren. Between 1940 and 1947, Charbonneau designed the structure of his work and wrote a voluminous book, entitled Par la force des choses, whose content announced the twenty or so books that would follow. His analysis of the contradictions in the world led to the anticipation of something worse than political totalitarianism: social totalitarianism resulting from the unstoppable technological progress.Based on the analysis of the social and political evolution he witnessed in the 1930s and in the 1940s, he was able to anticipate issues that were later recognized as crucial in society. He noted the problems resulting from ever more technocratic social, political and ecological spheres, from State propaganda and mass communication, from the move from fine art to entertainment and consumerism and from the liquidation of traditional farming, among other factors. He was not in a position to communicate his thoughts as a whole and therefore tried to expose it in details in separate books. His books l'Etat and Je fus are the two major cornerstones of his work, previously announced in Par la force des choses. He could not find any editors to publish them so he used a spirit duplicator to distribute copies to a close circle of friends. Those two books would eventually be published some 50 years later. Charbonneau resumed the analysis of the industrial society that he had started before the war under a book named Pan se meurt. There again, he could not find any editor. He waited 20 years before Editions Gallimard published his book, under a renamed title: Le Jardin de Babylone. His analysis of the chaotic effects of technological and industrial progress were published in 1973 under the title Le syst√®me et le chaos. His thoughts on the contradictions of the liberal conception of freedom were published in 2002 under the title Prom√©th√©e r√©encha√Æn√©.

Strayer, from a screenplay by Keene Thompson. The film stars Lloyd Hughes, Margaret Livingston, and Sam Hardy, and was released by Columbia Pictures on November 15, 1929. Plot Marian is sent to prison for a crime she did not commit. While there she meets fellow convict, Dr. Bradford, who has also been wrongly convicted of a murder. Marion believes his innocence and falls in love with him. Bradford tells her that it was Egan who framed him. Meanwhile, Egan has fallen in love with Marian, and when Marian is paroled, begins to woo her. She goes along with his romances, hoping to get the info she needs to free Bradford. However, Egan is warned of her intentions by associates who are still in the jail. When Egan confronts Marian, she admits her plan, but tells Egan of her love for Bradford. Egan, pretending to help Marian out, agrees to get Bradford released, and pays one of his henchmen, Smith, to confess to the crime for which Bradford is in prison for. Once Bradford is released, Egan attempts to leverage his role in that release, to force Marian to marry him. When she refuses, he has Bradford kidnapped, intending to have him killed. Learning of it, an armed Marian confronts Egan, and when he refuses to divulge Bradford's whereabouts, she shoots him. Grievously wounded, Egan needs immediate medical attention. Regretting her action, she pleads with Egan to tell him where Bradford is, so that he can tend to the wound. Once Egan tells her where he has Bradford stashed, Marian rushes to free him, returning to Egan, where Bradford tends to the gunshot wound. The woman and doctor are followed by the police, who overhear Egan confessing to the murder for which Bradford was originally convicted. The wound patched, Egan is taken to jail, while Bradford and Marian end up together. Cast list * Lloyd Hughes as Dr. Bradford * Margaret Livingston as Marian * Sam Hardy as Egan * Charles West as McManus * George Rigas as Tony * Charles Wilson as Nelson * Otto Hoffman as Smith * Erville Alderson as Prison Warden (uncredited) Production In early September 1929, it was announced that Frank Strayer had been slated to direct the picture. In late August it was announced that Lloyd Hughes, Margaret Livingston, and Sam Hardy were attached to the project. With Lloyd Hughes and Margaret Livingston already cast in the lead roles, Charles Wilson and Otto Hoffman were added to the cast in early October. The film was released on November 15, 1929. Reception Harrison's Reports gave the film a positive review, calling it a \\"strong melodrama\\", although they found the moral of the story less than desirable, saying that \\"it glorifies a crook and a murderer\\". They felt the script and direction created an atmosphere of tense suspense. They particularly singled out the acting work of Sam Hardy. The Motion Picture News also enjoyed the film, calling it a \\"Good Crime Drama\\". They complimented Lloyd Hughes and Margaret Livingston, while saying that they were outshone by Hardy, although they felt the plot was a bit hackneyed.

Biography  Born near Dundee, KwaZulu- Natal, Nyembe was the daughter of Leeya Basolise Nyembe, whose father was Chief Ngedee Shezi. She attended mission schools until Standard 9. She had her only child when she was fifteen. Nyembe spent much of her life under apartheid either under banning orders or in prison, serving terms from 1963 to 1966 for furthering the ANC movement. Again from 1968 until 1983 for harboring terrorists. Nyembe joined the Natal Organisation of Women (NOW) after her 1984 release. She was again released from detention in 1987. She was elected to the National Assembly in 1994. Career Nyembe was merchant but was also active in politics, participating or running many progressive organizations. She joined the African National Congress in 1952 and soon became an active member. When she joined the ANC the Defiance campaign was going on. Nyembe was imprisoned in 1952 for defying unjust laws. She led women from Natal in the Defiance Campaign of 1956. Part of the Defiance Campaign was being a leader against the removal of the Cato Manor in 1956. In 1956 she was elected as the vice president of the Durban ANC. She was also active in the movement to boycott beer halls. Beer Halls, taking jobs away from many women. In 1959 she was elected president of the Natal division of the African National Congress Women's League. When the ANC was banned in 1960, she joined Spear of the Nation. In 1961, Nyembe was recruited into the Umkhonto we Sizwe and worked with a number of allies such as Chief Albert Luthuli, Moses Mabhida, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo.\\" In 1963 she led women during the Natal Women's Revolt. \\"She was released on 23 March 1984, after her release, Nyembe started working for Natal Organisation of Women (NOW). NOW served a number of purposes. Fighting against rent increases, transport costs, poor education and lack of child care facilities are the main focus of the organization.\\" Work for the African National Congress The ANC's philosophy during the early 1950s was that of Gandhi's. A passive philosophy where members were willing to go to prison if necessary. Nyembe, while not a pacifist, joined the ANC and in 1952 was willing to break laws that imposed restrictions of political, labour and residential rights. Nyembe's time in the defiance campaign ended when, in 1953, the British passed laws that banned protest meetings. After her election president of the Natal division in 1959 Nyembe was involved in the planning of opposition to pass laws. Pass laws would have made it required that all black citizens carry an identity card around in white areas. After the Sharpeville massacre and the ANC and the PAC being banned under newly passed the Unlawful Organisations Act. Nyembe joined a violent wing of the ANC called the spear of nation. Under this operation she participated in sabotaging government facilities. Natal Women's Revolt As a leader of the Natal Women's Revolt, Nyembe was with other South African black women against beer halls. Beer Halls took a major source of income away from women. This organization also sought the destruction of the Durban Corporation property. Nyembe was fighting for influx control, passes for women, and permits to seek work. Awards During her career she received the Order of Friendship of Peoples, from the Soviet Union, and the Chief Albert Luthuli prize, the latter in 1992.

It is most prominently discussed in Tibetan Buddhism where PrƒÅsa·πÖgika and SvƒÅtantrika, are viewed to be different forms of Madhyamaka philosophy.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267 For Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelugpa school and the most outspoken proponent of the distinction, as well as for the Karma Kagyu school, these differences are of major importance. Tsongkhapa not only negates an inherent identity or self-characterizing essence which resides in persons, things, and abstract phenomena; but he also negates the identity of phenomena as they appear to our instinctive, everyday perception.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267 In contrast, according to Tsongkhapa, the SvƒÅtantrika negate a \\"truly existing self,\\" but maintain that things exist conventionally \\"according to characteristics.\\"Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267 The heart of the distinction according to Tsongkhapa PrƒÅsa·πÖgika For Tsongkhapa, the Svatantrika-Prasa·πÖgika distinction centers around the role of prasa·πÖga (consequence) in a formal debate, and the interpretation of the meaning of both \\"ultimate truth\\" and \\"conventional truth.\\" The PrƒÅsa·πÖgika view holds reductio ad absurdum of essentialist viewpoints to be the most valid method of demonstrating emptiness of inherent existence, and that conventional things do not have a naturally occurring conventional identity.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267 Further, the PrƒÅsa·πÖgika argue that when initially attempting to find the correct object of understanding - which is a mere absence or mere negation of impossible modes of existence - one should not use positivist statements about the nature of reality. Positing an essencelessness rather than merely negating inherent identity creates a subtle linguistic and analytic barrier to finding the correct understanding.H.H. The Dalai Lama & Alexander Berzin, The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra, pg. 235.Introduction to the Middle Way: Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara with Commentary by Ju Mipham, pg. 208-210. This is exemplified in the debate over the use of the terms \\"devoid of nature itself\\" in Gelug Mahamudra (non-affirming negation) and \\"that which has voidness as its nature\\" in non-Gelug Mahamudra and Dzogchen (an affirming negation). Tsongkhapa argued that because the Svatantrika conventionally establish things by their own characteristics, they do not arrive at a complete understanding of emptiness. According to Tsongkhapa, not only were their methods different, but also that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach. Lama Tsongkhapa states that when he uses the term \\"advocates of intrinsic existence\\" he is referring to both \\"essentialists and the Svatantrikas.\\" Modern scholars like the 14th Dalai Lama disagree, echoing sentiments from classical authorities like Lobsang Ch√∂kyi Gyaltsen (4th Panchen Lama) stating that the credible teachers of the various systems of Buddhist philosophy all \\"arrive at the same intended point\\" of realization. However, they openly admit that this non-denominational position is very difficult to establish through reason.  PrƒÅsa·πÖgika Logic  =Consequential syllogistic reasoning= According to Tsongkhapa, if both people in a debate or discussion have a valid understanding of emptiness already, then autonomous syllogistic arguments could be quite effective. However, in a circumstance where one or both parties in a debate or discussion do not hold a valid understanding, \\"the debate [should be] founded on what the parties accept as valid. Hence, it is proper to refute opponents in terms of what they accept.\\" In other words, it is more appropriate to establish a position of emptiness through showing the logical consequences of the incorrect position that the opponent already accepts, than it is to establish emptiness through syllogistic reasoning using premises that the opponent (and perhaps even the proponent) do not fully or deeply understand. Tsongkhapa quoting Chandrakirti, in the Lamrim Chenmo, Volume Three, on the problem of relying on autonomous syllogistic reasoning: Tsongkhapa argues further that the PrƒÅsa·πÖgika's use of reductio ad absurdum is syllogistic, because one \\"refutes the opponent using a subject, a reason, and so forth that are accepted by that opponent.\\" For example, if cause-effect relationships occur because the sprout itself produces the effect of being a sprout (self- arising), then this \\"would mean that something that already exists is being produced, [and] production would be purposeless and endless [... if] contradictions are assembled in this way, the only result is that the opponents understand them and abandon\\" wrong tenets. =Non-affirming negation= A prominent and important feature of the approach is their use of the non-affirming negation. A non-affirming negation is a negation which does not leave something in the place of what has been negated. For instance, when one says that a Buddhist should not drink alcohol, they are not affirming that a Buddhist should, in fact, drink something else. One is merely negating the consumption of alcohol under a particular circumstance. According to Tsongkhapa, for the the philosophical position of emptiness is itself a non- affirming negation, since emptiness is a \\"lack of inherent existence.\\" One is not affirming anything in the place of that absence of inherence.Lama Tsongkhapa, Ocean of Reasoning, pg. 59 It is not the presence of some other quality. If one were to describe emptiness as the presence of some quality -for example, a \\"voidness\\" or a \\"thusness\\" - it would linguistically and philosophically contradict the nature of the object which it is attempting to characterize.The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra, p.235 Ignorance - Prasa·πÖgika Object of Negation Pabongka Rinpoche states in Liberation in Our Hands that if we cannot correctly \\"recognize the nature of the false mode of existence that is being denied, we will not be able to realize the simple negation [Skr. prasajyapratisedhah or non-affirming negation] that is established through its refutation.\\"Pabongka Rinpoche \\"Liberation in Our Hands\\" Pg 274-275 For the PrƒÅsa·πÖgika, when analyzing a table, the object being negated is not an abstract intellectual concept apart from the table which can be called 'inherent existing', but the conventionally appearing table itself, which appears to naive perception as being inherent. The table is not just empty of inherent existence in some abstract philosophical way; the identity of the table as it appears to normal, everyday perception - which misattributes inherence to the object - is being negated.Introduction to the Middle Way (2002), p. 210 Lama Tsongkhapa explains:We can say \\"therefore, [that] what exists objectively in terms of its own essence without being posited through the power of a subjective mind is called [...] 'intrinsic nature'\\" or ignorance Therefore, the object to be negated by reason is a conception that phenomena have an \\"ontological status‚Äîa way of existing‚Äîin and of themselves, without being posited through the force of an awareness. Pabongka Rinpoche adds that \\"while simply knowing and using verbal explanations such as these may be enough to silence an opponent in debate we have not truly recognized the object to be refuted until we have recognized it within our own experience.\\"Pabongka Rinpoche \\"Liberation in Our Hands\\" Pg 276 In furtherance of this:This is the meaning of both ignorance and the object to be negated by valid cognition, according to the Madhyamaka-PrƒÅsa·πÖgika in the view of Lama Tsongkhapa. =Indo-Tibetan rope & snake analogy= Under low light, the thought might arise that a striped rope on the ground is a snake, \\"but there is nothing on top of or inside this rope [...] to which we could\\" validly apply the term and therefore establish a conventionally existing snake.Dalai Lama, Alexander Berzin The Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra P 323 The Dalai Lama expands: In reality, the self of persons, objects, and abstracts is like the term-concept \\"snake\\" being designated upon a rope, \\"the snake is merely what can be designated by a mental label.\\"Dalai Lama, Alexander Berzin The Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra P 323 Like this, the object of negation or ignorance is viewed to be the thought and perception which grasps the self of persons and objects to be established within their respective bases of designation. To put this in somewhat simpler terms, the thought and perception which grasps persons, things, and abstracts phenomena as existing in-and-of themselves - with characteristics or an identity of their own - is seen to be ignorance in this system. =Incorrect Object of Negation (Permanence)= In the Gelugpa four tenets system, the object of negation is different for the Madhyamika-PrƒÅsa·πÖgika than it is for Hinayana schools of VaibhƒÅ·π£ika and SautrƒÅntika. Indeed, from the PrƒÅsa·πÖgika viewpoint, Buddhist and non-Buddhist essentialist schools are not negating the correct object.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg 211 According to Geshe Tenzin Zopa in Buddhist Tenets, the various Hinayana schools are negating a number of different objects, but none of them are inherent existence. Geshe Tenzin Zopa states: \\"From VaibhƒÅ·π£ika school, they [the Vasiputriyans] assert selflessness/emptiness of the person/self is that which is impermanent (can momentarily change), has parts (physical parts, moments of time, various cardinal directions) and is dependent.\\"Geshe Tenzin Zopa, Commentary on Chokyi Gyaltsen‚Äôs A Presentation of Tenets Pg 33 Chandrakirti explains why the Prasangika do not see this as the final correct position: Lama Tsongkhapa supports the analysis of Chandrakirti when he says: =Refuting that rational analysis is not required= From the point of view of the opponents of Prasangika, it is absurd \\"to conduct the extensive rational analysis required for refutations and proofs [which] is to meander among mere conventional words.\\" They propose that \\"all phenomena are devoid of refutation and proof, in that, if something exists, it cannot be refuted, and, if it does not exist, it need not be refuted.\\" An idea which Lama Tsongkhapa refers to as \\"a nonsensical collection of contradictions, showing neither general awareness of how reason establishes and negates things nor general awareness of how the path establishes and negates things.\\"Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 205 Nagarjuna‚Äôs Refutation of Objections he deals with this idea in a similar way: What use is it to establish the negation Of what does not exist anyway, even without words? To answer that, the words \\"does not exist\\" Cause understanding; they do not eliminate.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 204-5 In his Commentary on Refutation of Objections Nagarjuna expands as follows: The words, \\"All things lack intrinsic nature,\\" do not cause things to lack intrinsic nature, but, in the absence of intrinsic nature, they do make it understood that things lack intrinsic nature.\\"Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 205 This can be illustrated with the following paraphrased example found in the same text. If a person named Devadatta is not in the house, but someone says, \\"Devadatta is in the house.\\" Then in order to show that Devadatta is not there, someone else will say, \\"Devadatta is not there.\\" Those words do not cause Devadatta not to be there but allow the first person to understand that Devadatta is not in the house. Similarly, the words, \\"Things lack intrinsic nature,\\" do not cause things to lack intrinsic nature, but help the those confused by ignorance to gain a valid cognition of reality.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 205 Dependent Origination - Conventional Truth At the time of Candrakƒ´rti, the PrƒÅsa·πÖgika discerned three levels of dependent origination:Just Another Word for Nothing Left to Lose: Freedom, Agency and Ethics for MƒÅdhyamikas, by Jay Garfield Smith College (2013) in press. # Pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda or 'dependent arising.' All things arise in dependence on causes and conditions and cease when those causes and conditions are no longer present. # All wholes are dependent upon their parts for existence, and all parts are dependent on their wholes for existence. # Praj√±aptir upƒÅdƒÅya or 'dependent designation.' All phenomena are dependent for their existence on conceptual imputation. According to Tsongkhapa, PrƒÅsa·πÖgika asserts that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence, because they are dependently co-arisen with mental imputation. All phenomenon in all possible worlds lack inherent existence and come into existence relative to a designating consciousness which co-arises with that phenomena. = Dependent Designation as Conventional Truth = Designation is, according to Kelsang Gyatso's translation of Lorig, the application of a conceptual image or term to a selected object of mere experience.Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, Understanding the Mind Pp 9-12 Anything which comes into existence through valid designation is part of \\"conventional reality\\" or \\"conventional truth.\\" According to Lama Tsongkhapa, something is validly designated (exists conventionally) if it meets all of the following three conditions: # It is known to a conventional consciousness; # No other conventional cognition (within that convention) contradicts it from being thus known; # Reason that accurately analyzes reality ‚Äî that is, analyzes whether something intrinsically exists ‚Äî does not contradict it. Whatever fails to meet those criteria does not exist. If something has a cause-effect relationship or a relationship of parts-whole, then those objects are already in existence. In order to be already existing, they must have been designated by a conceptual mind. To talk about an object that does not exist in relation to a subject is incoherent.Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, Understanding the Mind Pp 9 According to Lama Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Nagarjuna, both causes and effects are merely designated by mind.Lama Tsongkhapa, Ocean of Reasoning, pg. 67. Parts and wholes - being among the components that make up reality - are also merely designated by mind. Relationships between objects cannot exist without being validly designated into existence. This is the meaning of \\"conventional truth\\" in this system. = Causes & Conditions are merely designated = According to Tsongkhapa by way of Nagarjuna, the most pervasive relationship of co- dependent arising is the third relationship, dependent designation. From the PrƒÅsa·πÖgika perspective, in order for something to exist, it must be designated validly by a designating consciousness. It is mind that determines that a cause has ceased and its effect is now in existence. To exemplify this, Lama Tsongkhapa quotes Buddhapalita's response to an Abhidharmica's objection: According to Lama Tsongkhapa by way of Buddhapalita, this was one of the points of Nagajuna's Chatu·π£ko·π≠i. From Nagarjuna's Middle Way: \\"1. Not from itself, not from another, not from both, nor without cause: Never in any way is there any existing thing that has arisen.\\" According to Mark Siderits and Sh≈çry≈´ Katsura, \\"This is the overall conclusion for which NƒÅgƒÅrjuna will argue in this chapter: that existents do not come into existence as the result of causes and conditions.\\"Mark Siderits and Sh≈çry≈´ Katsura (2013), Nagarjuna's Middle Way: Mulamadhyamakakarika, Simon and Schuster, p.18 Both modern scholars like Mark Siderits and Sh≈çry≈´ Katsura, and classical commentators Lama Tsongkhapa agree on this point.Lama Tsongkhapa, Ocean of Reasoning, pg. 67. The implied modifying phrase in Nagarjuna's tetralema is \\"intrinsic\\" or \\"inherent\\" according to Tsongkhapa and ChandrakirtiTsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 pp185-194Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 p 216 So, the tetralemma would read: Not from intrinsic self, not from intrinsic other, not from intrinsic both, and not from intrinsic nothingness/causelessness. Notice that each one of these statements is a non-affirming negation which merely negates the subject and does not affirm some other mode of arising in its place. These four possibilities include all possible ways that a conventional phenomenon could arise if, in fact, they arose through some type of intrinsic arising process. Each one of these modes is negated in sequence - self, other, both, no cause - to arrive at a mere absence: the absence of inherent modes of causality. These arguments are elucidated in great detail Lama Tsongkhapa's commentary on the M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅ Ocean of Reasoning.:\\"Ocean of Reasoning.\\" Oxford University Press (2006) = Parts-Whole are merely designated = Further, one can look to the Seven-Point Analysis of a Chariot by Chandrakirti and find a similar treatment of parts-whole: It is mind which determines that some collection of parts is now considered to be a whole.Rigpawiki, Sevenfold Reasoning of the Chariot Therefore, the relationship of dependent designation is the most pervasive among the three types of dependencies, according to PrƒÅsa·πÖgika. Therefore, PrƒÅsa·πÖgika are not stating that nothing exists, but instead hold that phenomena only come into existence co-dependently with minds which are applying conceptual and nominal conventions to mere experiences. = Dependent Designation is merely designated = Things and phenomenon do exist co-dependently, based upon a relationship with a knowing and designating mind, but nothing exists in an independent, self-arising, or self-sustaining manner. The relationship between object and subject is also empty of inherent existence. From the 1st Panchen Lama's Lozang Chokyi Gyeltsen The Main Road of the Triumphant Ones: To simplify the above, in the direct cognition of rigpa or clear light, there is no findable, inherent subject or object. When you arise from that meditation, things exist and function, but only as dependent designations. Thus they appear in reality - like a mirage or reflection appears in reality - but cannot be established as existing in-and-of themselves. Emptiness - Ultimate Truth =Inseparability of Conventional & Ultimate Truth= According to the Prasangika, dependent- arising and emptiness are inseparable, and exist in a relationship of entity or identity.Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 Pg 137 A relationship of entity or identity is one in which two objects are merely conceptually distinct, but not actually distinct. For example, the relationship between the mental categorization of a dog and that of an animal, with regards to the same being. If it is a dog, then it must also be an animal. Additionally, this relationship applies to impermanent phenomenon and products: if it's impermanent, it must be a product.Duckworth, Douglass. Mipam on Buddha-Nature: The Ground of the Nyingma Tradition Pg 255 Similarly, if it is a conventional arising then it is emptiness, and if it is emptiness, then it is a conventional arising. These two are merely conceptually distinct, but not actually distinct.Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 Pg 137 The two truths are defined only in relationship with one another. In the Heart Sutra, Shariputra and SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama illucidate the idea of the emptiness-conventionality inseparability: All phenomena are of the nature of emptiness and emptiness is nowhere to be found except as the nature of all phenomena. Emptiness is established as being synonymous with dependent arising. Dependent arising, also, is established as being synonymous with emptiness. The mere appearance of phenomena due to dependent designation is inseparable from the non- obstruction to their arising, which is emptiness. =Emptiness of Emptiness= According to both Tsongkhapa and Nagarjuna, emptiness is also empty of inherent existence: emptiness only exists nominally and conventionally. Emptiness is co-dependently arisen as a quality of conventional phenomena and is itself a conventional phenomenon.Lama TsongkhapaLamrim ChenmoPg 191 There is no emptiness just \\"floating around out there\\" or a \\"Great Emptiness from which everything else arises.\\" For example, a table is empty of inherently being a table from its own side. This is referred to as \\"the emptiness of the table.\\" The emptiness of the table exists conventionally as a property of that particular table. Lama Tsongkhapa quoting Chandrakirti: From the Prasa·πÖgika point of view, it is the same with all types of emptiness. There is no \\"independent emptiness\\" or \\"ultimate emptiness.\\" Therefore, emptiness is an ultimate truth (a fact which applies to all possible phenomena, in all possible worlds), but it is not an ultimate phenomenon or ultimate reality (something which has always existed, is self- created, and is self-sustaining). It is also not a \\"Tao\\" or a primal substance from which all other things arise. Buddhapalita comically equates someone who thinks emptiness is inherent with someone who doesn't understand what \\"nothing\\" means: Nagarjuna paraphrases the Buddha in the Mulamadhyamikakarika, stating that \\"the Conqueror said that emptiness eradicates all dogmatic views; as for those who take a dogmatic view of emptiness, he said that they are incurable.Lama TsongkhapaLamrim ChenmoPg 192 Therefore, it is clear that the Prasangika do not advocate an inherent form of emptiness. =Karma is carried on the mere 'I'= The Prasangika refute the idea of a storehouse consciousness or mind-basis-of-all consciousness. According to Daniel Cozart's interpretation of Ngawang Belden, \\"the Buddha taught the mind-basis-of-all provisionally, for the benefit of those who could be helped by believing in its existence but who would be harmed by hearing the teachings about emptiness. In his own mind, the basis of his teaching was emptiness. [...] This is because the purpose of positing a mind-basis-of-all is supposed to be to provide a basis for experience without positing external objects.\\"Cozart, Daniel. \\"Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School\\" Pg 436 According to the Gelugpa, the Chittamatra hold that the mind-basis-of-all consciousness is that which bears the karmic seeds and is findable upon analysis. That is, \\"if one sought the basis of the designation of the person one would discover the mind-basis-of-all.\\"Cozart, Daniel. \\"Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School\\" Pg 235 So, how is it that Madhyamika-Prasangika posit that beings accumulate karma and experience their effects without the mind-basis- of-all? They posit that karma is carried on the mere \\"I\\" which is dependently designated on the basis of the aggregates, stating that \\"it is a sufficient basis with which to associate the factors of disintegratedness (karma).\\"Cozart, Daniel. \\"Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School\\" Pg 236 Daniel Cozant expands by saying that since phenomena are neither inherently created nor inherently destroyed according to Prasangika, that \\"therefore, the possibility of a later effect is not precluded.\\"Cozart, Daniel. \\"Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School\\" Pg 236-7 Eight unique tenets & thirteen distinguishing features According to Daniel Cozart's Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School (based on the work of Jamyang Shayba and Ngawang Belden) there are eight unique tenets within the Madhyamika-Prasangika viewpoint: * The Unique Way of Refuting a Mind-Basis-of- All * The Unique Way of Refuting Self-Consciousness * The Non-Assertion of Autonomous Reasons * The Unique Way of Asserting External Objects * The Proof That Hearers and Solitary Realizers Realize the Selflessness of Phenomena * The Unique Way of Positing the Conception of a Self of Phenomena as an Affliction * The Unique Way of Asserting That Disintegratedness Is a Functioning Thing * The Unique Presentation of the Three TimesCozart, Daniel Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School Table of Contents He also cites thirteen distinguishing features of the Prasangika view: * Valid Cognition Is Mistaken but Reliable * Refutation of Autonomous Syllogisms * Prasangika Perspective on the Destruction of the Obstructions to Omniscience * Pramana Is Not Necessarily New Cognition * Mental Direct Perception Can be Conceptual * Prasarigika Perspectives on Nirvana * The Two Selflessnesses of Persons and Phenomena Are Equally Subtle * Desire and Aversion Conceive True Existence * Common Beings Can Have Yogic Direct Perception * One Can Directly Realize the Sixteen Aspects of the Four Noble Truths Even before the Path of Preparation * True Cessations Are the Dharmadhatu * Pratyaksa Refers to Objects * How Prasangikas Avoid the Two ExtremesCozart, Daniel Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School Table of Contents Criticism SvƒÅtantrika in disguise According to the Padmakara Translation Group: According to the Nyingma lineage, Ju Mipham was one of the critics who argued that Je Tsongkhapa was also a Svatantrika, because of the way he refutes true establishment instead of objects themselves. According to Ju Mipham, Je Tsongkhapa's approach is an excellent Svatantrika approach, that leads students in the right direction but will not lead to the true ultimate until they go further. Levels of realization As a result of Je Tsongkhapa's view, the Gelugpa lineage establishes a sort of ladder of progressively refined worldviews and identify the Svatantrika view as inferior to the Prasangika. Sakya and Kagyu scholars argued against the claim that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach; According to those critics, there is no difference in the realization of those using the Svatantrika and Prasangika approaches. They also argue that the Svatantrika approach is better for students who are not able to understand the more direct approach of Prasangika, but it nonetheless results in the same ultimate realization.

The term, \\"Three Forks,\\" was apparently used to designate this area as early as 1719, when the French trader Bernard de la Harpe traveled through the area, meeting and trading with members of the Wichita tribe at a place on the Arkansas River immediately south of the present city of Tulsa.Goins, Charles Robert; Danney Goble and James H. Anderson. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma,Fourth edition. . University of Oklahoma Press. 2006. Available on Google Books. Located in a transition between the Ozark Mountains on the east and the Cross Timbers/Sandstone Hills on the West, this area is the wettest part of Oklahoma, commonly receiving at least of precipitation per year. Bison and other fur-bearing animals were plentiful, making this a prime hunting area for centuries. Archaeologists have found evidence of human settlements dating back to at least 5000 B.C.Hurt, Douglas A. \\"Three Forks Area.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed September 27, 2017. According to Oklahoma historian Grant Foreman, it was the Spanish government who in 1802, granted a monopoly on trading with the Osage Indians, who then claimed control over the area, to Manuel Lisa, Charles Sanguinet, Francis M. Benoit and Gregoire Sarpy. This effectively undercut Pierre Chouteau, a Frenchman and resident of St. Louis, who enjoyed such a monopoly for the previous twenty years. Chouteau had acquired much influence with the Osage, and refused to take this situation lying down. He persuaded about two thousand of their number to pick a new chief named Cashesegra, or Big Track and move from their homes on the Missouri River to the Three Forks, where the Arkansas, Grand and Verdigris Rivers joined. This area was under at least nominal control of the French government, rather than the Spanish, so Chouteau was legally free to trade with these Osage.Foreman, Grant. \\"The Three Forks.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 2, Number 1. March, 1924 Accessed September 24, 2017. Foreman also wrote that after the Louisiana Purchase became a reality, the Osages were notified by an official letter. The Osage, by then led by Chief Clermont, simply threw the letter into a fire. They refused to accept that their friends, the French, would sell their land, and that they must swear loyalty to the United States. According to Foreman, this response was given to Lewis and Clark while their expedition was encamped on the Osage River on May 31, 1804.Foreman, p. 38. The Osages who moved to the Three Forks fared well. Temperamental and warlike, they soon pushed out the Washitas and intimidated smaller tribes who already lived in the area. Then they dominated the fur trade with the French who came to Chouteau's trading post. It was not long before Cherokees who had already left their ancestral homes in the Southeastern states to settle in the Arkansas Territory began to encroach on the Osage's newly acquired hunting ground. One source claims that between 1790 and 1820, around 5,000 Cherokee settlers built farms and ranches on land they now claimed as their tribe's territory. These two tribes engaged in a 10-year war, in which neither would submit to the other, but the Osage finally realized they could not win. A settlement was reached whereby the Osage accepted a large reservation elsewhere.DuVal, Kathleen. The Native Ground: Indians and Colonists in the Heart of the Continent. Available on Google Books. pp. 196-198. 2006. The University of Pennsylvania Press. . Accessed September 27, 2017. Three Forks is still used in the 21st Century in reference to the same geographic area, now covering at least part of present-day Cherokee, Muskogee and Wagoner Counties.

The war resulted in Delhi recognizing the separation of Bengal from its authority. Background In the early 14th century, Delhi's rebel governors in Bengal formed their own sultanates. By 1352, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah defeated other rulers in Bengal and united the region into one sultanate. Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the Sultan of Bengal. Ilyas Shah's earlier military campaigns also involved the sacking of Kathmandu and Varanasi; and an invasion of Orissa. Location The conflict centered on the mud fort of Ekdala. The fort was located on an island surrounded by a moat and marshy jungle. The exact location of the area is unclear; with various sources saying it may have been in Dinajpur, Dhaka or Pandua.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ekdala Siege of Ekdala (1353) Firuz Shah Tughluq, the Delhi sultan, led his army and navy into Bengal in 1353. Ilyas Shah's forces deserted the capital Lakhnauti and took shelter in the Ekdala fort. The Delhi army then besieged the fort, but was deterred by its island's location and the Bengal navy. The Delhi army occupied Lakhnauti and issued a proclamation asking locals to pledge allegiance to Delhi. According to erstwhile Delhi accounts, the Bengal and Delhi forces engaged in a battle after the Delhi Sultan tricked Ilyas Shah into attacking Delhi forces, who pretended to withdraw. The conflict was settled after Bengal agreed to pay an annual tribute to Delhi, according to erstwhile Delhi accounts. R. C. Majumdar, a leading modern Indian historian, believed that the exchange of gifts between Delhi and Bengal indicated each other's sovereignty. Siege of Ekdala (1359) Firuz Shah Tughluq again invaded Bengal in 1359 when Ilyas Shah's successor Sikandar Shah took the throne. Tughluq felt Sikandar Shah had violated the terms of the treaty reached with his father. Tughluq sought to place the son-in-law of one of Ilyas Shah's rivals as the sultan of Bengal. During the invasion, Sikandar Shah based himself in Ekdala fort like his father. The Delhi army besieged the island fort for months. After growing exhausted of Bengal's climate, the Delhi Sultan reached a peace treaty with Sikandar Shah. Delhi recognized Sikandar as an independent ruler. The peace treaty ensured Bengal's independence for two centuries.

Married to Marie Balestel, he had four children; the second one was named Jacques-Denis and became an organist. His older brother was Guillaume; the other two were Martin and Marie. Jacques-Denis married 10 November 1653MC XXXIII, 229. with H√©l√®ne Dumelin, daughter of a Parisian goldsmith, who brought him 2400 lt dowry. In 1655 he settled down with his wife in the rue du Fouarre, in the Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s parish. After 1669, he moved to rue de la Verrerie.and remained at this address until his death: he is quoted there in the Livre commode des adresses de Paris by Abraham Du Pradel (pseudonym of Nicolas de Bl√©gny), second edition (Paris: 1692). On 8 November 1684, Thomelin, as the executor of Pierre M√©litonPierre M√©liton on data.bnf.fr's will, organist of St. Jean Church, signed the inventory after the death of his deceased colleague (and probably friend).Paris AN : MC/ET/LXIX/451, at that date.

His post-death inventory is known:MC XCII, 284. In addition to 3000 lt in cash, he left musical manuscripts that were donated to his widow (the latter moved to rue des Prouvaires with her eldest daughter). Jacques-Denis (who at the end of his life also signed Alexandre, A. J. or A. J. D.) had two daughters. In 1683, cadet √âl√©onore married Nicolas Aunillon, Deputy Attorney General at the Grand Conseil. The elder, Marie-Madeleine, born before 1660, married Fran√ßois Collesson, businessman and clerk of Dupille, Receiver General for Finance of Lyon, by contract dated 18 March 1695.MC XCVII. There were disputes between the young couple and H√©l√®ne Dumolin, who finally disinherited her daughter, and asked her for the music she would have taken with her. These music sheets never reappeared. Guillaume Thomelin, Jacques-Denis' elder brother, was an organist like his brother and a master writer like his father. He married in 1657 the daughter of Gabrielle Lhuissier, widow of Jacques Oudinot, daughter of a master of the Mantes and Meulan waters and forests, and endowed by his father with a pension of 300 lt.Marriage contract in Paris ANF : Y 195, f. 386v, mentioned after Gaussen 1960 (pp. 200).  Career  The formation of Jacques-Denis Thomelin is not known. From 1653 onwards he was organist at the (until June 1669) when the instrument went to Claude de MontalanClaude de Montalan on data.bnf.fr and the Carmes de la place Maubert, a position he retained until his death and was occasionally replaced by his elder brother Guillaume. In 1667 he became the first organ holder of this church's new organ, just completed by the sons of the builder Pierre Thierry, and kept this job until 1685, when he passed it on to his pupil Tassin.Paris ANF : H 5, 4276/4277. In 1669, he obtained the organ of Saint-Jacques-la-Boucherie, due to the death of √âtienne Richard. An agreement concluded with the churchwardens of this parish on 22 June 1669 specifies the terms and conditions of this employment:MC II, 245. he received 400 lt of wages, of which 200 lt were withheld for the rent of a company residence on rue des Lombards, belonging to the factory.MC II, 247, 24 April 1670. The chapter registers of this church provide the text of a reprimand of the chapter to the organist: ::And like the length affected by Mr Thomelin, organist, in the playing of the organ during the service, wearies and tires both the clergy and the parishioners, who make continuous complaints about it that he was prayed various times but unnecessarily to cease it. We decided as well that said Thomelin will still be adverty <!advised?--> to conform better to the ceremonial of the church of Paris which wants in no ambiguous terms that the organ play is ny (neither) long ny (nor) precipitated, if not that we will be forced to provide for it.Paris ANF, LL 771 f. 60v, 11 January 1685, mentioned after Benoit 1971 VMR . The 1670s inaugurated a period of fame for him, during which he was called upon several times to evaluate organs.See acts on this subject in Hardouin 1958 . In 1678, he became sufficiently well known to compete in the Chapelle Royale organist competition, organized to replace Joseph Chabanceau de La Barre who died, during which time this office was divided into four quarters. He won the contest and took the first quarter (the one running from January to March), Jean-Baptiste Buterne, Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers and Nicolas Leb√®gue taking the following three quarters.About his nomination, see Paris AN : O/1/22. The records of Thomelin's wages can be found in Benoit 1971 MC between 1678 and 1692, according to various archival sources. Each organist earned 600 lt for his trimester. He gave lessons to the young Fran√ßois Couperin between 1679Charles Couperin, father and master of Fran√ßois, died prematurely that year. It is said that Thomelin was for him a second father. and 1685 and it is assumed that he did the same with Fran√ßois de Lalande, brother of Michel- Richard de Lalande, who apparently attended him at Saint-Jacques.ON that point, see Hardouin 1958 . He was included in the jury of the famous competition of April 1683 for the positions of sub-masters of the Chapel of the King.Benoit VMR . In addition to his role as organist, he purchased an office as Ordinary Secretary to the King. After his death, his pupil Couperin returned to his quarters in the Chapelle Royale.Patent for Fran√ßois Couperin to replace Jacques Thomelin who passed away: Paris ANF : O1 37 f. 237v, mentioned after Benoit 1971 MC : ::The after-dinner he [the king] would have liked to hear seven different organists play to choose one instead of one of his own (who was called Thommelin), who praised the death; but, after hearing them, he would not declare his choice, which was known three days after he had fallen upon a man named Couperin. (M√©moires of Sourches, 27 December 1693).Mentioned after Sourches 1970. At Saint-Jacques-la-Boucherie like the Carmes de la place Maubert, it was his nephew Louis-Jacques Thomelin (son of Guillaume) whom Jacques-Denis designated to replace him, at the charge of financing some minor repairs for the organ of Saint-Jacques, for defects that Jacques-Denis should have - according to the chapter - repaired in his time.

He was a prominent Telugu Niyogi Brahmin. He wrote \\"Kasi Yatra Charitra\\" Travelogue in Telugu about his pilgrimage to Varanasi. The book was first published in 1838, again in 1869 (Madras). This is the first remarkable travelogue published in Telugu. This book written in the form of daily letters by the author to his friend Srinivasa Pillai at Komateawarapuram, narrates the salient aspects of his pilgrimage. It is written in colloquial language and was printed thrice in 1838, 1869 and 1941. It brings out the ethos, customs and traditions of ancient India.  Early life and education  He was born on 1780 in Madras (now Chennai). He was a Niyogi Brahmin and from an early age studied English, Telugu, Sanskrit, and Tamil languages. He joined the Company at the age of 12 to work as a translator (dubasi), eventually rising to the post of \\"head interpreter\\" of the Madras Supreme court.  Pilgrimage  He started at Madras (Now Chennai) on 18 May 1830 on a long tour of this country. During his historical journey he covered many places in India. He stayed at places such as Tirupati, Kadapa, Ahobilam, Hyderabad, Vemulavada, Nirmal, Dhanora, Nagpur, Ramatenki, Jabalpur, Reema, Mirjapur, Prayaga, Kasi, Patna, Gaya, Rajmahal, Krishnanagar, Calcutta, Gopalpur, Cuttack, Puri-Jagannath, Chilka Lake, Ganjam, Chatrapur, Berhampur, Srikakulam, Vizianagram, Simhachalam, Rajahmundry, Ryali, Machilipaitnam, Bapatla, Chinna Ganjam, Nellore, Gudur, Naidupet, Sullurpet, Ponneri and returned to Madras on 3 September 1831. Hundreds of other historically important places were also visited by him in this pilgrimage to Kasi, Prayag etc. During this journey he maintained a journal. The journal is particularly valuable to us as it throws much light on the conditions of the country during the period indicated above. He is a keen observer and his observations on Hindu holy places, rivers, on religions such as Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Hindu mythology, astronomy, the customs, manners, castes, laws of the late Governments of the several places make a very interesting and absorbing study.

The rule has a long history in the law and has been an important element of the relationship between the courts and the legislature, but its role in modern jurisprudence is less clear. Overview Today, determining legislative intent is a critical job that arises from the distinct and separate roles played by the judiciary and the legislature in administering justice. Judges are routinely required to apply the relevant laws and rules passed by the legislature to the decisions they make. There are reasons this can be difficult. For one, laws are intended to apply generally and it would be impossible for the legislature to foresee all the possible situations to which they might apply after their enactment. Second, the manner in which laws are passed, which includes the influence of lobbying and interest groups, can sometimes obscure their purpose when finally enacted. Finally, the two branches are not allowed to \\"confer\\" with one another. Neither is the legislature allowed to add to a law it has already passed in order to affect a court's ruling, nor are the courts allowed to \\"inquire\\" as to how a law should be applied in the cases before them. The two institutions have evolved tools to make the job easier. For instance, statutes often contain \\"definition\\" sections, which attempt to make plain how the statute should be read. The courts have developed \\"canons of construction\\", rules which are intended to guide the manner in which a statute is to be applied. The rule of lenity is one such canon. Implicit in its provisions is the additional burden placed on the prosecution in a criminal case and the protection of individual rights against the powers of the state. It also furthers the fundamental principle of requiring notice in criminal law. Individuals should not be punished for their acts when the law fails to communicate to the public that such acts are forbidden. It is intended only to apply to those instances where the court recognizes the existence of more than one interpretation and where the decision that the court reaches harms or benefits the defendant to some greater or lesser degree. In that case, the rule requires the court to select the interpretation most beneficial (or least detrimental) to the defendant. History The traditional rule, also called the rule of strict construction, arose for a very different purpose in the English common law than those cited in U.S. law. English common law Originally, the rule was conceived by English judges trying to limit Parliament's use of the death penalty. When the facts of a case were not expressly described by a law, the court would \\"strictly construe\\" it so as to exclude its application to the case in question. A 1547, a law passed that denied a lesser sentence to first-time offenders convicted of \\"felonious stealing of Horses, Geldings or Mares\\" among other offenses. 1 Edw. VIII c.12(X)(3), (1547), The courts interpreted the law as only applying to those convicted of stealing two or more horses and allowed first-offenders who stole one horse to continue to avail themselves of the lesser penalty. The following year, Parliament explicitly addressed the rule's use with the passage of a new law, solely dedicated to horse thievery. They pointed to the prior law's \\"ambiguous\\" wording and its construction by the courts. The new law explicitly stated that those convicted of stealing \\"any Horse, Gelding, or Mare\\" shall be treated the same as those charged with \\"stealing two Horses, two Geldings, or two Mares, or any other\\". 2 & 3 Edw. VIII c.37(X)(3), (1547), Under the reign of George II, another law concerning first-offenders and livestock was similarly limited by the courts. This time, the act ambiguously referred to \\"Sheep, or other Cattle.\\" 14 Geo. II c.6(I), (1547), Again, the following year, Parliament passed a new \\"Act to Explain An Act\\". In it, they expressly spell out that it shall apply to \\"any Bull, Cow, Ox, Steer, Bullock, Heifer, Calf and Lamb, as well as sheep\\". Early American law Laying out the rule's application in the American courts, it was first cited in 1820 by Chief Justice John Marshall in United States v. Wiltberger: > The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much > less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the > law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle, that the > power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial > department. ... [T]hough penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are > not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the > legislature. The maxim is not to be so applied as to narrow the words of the > statute... in their ordinary acceptation, or in which the legislature has > obviously used them.... The intention of the legislature is to be collected > from the words they employ. Where there is no ambiguity in *the words, there > is no room for construction.18 US 76, 95 (Supreme Court 1820). 20th century After its initial wide acceptance, other canons, such as the clear statement rule and the vagueness doctrine, have encroached on the rule and its use by the courts. In 1961, Justice Frankfurter wrote in Callanan v. United States, that the rule is for expressing the will of Congress, not protecting defendants from it: > The rule of lenity [is] for resolving an ambiguity, not [creating one].... > The rule comes into operation at the end of the process of interpreting what > Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration > of being lenient to wrongdoers.364 U.S. 587, 596 (Supreme Court 1961) Islamic law Islamic law has a similar tenet which allows the imposition of punishments only in the absence of \\"doubt or ambiguity\\". Modern status in US The rule is today seen as an expression of legislative supremacy. It is infrequently cited in contemporary opinions. During oral arguments for the 2016 case, Lockhart v. United States,136 S. Ct. 958 (Supreme Court 2016) Justice Antonin Scalia sua sponte raised the question of the rule's application: > \\"...what I worry about is the rule of lenity. You have these dueling canons, > and you have a rule that when the government sends somebody to jail for 10 > years, it has to cross sharp corners. It has to dot every i and cross every > t. It has to be clear!\\" In the end, he joined the majority in refusing to apply the rule. 136 S. Ct. 958 at 968 See the dissent by Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer. They expressly support the rule and its use in the case before them (136 S. Ct. at 977). In State v. Thonesavanh, The Minnesota Supreme Court expressly rejected the position that the rule \\"allows a defendant to prevail in every instance in which a criminal statute is ambiguous.\\"State v. Thonesavanh No.A15-2017, pt. III, para. 1 (decided Sep. 6, 2016) At issue was the question of whether the word \\"take,\\" as used in the state's law against auto theft, Minn. Stat. 609.52, subd. 2(a)(17) required the accused to actually move the vehicle, or, as in this case, merely to enter it and lock the doors. The court relied on the doctrine of in pari materia in holding that the mere \\"temporary control\\" of the car was enough under the statue. On the other hand, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court cited the rule in Commonwealth v. DaytonNo. SJC-12213, Discussion para. 2 (decided June 1, 2017) in ruling that the ambiguous language in the state's OUI law did not permit suspects to be held without bail unless they have been convicted three times under the statute, as opposed to being arrested three times. State codification The states of Florida and Ohio have codified the rule. The Florida statute states that the code \\"shall be strictly construed; when the language is susceptible of differing constructions, it shall be construed most favorably to the accused.\\" The Ohio law states simply that offenses and penalties shall be \\"strictly construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\\" More states, however, have eliminated the rule by statute.

Shabbily clad, barefoot, her hair knotted and uncombed, M'Liss scorned the girls from the city who had Mamas and always had ribbons in their hair. But this was before the new Schoolmaster (Steele) came, and she began to realize how sadly ignorant she was. Of course, he was handsome and well groomed. M'Liss was not surprised by that, but she could believe her ears when he told her that he loved her and wanted her to go away with him. The little wildcat of the mountains began to earnestly study her textbooks, to wear becoming clothes supplied by her two guardians, and awoke to all that she had been missing before in her solitary existence in her father's shack. One thing that M'Liss did not have to learn in school was the winsome ways of a maid to win a man. This is where her eternal feminine cropped out to beat the village belle to the goal.

He achieved some success in the 1960s in the Keef Hartley Band playing electric guitar under the pseudonym Spit James before becoming enamoured of the gypsy jazz style originated by Django Reinhardt in the 1930s and devoting almost all of his energies to educating, performing and promoting activities in this area up till his death in 2017. He published several influential books on gypsy jazz, was producer and music co-ordinator for the TV Documentary Django Legacy, was the owner of the Fret Records record label, and organised the UK Gypsy Jazz Guitar Festival annually from 1997 to 2000. Biography Ian Cruickshank grew up in the south-east of England where he formed his first band, The Ian Lloyd Bluesmen, in 1965 at the age of 18. One night in 1968, after a gig supporting John Mayall's Bluesbreakers he was approached by Mayall's drummer Keith \\"Keef\\" Hartley who was leaving Mayall to form his own band, and asked Cruickshank to join; turning professional by this means, and with the stage name of \\"Spit James\\" (coined by Hartley so as to sound more like a bluesman), Cruickshank went on to record two albums with the band (Halfbreed and The Battle Of North West Six) before leaving after 18 months. His work on Halfbreed caught the ear of many fans, one retrospective reviewer stating that Ian/Spit was \\"rather the star of the album\\". After leaving Hartley, Ian concentrated on teaching and session work, and at some point he became fascinated with the playing of the late jazz guitar legend Django Reinhardt and taught himself to play quite effectively in this style - a feat given the dearth of gypsy jazz stylists in the U.K. at that time. Eventually in May 1978 he made his way to the village of Samois-sur-Seine to attend the Django Reinhardt memorial jazz festival which in that year was celebrating 25 years after the death of Django and discovered how the living tradition of gypsy jazz was flourishing among the Manouche gypsies of France and northern Europe. Documenting his experiences in a magazine article the following year entitled \\"Django Re-visited\\", he described his discovery of players such as Boulou and Elios Ferr√© playing with their father Matelo, Rapha√´l Fa√øs, Christian Escoud√© as well as those of the older generation then still performing including Django's brother Joseph Reinhardt and Django's first son Lousson, who were by then playing more in an electric style. Ian also taped a number of these performances on a small portable tape recorder and later made the performances available on a subscription-only cassette entitled \\"Gypsy Jazz from France\\" which for many U.K. enthusiasts was their first opportunity to access performances of this style of music by living musicians. Around this time Ian was contributing a monthly column \\"Guitar Django Style\\" to the U.K.'s Guitar magazine, which were eventually collated to form the nucleus of Ian's first published book, \\"The Guitar Style of Django Reinhardt\\" (1982) which also included numerous original photographs as well as notes on present-day gypsy practitioners of the style. He was active in promoting gypsy jazz performances in the U.K. by bringing over artists such as Waso, Rapha√´l Fa√øs and Bir√©li Lagr√®ne as well as performing with his own groups, entitled first Swing Guitars and later, Ian Cruckshank's Gypsy Jazz. In 1994 Ian produced a second book entitled \\"Django's Gypsies: The Mystique of Django Reinhardt and his People\\" which was subtitled \\"a unique collection of photographs, illustrations, memorabilia and quotations\\" and included reprints of a number of articles along with numerous original and rare photographs related to the gypsies and gypsy jazz. In 1991 he was producer and music co- ordinator for John Jeremy's TV Documentary \\"Django Legacy\\". He organised the U.K. \\"Gypsy Jazz Guitar Festival\\" annually from 1997 to 2000, and appeared as a guest artist on three compilation albums from these for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000. He also produced an instructional VHS tape (later DVD) \\"Gypsy Jazz Guitar\\" as well as additional books entitled \\"Getting Started With Jazz Guitar\\", \\"Notes\\", \\"The A to Z of Django\\", \\"Chord and Discord\\", and \\"Noticed Moments\\", as well as appearing on the CDs Swingin' Spirits and Django Meets the Duke (both with the U.S.-based group Pearl Django), Water Gypsy, and Now and Zen. As a sideline, he founded \\"Fret Records\\" to release these and other albums of gypsy jazz interest. His death at the age of 70 was reported in April 2017. Chris Martin, writing on the \\"djangobooks\\" forum, expressed the views of many when he wrote: \\"Every Brit, and many others, who love the Django style owe him a huge thanks for everything he has done over the years, his books were my first introduction to the style.\\" Discography * ?? ‚Äì Ian Cruickshank's Gypsy Jazz (1993) * FJCD 107 ‚Äì Swingin' Spirits - Ian Cruickshank with Pearl Django (1995) * FJCD 109 ‚Äì Django Meets The Duke - Ian Cruickshank's Gypsy Jazz, with Alan Barnes, Johhny Van Derrick and Pearl Django (1996) * FJCD 114 ‚Äì The Gypsy Jazz Guitar Festival '98 (1998) - Ian appears on tracks 1-2 (as the Paul Chester Trio), 10 (with Claudine Valadier- Larne), and 13-14 (with Patrick Sausois et al.) * FJCD 115 ‚Äì The Gypsy Jazz Guitar Festival '99 (1999) - Ian appears on tracks 1-2 (as the Paul Chester Trio) and 10-11 (with Mito and Dorno) * FJCD 116 ‚Äì Water Gypsy - Ian Cruickshank (?2000) * FJCD 117 ‚Äì The Gypsy Jazz Guitar Festival 2000 (2000) - Ian Cruickshank's Gypsy Jazz perform on tracks 1‚Äì3. * FJCD 118 ‚Äì Now and Zen - Cruickshank/Morgan/Coverdale - with John Coverdale, guitar; Pete Morgan, bass Published books and DVDs * The Guitar Style of Django Reinhardt Book, self-published, 1982; subsequently reprinted as \\"The Guitar Style of Django Reinhardt & the Gypsies\\". * Django's Gypsies: The Mystique of Django Reinhardt and his People.

According to eyewitnesses, Burmese soldiers allegedly carried out the massacre with the support of local Rakhines who also resided in the village. Eyewitnesses claim that at least 200 women and 300 children were killed; however, this has not been verified and there is no official estimate. Satellite images collected before and after the massacre by Amnesty International showed Rohingya neighbourhoods in Tula Toli completely destroyed, whilst Rakhine neighbourhoods remained intact. Background The Rohingya people are an ethnic minority that mainly live in the northern region of Rakhine State, Myanmar, and have been described as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. In modern times, the persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar dates back to the 1970s. Since then, Rohingya people have regularly been made the target of persecution by the government and nationalist Buddhists. The tension between various religious groups in the country had often been exploited by the past military governments of Myanmar. According to Amnesty International, the Rohingya have suffered from human rights violations under past military dictatorships since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result. In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had assisted with the repatriation of Rohingyas from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps threatened this effort. In 2015, 140,000 Rohingyas remained in IDP camps after communal riots in 2012. On 9 October 2016, insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched their first large-scale attack on Burmese border posts on the Bangladesh‚ÄìMyanmar border, with a second large-scale attack on 25 August 2017, leading to new \\"clearance operations\\" by the government, one of which was conducted in Tula Toli. Prelude According to eyewitnesses, a group of around 90 Myanmar Army soldiers arrived in Tula Toli three days prior to the massacre and ordered the villagers to an area east of the settlement, which locals call \\"the sands\\" because of the area's infertile soil. The soldiers' commander ordered the villagers not to flee and to continue farming and fishing, and warned them that \\"If you run, we will shoot.\\" Villagers who escaped the massacre claim that during the briefing, soldiers and Rakhine collaborators went to all the huts inhabited by Rohingyas to loot valuables and detain people at random. The day before the massacre at Tula Toli, residents from a village across the river called Dual Toli swam over to escape an attack by soldiers on their village. According to eyewitnesses, ten of those fleeing the attack drowned in the river. Dual Toli was razed and burnt to the ground as the residents of Tula Toli watched helplessly. Massacre On the morning of 30 August 2017, the Myanmar Army and local collaborators surrounded Tula Toli and blocked off all the exit points. The Rakhine chairman of the village assured the Rohingya villagers that the soldiers would not harm them, but that their homes would be torched. He then told the villagers to assemble in one place where they would be safe. By the end of the morning, the huts of Rohingyas in the village were all burnt down. Satellite images provided by Amnesty International show all the Rohingya huts in the village burnt, whilst the Rakhine ones remained intact. Women and children were separated from the men first and were told to sit next to the river. Women in the river were ordered to get out and sit down along the riverbank. After a while they were all ordered to stand up, then sit down again. Finally they were ordered to stand, and the soldiers shouted at the women to run. As they started running, the soldiers opened fire on them. Some of the women attempted to escape the bullets by swimming across the river, only to drown in the river's current. Babies and young children were thrown into a river by soldiers. According to survivors, the men were lined up along the riverbank and shot by automatic rifles, decapitated, burned alive, lynched or blown up by rocket-propelled grenades. The soldiers paused for a moment afterwards and shouted for any survivors to stand up, then fired their rifles again to ensure the victims' deaths. The bodies were buried in mass graves alongside the riverbank by the army and burnt to avoid leaving evidence of the massacre. Aftermath After the massacre, a group of around 30 women survived. They alleged that the army told them to wait along the river again, where five women from the group were taken at a time into nearby huts and raped by soldiers. After raping them, the soldiers allegedly robbed them of their jewelry, beat them and set their huts ablaze. According to a survivor of the massacre, a group of children managed to escape the massacre and took shelter in a nearby paddy field, but were later caught by the military, placed on the floor and impaled. Their bodies were then thrown in the river.

National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Portrait of Charles Marcotte (also known as Marcotte d'Argenteuil) is an 1810 oil on canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste- Dominique Ingres, completed during the artists first stay in Rome. Charles Marie Jean Baptiste Marcotte (1773-1864) was a long term friend, loyal supporter and adviser to Ingres, and commissioned a number of portraits of his family and friends, as well as works such as Odalisque with Slave (1839). He was 23 years in age when the portrait was painted, and serving as inspector general for Waters and Forests in Napoleonic Rome.Rosenblum, 70 Although handsome, and possessing strong bone structure, he is portrayed as dour and serious, dressed in an imposing military uniform, and given a stern facial expression, with tightly pursed lips, which are turned down at the corners. A number of art historians have noted how his stiffness resemble Ingres' own early self-portraits, particularly that of 1804.Conisbee, 124 Marcotte stands against a plain grey-green background, leaning against a table draped with a red cloth.Conisbee, 122 His stiff, starched white and yellow neck collar appears tight and restrictive. He wears a blue carrick with a cape and velvet collar, over a white shirt and yellow waistcoat. Affectionately, his hair appears ruffled, which somewhat breaks the overall grim and morose tone. Special attention is given to his claw-like right hand, with its long sinuous fingers, the shape of which is echoed by the tassels protruding from the scroll beside him. Marcotte commissioned the portrait as a gift to his mother. He did not like the final painting, finding it too stern, a fact Ingres asked him to keep to himself. It remained in his possession until his death in 1864, after which it passed to his son Joseph Marcotte, and then to his widow, and to his daughter √âlisabeth Pougin de la Maisonneuve until 1935.

The Commission was chaired by John Henry Whitley. The commission submitted its report in 1931. The report surprised many by concurring with the criticisms of Mahatma Gandhi and others that poverty was the cause of India's social and industrial problems. It was also critical of British employers' role in perpetuating the problems. The Royal Commission on Labour in 1931 pointed out the need for systematic collection of labour statistics. It observed that the policy must be built on facts as the uncertainty of facts would lead to confusion and conflict regarding its aim. The Commission recommended the adoption of suitable legislation enabling the Competent Authority to collect and collate information regarding the living, working and socio-economic conditions of industrial labour.

The theme of APEC in 2003 is \\"Different worlds: Partnership for the Future\\", which aims to bring together the greatest potential of all APEC economies to meet future challenges, in particular the free and open trade of APEC and investment in the developed APEC economies. This central theme is magnified by a series of five sub-themes designed to guide APEC working groups and forums in achieving their objectives.

Various meetings were held across the country, with leaders from all the member countries meeting 20‚Äì21 October 2001 in Shanghai. Background Al-Qaeda's attacks against America on 11 September 2001 initiated international counterterrorism efforts, as well as attempts to mitigate its economic impact. Many of the member states were still dealing with the fallout of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, whose effects on the price of oil led to the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Discontent with globalization had erupted into major protests in Seattle, Prague, and Genoa. Even China, the only economy to experience rapid growth in the region through the period thanks to various protections against capital flight, saw weaker- than-projected growth and made efforts to improve non-performing loans in its banking system and its dependency on trade with the United States. The leaders' meeting for APEC China 2001 was held shortly after the September 11th Attacks on New York City and Washington, DC, in the United States, which quickly led to a \\"War on Terror\\" and an invasion of Afghanistan by American forces.People's Daily (10 Oct 2001), \\"APEC Meeting to Be Held in Shanghai as Scheduled\\". The United Nations Security Council had already passed Resolutions 1368 (condemning the attacks) and 1373 (initiating international counterterrorism arrangements), but not yet authorized an international military response. PresidentGeorge W. Bush had cancelled a scheduled trip to China, Japan, and South Korea to deal with the attack and its fallout, but arranged to meet those countries' leaders while at the APEC meetings in Shanghai.People's Daily (27 Sep 2001), \\"Preparation for APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting 2001 Smoothly: FM Spokesman\\". Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan visited Washington to conclude preliminary arrangements with Vice-President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin Powell in mid-September.People's Daily (26 Sep 2001), \\"Economic Issue to Top Agenda of Summit, Terrorism to Be Concerned\\". Bush has visited in China on his first international trip since the September 11 attacks and China offered strong public support for the War on Terror. The meetings also took place during and after the negotiations for a 20-year treaty between Russia and China. The treaty, signed on 16 July, stipulated economic and military cooperation between the two countries and also outlined a policy of general friendliness and cooperation. Administration APEC China 2001 was overseen by a steering committee headed by Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and including Shanghai mayor Xu Kuangdi and Party secretary Huang Ju; Organization Department head Zeng Qinghong; State Council secretary-general Wang Zhongyu; Central Office director Wang Gang; Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Jiaxuan; and Minister of Foreign Trade Shi Guangsheng.. Tang, Shi, and Xu also took on a more direct role as members of the conference's Preparatory Commission. Wang Guangya and Zhang Yesui, then vice- minister and assistant minister at the Foreign Office, managed day-to-day affairs as the heads of the conference's secretariat. Mission APEC member states (dark green) have remained constant for decades despite others interested in joining (light green), in part because of the trauma of the 1997 Asian financial crisis The planned overarching theme of the meetings was \\"Meeting New Challenges in the New Century: Achieving Common Prosperity through Participation and Cooperation\\", with the subthemes \\"Sharing the Benefits of Globalization and the New Economy\\", \\"Advancing Trade and Investment\\", and \\"Promoting Sustained Economic Growth\\".. Discussion of globalization and the \\"New Economy\\" were focused on ecotechnology, e-commerce, human resource development, and corporate governance. Discussion of trade and investment focused on non-binding principles of trade facilitation, improving regional investment competitiveness, the next WTO round, and the Bogor Goals regarding trade liberalization. Discussion of sustained growth focused on international financial cooperation, improving macroeconomic forecasting, and structural reform to improve industrial competitiveness. In practice, the 11 September Attacks in the United States refocused most of the September and October meetings around counterterrorism; the US wars \\"on Terror\\" and with Afghanistan; and cooperation to address the negative economic effects of the attacks....McMillan, Alex Frew, \\"'Shanghai Accord' Sets APEC Trade Agenda\\", CNN, 21 October 2001.

Ahead of the October events, Shanghai spent a considerable sum on beautifying the city and refurbishing the major 4- and 5-star hotels,People's Daily (10 Oct 2001), \\"Shanghai Takes on New Look to Welcome APEC\\". including providing them with drinkable tap water. Suzhou Creek‚Äîwhich had been notorious for its foul odor for over 80 years‚Äîwas thoroughly cleaned. Bridges and other infrastructure were examined and improved where needed, including an expansion of Pudong Airport to accommodate VIP arrivals and departures without inconvenience to other travelers.People's Daily (5 Oct 2001), \\"Shanghai Pudong Airport Well Prepared for APEC Meeting\\". 320 million was spent improving the city's telecommunications, including internet and satellite upgrades. The Great Firewall was partially opened, with websites for the BBC, CNN, The Washington Post, and some other western media outlets available during the event.Bray, Marianne, \\"China Unblocks News Sites as Leaders Gather\\", CNN, 17 October 2001. Security was heavily tightened, with more than 10,000 personnel brought in to guard the hotels, venues, and associated facilities. Shanghai's airspace and coastline were also heavily monitored throughout the events.People's Daily (14 Oct 2001), \\"Security Tightened for Safety of APEC Meetings: Spokesperson\\". Mayor Xu Kuangdi boasted that \\"Shanghai is now the safest city in the world\\" while noting that the municipal government was taking pains to assure that the people of Shanghai were not inconvenienced in their daily lives by the international conference.People's Daily (12 Oct 2001), \\"Shanghai Ready for APEC Meeting\\". (In the event of a disaster or attack, the 1,000-odd volunteers staffing the event also received tens of thousands of RMB in disability and life insurance from Ping'an, totaling 1.14 billion $137 million) overall.)People's Daily (11 Oct 2001), \\"APEC Work Staff Get 1.14 Billion Yuan Insurance\\". Beginning in early 2000, various workers around the city were trained in English to assist international visitors.

Russian president Vladimir Putin with Bush at the Economic Leaders' Meeting in Shanghai, wearing tang jackets APEC China 2001 occurred in several stages throughout the year in different major cities around the country. It began in early February at the national capital Beijing. The APEC Symposium on e-Commerce and Paperless Trading ran from 9‚Äì10 February, and the first Senior Officials' Meeting from 11‚Äì19 Feb.. In May, there was a \\"high-level meeting\\" on Human Capacity Building in Beijing on the 15th & 16th; an ASC Consortium Meeting in the northern port of Tianjin from the 18th to the 20th; and the second Senior Officials' Meeting in the southern manufacturing center and port of Shenzhen from the 26th until 3 June. Also in June, the Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade occurred in the eastern port of Shanghai on the 6th and 7th. The 2nd APEC Investment Mart occurred from the 9th to the 15th in the northern port of Yantai, Shandong. In July, the Youth Science Festival took place in Shanghai from the 9th to the 14th. In August, the Manchurian port of Dalian, Liaoning, hosted the third Senior Officials' Meeting from the 16th to the 24th; Beijing hosted the WLN Meeting from the 22nd to 25th; and Shanghai hosted the SMEs Ministers' Meeting from the 26th to the 31st. In September, the Finance Ministers' Meeting was held in the eastern manufacturing center and historic city of Suzhou, Jiangsu, from the 6th to the 9th and the fourth Technomart‚Äîduring which 513 contracts were signed, with a total value of $1.07 billionPeople's Daily (26 Sep 2001), \\"APEC Technical Fair Concludes\\".‚Äîwas held in the same city from the 21st to 25th.People's Daily (13 Sep 2001) \\"HK Delegation to Attend APEC Technomart in Suzhou\\", (22 Sep 2001) \\"APEC Technology Exhibition, Trade Fair Opens in Suzhou\\", & (24 Sep 2001), \\"APEC Technomart: Show of Future Technology\\".

The Shanghai Accord iterated the group's support for the 1994 Bogor Goals of reducing tariffs between one another to zero by the year 2020. The importance of China to such action‚Äîat the time, it was the only country in the Asia- Pacific region experiencing rapid economic growth‚Äîled to renewed support for its impending ascension to full membership in the World Trade Organization and prompted calls to \\"work together to fight against protectionism in all forms\\". Some smaller states like Malaysia had expressed discontent in Shanghai with how globalization placed the rich \\"firmly in control\\".McMillan, Alex Frew, \\"Bush: Terrorists Attacked World and Free Trade\\", CNN, 20 October 2001. US trade representative Robert Zoellick praised China for its efforts at APEC and the following months for pushing such member economies to join the Doha round of trade negotiations.China Daily (2 Feb 2002), \\"US Trade Rep Praises Role of China in Negotiations\\". In light of the growing importance of the internet, the leaders also agreed to take steps‚Äîincluding two programs arranged at the earlier ministerial meetings‚Äîto expand digital penetration to all members, with the aim of reducing the \\"digital divide\\" between more and less developed states. The APEC leaders issued a separate counter-terrorism statement, committing to \\"prevent and suppress all forms of terrorist acts in the future\\", including enacting regulations and legislation to prevent terrorist funding.People's Daily (21 Oct 2001), \\"APEC Leaders Statement on Counter- terrorism (Full Text)\\". Bush spoke of the fight against terrorism as \\"the urgent task of our time\\", claiming \\"there is no isolation from evil\\" and \\"every nation must oppose this enemy or turn into its target\\".. He used the conferences, particularly his centerpiece address, as an opportunity to enlist the support of Asian political and business leaders for counterterrorism and his nascent war in Afghanistan, as well as economic recovery from the attacks. Some efforts were weakened by resistance from APEC's three majority Muslim states, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Chinese officials also initially attempted to maintain the summit's economic focus before yielding to American concerns. In the end, both Jiang and Putin spoke strongly about the need to \\"unswervingly oppose... terrorism in any form, whenever and wherever it occurs and who[m]ever it targets\\", while particularly connecting such opposition to Russia's ongoing Chechnyan Conflict and China's issues tamping down Uyghur separatism, both of which had drawn some international complaints.McMillan, Alex Frew, \\"APEC Unites against Terror\\", CNN, 22 October 2001. Rather than considering these cases separately, Jiang advocated \\"a unanimous attitude and a sole standard should be adopted in fighting terrorism and... all forms of terrorism should be opposed and crushed\\". At the same time, Jiang emphasized that reprisals against terrorism‚Äîsuch as that beginning to be untaken by the United States‚Äîshould be undertaken within UN guidelines and frameworks. In the months following APEC, the United Nations Security Council would unanimously pass Resolutions 1377 (concerning international counterterrorism); 1378 and 1383 (condemning the existing government of Afghanistan and envisioning its future replacement under UN auspices); and 1386 (authorizing the International Security Assistance Force to assist the US military in the removal of the existing Afghani government).

The PGD algorithm computes an approximation of the solution of the BVP by successive enrichment. This means that, in each iteration, a new component (or mode) is computed and added to the approximation. The more modes obtained, the closer the approximation is to its theoretical solution. By selecting only the first PGD modes, a reduced order model of the solution is obtained. Because of this, PGD is considered a dimensionality reduction algorithm. In addition, it is considered as a generalized form of the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition.  Description  The proper generalized decomposition is a method characterized by (1) a variational formulation of the problem, (2) a discretization of the domain in the style of the finite element method, (3) the assumption that the solution can be approximated as a separated representation and (4) a numerical greedy algorithm to find the solution. The most implemented variational formulation in PGD is the Bubnov-Galerkin method, although other implementations exist. The discretization of the domain is a well defined set of procedures that cover (a) the creation of finite element meshes, (b) the definition of basis function on reference elements (also called shape functions) and (c) the mapping of reference elements onto the elements of the mesh. PGD assumes that the solution u of a (multidimensional) problem can be approximated as a separated representation of the form :: mathbf{u} approx mathbf{u}^N(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_d) = sum_{i=1}^N mathbf{X_1}_i(x_1) cdot mathbf{X_2}_i(x_2) cdots mathbf{X_d}_i(x_d), where the number of addends N and the functional products X1(x1), X2(x2), ..., Xd(xd), each depending on a variable (or variables), are unknown beforehand. The solution is sought by applying a greedy algorithm, usually the fixed point algorithm, to the weak formulation of the problem. For each iteration i of the algorithm, a mode of the solution is computed. Each mode consists of a set of numerical values of the functional products X1(x1), ..., Xd(xd), which enrich the approximation of the solution. Note that due to the greedy nature of the algorithm, the term 'enrich' is used rather than 'improve'. The number of computed modes required to obtain an approximation of the solution below a certain error threshold depends on the stop criterium of the iterative algorithm. Unlike POD, PGD modes are not necessarily orthogonal to each other.  Features  PGD is suitable for solving high-dimensional problems, since it overcomes the limitations of classical approaches. In particular, PGD avoids the curse of dimensionality, as solving decoupled problems is computationally much less expensive than solving multidimensional problems. Therefore, PGD enables to re-adapt parametric problems into a multidimensional framework by setting the parameters of the problem as extra coordinates: :: mathbf{u} approx mathbf{u}^N(x_1, ldots, x_d; k_1, ldots, k_p) = sum_{i=1}^N mathbf{X_1}_i(x_1) cdots mathbf{X_d}_i(x_d) cdot mathbf{K_1}_i(k_1) cdots mathbf{K_p}_i(k_p), where a series of functional products K1(k1), K2(k2), ..., Kp(kp), each depending on a parameter (or parameters), has been incorporated to the equation. In this case, the obtained approximation of the solution is called computational vademecum: a general meta-model containing all the particular solutions for every possible value of the involved parameters.  Sparse Subspace Learning  The Sparse Subspace Learning (SSL) method leverages the use of hierarchical collocation to approximate the numerical solution of parametric models. With respect to traditional projection-based reduced order modeling, the use of a collocation enables non- intrusive approach based on sparse adaptive sampling of the parametric space. This allows to recover the lowdimensional structure of the parametric solution subspace while also learning the functional dependency from the parameters in explicit form. A sparse low-rank approximate tensor representation of the parametric solution can be built through an incremental strategy that only needs to have access to the output of a deterministic solver. Non- intrusiveness makes this approach straightforwardly applicable to challenging problems characterized by nonlinearity or non affine weak forms.

He was born at Balaklava, South Australia, to bank manager Edward Blore Bednall and Naomi Caroline Gertrude, n√©e Ferry. He attended Pulteney Grammar School and the Collegiate School of St Peter, but left during the Great Depression following the death of his father. He became a journalist at the Adelaide News and then at the Sun and the Herald. From 1937 to 1938 he was a special correspondent in Darwin, where he met Hilda Marion Abbott, daughter of administrator Aubrey Abbott, whom he married on 4 February 1939 in Radlett, Hertfordshire. From 1938 Bednall worked for Australian Associated Press in London, and from 1942 to 1944 was aviation correspondent for the Daily Mail. His articles were informed by his flights as a qualified gunner over Germany. In 1945 he worked briefly as a correspondent for Lord Louis Mountbatten's command in India, and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the war effort. Although he was an assistant editor at the Daily Mail, he was persuaded to return to Australia by his mentor, Keith Murdoch, who made him managing editor of Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd, and therefore the Courier-Mail. In 1954 he succeeded Murdoch as managing editor of the Argus in Melbourne. Bednall was the first managing director of GTV 9, one of Melbourne's first two commercial television stations; this became the local station for Channel Nine, and Bednall cultivated a number of local television personalities, including Graham Kennedy. In 1965, he left the channel after a disagreement over finances. He was then appointed to UNESCO's space communications committee, and from 1966 to 1969 he managed an English-Chinese television station in Hong Kong. His time in China saw his previously conservative political views shift to the left, and when he returned to Australia he joined the Labor Party, and ran unsuccessfully for the seat of Flinders in the federal elections of 1972 and 1974. From 1973 to 1975, he also worked as a part-time media consultant for Gough Whitlam. In 1976 he died suddenly of hypertensive heart disease at the age of 63.

It prohibits and penalizes physical harm and violence in such practices. Background The Anti-Hazing Act was passed as a response to the death of Leonardo Villa in 1991. Villa died from multiple injuries when he underwent hazing rites by the Aquila Legis, a fraternity of law students at the Ateneo de Manila University. Two decades later in 2012, the Supreme Court of the Philippines found five members of the fraternity guilty of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. The Anti-Hazing Act couldn't be applied to the five since it was still yet to be enacted as law when Villa died. Convictions By 2017, only 1 conviction has been made under the Anti-Hazing Act which was in 2015 when two Alpha Phi Omega members were found guilty for the death of Marlon Villanueva, a University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os student, in 2006 Proposed amendments Bills to amend the Anti-Hazing Act has been passed in both the Upper and Lower House. In 2016, Majority leader Tito Sotto passed Senate Bill 223 which aims to impose the maximum penalty for violators under the influence of alcohol and illegal drugs as well as if a non-resident or alumni fraternity member present during the hazing rites. Both Win Gatchalian's Senate Bill 199 and Bagong Henerasyon party-list representative Bernadette Herrera-Dy's House Bill 3467 seeks to ban all forms of hazing, only allowing initiation rites which do not inflict physical or psychological harm. Gatchalian's bill also proposes to impose stiffer penalties and fine to non-resident and intoxicated members involved in hazing, additional fine if hazing results to death, mutilation, rape, and sodomy, and requiring schools to conduct awareness campaign on hazing.

Self-Portrait at Seventy- Eight is an 1858 oil-on-canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It is one of the last of his many portraits, which he had always regarded as bothersome distractions from his true calling, history painting. The painting measures 24 3/8 x 20 1/8 inches (62 x 51 cm) and is in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. The self-portrait is renowned for its honest treatment of the physical effects of old age. Ingres' expression is foreboding and intense, and he is tightly wrapped in stiff military like clothes. The work was painted at a point when Ingres, owing to age, could no longer commit to society portraits, which typically took him 4-5 years to complete. Ingres was to live a further nine years, dying on 14 January 1867, aged 86. History In 1839 the director of the Uffizi, Antonio Ramirez di Montalvo, sent Ingres a letter requesting the donation of a painting of himself for the museum's gallery of self-portraits of great artists. Ingres demurred, believing that his obligations as director of the French Academy in Rome‚Äîand the work he was just beginning on Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry‚Äîwould leave him no time to undertake the self-portrait. In 1855 Montalvo's successor, Marchese Luca Bourbon del Monte, renewed the request; this time Ingres felt able to oblige. On 20 March 1858, Ingres reported to Bourbon del Monte that he had completed the portrait. His letter reads in part: > I beg you, Monsieur le Directeur, to accept all my excuses and regret for > not complying sooner to the request that you so kindly addressed to me. But > I have just completed my portrait, finally, and I am ready to send it to > you. However, I wanted to make this portrait simple and humble so that the > great Painters among whom I am about to sit will not accuse me of prideful > temerity. In the first known instance of Ingres using a photograph as his primary source for a portrait, he modelled the painting on a photograph of ca. 1855 by Gerothwohl and Tanner. The painting was likely completed with the assistance of unidentified collaborators, though the passages describing his face can only have come from his hand. Description The self-portrait is brutally honest and mostly bereft of vanity; as a study of old age it goes beyond even his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin which he deliberately invokes. As always, Ingres took Raphael as his stylistic ideal. The 1669 self-portrait by Rembrandt, an artist Ingres generally held in low regard, has been suggested as an influence as well.Conisbee, 463 Self-Portrait, 1864‚Äì65, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp Rembrandt, Self-portrait at the age of 63, 1669. National Gallery, London Ingres presents himself in half bust view, dressed in clothing that suggest a cultivated, rich, well traveled and influential man. He is slimmer in the painting than he was in real life at the time, and wears an evening dress uniform that reflects his status as grand officer in Napoleon's Legion of Honour.Finberg, 30 Although Ingres appears aged and troubled, the portrait contains hints of optimism; he had been widowed but had recovered and was happily married to his second wife Dominique Rame, and could look back on a commercially successful if not artistically fulfilling career.Conisbee, 459 He gives himself a grim expression, with a down turned mouth, which art historians view as overstating his existential view ‚Äì extant photographs from the period show him almost, or about to smile, and his letters from this period reflect a degree of contentment.Conisbee, 462 His expression is often interpreted by modern art historians as conflicted, troubled and bad tempered, the reflection of a frustrated history painter at the end of a career spent largely on society painting.Conisbee, 462 The painting was widely praised when first exhibited, and is today considered one of the finest examples of self- portraiture in art history. It is often compared to Rembrandt's later self- portraits, although Ingres's work contains hints of vanity that the older master's did not; Ingres has smoothed out his skin and has more and darker grey hair than contemporary photographs suggest. Ingres painted two variant copies of the portrait. One was completed in 1859, when Ingres reworked an octagonal, oil-on-paper sketch he had made for the Uffizi portrait. By mounting it on a rectangular canvas, he made it into a pendant for his Portrait of Madame Ingres, painted the same year.Cohn and Siegfried, 158 In this version Ingres wears several state decorations and ribbons, and he holds a top hat with a gloved hand. The face is more loosely painted than in the Uffizi portrait, and Ingres does not omit the cowlick that is apparent in the source photograph. The portrait is in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US. Ingres painted a near-replica of the Fogg painting in 1864‚Äì65 to fulfill a membership obligation to the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, which owns the painting.

The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified on July 9, 1868, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as extending this prohibition to laws enacted by the states.  Supreme Court case law  Some limits on expression were contemplated by the framers and have been defined by the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1942, the issue of group defamation was first most explicitly brought up in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, which surrounded the issue of a Jehovah's Witness, Walter Chaplinsky, who verbally attacked a town marshal for restricting his use of a public sidewalk to protest organized religion by calling him a \\"damned fascist\\" and \\"racketeer.\\" Later, when the court heard Beauharnais v.IllinoisBEAUHARNAIS v. PEOPLE of the STATE OF ILLINOIS. 343 U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952). https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/250, establishing the narrow traditional exception to the first amendment covering those words which by their very utterances tend to inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.Head, T., Head, T., & Aclu. (2019, July 18). 6 Major U.S. Supreme Court Hate Speech Cases. Retrieved October 14, 2019, from https://www.thoughtco.com/hate-speech-cases-721215. About a decade later in 1952, in Beauharnais v. Illinois, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state of Illinois's group libel law, which punished expression attacking the reputation of racial, ethnic, and religious groups. The defendant was charged for distributing a leaflet that rallied white people in Chicago ‚Äúto halt the further encroachment, harassment and invasion of white people, their property, neighborhoods and persons, by the Negro.\\" Going off Chaplinsky, the court ruled that since \\"libelous utterances [are not] within the area of constitutionally protected speech,\\" it did not matter that the speech did not incite any direct harm. After the Beauharnais case, the Supreme Court developed a free speech jurisprudence that loosened most aspects of the free speech doctrine. Traditionally, however, if the speech did not fall within one of the categorical exceptions, it was protected speech. In 1969, the Supreme Court protected a Ku Klux Klan member's speech and created the \\"imminent danger\\" test to determine on what grounds speech can be limited. The court ruled in Brandenburg v. Ohio that: \\"The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force, or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\\"Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, at 447 (1969) This test has been modified very little from its inception in 1969, though it was itself a modification from the earlier clear and present danger standard. Speech promoting violation of the law may still only be restricted when it poses an imminent danger of unlawful action, where the speaker has the intention to incite such action, and there is the likelihood that this will be the consequence of that speech. In 1992, in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, the issue of targeting hate speech arose again when a group of white teenagers burned a cross in the front yard of an African-American family. The local ordinance in St. Paul, Minnesota, criminalized symbolic expressions tantamount to fighting words, arousing anger on the basis of race (among other protected classes). Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the Supreme Court, held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as it contravened the First Amendment by focusing on particular groups about whom speech was restricted. Scalia explained that \\"The reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable (and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey.\\"R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992) Because the hate speech ordinance was not concerned with the mode of expression, but with the content of expression, it was a violation of the freedom of speech. Thus, the Supreme Court embraced the idea that speech in general is permissible unless it will lead to imminent violence. The opinion noted \\"This conduct, if proved, might well have violated various Minnesota laws against arson, criminal damage to property\\", among a number of others, none of which was charged, including threats to any person, not to only protected classes. In 2003, the Supreme Court decided Virginia v. Black.Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343 (2003). In a 7-2 majority opinion written by Justice O'Connor, the court decided that a law which criminalized public cross-burning was unconstitutional.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/01-1107 The court noted that the law would be constitutional if the law included an element of specific intent to inspire fear of bodily harm instead of concluding that cross-burning is prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. The court's analysis was based upon the first amendment free speech clause. In 2011, the Supreme Court issued their ruling on Snyder v. Phelps, which concerned the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest with signs found offensive by many Americans. Snyder, the father of a soldier whose funeral was protested by Phelps‚Äô church, sued Phelps for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The issue presented was whether the First Amendment protected the expressions written on the signs from being the basis for civil liability. In an 8‚Äì1 decision the court sided with Fred Phelps, the head of Westboro Baptist Church, thereby confirming their historically strong protection of freedom of speech. The Court explained, \\"speech deals with matters of public concern when it can 'be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community' or when it 'is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public.\\" In June 2017, the Supreme Court affirmed in a unanimous decision on Matal v. Tam that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violates the First Amendment's free speech clause. The issue was about government prohibiting the registration of trademarks that are \\"racially disparaging\\". Justice Samuel Alito wrote: > Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, > disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast > of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express > \\"the thought that we hate\\". United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U. S. 644, 655 > (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. ___ (2017). > https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/582/15-1293/alVTam\\" Justice Anthony Kennedy also wrote: > A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of > the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the > detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the > government's benevolence. Instead, our reliance must be on the substantial > safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society. Effectively, the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed that there is no 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment.  Societal implementation  In the 1980s and 1990s, more than 350 public universities adopted \\"speech codes\\" regulating discriminatory speech by faculty and students.\\"Free speech on public college campuses\\", Kermit L. Hall, First Amendment Center, 13 September 2002 These codes have not fared well in the courts, where they are frequently overturned as violations of the First Amendment.See, e.g., Doe v. Michigan (1989), UWM Post v. Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin (1991), Dambrot v. Central Michigan University (1995), Corry v. Stanford (1995). Debate over restriction of \\"hate speech\\" in public universities has resurfaced with the adoption of anti-harassment codes covering discriminatory speech.\\"Harassment policies in the university\\", Alan Charles Kors, Society, vol. 28, no.4 (May/June 1991), pp. 22‚Äì30, Springer, (Print), (Online) The speech that hostile work environment harassment law can prohibit varies case by case and is continually under scrutiny by the courts. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) states that, ‚ÄúHarassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (ADA). Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.‚Äù For example, in Brown Transport Corp. v. Commonwealth, the state of Pennsylvania stated that it was religious harassment to put religious pieces in their employee newsletter and Christian-themed verses on their paychecks. In Olivant v. Department of Environmental Protection, the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law found jokes e-mailed to a workplace department and the judge ruled the jokes to ‚Äúdefame and dishonor men and women based upon their gender, sexual preference, religion, skin pigmentation and national and ethnic origin,‚Äù thereby making them illegal.  Private Regulation  AT&T; aimed to regulate hate speech starting in the 1960s, when various people and groups would connect tape recorders to a phone line and when anyone would call that line, the recording would play. These types of phone lines were nicknamed ‚Äúdial-a-hate‚Äù. This technique was used by extremists groups like the Connecticut branch of the Nationalist Socialist White People‚Äôs Party and the Ku Klux Klan. These phone lines proved to be popular as a Neo-Nazi group in Philadelphia said they received 3,800 calls per week in 1973 and a Texas branch of the Ku Klux Klan used this method all the way into 1977. Some phone lines like Let Freedom Ring became popular shows that people would call in to hear a new recording every week, much like an early form of a podcast. AT&T; tried several times to end the ‚Äúdial-a-hate‚Äù lines but phone companies and regulators said nothing could be done to shut down the recordings and courts protected them under the First Amendment. Eventually, AT&T; required that the operators of the line identify themselves. Between this new AT&T; policy and the growing expense of having a phone line, the ‚Äúdial-a-hate‚Äù lines came to an end. Many of the groups found new and less expensive ways of promoting their agenda like sending messages through fax machines and digital bulletin boards. Eventually, the extremist group would spread their messages through the internet and social media. In 1992, Congress directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to examine the role of telecommunications, including broadcast radio and television, cable television, public access television, and computer bulletin boards, in advocating or encouraging violent acts and the commission of hate crimes against designated persons and groups. The NTIA study investigated speech that fostered a climate of hatred and prejudice in which hate crimes may occur. The study failed to link telecommunication to hate crimes, but did find that \\"individuals have used telecommunications to disseminate messages of hate and bigotry to a wide audience.\\" Its recommendation was that the best way to fight hate speech was through additional speech promoting tolerance, as opposed to government regulation.

She later became a dancer and dance instructor and was honored with the Monje de Oro in 1966 for her radio show. Early life Lillian Molieri Berm√∫dez was born in Managua to M√©lida Berm√∫dez and L. Arturo Molieri. Her father was the president of the Nicaraguan National Bank. Her family was of Italian descent, but had lived in Nicaragua for three generations prior to Molieri's birth. The oldest daughter in the family, she attended school at the Convento Notre Dame de Cion and then furthered her education at the Colegio de la Asuncion in Nicaragua. Completing her high school education, Molieri traveled in Europe learning French and Italian. After winning several beauty contests in Nicaragua in the early 1940s, she came to Los Angeles, where her brother Ronald was serving as Nicaragua‚Äôs Vice Consul, to improve her English and enrolled in university to study banking.

The present church is the third to occupy the site. History Prior to the 1870s, the church was dedicated to St Leonard. Originally founded before 1666, the church was rebuilt for the first time in 1723 by Thomas Charles Tracy, 5th Viscount Tracy. The building of 1723 was a small Perpendicular structure, of which only very small elements are known to still exist. It was demolished in 1868 and the church was rebuilt almost entirely in 1868‚Äì69 by George Edmund Street (1824‚Äì1881). Street was commissioned by the 3rd Lord Sudeley. The work cost ¬£44,000, equivalent to around ¬£20 million in the 21st Century. An illustration of the finished church was featured in The Building News on 5 January 1870. It was rededicated to St Andrew after the rebuild was completed. Little remains of the earlier buildings aside from some loose effigies dating from the 17th Century and three marble wall monuments from the 18th Century. The church's large North Chapel houses the tombs of Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 1st Baron Sudeley (1778‚Äì1858) and his wife Henrietta Susanna Tracy. Lord Sudeley left ¬£5000 towards the creation of the tombs, which were designed by John Graham Lough. The large sums of money which the family donated towards the building an upkeep of the church, combined with the agricultural depression of the late 19th Century were eventually contributory factors to the financial decline of the Hanbury-Tracy family. The church became Listed in 1960. Services Services are held in the church on the first (Parish Communion) and fourth (family service and Evensong) Sundays of the month.

He became a South Australian basketball icon playing for the West Adelaide Bearcats in the SA State League and the National Basketball League (NBL). Richardson, who played his college basketball at Ohio Dominican University and was a Mid Ohio Conference First Team selection in 1970‚Äì71, joined West Adelaide in 1974, winning the 1975 Woollacott Medal en route to his first SA state championship. He went on to win the NBL's inaugural Most Valuable Player award in 1979 and led the Bearcats to the NBL championship in 1982 as player-coach. Early life Richardson was born in Zanesville, Ohio. From junior college in Florida, he attended university in Ohio and was invited to attend a Houston Rockets' camp, albeit at his own expense. In 1970‚Äì71 and 1972‚Äì73, Richardson played for Ohio Dominican University's men's basketball team. In 1970‚Äì71, he earned first-team All-MOC honors, and in 1972‚Äì73, he was named NAIA All- District 22 Honorable Mention. Richardson scored 1,207 points in two seasons at Ohio Dominican, earning him a place in the school's 1,000-point club. Growing up in Ohio, Richardson was an expert tracker. It made him invaluable in Vietnam as a soldier leading men into battle. Professional career Richardson arrived wide-eyed in Adelaide in 1974 after having turned his back on an NBA career. At 6'6\\", he was considered a wiry forward who could play center. He joined the West Adelaide Bearcats and led them to the 1974 grand final. A year later, he won the 1975 Woollacott Medal en route to his first South Australian (SA) state championship. He became the first American to claim the Woollacott Medal, an honor bestowed on the Fairest and Most Brilliant player in the SA State League. For the next two years he dominated in Victoria playing with national powerhouse St Kilda, helping them win the 1977 Australian Club Championship title. He returned to the Bearcats in 1978 and helped them win five straight SA championship titles as player-coach from 1978‚Äì82. During this time, in 1979, the National Basketball League (NBL) was established. Richardson was crowned the NBL's inaugural Most Valuable Player before earning All-NBL Team honors the following year. As West's playing coach for four years of NBL, Richardson steered them to fourth, second, third and first. After losing the 1980 grand final significantly to his former team St Kilda and its superstar import guard Rocky Smith, Richardson said he needed a player to counter him. That brought Al Green to the Bearcats in 1981 and a year later, Richardson recruited Leroy Loggins. The trio went on to lead the Bearcats to their first and only NBL championship in 1982. West's 1982 NBL championship team is the only one to include three league MVPs, with Green winning in 1982 and Loggins collecting three outstanding individual player awards in 1984, 1986 and 1987. Richardson retired from playing following the 1982 season. He is considered one of the league's three greatest imports, alongside Leroy Loggins and Rocky Smith. In 71 NBL games, he averaged 20.2 points per game. In November 2012, West Adelaide inducted Richardson into the club's Hall of Fame. In 1986, Richardson coached the Geelong Cats to a 14‚Äì12 record, missing the playoffs on percentage. Personal life In the late 1970s, Richardson considered taking out Australian citizenship. On the assumption he would, then Boomers coach Lindsay Gaze suited him up for Australia to play against a visiting US college team, making Richardson the only American who was solely an American to officially play for Australia. Post-basketball, Richardson worked on oil rigs and on the MS Princess of Tasmania, having a love of the ocean and the open sea. He was also a supporter of the Maritime Workers' Union.

He was born at Thame, Oxfordshire and died at Ludlow, Shropshire. Marsh was educated at Amersham Hall school, Reading, and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where, unusually, he was in his late 20s by the time of his matriculation in 1900. As a cricketer, he was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper, and he had already played a single Minor Counties game for Oxfordshire County Cricket Club before he arrived in Cambridge. He was not able to secure a regular place in the Cambridge University first team in any of his three years at Cambridge, and did not play in the University Match against Oxford University. His younger brother Frederick, who was contemporary with him at Jesus College but then remained for a fourth year in 1904, was even less favoured by the cricket selectors in the years that James was at the university, appearing only in trial matches from 1901 to 1903, but finally achieved selection in 1904 and then proceeded to break the record for an individual score in the University Match. James Marsh played regularly for Oxfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship from 1901 through to 1906, but after leaving university appeared in only one further first-class game, an end-of-season game against the 1907 South Africans. Marsh graduated from Cambridge University in 1903 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in 1904 and as a priest the following year. He had an itinerant clerical career, being successively at Oakham, Rutland and Knighton, Leicester as a curate, then vicar at Belgrave, Leicester and rector at Kings Cliffe, Northamptonshire, and finally reverting to curate status at Bitterley, Shropshire.

Early life Blood was born in 1758, the daughter of Matthew Blood the Younger (1730‚Äì1794) and Caroline Roe (c.1730‚Äì1805). Career Fanny Blood was paid by the botanist William Curtis to paint wildflowers for his book Flora Londinensis. This created an income for her family. Fanny was engaged to Hugh Skeys, but her fianc√© had gone to sea to establish money that would finance their marriage. Fanny Blood and her brother, Lieutenant George Blood (1762‚Äì1844), were good friends with Mary Wollstonecraft. They met in 1774 after introductions by common friends, the Clares. As William Godwin wrote, Mary \\"contracted a friendship so fervent, as for years to have constituted the ruling passion of her mind\\".Godwin, 50. Blood, together with Mary Wollstonecraft and Wollstonecraft's sisters, Eliza and Everina, opened a school first in Islington, which soon failed, and then in Newington Green. The school was combined with a boarding house for women and their children. On 24 February 1785 Fanny Blood married Hugh Skeys (born ca. 1758), a wine merchant of Dublin. When Blood married and left the school, Wollstonecraft left as well to take care of her friend, also the second school failed. Blood died in childbirth in Lisbon, Portugal, on 29 November 1785. Wollstonecraft was deeply affected by Blood's death and in part inspired her first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788). Wollstonecraft named her daughter, Fanny Imlay (1794‚Äì1816), after her friend.

History The bank was established in 1832 as a joint-stock company named Plymouth & Devonport Banking Company by a group of Westcountry businessmen as a vehicle to effect the purchase of Hingston & Prideaux, a private Westcountry bank which had encountered financial difficulties. Hingston & Prideaux =Founding= The Kingsbridge historian Abraham Hawkins wrote in 1819:Kingsbridge and Salcombe, with the Intermediate Estuary, Historically and ... By Abraham Hawkins, Kingsbridge, 1819, pp.42-3 :\\"A Bank was established at Kingsbridge in the month of February, 1806, by Messrs. Walter Prideaux, John Square, Joseph Hingston, and Walter Prideaux junior. It was first opened in a house on the West side of Fore street nearly opposite the late Buttermarket, and on the North side of Millman's Lane which communicates with the West backlet. An excellent stone mansion however, with an appropriate room for this concern, having been erected by the junior partner on the East side of Fore Street Hill, facing the houses a little above the Quakers' meeting, the business was removed thither in 1808; and, the second partner being dead, but replaced by his son of the same Christian name, and the third removed to Plymouth, where he carries on a similar establishment, the notes of the present firm bear the designation of \\"Prideaux, Square, and Prideaux,\\" whose Loudon correspondents are messieurs Masterman, Peters, Mildred, & Co. No, 2. White-Hart Court, Gracechurch Street\\". Thus two separate banks were in existence: one at Kingsbridge (Prideaux, Square, and Prideaux) and another at Plymouth (Hingston & Prideaux) =Development= On 31 October 1813 the banking partnership known as Prideaux, Square, Hingston and Prideaux of Kingsbridge in Devon (whose partners were Walter Prideaux (1741-1829) \\"Senior\\", John Square, Joseph Hingston and Walter Prideaux (1769-1855) \\"Junior\\" (son of Walter Prideaux (1741-1829) \\"Senior\\") was dissolved by mutual consent to allow for the retirement of Joseph Hingston (who as Hawkins relates above \\"removed to Plymouth, where he carries on a similar establishment\\"), and was immediately reformed as Prideaux, Square and Prideaux.The London Gazette, Part 2, p. 2533 Joseph Hingston's new partner in the Plymouth bank was Walter Prideaux (d. 1832), a cousin of the Kingsbridge bankers, a son of George Prideaux of Kingsbridge by his wife Anna Debell Cookworthy, and a Quaker associated with the Plymouth Brethren, having moved from Kingsbridge to Plymouth in 1812.Stunt It is not clear what relation he was to the ancient gentry family of Prideaux seated variously at Orcheton, Modbury; Adeston, Holbeton; Thuborough, Sutcombe; Soldon, Holsworthy; Netherton, Farway; Ashburton; Nutwell, Woodbury; Ford Abbey, Thorncombe all in Devon, and at Prideaux Place, Padstow and Prideaux Castle, Luxulyan, in Cornwall. Fox (1874) stated in regard of the Kingsbridge branch of Prideaux: \\"We have no intention ... of tracing the pedigree back to old Paganus de Prideaux, who came over from Normandy with William the Conqueror, and who was Lord of the Castle of Prideaux, in Cornwall\\".Fox, Sarah Prideaux, Kingsbridge and its surroundings, Plymouth, 1874, p.68 For details on the pedigree of Prideaux of Kingsbridge see: Prideaux, R.

Walter Prideaux (i.e. Walter Prideaux (1769-1855) \\"Junior\\"Prideaux, R.M.) and John Roope erected extensive machinery at the former Kingsbridge corn-mill, which they converted into a woollen manufactory, where for a number of years the serge or long-ell trade was carried on, to supply the East India Company with goods for India.Fox, S.P., Kingsbridge and its surroundings, Plymouth, 1874, p.30 One of the sons of Walter Prideaux (1769-1855) \\"Junior\\" (by his wife Sarah Were) was Walter Were Prideaux (1792-1878), one of the partners in the Kingsbridge Bank on its bankruptcy in 1825.

The headquarters was in the City of Plymouth in Devon, and within one year of its establishment the first branch had been opened at St Austell in Cornwall. The bank's policy was to \\"seek opportunities in the centre of agricultural and mining districts and commercial metropolises being destitute of a regular bank\\". By 1840 the bank had 15 branches and by 1900 had 55 branches, when it had become one of the largest banks in the south-west. In 1906 the bank was taken over by Lloyds Bank, also of Quaker origins, in order to supply its deficiency of a branch network in the Westcountry.

D. Shakabpa and The Status of Tibet by Michael C. van Walt van Praag on the other hand : \\"the historiography associated with the ‚ÄúTibet is a part of China‚Äù argument and with the ‚ÄúTibetan independence‚Äù argument both project anachronistic ideas of nation-states and even western international law back into the past.\\"Gray Tuttle, op. cit., p. 416.

It consists of a benzene ring, with an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid as substituents that are ortho to each other. The compound exhibits ring‚Äìchain tautomerism: the two substituents can react with each other to form 3-hydroxyphthalide, a cyclic lactol. This lactol reacts readily with Grignard reagents , forming alkyl- and aryl-substituted phthalides. Other benzo-fused heterocyclic compounds can be derived from 2-carboxybenzaldehyde, including isoindolinones and phthalazinones, with a variety of pharmacological properties, such as the antihistamine azelastine.  Synthesis  2-Carboxybenzaldehyde was first prepared from phthalide and characterized in 1887. The reaction of bromine with phthalide produces 2-bromophthalide, which is converted into 2-formylbenzoic acid by heating with water in a total yield of 78 to 83%. Synthese von 2-Carboxybenzaldehyd aus Phthalid An analogous process based on a chlorination reaction can also be used: center The synthesis of 1-dichloromethyl-2-(trichloromethyl)benzene by photochlorination of o-xylene was also reported in 1887. Synthese von 2-Carboxybenzaldehyd aus o-Xylol The hydrolysis of the pentachloroxylene to the 2-carboxybenzaldehyde is carried out by boiling it with FeCl3-containing hydrochloric acid. In the reaction of phthalic anhydride with sodium tetracarbonylferrate, only one of the carboxyl groups is reduced to the aldehyde, the second remains unchanged. Synthese von 2-Carboxybenzaldehyd aus Phthals√§ureanhydrid This gives 2-carboxybenzaldehyde in a yield of 61%. In a laboratory procedure, the oxidation of naphthalene with alkaline potassium permanganate is given, which, however, yields only a yield of 39% 2-carboxybenzaldehyde. Also the oxidation of naphthalene with ozone to 2-formylbenzoic acid offers no significant advantages. Synthese von 2-Carboxybenzaldehyd aus Naphthalin  Properties  Pure 2-carboxybenzaldehyde is a white crystalline powder which dissolves in water and in short-chain alcohols. In solid form and in most solvents, the substance is present as racemic 3-hydroxyphthalide (a lactol) as a result of ring‚Äìchain tautomerism. Gleichgewicht 2-Carboxybenzaldehyd-3-Hydroxyphthalid The refractive index is = 1.4500 (at 25 ¬∞C, 589 nm).  Application  In the lactol form, 2-carboxybenzaldehyde behaves like a carboxylic acid anhydride and reacts smoothly with alcohols forming 3-alkoxyphthalides. Reaktion von 3-Hydroxyphthalid mit Nukleophilen Also with other nucleophilic compounds, such as, thiols, amines, amides, etc., 3-hydroxyphthalide reacts without a catalyst to give the corresponding derivatives. For example, it reacts with morpholine in 91% yield to 3-morpholinyl phthalide. 3-Hydroxyphthalide reacts with thionyl chloride at the hydroxyl group smoothly (80-90% yield) to 3-chlorophthalide. With Grignard reagents, the hydroxy group can be exchanged for the corresponding alkyl or aryl group: Reaktion von 3-Hydroxyphthalid mit Grignard-Verbindungen In the presence of (+)-cinchonine, in the reaction of (racemic) 3-hydroxyphthalide with carboxylic acid anhydrides to the corresponding chiral 3-substituted phthalides anenantiomeric excess of up to 90% ee can be achieved besides high product yields. An alternative approach to (racemic) 3-substituted phthalides with high yields is opened up by the reaction of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde and Œ≤-keto acids in the presence of base 4-anisidine in glycerol as solvent. Reaktion von 3-Hydroxyphthalid mit Œ≤-Ketos√§uren 2-Carboxybenzaldehyde underdoes a double condensation reaction with hydrazine or alkylhydrazines, 1(2H)-phthalenazinones are obtained under acid catalysis with K10-montmorillonite and microwave irradiation in high yield. Reaktion von 2-Carboxybenzaldehyd mit Alkylhydrazinen Phthalazinones (1(2H)-phthalenazinones) are important building blocks for natural products, fine chemicals and pharmaceutical active ingredients, such as the antihypertensive vasodilator hydralazine. 2-carboxybenzaldehyde can also be used for the preparation of N-substituted isoindolinones (1-isoindolinones, 2,3-dihydroindol-1-ones) which are formed when reacting 2-carboxybenzaldehyde with primary amines in the presence of platinum nanowires and low hydrogen pressure in 1,4-dioxane in very high yields: Synthese von Isoindolinonen durch 3-Komponentenreaktion When the reaction of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde is carried out with primary amines in the presence of dimethylphosphite, the corresponding isoindolin-1-one-3-phosphonates are obtained first. After activation with butyllithium with aromatic aldehydes (such as, benzaldehyde in a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction), these can be converted in very high yields to 3-(arylmethylene)isoindolin-1-ones. Synthese von Arylmethylenisoindolinonen More recently, 2-formylbenzoic acid became due to its reactivity of some interest as versatile molecular building block in multicomponent reactions, for example the Ugi reaction, for the synthesis of heterocyclic annellated aromatics. Functionalized isoindolinones are accessible in high yields in a three-component reaction with 2-formylbenzoic acid and 2-bromoanilines by palladium-catalyzed carbonylation. Synthese von funktionalisierten Isoindolinonen Another three-component reaction (here carried out as a Strecker synthesis) with 2-carboxybenzaldehyde, primary amines and potassium cyanide in methanol yields in the acidic medium an N-substituted isoindolinone-1-carbonitrile, formally an aminoacetonitrile derivative of isoindolinone with two moles of HCN. Synthese von Isoindolinonen aus 2-Carboxybenzaldehyd via Strecker-Synthese When substituted 2-formylbenzoic acid, potassium cyanide and equimolar amounts of primary aromatic amines and acetic acid are used, substituted isochromes-1-ones (isocumarins, 1H-2-benzopyran-1-ones) are obtained in good yields. Synthese von Isochromenonen durch 3-Komponentenreaktion mit Kaliumcyanid The isochromenones obtained are quantitatively converted into isoindolinones by reacting in DMSO upon ring constriction into substituted isobenzofurans or with catalytic amounts of iodine in triethylamine. With isonitriles instead of potassium cyanide, 2-carboxybenzaldehyde and primary aromatic amines react in methanol to form substituted isochromen-1-ones, which are converted to isoindolinones with traces of acid.

Eugene \\"Gean\\" Harwood was born in Auburn, New York, where he first studied music. Career Bruhs Mero and Gean Harwood were partners in life and music. They wrote their first composition, \\"Come and Take My Hand\\", in 1933. The text was a poem by Mero, who lived alone in Florida for a period due to the lack of jobs in New York City; loneliness pushed him to wrote the poem and he sent it to Harwood who put it in music. More than 50 other songs would follow. Harwood worked for Paramount Pictures in New York City for twenty years; he made transportation arrangements for actors and executives. Harwood later became administrative assistant for the New York City's building department, retiring in 1971.

After that Mero worked as a writer for a trade publication. On June 30, 1985, during the New York Pride celebration, Gean Harwood and Bruhs Mero were named \\"Grand Marshals\\". After Mero's death in 1995, Harwood remained active: he played the piano into his 90s and was active in the Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE). Personal life The unwelcoming climate of Upstate New York pushed Harwood to move to New York City where he met Mero in 1929. They first kissed on New Year's Eve 1929 and remained together for 66 years, until Mero's death in 1995. They lived in an Lower East Side studio apartment.

The mine was worked for around 125 years and employed at its peak 100 workers. It was primarily an open cast mine, but five shafts and six adits are also mentioned in reports of the site. Some are still accessible today, but since the area was used as a rubbish tip in the 1950s and 60s, much of the archaeology has been covered over. History The first reliably attributable reference to an iron deposit at Sharkham Point appears to have been made by Henry De la Beche in his memoir of 1839 where he said: \\"A large iron-lode runs nearly east and west from Sharkham Point, near Brixham, to Upton, and was extensively worked towards the end of 1837\\"\\"Report on the Geology of Cornwall, Devon and west Somerset\\", Henry T. De la Beche, F.R.S. (1839), Originally published by Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans on behalf of Her Majesty's Treasury and now available as a free downloadable eBook from Google on-line, p302. The mining of iron ore at Sharkham Point was however underway as early as 1790 when a discovery of \\"considerable quantities of kidney ore\\" was reported. A century later at the peak period of operation the mine employed 100 workers and shipped ore to South Wales and West Hartlepool for smelting\\"Rocks and Fossils of Brixham\\" (2015), Chris Proctor, Philip L Armitage & Janet Pettit, Brixham Heritage Museum, New Road, Brixham, TQ5 8LZ..

Strayer from an original screenplay by Betty Burbridge. The film stars Dorothy Revier, Reed Howes, and Edna Murphy, and was released by Action Pictures on November 17, 1931. Plot Janet Reese is a reporter whose brother, Jim Dorgan, is an up-and-coming boxer, who is a win away from getting a shot at a title bout. Steve Crane is a local gangster who also owns a popular nightclub. Crane, knowing he can get better odds betting against Dorgan, tries to force him into throwing the match, but Dorgan refuses. Crane enlists Myrtle Devoe, one of his showgirls and his mistress to distract Dorgan long enough so that he misses the fight. Myrtle and Dorgan used to go out, so when she invites him back to her place, he agrees. When Dorgan doesn't show up for his match against Don O'Hara, he loses by forfeit. O'Hara now becomes the number one challenger for the title. The following morning, Dorgan is found dead near Myrtle's apartment. The police pick up both Myrtle and Crane for questioning, but there is not enough evidence to make a case against them. During their interrogation Crane tries to shift interest onto O'Hara. When they are released, Crane thinks it would be best for Myrtle to leave town for a while, at least until the heat about Dorgan's murder dies down. Frustrated with the lack of progress being made by the police. Janet decides to investigate for herself. With the departure of Myrtle, there is an opening at Crane's club, and Janet applies for and gets the job. Crane becomes interested in Janet, and she begins to lead him along. As they are talking, O'Hara storms in, angry at Crane's having attempted to finger him for Dorgan's murder. There is an instant attraction between Janet and O'Hara. As Janet and O'Hara's romance blossoms, she continues to attempt to pump Crane for information about her brother's murder. O'Hara proposes to Janet, but she turns him down, since he is a boxer, and she hates boxing. Meanwhile, Myrtle has heard about Crane's interest in Janet, and returns to town, intent on staking her claim. Seeing a way to make Myrtle's return work in her favor, Janet plans to force a confrontation between Crane and Myrtle, with the police listening in. As the night of the title fight approaches, Janet sets the trap up at Crane's apartment for the night before the fight. When O'Hara learns that Janet is over Crane's apartment, he heads over there to confirm it. When he does, he jumps to the conclusion that there is something going on between the two. He heads to the nearest bar to drown his sorrows. Janet goes through with her plan, and has Myrtle show up at Crane's. During the argument between the two, Myrtle and Crane reveal enough of their murder of Dorgan to allow the police to arrest them. When the fight takes place the following night, O'Hara is still drunk and subsequently loses the fight. When Janet finds him and tries to explain what was really going on, he doesn't want to hear about it, but when he sees her report in the paper, he understands she was telling the truth, and the two reconcile.

It is described in the account of the first Flatters expedition, which reached the lake in April 1880. Other European visitors found the lake dry or filled depending on rainfall. Location The lake was to the east of the Tassili n'Ajjer. The lake is from Ghat, Libya. The Flatters expedition came to it when travelling southeast along the well-wooded Irhararer valley (Oued i-n-Karaha?) to the point where it joined the Tijoujelt valley, not far from Tajenout. At this point, the surplus waters of the Tijoujelt during the rainy season empty into lake Menghough. Lake Menghough is located on the northern shore of the Wadi of the same name. The sheet of water is enclosed in a sort of circle surrounded by high dunes beside the Wadi Tidjoudjelt, an affluent of the Wadi Igharghar. Flatters expedition The first Flatters expedition left Biskra early in February 1880 and travelled south by Touggourt, Ouargla, A√Øn-el-Ta√Øba and Temassinin. The expedition encamped on shores of Lake Menghough on 16 April 1880. At this time the lake was about , with creeks fringed by tamarisk and flowering plants on its southern side. The other shores were low and clayey. They found yellow-eyed Clarias lazera (African sharptooth catfish) in the lake. The expedition members swam in the lake, and caught five fish, the longest of which was long. Near Lake Menghough in the Ighargharen valley the expedition found two double stone tombs surrounded by a circular wall about in diameter, with a gap in the wall towards the east. The Tuaregs could not supply any information about the tombs. With provisions running short and the local people showing hostility, Flatters decided to return by the same route. A member of the Flatters expedition reported that: Later expeditions The French explorer Gaston M√©ry visited the lake in 1893 after a long period of drought, and found it completely dry. M√©ry was the first French explorer to visit the region since the massacre of the second Flatters expedition. He and Guilloux were accompanied by five local Algerians. At Lake Menghough M√©ry met with some of the Kel Ajjer chiefs. Antoine Bernard d'Attanoux found water in the lake when he visited it in March 1894. This was in a rainy period, and the rains in the preceding weeks had overwhelmed the wadis and turned the plain into a vast swamp. The expedition had to avoid the valley floors and travel with some difficulty by the higher land. Attanoux could not approach the lake very closely, and set up his camp a few kilometers to the southwest at the mouth of the Wadi Timatouiet. Attanoux noted that Colonel Flatters had thought the lake was fed by an underground source, and that this was plausible despite the lake drying up, since there was no permanent water table in the region and the source could therefore have dried up. He reported that the Ighargharen valley with its sand-clay soils seemed to have great potential for agriculture, particularly cereals. Boreholes would be enough to find water from the rains that sometimes fall in several consecutive years. However, the nomadic Tuaregs did not practice agriculture.

Plot Madelynne Cabrone is the wife of gangster Joe Cabrone. She is having an affair, and her husband finds out about it and tracks her to a roadhouse, intent on killing her lover. She escapes in her car, but when it breaks down, she takes to the road, where she is picked up by the unwitting Sam Harris. Joe catches up to them, and believes Sam to be the man Madelynne is having an affair with. He is about to move in to kill him, when Sam is stopped for speeding. When Madelynne tells her story, it is printed in the papers, and Sam becomes something of a hero for saving her. Joe vows to kill Sam within twenty-four hours. T. McGillicuddy Hungerford, a wealthy businessman hears of Sam's heroism and offers to give Sam a huge order. Thinking that the order is dependent on him playing the hero, Sam keeps up with the pretense, although he is scared to death. A rival gangster, Tobey Moran, gives Sam two bodyguards to protect him from Cabrone. As part of Cabrone's plan to kill Sam, he sends him two tickets to a masquerade party at a local speakeasy. McGillicuddy, known as \\"Mac\\" wants Sam to go to the masquerade with him and two women. Since all wear masks, no one knows that one of the women is Madelynne. Sam's wife, Lena, believes that he is cheating on her, and also goes to the masquerade. Cabrone and his men show up as well, dressed as policemen. They abscond with Sam and Mac, taking them back to their hideout. Moran's men follow and a gunfight ensues where Cabrone and his gang are wiped out. The police arrive and declare Sam and Mac to be heroes, whereafter Mac awards the contract to Sam, and Lena understands the truth about Sam and Madelynne and forgives him.

Completing the trail will require 40 construction projects, to create new trails, and to eliminate gaps in existing segments. The trail is to be completed by 2020. Route The trail is organized in three main segments: the Hudson River Valley Greenway Trail, the Erie Canalway Trail, and the Champlain Valley Trail. There is a proposal to extend the trail from its southern terminus into Long Island.
