She died young, after which publication by her mother of a book containing some of her poems, diary entries and other writings covering treatment she had received for her psychotic illness brought her to the attention of an audience beyond the usual confines of the arts and literature establishment.  Life  Sonja Gerstner was born in Berlin into one of East Germany's elite families. Her father, Karl-Heinz Gerstner (1912-2005), was an economics journalist. Sibylle Boden-Gerstner (1920-2016), her mother, was one of East Germany's leading fashion journalists. Sonja was the younger of her parents' two daughters. The writer-controversialist Daniela Dahn is her elder sister. When she was 17 Sonja displayed the first signs of psychotic illness. Several stays in closed psychiatric wards, where she was subjected to Insulin shock therapy and Electroconvulsive therapy intensified her sense of helplessness and spiritual isolation. Her attempts to make herself understood were mostly ignored. Her parents' desperate attempts on her behalf to find psychotherapeutic care were unsuccessful. Advised by doctors to cut herself off from her friends, Gerstner encountered growing difficulties at school and college. At the end of her third stay in the clinic she was released in December 1970 and moved into her own apartment, but experienced loneliness and an acute sense of inadequacy. She ended her life on 8 March 1971. The date has added significance because 8 March was celebrated in East Germany (and elsewhere) as International Women's Day. After Sonja Gerstner died her mother, using the pseudonym Sibylle Muthesius, published \\"Flucht in die Wolken\\" (\\"Escape into the clouds\\"), a volume about her daughter that included full- colour reproductions of many of Sonja Gerstner's images. The book was published in 1981 and widely distributed. The next year it was published across the Inner German border in the west. Exhibitions of Sonja's writings and images followed.  Works  Sonja Gerstner confided her hopes and anxieties to her diary. She also wrote poems, songs and letters. Increasingly, after her first psychotic episode, she expressed her artistic talent with surrealistic-expressionistic paintings and drawings. :\\"She was versatile, deeply sensitive and exceptionally creative. These characteristics entitled her to the beautiful hope that she would make her career as an artist. .... In picture, diaries, letters and poems the distraught young woman worked through her feelings and anxieties. Despite all her inner troubles, her love for life and then for humanity wins out.\\"Wulf Skaun: Sonja Gerstners Flucht in die Wolken. In: Leipziger Volkszeitung, 13. Mai 2004. Wulf Skaun, Leipziger Volkszeitung, 2004 The largest collection of Sonja Gerstner's paintings and drawings is on permanent loan to the Prinzhorn collection at Heidelberg University. Her mother handed them over in 2007. Her diaries, letters and other writings are archived by the family.  Psycho-historical importance  Sonja Gerstner's sad trajectory through psychosis treatment provided a basis for what may have been the first, and was certainly the most popular critical book on psychiatric provision in the German Democratic Republic. The situation in psychiatric institutions was set out in an authentic way, including descriptions of treatments involving Insulin shock therapy and Electroconvulsive therapy, and setting out with dramatic clarity the use of \\"isolation bunkers\\" and their impact on patients.Thomas R. M√ºller: Flucht in die Wolken ‚Äì Ein au√üergew√∂hnliches Kapitel der DDR-Psychiatriegeschichte. In: Schriftenreihe der Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Geschichte der Nervenheilkunde.

Patienten, √Ñrzte, Personal und Institutionen der Psychiatrie in Sachsen vom Mittelalter bis zum Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts. 2nd, expanded edition. Frankfurt am Main 2014. \\"Flucht in die Wolken\\", her mother's compilation of Sonja's work, quickly became popular in East Germany, and in the end was translated into eight languages. There was also a drama version produced in 1991 and a filmscript. The book's success can be attributed to the critical light it shone on therapeutic practice, the sensitive presentation of psychotic illness and the headlong assault on the taboo in place across the medical profession against applying the theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung to diagnoses of mental illnesses. After the book appeared in West Germany a reviewer there praised the book for enabling the reader to recognise that misery in the psychiatric wards was a significant phenomenon as much in the east as in the west.

It was described by the British malacologist Guy Coburn Robson in 1926, the type specimens having been collected in the Gulf of Mannar, off Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu, southeastern India. Description Macrochlaena winckworthi is a small species of octopus with relatively short arms, the arms being 1.5-2.5 times longer than the mantle with the lateral arms being slightly longer. The web is relatively deep, being one third the length of the arms, and the web is slightly deeper between the lateral arms. There are no pouches between the arms. Each arm has two rows of small suckers n its underside, with each arm having around 65 suckers. The funnel organ has a shape described as \\"UU\\" and the gills have 8 to 10 lamellae per demibranch. The radula has 9 elements, 7 teeth rows and marginal plates and the rachidian tooth has a single lateral cusp in a symmetrical series. It possesses a small ink sac. In the males the third right arm is hectocotylised being approximately 80% of the length of the opposite arm and having 35 to 40 suckers. The terminal organ is linear and the diverticulum is simple in form with a slightly swollen shape. It has small spermatophores each being 8 to 10 mm in length, roughly one third of the length of the mantle. The head is now dsitnguished much from the mantle and the eyes are rather small. The skin is smooth and overall the animal is red-brown to purple in colour with a marbling of darker mottles. The total length of an adult is at least 93mm, the mantle length is 33mm. Habitat and distribution Macrochlaena winckworthi was originally collected from pearl oyster beds in shallow water off the coast of Tamil Nadu in the Gulf of Mannar. It has also been collected off Java and it has been inferred that its distribution extends from India east to the Malay Archipelago in shallow waters of less than 20m in depth. It seems to have some convergent adaptations with other species of octopods which live in muddy habitats. This is a little known species and its biology and behaviour are unknown, as is its importance in any fisheries.

History Non-racialism became the official state policy of South Africa after April 1994, and it is enshrined in Chapter One of the Constitution of South Africa. The term has been criticized as vague, and carrying different meanings even among people sharing the same ideological tradition. The earliest use of the term was by Karl Polanyi in the 1930s. Neville Alexander follows Robert Sobukwe in defining non-racialism as the acknowledgement of the nonexistence of race as a scientific fact. Robert Mugabe professed a belief in non-racialism in the early 1960s, but later rejected the concept and harshly criticized Nelson Mandela for his embrace of the ideology. Non-racialism is a stated core policy of the African National Congress. However the adoption of multiracialist policy in the Freedom Charter instead of afrocentric non- racialism is what resulted in the breakaway Pan Africanist Congress in 1959.

She was particularly interested in the mathematical methods used by Islamic architects and builders of the Middle Ages for measurements of volumes and measurements of religious buildings or in the design of muqarnas.  Biography  Born on 20 May 1937 in Haarlem, Yvonne Samplonius obtained her degree in mathematics and Arabic from the University of Amsterdam (Doktoratsexamen) in 1966. Yvonne Dold-Samplonius married in 1965 the German mathematician Albrecht Dold. She studied from 1966 to 1967 at Harvard University under the direction of Professor John E. Murdoch. She obtained in 1977 a PhD for her analysis of the treatise KitƒÅb al- mafrƒÅdƒÅt li AqƒÅ≈£un (Book of Assumptions of AqƒÅtun) under the supervision of Prof. Evert Marie Bruins and Prof. Juan Vernet.

Through his work, she became interested in the geometrical calculations that helped building many domes of palaces and mosques, called muqarnas, in the Arab world and Persia. She wrote articles on the Islamic mathematicians Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´ and Abu-Abdullah Muhammad ibn ƒ™sa MƒÅhƒÅnƒ´ in the Dictionary of the Middle Ages and in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography. In her last years her interest shifted to mathematics in Islamic architecture from an historic point of view. Since 1995, she has been an associate member of the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) of the University of Heidelberg, with whom she has published several videos on Islamic geometrical art. In 1985, she is visiting professor at the University of Siena. In 2000, she organized with Joseph Dauben the conference \\"2000 Years of Transmission of Mathematical Ideas\\".

Design and development The T-610 Super Pinto started off as a 1968 conversion of the United States Navy's Temco TT Pinto two-seat jet trainer. AJI modified the aircraft for light attack by changing the powerplant with the General Electric CJ610-6 turbojet engine and extending the fuselage by 10 inches. It featured a modified wing, wingtip fuel tanks and a swept vertical stabilizer as well as provision for two underwing hardpoints. The prototype first flew on June 28, 1968. The aircraft flew very well and now was three times more powerful, with only 20 pounds more weight than the original design. The United States Air Force (USAF) evaluated the Super Pinto during its PAVE COIN program in 1971, but had failed to gain any contract with either the USAF or Turkey. Consequently, the company decided to sell the whole project and struck a deal with the Philippine government, whereby AJI relinquished all rights on the Super Pinto design. In a US$1.25 million deal, the Philippine Air Force (PAF)'s Self-Reliance Development Wing bought the rights for the work drawings, patents, design, flight test data and process sheets for the manufacture of the aircraft on November 8, 1976, as well as one U.S.-built prototype, which became the first Philippine T-610 (now known as the Cal√≠ or \\"hawk\\"), and an additional fuselage. The deal included the exclusive rights to market military and commercial versions throughout the world. The second T-610 was produced locally, and both aircraft were flight tested satisfactorily in Manila, creating high expectations to build a national aircraft industry in the Philippines. They carried the numbers 44233 and 44234, which strangely echoed U.S. Navy Pinto serials 144233 and 144234. The two aircraft differed mainly in that \\"233\\" had the one-piece canopy of the original Pinto, while \\"234\\" had a two-piece canopy. It would be logical to conclude that \\"44233\\" was originally the Navy's 144233, but there is no evidence of this. Besides, both Navy Pintos are still extant on the American civil register and pretty much active. Bad luck seemed to pursue the Super Pinto. The Cal√≠ program started to encounter economic problems, and after the Marcos administration collapsed the project was shelved. Resurrection of the Cal√≠ program was considered on various occasions. In the mid-1980s, four separate versions were targeted for possible production: a single-seat light strike aircraft that could carry up to 1,600 kg of stores for COIN operations; a tandem-seat primary jet trainer; a quick change version of the trainer that could be rapidly converted as a strike aircraft; and an executive version with a wider pressurized cabin seating five passengers. At that time, the PAF foresaw the Cal√≠ as a possible replacement for no less than its Beechcraft T-34 Mentors, SIAI-Marchetti SF.260s, North American T-28D Trojans, Lockheed T-33s and even its North American F-86F Sabres, with a planned operational life of about 15 years. Commonality of the CJ610-6 engine with the country's Northrop F-5 fighter force was especially viewed as a key element. At the 1988 Farnborough Airshow, it was announced that American company Avstar Inc., in collaboration with Shenyang Aircraft Corporation of the People's Republic of China, Pacific Marketing Consultants Inc. of San Francisco and Plymouth Ltd. of Hong Kong, planned to revive the Super Pinto. Under the terms of \\"an agreement in principle\\" between the four parties, the Avstar T-100 Super Mustang was to be built at Shenyang under licence from Plymouth, with final assembly and avionics installation taking place in the U.S., and marketed by the two U.S. companies. A prototype, powered by a General Electric J85 turbojet, was undergoing flight testing in the U.S. in 1988; production T-100s were expected to be powered by either that engine or a Williams FJ44. The T-100 scheme came in direct contradiction with the Philippines having the exclusive rights to market the Super Pinto internationally, so it is possible that the exclusiveness clause might have been invalidated by Manila's not having produced any new aircraft over the past decade. Whatever the reason, nothing came of the Super Mustang project either. As recently as 2009 a government official stated that the Super Pinto could still be produced, if only to take advantage of the licensing rights that had been purchased. If produced today, however, the Cal√≠ would incorporate locally produced composite materials on some major components. An appeal to the private sector was made to take part in the development and manufacture of \\"the first Philippine jet\\" on a cost sharing and profit sharing scheme. However, the current state of that program is unknown. Variants ;T-610 Super Pinto/Cali:The first two prototypes were converted Temco TT Pintos. The second prototype was unfinished when the program was bought by the Philippine government, and completed in Manila. Two more unarmed prototypes were made thereafter. ;Aeronca Model 620:Production variant, to have been built by Aeronca.

It premiered on the ABC on 5 February 2018 and is hosted by Paul McDermott. Think Tank panelists The Think Tank is made up of people from across Australia with various backgrounds and occupations, and who share an interest in quizzing. There are thirteen people in the Think Tank, who make up a panel of eight in each show. *Caroline Roff, runs a community newsletter in Koo Wee Rup, Victoria. *Deborah Cooke, an editor. *Gurm Sekhon, an intercultural consultant. *Mik Quall, a stay-at-home dad. *Emma Goodsir, an educational psychologist. *Sam Wade, an educational travel company worker who takes high school students to developing countries. *Jono McQuie, a journalism student. *Bruce Whalley, self-proclaimed \\"happiest tram driver in Melbourne\\". *Chira Fernando, works in retail. *Michelle Cheng, a journalist. *Mat Garrick, an electrician . He appeared as a house mate in Big Brother (Australian season 12). *Craig Lawler, Australian bushranger expert. *Rachel Ramsay, a high school humanities teacher. Gameplay Before the show, the Think Tank answered quiz questions under strict conditions to determine which eight are in the tank that episode, because if a Think Tanker gets the final \\"Question: Impossible\\" correct they cannot be in the episode. Three contestants play against each other in five rounds. The phrases, \\"Shut the gate\\", \\"kill the goat\\" or \\"dance like a pagan\\" are sometimes used, similar to the phrase \\"Lock it in\\", from rival game show Millionaire Hot Seat, when selecting an answer. Some contestants have accidentally said \\"Lock it in\\" by mistake, leading to joking ridicule from the host. =Full Tank= Each contestant gets asked three questions. When a question is asked, each answer given by the Think Tank is displayed, some being correct, some not, with at least one of the options being correct. Contestants must decide which of the options is the correct answer. 15 points are given for each correct answer, with 45 being the maximum total possible. =Pick a Thinker= Each contestant (one at a time) chooses a Think Tank panellist to ask them one of two questions the panellists have written themselves. Each contestant gets three questions and get no help from the Think Tankers. Contestants who answer a question correctly get 25 points. =Trust Me, I'm a Think Tanker= Two Think Tankers are asked the same question, and each give their answer, only one of which is correct, and explain why they chose their answer. They must try to persuade the contestants that their answer is correct, and contestants then choose option A or option B. Five questions are asked in the round. Contestants with the correct answer are given 50 points. The contestant with the lowest score at the end of the round is eliminated from the game. At the end of this round, the Think Tank no longer know the questions asked by the host. =Head to Head= The remaining two contestants are each asked questions which have not been seen by the Think Tank, in a best-of-five shootout. Contestants can either answer the question themselves, or can select a Think Tanker for assistance. Each contestant has three opportunities to ask a Think Tank panellist, and each panellist can only be chosen once. If a Think Tank panellist is chosen, the contestant has twenty seconds (represented by a burning fuse connected to the brain symbol on a screen behind the host) to answer the question before the brain explodes. A question not answered in time counts as a wrong answer. The contestant with the most correct answers continues to the final round. If the scores are tied after five questions, additional questions are asked until one contestant gets a question right, and the other wrong. During the tie-breaker, contestants cannot ask a Think Tank panellist, even if all three chances to ask them have not been used. The tie-breaker is usually a numerical question and the contestant with the nearest answer wins. =Question: Impossible= The remaining contestant is asked a question that none of the Think Tankers were able to answer correctly before the show. To help to steer the contestant away from incorrect answers, the incorrect answers given by the Think Tank before the show, are displayed. If the contestant answers the question correctly, they receive the Think Tank trophy.

Pope Clement XII elevated him to the cardinalate on 20 December 1737. Biography=Early life= Son of Ant√≥nio de Almeida-Portugal, 2nd Count of Avintes and Governor of the Algarves, and of his wife Maria Antonia de Bourbon, sister of the 3rd Count of Avintes. He studied Latin, philosophy and rhetoric in the Col√©gio de Santo Ant√£o with the Jesuits. At the age of 18, on 20 December 1688, he took a scholarship to attend the Real Col√©gio de S√£o Paulo of the University of Coimbra, where he graduated. In 1695, he was a deputy of the Inquisition of Lisbon, and on 27 August 1695 was dispatched to preside over the Tribunal of the Port Relation. On 1 June 1702, he took office as procurator and deputy of the Treasury of the Queen's Council, plus the priory of the church of S√£o Louren√ßo de Lisboa. On 13 April 1703, appointed deputy of the Bureau of Conscience and Orders, already decorated as a knight of the Order of Christ. On 28 May 1704, as King Pedro II departed for Beira, leaving his brother as regent, Diogo de Mendon√ßa Corte-Real was chosen as the substitute, who accompanied him at the Secretariat of Mercy, Expedient and Signature. =Episcopate= Tom√°s de Almeida was made sumilher da cortina, Governor of the Royal Treasury, Chancellor of the Kingdom, taking office on 24 November 1704. The Papal Bull of Clement XI made him Bishop of Lamego, sacred in Lisbon in the church of the Convent of Grace on 3 April 1707, chief chaplain and titular Bishop of Torga Dom Frei Nuno da Cunha e Ata√≠de. He entered the diocese on the 2nd of May. As there was disagreement between the cabinet and the Bishop of Viseu, he was able to ease tensions and was made by the King, already sick and whom he had seen in his last hours, Notary Public of the Kingdom. On 1 July 1707, the day of the Royal Acclamation, King Jo√£o V appointed him to be Registrar of the Pureness. On 3 May 1708, he travelled to Coimbra on a commission at the Real Col√©gio de S√£o Paulo. Jos√© de Santa Maria Saldanha was appointed Bishop of Porto by decree of April 30 and royal charter of 26 May 1709, and on the same date Governor of Arms of the same city. On 7 November 1716, Pope Clement, delivering his services to the College of Cardinals in consistory, elevated the Royal Collegiate Chapel of S√£o Tom√© to a metropolitan cathedral with the title \\"Holy Patriarcal Cathedral\\". He was named Chief Chaplain-Patriarch in the Royal Charter of 4 December 1713, confirmed on December 7 by the Holy See, making him the first Patriarch of Lisbon. On 13 February 1717, Tom√°s entered Lisbon in majestic solemnity attended by the secular and regular clergy, state officials, a court procession, and troops formed in wings. Father Francisco de Santa Maria recorded the events as follows: > \\"His entry started in the church of San Sebasti√£o da Pedreira, the noblemen > of the court waiting for him on horseback. He took to the carriage and came > marching with light accompaniment to the church of Santa Marta; then went > down on horseback to the gates of Santo Ant√£o, where the altar was erected. > He left dressed pontifically with his cloak and white miter, and mounted a > mule, covered with a white linen cloth, the reins given to Brother D. Luis, > Count of Avintes. When the councillors of the two chambers of Lisbon and the > two wings that formed the regular communities, confraternities and > brotherhoods of the city received him under a canopy of precious canvas, > they arrived at the Holy Patriarchal Cathedral, this act to the hymn Te Deum > laudamus, sung with solemnity.\\" On 17 November 1717, he had the honor to bless the first stone, medal and foundations of the Royal Basilica of Mafra. He baptized the Infantes D. Pedro and D. Alexandre, and the four children of the Prince of Brazil. On 11 January 1728, he celebrated in the Holy Patriarchal Cathedral the marriage of the Infanta Dona Maria B√°rbara to the Prince of Asturias, and on 20 January 1729, in Elvas, that of the Prince of Brazil with the Princess Dona Mariana Vit√≥ria. =Cardinalate= On 20 December 1737, he ascended to the cardinalate. He received the red hat in the Oratory of the Palace where he lived near the church of S√£o Roque. He came to Lisbon to receive, on 3 March 1738, Julio Sacchetti, envoy of the Holy See, Canon of St. Peter in the Vatican and the Pope's chief chamberlain. On 13 November 1746, the Holy Patriarchal Cathedral which the King had built after the extinction of the Eastern diocese by Benedict XIV, was destroyed by an earthquake. On 7 September 1750, he attended the acclamation of Joseph I of Portugal. On 27 October 1753, he offered the Brotherhood of Santa Isabel part of his expensive silver flatware for their assistance in the reconstruction of the Cathedral, upon his death he bequeathed the rest to them, then worth more than four reals. He spent large sums of money on the construction of convents, churches, and other religious bodies. He remained controversial with Alexandre de Gusm√£o and Diogo de Mendon√ßa Corte-Real. His body is interred in Igreja de S√£o Roque, in Lisbon. Bibliography *BARBOSA ( D. Jos√© ) - PANAGYRICO / AO EXCELLENTISS. E REVERENDISS. SENHOR D.

It is reputed to have been used as a hiding place by Dick Turpin and since the 20th century has become closely associated with the Scout movement. The tree is situated close to the training ground for the association's first Scout leaders and provided material for the earliest Wood Badges. The oak inspired Scout movement founder Robert Baden- Powell to create \\"the moral of the acorn and the oak\\" an analogy for the growth of the Scout movement and the personal growth of its members. The Gilwell Oak was voted England's Tree of the Year by the public in 2017 and was subsequently selected by a panel of experts as the UK Tree of the Year.  Description  Baden-Powell's sketch of his acorn and oak analogy, inspired by the Gilwell Oak The Gilwell Oak is a Common or English Oak (Quercus robur) of approximately 450‚Äì550 years of age. It is in Gilwell Park, a former country estate in Epping Forest that was purchased by The Scout Association in 1919 for use as their headquarters. The tree is reputed to have been used by the 18th-century highwayman Dick Turpin to ambush passing stagecoaches.  Scouting  A modern Wood Badge The oak is sited at the edge of Gilwell Park's training ground where the first Scout leader training was carried out. The Wood Badge, the bead insignia that mark completion of Scout leader training, is closely linked to the Gilwell Oak. Although the original beads came from Africa, reputedly having belonged to Dinizulu, the fallen branches of the Gilwell Oak were carved into early wood badges awarded to leaders trained at Gilwell. Modern wood badges are made from alternative materials but special commemorative beads carved from the Gilwell Oak are sold by The Scout Association to certified leaders. Scouting's founder Robert Baden-Powell was inspired by the oak to write \\"the moral of the acorn and the oak\\" in around 1929 that held that \\"big things were possible from modest beginnings\\". Baden- Powell said that the growth of the oak from humble acorn to mighty tree was analogous to the growth of Scouting from the 1907 Brownsea Island Scout camp to a worldwide organisation and the similar personal growth of a young person passing through the movement. Chief Scout of the Scout Association Bear Grylls said that \\"The Gilwell Oak has been the backdrop to hundreds of courses in which thousands of volunteer leaders have been inspired and motivated to change young people's lives. It's the unbending symbol of Scouting's desire to change the world for the better\\". The Gilwell Oak is a landmark at Gilwell Park and is visited by hundreds of Scouts each year, some of whom take a leaf or an acorn from the tree as a souvenir of their visit.  Tree of the Year 2017  The Gilwell Oak was nominated for English Tree of the Year 2017 and beat the nine other contenders, having polled 26% of the 7,000 public votes. It was subsequently chosen as UK Tree of Year from the winners of the four Home Nations by a panel of experts. The tree represented the UK at the European Tree of the Year Awards and came in fifth place with 12,955 votes. In commemoration of the tree's win the Scout Association was presented with a model of the tree.

The parameters defining the Snake Projection must be tailored for specific projects; the most typical use is with large-scale linear engineering projects such as rail infrastructure, however the projection is equally applicable to any application requiring a low distortion grid along a linear route (e.g. pipelines and roads). The name of the projection is derived from the sinuous nature of the projects it may be designed for. Typical map projection distance distortion characteristics of a Snake projection are minimal over the whole route within approximately 20 kilometres of the centre line. The principal advantage of the projection is that, for the corridor defining the design space, distances measured on the ground have a one to one relationship with distances in coordinate space (i.e. no scale factor need be applied to convert between distances in grid and distances on the ground). The main disadvantage is that away from the design corridor the distortion of the projection is not controlled. The Snake Projection is the engineering coordinate system used for a significant proportion of primary rail routes in the UK, including that of the HS2 London to Birmingham line. For the London to Glasgow West Coast Main Line the distortion in the Snake Projection used is no greater than 20 parts per million within 5 kilometres of either side of the track.

The book follows a first-person narrator as he takes a walk through an unnamed Brazilian city. It depicts the narrator's wandering both physically and mentally through an unfamiliar environment that reminds him of other walks he has taken in other cities. Chejfec says he set the novel in Brazil because it is an immense country that is culturally and linguistically different from the rest of Latin America, which gives the character space to get lost in and reflect on the separation within himself. The character leads a divided existence where the material world and the world of thought are in constant tension. Critics have praised My Two Worlds for its \\"perverse, profound magic\\" and its \\"penetrating\\" insights into the mind, but showed less enthusiasm for its \\"affectations\\" and tendency to exhaust the reader.

Its original branch is on Dolphin Street in Jaffa and there are two more branches located on Shivtei Israel Street. It has been rated best hummus restaurant in Israel in many lists. The restaurant is famous for its loyal crowd of Arabs and Jews, laborers and tourists, sitting side by side and crammed to the same tables, and the long line that lurks at its entrance every day at noon. The hummus was founded by Ali Karawan, known as Abu Hassan. History Karawan started out as a hummus seller off a cart in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa. In 1959 he opened his first restaurant on 60th Street, now Yefet Street, that did not last. In the early 1970s he opened a restaurant on Dolphin Street, corner Yehuda HaYamit. This restaurant is still active today. After decades in which Karawan refused to open additional branches, a larger hummus restaurant was opened on Shivtei Yisrael Street, not far from the original restaurant. The success of the branch, which despite its size is also characterized by a long line of diners at the entrance, led to the opening of a third restaurant, Pearl of Jaffa - Brothers Karawan, which also offer fries, falafel and salad. In October 2007 Karawan died after years of minor involvement in the management of the network during which his son Ibrahim served as the director. Concept The original restaurant of Abu Hassan on Dolphin Street is small, overcrowded and almost uncluttered. It is open from eight in the morning and closes when there is no more food, usually in the early afternoon. Due to the long line that is steeped in the entrance, hummus is eaten sitting together with other diners around the same table, as is customary in many working restaurants. Restaurant service is fast, efficient and sometimes even aggressive. The reservation and serving are very quick, and the waiters often urge the diners who have finished eating to make room for those waiting in line. The restaurant's menu is very limited. The restaurant serves only four basic courses - hummus, masabacha, brown beans and labane - and dishes that combine them. The famous dish of the restaurant is the triangle (in Arabic: Mutha'alat, in Hebrew: Meshulash), a triangular dish that includes hummus, brown beans and masabacha. With the dishes, pitas, fresh onions, and saucers of hot sauce with lemon salt are served. The restaurant does not offer the guests a written menu for viewing around the table, but presents the various dishes and their prices on the wall of the restaurant.

By the time that appliances from the Shrewsbury Fire Brigade had arrived the fire had taken hold over two floors of the wing. A spokesman for the fire brigade reported that 70 fireman had been involved and the fire was under control by 02:00, two rooms had been severely damaged. Twenty patients died in the fire and another died in hospital, a total of 140 patients were evacuated from the wing. A further 14 women were injured. Investigation An investigation report found that the night staff had no training in evacuation and the Shrewsbury Fire Brigade reported that a ten-minute delay between the night nurse finding the fire and the alarm being raised contributed to the number of deaths, mainly from smoke inhalation. It was believed that the fire started from a discarded cigarette end. The report found that staffing at the hospital was \\"on the low side\\" and the locking patients into wards was accepted practice although the 1959 Mental Health Act said the number that needed to be locked in would be as few as possible. A review of fire safety procedures in hospitals in the Midlands were held after this fire.

The townland covers 208 statute acres. A sub-division is called Tullynahaltra (Tulaig na hAlt√≥r = The Hill of the Altars, because there was a Mass Rock in the field). History In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. An alternative name for the townland was Curraghlahan (Carrach Leathan = The Broad Bog). The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as Corclagh. In 1804 Lowther Kirkwood of Mullinagrave, parish of Templeport, Co.

Over the following years, she composed works which included a symphony, a piano concerto, choral works, chamber music, piano solos and art- songs.

In 1916, she married one of her pupils, Sergei Andropov, who was a member of the Bolshevik Party. Unrest following the February 1917 revolution meant that she had to leave her life among Saint Petersburg musical circles and it is believed that soon after that event she was in hiding with her husband's family in Rostov-on-Don. Although she later moved to Moscow following the success of the Bolsheviks in establishing the Soviet state, she undertook little public work except piano recitals of music deemed acceptable, which did not include her own Romantic compositions. However, it is thought she continued to compose in private.

Cookie, Pudding and their little sister Candy, as any kids, like to play, eat sweets and investigate about things around them. Every day their inquisitive mind leads the three kittens to new adventures. With wise advice of their caring parents, the kittens solve all the problems and everything always end well. With their friends Cupcake, Chase, Boris, Caddy, Sugarplum, Smudge, Mustard, Bow, Raisin Dart and Jerry, they have very fun and interesting times. Many other cats live in the town. They all have different ways of doing things but it always comes to a common decision.

Their names are Mustard, Boris, Chase, Dart, Smudge, Cupcake, Caddy, Sugarplum, Bow, Raisin and Jerry In every episode, Cookie, Candy and Pudding encounter a situation that requires action. Rather than jump into action, these three love to jump in with enthusiastic and often absurd suggestions for how to tackle the problem: pizza delivery by rocket ship, indoor snow sculptures, or steamroller bicycles. Characters=Main= *Cookie (Russian - –ö–æ—Ä–∂–∏–∫ (Shortbread / Korzhik) - (Voiced by Lori Gardner and Kate Bristol) - the most restless and hyperactive kitten.

Since 2008 there has been a mechanism for an independent review of any suspected breaches of the code. History Drafting of the new Scottish Ministerial Code was discussed at the first meeting of the Cabinet on 20 May 1999. It was based on a code used in Whitehall. The first version was issued in August 1999. The 2008 version introduced changes that specifically prohibited ministers from making misleading statements in the Parliament chamber. In 2015 changes were made to allow Ministers to confirm whether they have received legal advice on a specific topic. Ministerial parliamentary aides were originally not able to sit on committees that provided scrutiny of their Minister. This positions became known as Parliamentary Liaison Officers (PLOs) and the restriction was removed in 2007. In August 2016 A requirement was introduced for PLOs to declare this on the first occasion that they took part in parliamentary business within the remit of their Cabinet Secretary. By December this had been tightened up to extend to every occasion. The February 2018 version contained new sections to guard against harassment, bullying and other such inappropriate behaviour. Scrutiny In 2008 an independent Panel was created to review any concerns, with former Presiding Officers Lord David Steel and George Reid appointed. Steel and Reid left their positions in mid-2011. Following this Lord Peter Fraser and Dame Elish Angiolini were appointed. David Bell was appointed in October 2012, then in 2013 James Hamilton, a former Director of Public Prosecutions on Ireland.

In 1917 she showed top-class form, winning both her races including the prestigious Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year she finished second in the 1000 Guineas and was then awarded the New Oak Stakes on the disqualification of Stony Ford. She went on to win the Champion Stakes, Lowther Stakes and Liverpool Autumn Cup as well as finishing second in the wartime substitute St Leger. She was not a great success as a broodmare but did produce at least two winners before her death in 1933. Background My Dear was a bay mare bred in England by her owner Alfred W. Cox who raced his horses under the name of \\"Mr Fairie\\". The filly was sent into training with by Alec Taylor, Jr. at Manton, Wiltshire. She was ridden to her biggest successes by Steve Donoghue. She was sired by Beppo, a male-line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian, who won the Jockey Club Stakes and Hardwicke Stakes as well as finishing third in the 1906 running of the St Leger. As a breeding stallion, the best of his other offspring were Picaroon and the Ascot Gold Cup winner Aleppo. My Dear's dam Silesia was a daughter of the outstanding broodmare Galicia, making her a half-sister to both Bayardo and Lemberg. My Dear's racing career took place during World War I. Many racecourses were closed for the duration of the conflict and all five of traditional British Classic Races were run at Newmarket. Racing career=1917: two-year-old season= My Dear was one of the best juvenile fillies of 1917 in England. She began her career with a \\"stylish\\" victory in the Banham Plate. In the autumn she started at odds of 11/10 and \\"romped home\\" from male opposition to win the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket. =1918: three-year-old season= The 1918 edition of the 1000 Guineas on 1 May attracted eight runners but the only serious contenders appeared to be My Dear and the Middle Park Stakes winner Benevente, who was slightly preferred in the betting. My Dear tracked her rival before going to the front at half way but was then overtaken by Lord Derby's Ferry a 50/1 outsider and finished second, beaten two lengths. Ferry and Benevente were again in opposition when My Dear started 3/1 favourite for the 140th running of the Oaks Stakes (officially the New Oaks Stakes) at Newmarket on 6 June, with the best of the other runners appearing to be Zinovia, Stony Ford and White Squall. Entering the last half mile Stony Ford led from My Dear with the pair several lengths clear of their rivals. When her jockey began to use his whip, Stony Ford veered sharply across the track, bumping the favourite who lost three lengths as a result. My Dear rallied strongly but was hampered for a second time as Stony Ford hung badly to the right in the closing stages. Stony Ford finished a length in front but Donoghue immediately lodged an objection and there was little surprise when the racecourse stewards disqualified the winner and awarded the race to My Dear. Ferry and Silver Bullet, who had dead-heated for third, were promoted to joint-second place. My Dear returned for a successful autumn campaign. In September at Newmarket, she finished second to her stablemate Gainsborough, winner of the 2000 Guineas and Derby in the September Stakes, a wartime substitute for the St Leger. At the same track on 15 October she started 11/10 favourite for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs and won \\"easily\\" from the Derby runner-up Dansellon, with Diadem in third place. Later at the same meeting she won the Lowther Stakes (not the current race of the same name) over fourteen furlongs. Before the end of the season she added a victory in the Autumn Cup at Liverpool. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated My Dear an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks and the best three- year-old filly of 1918 in Britain. Breeding record My Dear was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She produced at least two winners: *Caravel, a bay colt, foaled in 1921, sired by Cicero.

They are now thought to be extinct. Language The Mingin language's affiliation has yet to be determined but is thought to have belonged to the Tangkic language family, and to have been closely related to the languages of the Wellesley Islands and in particular Yukulta spoken by the neighbouring Ganggalida. Country Norman Tindale estimated Mingin land as encompassing around , living in the savannah plains south of Burketown on the Barkly River, as east to the banks of the Leichhardt River. Their southern limits lay around Augustus Downs and Gregory Downs. Their sole contact with the coast was at the area where the Albert River drains into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Social customs The Mingin were a circumcising tribe which dropped the rite from their initiation ceremonies sometime around the middle of the 129th century. They had close links, though speaking apparently quite distinct languages, with the neighbouring Maikudunu. According to one early settler in their area, their tribal traditions held that they were respectively formed by branching off from the Kalkatungu, a people whom they, and the Maikudunu, thereafter reportedly held in contempt. History The Mingin lived along the coastal territory lying west of the Leichhardt River. One oral account, conserved by the Ganggalida, has them encountering intruders in the area of the Albert River. The Leichhardt river forms a natural divide between differing aboriginal cultures, circumcision not being practiced east of it, from which one may infer that the Mingginda included it in their initiatory rituals. Within a very short period after the beginning of white settlement in the area, the Mingin were decimated, either through white colonial violence, introduced diseases, or both. The yellow fever that ravaged the settlement of Burketown, which was founded in the heartland of their territory, is thought to have been a major factor precipitating their disappearance, and by the 1930s they were thought of as extinct. The Ganggalida people spread to occupy the niche once occupied by the Mingin, and have successfully petitioned for a native title right to the latter tribe's traditional lands around Burketown on the basis of the principle of succession.

History The building was designed as the headquarters of the 2nd Northumbrian Brigade, Royal Field Artillery and opened in April 1911. The riding school of the East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry, which was accessed from Walton Street and had been completed in 1905, formed part of the site. The barracks were named after Lord Wenlock who had been honorary colonel of both 2nd Northumbrian Brigade and the East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry.Army List, various dates The 2nd Northumbrian Brigade was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 and, after being deployed to France and being re- designated 251 Brigade in May 1916, it saw action at the Battle of Passchendaele in autumn 1917, the First Battle of Bapaume in March 1918 and the Second Battle of the Somme in August 1918 as well as the Second Battle of Bapaume later that month. After the First World War the drill hall became home of 73 (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery, a formation which evolved to become 62nd (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade Royal Artillery in 1936. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) and Gun Operations Room (GOR) for the Humber Gun Zone (later Gun Defence Area, GDA) were based at Wenlock Barracks during the early part of the Second World War.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2272.

The regiment amalgamated with 529 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment Royal Artillery and 581 (5th Battalion The Royal Lincolnshire Regiment) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment Royal Artillery to form 440th (Humber) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment Royal Artillery, with its headquarters at Wenlock Barracks, in 1955. Following the defence cuts in 1967, the regiment was reduced to cadre strength sponsored by 250 Field Ambulance Royal Army Medical Corps.

History It was probably commissioned in 1505 from Andrea Mantegna by cardinal Marco Cornaro for the 'studiolo' or study of his brother Francesco's palace in San Polo. This would make it a pendant to The Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome, with the pair possibly intended to form part of a series of four works. However, Mantegna did not begin any of the four except Introduction, the only one that Mantegna he completed before his death in 1506. He and Bellini had trained together as young men and the latter was also the former's brother in law. Bellini was himself an old man by 1506 but still took over this part of the commission and produced it in one of Mantegna's signature styles, grisaille (monochrome). Roberto Longhi has suggested that Sofonisba and Tuccia from Mantegna's Exemplary Women of Antiquity series were produced to go with Introduction and Continence ‚Äì they are the same height as them but are on panel not canvas and no documents survive to support the theory. First half Second half Francesco Cornaro was a Venetian patrician and his family was supposed to be descended from the Cornelia gens of ancient Rome, hence the choice of two subjects from that gens' participation in the Second Punic War. Continence is derived from a story in Livy and Valerius Maximus about the aftermath of the capture of Carthage in 209 BC by Publius Cornelius Scipio. A virgin was personally delivered to him as a hostage, but she pleaded to be returned to her parents and Celtiberian fianc√©. He agreed on the single condition that her fianc√© would work for peace between Rome and Carthage. Just left of centre Scipio sits on a throne and refuses the gold brought to him by the woman's parents as her ransom. She stands at the foot of his throne with her fianc√©, who is shown with a sword and helmet. Between Scipio and the virgin is a plaque reading TVRPIVS / IMPER / VENERE / .Q. A. / MIS AI. The more peripheral figures were painted by Bellini's studio and overall his and their figures show more animation than Mantegna's more rigid classicism, showing that Bellini had taken on board innovations by Giorgione but refused to be influenced by D√ºrer. The work reappeared on the art market in 1873 when it was sold by Sir John Charles Robinson (1824‚Äì1913) to Sir Francis Cook (1817‚Äì1901) of Doughty House, Richmond-upon-Thames. Cook's son Frederick Lucas, his grandson Herbert Frederick and his great-grandson Francis Ferdinand Maurice all inherited the painting in turn. Sir Francis Ferdinand Maurice Cook sold it in February 1948 to Gualtiero Volterra, who was buying it on behalf of count Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi of Florence. The count briefly brought it back to Italy before selling it to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in March 1949. The Foundation finally gave it to its current owner in 1952.

Little remains of the signature on the first rock in the left foreground, but it has been confirmed as genuine during restoration and can be reconstructed as \\"[Johannes Bellinu]s. 1505\\". This is problematic, since the work's general style is linked to fashions no later than 1490, whereas Bellini's style of figures and landscapes had already begun to be influenced by Giorgione by 1500, with the backgrounds more fused and unified in terms of atmosphere. The composition makes it more analogous to his earlier works, such as the c. 1480 St. Jerome in the Desert. The Washington work may have been a collaboration, a work completed by a pupil in Bellini's studio or left incomplete and only finished by Bellini himself much laterMariolina Olivari, Giovanni Bellini, in AA.VV., Pittori del Rinascimento, Scala, Firenze 2007. . Saint Jerome is shown reading in the desert, referring to his life as a hermit and as the producer of the Vulgate Bible. A lizard, a squirrel and hare appear among the rocks, whilst in the distance are a ruined Roman bridge and series of arches along with a walled city. In the centre background is another city on an island or peninsula in the sea. The fig tree, bare tree and crumbled rocks are all theological symbols. The upper left part of the ruins and other more stiffly- painted parts of the background were probably produced by Bellini's studio.

Background Its original location is unknown, though Gamba's theory is that it was an altarpiece for Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice, where Jacopo Sansovino mentioned seeing a St. Jerome by Bellini completed in 1489. It uses the same composition as another St. Jerome in the Desert, controversially dated to around 1505. In both works saint Jerome is shown reading in the desert, referring to both his life as a hermit and his production of the Vulgate Bible. The Florence work shows a crucifix on a tall stick, which he used as a prayer aid. His usual lion is shown, as are some birds, a lizard, a squirrel on a branch and one deer chasing another, all of which probably had symbolic meanings. At the top is a rural background with a fortress and a walled city full of guard towers and bell towers, along with other buildings based on famous buildings in Romagna and Venetia which Bellini had seen on his journey to Romagna and the Marche. The central building resembles the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, whilst others are based on the Ponte di Tiberio in Rimini and the Mausoleum of Theoderic in Ravenna. The marked the start of a new conception of landscape painting, connected to the predella of the Pesaro Altarpiece or the New York St. Francis in Ecstasy, whose figures and background are lighter and whose atmosphere is freer than previous works.

He is well known for his writings on camouflage in relation to art, design and creativity as detailed in Camoupedia and additional books and essays on the subject. Biography Behrens has written extensively on the interface between camouflage and art, including on the theories of the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, who argued that the male wood duck's conspicuous plumage was disruptively patterned, rather than sexually selected.Behrens, Roy (2014) ‚ÄúAbbott H. Thayer‚Äôs vanishing ducks: surveillance, art and camouflage‚Äù in MAS Context (Chicago) 22, pp. 164-177. (Painting Male Wood Duck in a Forest Pool by Thayer, 1909) Roy R. Behrens was born to Chester H. Behrens and Eleanor E. Behrens in 1946 in Independence, Iowa. He gained his bachelor's in art education degree at the University of Northern Iowa in 1968. He rose to the rank of sergeant with the United States Marine Corps from 1969 to 1971. He gained his master of art education degree at Rhode Island School of Design in 1972. He taught graphic design, illustration, and design history at the University of Northern Iowa from 1972, at the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee from 1977, at the Art Academy of Cincinnati from 1987, and, again, at the University of Northern Iowa from 1990 until his retirement in 2018. He has written several books and numerous papers. For twenty years, beginning in 1985, he published a quarterly magazine called Ballast Quarterly Review (the title is an acronym for Books Art Language Logic Ambiguity Science and Teaching), self-described as a \\"periodical commonplace book.\\" Over the years, he has written numerous articles for Leonardo and various books and journals. He is the author of Camoupedia, a book and blog on camouflage. The camouflage researcher Isla Forsyth describes this work as an \\"extensive study into modern military camouflage..by the British and US military throughout the First and Second World Wars, exploring the contribution of art and science, and the ways in which, via modern and contemporary art, camouflage has been appropriated by contemporary culture\\". Mike Leggett, reviewing the book in Leonardo, wrote that \\"the outcome of enthusiastic research it is, but an entertaining summary of the field it also manages to be.\\" Michael A. Martone calls Behrens \\"a wonderful writer and artist ... whose work on camouflage and art is important to me. He publishes an amazing 'zine called Ballast on visual and verbal punning.\\" Behrens is married to the artist Mary Snyder Behrens, with whom he is founder and co-proprietor of Bobolink Books.

The term squeezing thus refers to a reduced quantum uncertainty. To obey Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, a squeezed state must also have phases at which the electric field uncertainty is anti- squeezed, i.e. larger than that of a coherent state.  Quantum physical background  An oscillating physical quantity cannot have precisely defined values at all phases of the oscillation. This is true for the electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave, as well as for any other wave or oscillation (see figure right). This fact can be observed in experiments and is correctly described by quantum theory. For electromagnetic waves we usually consider just the electric field, because it is the one that mainly interacts with matter. Fig. 1. shows five different quantum states that a monochromatic wave could be in. The difference of the five quantum states is given by different electric field excitations and by different distributions of the quantum uncertainty along the phase \\\\vartheta. For a displaced coherent state, the expectation (mean) value of the electric field clearly shows an oscillation, with an uncertainty independent of the phase (a). Also the phase- (b) and amplitude-squeezed states (c) show an oscillation of the mean electric field, but here the uncertainty depends on phase and is squeezed for some phases. The vacuum state (d) is a special coherent state and is not squeezed. It has zero mean electric field for all phases and a phase-independent uncertainty. It has zero energy on average, i.e. zero photons, and is the ground state of the monochromatic wave we consider. Finally, a squeezed vacuum state has also a zero mean electric field but a phase-dependent uncertainty (e). Generally, quantum uncertainty reveals itself through a large number of identical measurements on identical quantum objects (here: modes of light) that, however, give different results. Let us again consider a continuous-wave monochromatic light wave (as emitted by an ultra-stable laser). A single measurement of ‘ê(\\\\vartheta_1) is performed over many periods of the light wave and provides a single number. The next measurements of ‘ê(\\\\vartheta_1) will be done consecutively on the same laser beam. Having recorded a large number of such measurements we know the field uncertainty at \\\\vartheta_1. In order to get the full picture, and for instance Fig.1(b), we need to record the statistics at many different phases 0<\\\\vartheta_i<\\\\pi.  Quantitative description of (squeezed) uncertainty  The measured electric field strengths at the wave's phase \\\\vartheta are the eigenvalues of the normalized quadrature operator X_\\\\vartheta, where X_{\\\\vartheta=0^\\\\circ} \\\\equiv X is the wave's amplitude quadrature and X_{\\\\vartheta=90^\\\\circ} \\\\equiv Y is the wave's phase quadrature. X and Y are non-commuting observables. Although they represent electric fields, they are dimensionless and satisfy the following uncertainty relation: : \\\\;\\\\Delta X^2 \\\\Delta Y^2 \\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{16} , where \\\\Delta^2 stands for the variance. (The variance is the mean of the squares of the measuring values minus the square of the mean of the measuring values.) If a mode of light is in its ground state 0\\\\rangle (having an average photon number of zero), the uncertainty relation above is saturated and the variances of the quadrature are \\\\Delta X^2_g = \\\\Delta Y^2_g = 1/4. (Other normalizations can also be found in literature. The normalization chosen here has the nice property that the sum of the ground state variances directly provide the zero point excitation of the quantized harmonic oscillator \\\\Delta^2 X_g + \\\\Delta^2 Y_g = 1/2). :Definition: Light is in a squeezed state, if (and only if) a phase \\\\vartheta exists for which \\\\;\\\\Delta^2 X_\\\\vartheta < \\\\Delta^2 X_g = \\\\frac{1}4. While coherent states belong to the semi-classical states, since they can be fully described by a semi-classical model, squeezed states of light belong to the so-called nonclassical states, which also include number states (Fock states) and Schr√∂dinger cat states. Squeezed states (of light) were first produced in the mid 1980s.R. E. Slusher et al., Observation of squeezed states generated by four wave mixing in an optical cavity, Phys. Rev. Lett. 55 (22), 2409 (1985) At that time, quantum noise squeezing by up to a factor of about 2 (3 dB) in variance was achieved, i.e. \\\\Delta^2 X_\\\\vartheta \\\\approx \\\\Delta^2 X_g/2. Today, squeeze factors larger than 10 (10 dB) have been directly observed. A limitation is set by decoherence, mainly in terms of optical loss. A recent review is given in Ref. (arXiv version). The squeeze factor in Decibel (dB) can be computed in the following way: : -10 \\\\cdot \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\Delta^2_\\\\mathrm{min} X_\\\\theta}{\\\\Delta^2 X_G} , where \\\\Delta^2_\\\\mathrm{min} X_\\\\theta is the smallest variance when varying the phase \\\\vartheta from 0 to \\\\pi. This particular phase \\\\theta is called the squeeze angle.  Representation of squeezed states by quasi-probability densities  Fig. 1(f): Left: Wigner function of a squeezed vacuum state. Right: Connection to Fig. 1 (e). Quantum states such as those in Fig. 1 (a) to (e) are often displayed as Wigner functions, which are quasi-probability density distributions. Two orthogonal quadratures, usually Xand Y, span a phase space diagram, and the third axes provides the quasi probability of yielding a certain combination of [X;Y]. Since Xand Yare not precisely defined simultaneously, we cannot talk about a 'probability' as we do in classical physics but call it a 'quasi probability'. A Wigner function is reconstructed from time series of X(t)and Y(t). The reconstruction is also called 'quantum tomographic reconstruction'. For squeezed states, the Wigner function has a Gaussian shape, with an elliptical contour line, see Fig.: 1(f).  Physical meaning of measurement quantity and measurement object  Quantum uncertainty becomes visible when identical measurements of the same quantity (observable) on identical objects (here: modes of light) give different results (eigen values). In case of a single freely propagating monochromatic laser beam, the individual measurements are performed on consecutive time intervals of identical length. One interval must last much longer than the light's period; otherwise the monochromatic property would be significantly disturbed. Such consecutive measurements correspond to a time series of fluctuating eigen values. Consider an example in which the amplitude quadrature X was repeatedly measured. The time series can be used for a quantum statistical characterization of the modes of light. Obviously, the amplitude of the light wave might be different before and after our measurement, i.e. the time series does not provide any information about very slow changes of the amplitude, which corresponds to very low frequencies. This is a trivial but also fundamental issue, since any data taking lasts for a finite time. Our time series, however, does provide meaningful information about fast changes of the light's amplitude, i.e. changes at frequencies higher than the inverse of the full measuring time. Changes that are faster than the duration of a single measurement, however, are invisible again. A quantum statistical characterization through consecutive measurements on some sort of a carrier is thus always related to a specific frequency interval, for instance described by f \\\\pm \\\\Delta f/2 with f > \\\\Delta f/2 >0. Based on this inside, we can describe the physical meaning of the observable X_\\\\vartheta more clearly: 240x240px The quantum statistical characterization using identical consecutive modes carried by a laser beam confers to the laser beam's electric field modulation within a frequency interval. The actual observable needs to be labeled accordingly, for instance as X_{\\\\vartheta,f,\\\\Delta f}. X_{f,\\\\Delta f} is the amplitude (or depth) of the amplitude modulation and Y_{f,\\\\Delta f} the amplitude (or depth) of the phase modulation in the respective frequency interval. This leads to the doggerel expressions 'amplitude quadrature amplitude' and 'phase quadrature amplitude'. Within some limitations, for instance set by the speed of the electronics, f and \\\\Delta f can be freely chosen in course of data acquisition and, in particular, data processing. This choice also defines the measurement object, i.e. the mode that is characterized by the statistics of the eigen values of X_{f,\\\\Delta f} and Y_{f,\\\\Delta f}. The measurement object thus is a modulation mode that is carried by the light beam. ‚Äì In many experiments, one is interested in a continuous spectrum of many modulation modes carried by the same light beam. Fig. 2 shows the squeeze factors of many neighboring modulation modes versus f. The upper trace refers to the uncertainties of the same modes being in their vacuum states, which serves as the 0 dB reference. The observables in squeezed light experiments correspond exactly to those being used in optical communication. Amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) are the classical means to imprint information on a carrier field. (Frequency modulation is mathematically closely related to phase modulation). The observables X_{f,\\\\Delta f} and Y_{f,\\\\Delta f} also correspond to the measurement quantities in laser interferometers, such as in Sagnac interferometers measuring rotation changes and in Michelson interferometers observing gravitational waves. Squeezed states of light thus have ample applications in optical communication and optical measurements.  Applications = Optical high-precision measurements = Fig. 3: Schematic of a laser interferometer for the detection of gravitational waves. Here, squeezed vacuum states are injected and overlapped with the bright field at the central beam splitter to improve the sensitivity. Fig. 4: Photo voltages of a photo diode detecting light. Squeezed light is used to reduce the photon counting noise (shot noise) in optical high-precision measurements, most notably in laser interferometers. There are a large number of proof-of- principle experiments. Laser interferometers split a laser beam in two paths and overlap them again afterwards. If the relative optical path length changes, the interference changes, and the light power in the interferometer's output port as well. This light power is detected with a photo diode providing a continuous voltage signal. If for instance the position of one interferometer mirror vibrates and thereby causes an oscillating path length difference, the output light has an amplitude modulation of the same frequency. Independent of the existence of such a (classical) signal, a beam of light always carries at least the vacuum state uncertainty (see above). The (modulation) signal with respect to this uncertainty can be improved by using a higher light power inside the interferometer arms, since the signal increases with the light power. This is the reason (in fact the only one) why Michelson interferometers for the detection of gravitational waves use very high optical power. High light power, however, produces technical problems. Mirror surfaces absorb parts of the light, become warmer, get thermally deformed and reduce the interferometer's interference contrast. Furthermore, an excessive light power can excite unstable mechanical vibrations of the mirrors. These consequences are mitigated if squeezed states of light are used for improving the signal-to-noise-ratio. Squeezed states of light do not increase the light's power. They also do not increase the signal, but instead reduce the noise. Laser interferometers are usually operated with monochromatic continuous-wave light. The optimal signal-to-noise-ratio is achieved by either operating the differential interferometer arm lengths such that both output ports contain half of the input light power (half fringe) and by recording the difference signal from both ports, or by operating the interferometer close to a dark fringe for one of the output ports where just a single photodiode is placed. The latter operation point is used in gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. For improving an interferometer sensitivity with squeezed states of light, the already existing bright light does not need to be fully replaced. What has to be replaced is just the vacuum uncertainty in the difference of the phase quadrature amplitudes of the light fields in the arms, and only at modulation frequencies at which signals are expected. This is achieved by injecting a (broadband) squeezed vacuum field (Fig. 1e) into the unused interferometer input port (Fig. 3). Ideally, perfect interference with the bright field is achieved. For this the squeezed field has to be in the same mode as the bright light, i.e. has to have the same wavelength, same polarisation, same wavefront curvature, same beam radius, and, of course, the same directions of propagation in the interferometer arms. For the squeezed-light enhancement of a Michelson interferometer operated at dark fringe, a polarising beam splitter in combination with a Faraday rotator is required. This combination constitutes an optical diode. Without any loss, the squeezed field is overlapped with the bright field at the interferometer's central beam splitter, is split and travels along the arms, is retro- reflected, constructively interferes and overlaps with the interferometer signal towards the photo diode. Due to the polarisation rotation of the Faraday rotator, the optical loss on signal and squeezed field is zero (in the ideal case). Generally, the purpose of an interferometer is to transform a differential phase modulation (of two light beams) into an amplitude modulation of the output light . Accordingly, the injected vacuum-squeezed field is injected such that the differential phase quadrature uncertainty in the arms is squeezed. On the output light amplitude quadrature squeezing is observed. Fig. 4 shows the photo voltage of the photo diode in the interferometer output port. Subtracting the constant offset provides the (GW) signal. A source of squeezed states of light were integrated in the gravitational-wave detector GEO600 in 2010, as shown in Fig. 4. The source was built by the research group of R. Schnabel at Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover (Germany). With squeezed light, the sensitivity of GEO600 during observational runs has been increased to values, which for practical reasons were not achievable without squeezed light. In 2018, squeezed light upgrades are also planned for the gravitational wave detectors Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Going beyond squeezing of photon counting noise, squeezed states of light can also be used to correlate quantum measurement noise (shot noise) and quantum back action noise to achieve sensitivities in the quantum non-demolition (QND) regime. = Radiometry and calibration of quantum efficiencies = Squeezed light can be used in radiometry to calibrate the quantum efficiency of photo- electric photo detectors without a lamp of calibrated radiance. Here, the term photo detector refers to a device that measures the power of a bright beam, typically in the range from a few microwatts up to about 0.1 W. The typical example is a PIN photo diode. In case of perfect quantum efficiency (100%), such a detector is supposed to convert every photon energy of incident light into exactly one photo electron. Conventional techniques of measuring quantum efficiencies require the knowledge of how many photons hit the surface of the photo detector, i.e. they require a lamp of calibrated radiance. The calibration on the basis of squeezed states of light uses instead the effect, that the uncertainty product \\\\Delta^2 X_{f,\\\\Delta f} \\\\cdot \\\\Delta^2 Y_{f,\\\\Delta f} increases the smaller the quantum uncertainty of the detector is. In other words: The squeezed light method uses the fact that squeezed states of light are sensitive against decoherence. Without any decoherence during generation, propagation and detection of squeezed light, the uncertainty product has its minimum value of 1/16 (see above). If optical loss is the dominating decoherence effect, which usually is the case, the independent measurement of all optical losses during generation and propagation together with the value of the uncertainty product directly reveals the quantum uncertainty of the photo detectors used. When a squeezed state with squeezed variance \\\\Delta^2 X_{f,\\\\Delta f} is detected with a photo detector of quantum efficiency \\\\eta (with 0 \\\\leq \\\\eta \\\\leq 1), the actually observed variance is increased to : \\\\Delta^2 X^\\\\mathrm{obs}_{f,\\\\Delta f} = \\\\eta \\\\cdot \\\\Delta^2 X_{f,\\\\Delta f} + (1-\\\\eta)/4 \\\\, . Optical loss mixes a portion of the vacuum state variance to the squeezed variance, which decreases the squeeze factor. The same equation also describes the influence of a non- perfect quantum efficiency on the anti-squeezed variance. The anti-squeezed variance reduces, however, the uncertainty product increases. Optical loss on a pure squeezed state produces a mixed squeezed state. = Entanglement-based quantum key distribution = 388x388px Squeezed states of light can be used to produce Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-entangled light that is the resource for a high quality level of quantum key distribution (QKD), which is called 'one- sided device independent QKD'. Superimposing on a balanced beam splitter two identical light beams that carry squeezed modulation states and have a propagation length difference of a quarter of their wavelength produces two EPR entangled light beams at the beam splitter output ports. Quadrature amplitude measurements on the individual beams reveal uncertainties that are much larger than those of the ground states, but the data from the two beams show strong correlations: from a measurement value taken at the first beam (X^A_{f,\\\\Delta f}), one can infer the corresponding measurement value taken at the second beam (X^B_{f,\\\\Delta f}). If the inference shows an uncertainty smaller than that of the vacuum state, EPR correlations exist, see Fig. 4. The aim of quantum key distribution is the distribution of identical, true random numbers to two distant parties A and B in such a way that A and B can quantify the amount of information about the numbers that has been lost to the environment (and thus is potentially in hand of an eavesdropper). To do so, sender (A) sends one of the entangled light beams to receiver (B). A and B measure repeatedly and simultaneously (taking the different propagation times into account) one of two orthogonal quadrature amplitudes. For every single measurement they need to choose whether to measure X or Y in a truly random way, independently from each other. By chance, they measure the same quadrature in 50% of the single measurements. After having performed a large number of measurements, A and B communicate (publicly) what there choice was for every measurement. The non-matched pairs are discarded. From the remaining data they make public a small but statistically significant amount to test whether B is able to precisely infer the measurement results at A. Knowing the characteristics of the entangled light source and the quality of the measurement at the sender site, the sender gets information about the decoherence that happened during channel transmission and during the measurement at B. The decoherence quantifies the amount of information that was lost to the environment. If the amount of lost information is not too high and the data string not too short, data post processing in terms of error correction and privacy amplification produces a key with an arbitrarily reduced epsilon-level of insecurity. In addition to conventional QKD, the test for EPR correlations not only characterizes the channel over which the light was sent (for instance a glas fibre) but also the measurement at the receiver site. The sender does not need to trust the receivers measurement any more. This higher quality of QKD is called one-sided device independent. This type of QKD works if the natural decoherence is not too high. For this reason, an implementation that uses conventional telecommunication glas fibers would be limited to a distance of a few kilometers.  Generation  Fig. 6: Schematic of a squeezing resonator. The pumped nonlinear crystal inside the resonator attenuates the electric field at optical frequency u . This leads to perfect destructive interference for one quadrature angle that is carried by the optical frequency u and propagates towards the left (left side of resonator). The pump light enters from the right and is simply retro- reflected. If the pump light intensity is kept below the resonator's oscillation threshold, its input and output powers are basically identical. Timeline of experimentally achieved light squeezing values in the laboratory. Since the first demonstration in 1985 values have steadily improved. Squeezed light is produced by means of nonlinear optics. The most successful method uses degenerate type I optical-parametric down-conversion (also called optical-parametric amplification) inside an optical resonator. To squeeze modulation states with respect to a carrier field at optical frequency u , a bright pump field at twice the optical frequency is focussed into a nonlinear crystal that is placed between two or more mirrors forming an optical resonator. It is not necessary to inject light at frequency u . (Such light, however, is required for detecting the (squeezed) modulation states). The crystal material needs to have a nonlinear susceptibility and needs to be highly transparent for both optical frequencies used. Typical materials are lithium niobate (LiNbO3) and (periodically poled) potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP). Due to the nonlinear susceptibility of the pumped crystal material, the electric field at frequency u is amplified and deamplified, depending on the relative phase to the pump light. At the pump's electric field maxima, the electric field at frequency u is amplified. At the pump's electric field minima, the electric field at frequency u is squeezed. This way, the vacuum state (Fig. 1e) is transferred to a squeezed vacuum state (Fig. 1d). A displaced coherent state (Fig. 1a) is transferred to a phase squeezed state (Fig. 1b) or to an amplitude squeezed state (Fig. 1c), depending on the relative phase between coherent input field and pump field. A graphical description of these processes can be found in. The existence of a resonator for the field at u is essential. The task of the resonator is shown in Fig. 6. The left resonator mirror has a typical reflectivity of about r^2_1=90\\\\%. Correspondingly \\\\sqrt{0.9} of the electric field that (continuously) enters from the left gets reflected. The remaining part is transmitted and resonates between the two mirrors. Due to the resonance, the electric field inside the resonator gets enhanced (even without any medium inside). 10\\\\% of the steady-state light power inside the resonator gets transmitted towards the left and interferes with the beam that was retro- reflected directly. For an empty loss-less resonator, 100% of the light power would eventually propagate towards the left, obeying energy conservation. The principle of the squeezing resonator is the following: The medium parametrically attenuates the electric field inside the resonator to such a value that perfect destructive interference is achieved outside the resonator for the attenuated field quadrature. The optimum field attenuation factor inside the resonator is slightly below 2, depending on the reflectivity of the resonator mirror. This principle also works for electric field uncertainties. Inside the resonator, the squeeze factor is always less than 6 dB, but outside the resonator it can be arbitrarily high. If quadrature X_{f,\\\\Delta f} is squeezed, quadrature Y_{f,\\\\Delta f} is anti-squeezed ‚Äì inside as well as outside the resonator. It can be shown that the highest squeeze factor for one quadrature is achieved if the resonator is at its threshold for the orthogonal quadrature. At threshold and above, the pump field is converted into a bright field at optical frequency u. Squeezing resonators are usually operated slightly below threshold, for instance, to avoid damage to the photo diodes due to the bright down-converted field. A squeezing resonator works efficiently at modulation frequencies well inside its linewidth. Only for these frequencies highest squeeze factors can be achieved. At frequencies the optical-parametric gain is strongest, and the time delay between the interfering parts negligible. If decoherence was zero, infinite squeeze factors could be achieved outside the resonator, although the squeeze factor inside the resonator was less than 6 dB. Squeezing resonators have typical linewidths of a few tens of MHz up to GHz. Due to the interest in the interaction between squeezed light and atomic ensemble, narrowband atomic resonance squeezed light have been also generated through crystal and the atomic medium.  Detection  Fig. 7: Balanced homodyne detector. LO: local oscillator; PD: photo diode. Squeezed states of light can be fully characterized by a photo-electric detector that is able to (subsequently) measure the electric field strengths at any phase \\\\vartheta. (The restriction to a certain band of modulation frequencies happens after the detection by electronic filtering.) The required detector is a balanced homodyne detector (BHD). It has two input ports for two light beams. One for the (squeezed) signal field, and another for the BHDs local oscillator (LO) having the same wavelength as the signal field. The LO is part of the BHD. Its purpose is to beat with the signal field and to optically amplify it. Further components of the BHD are a balanced beam splitter and two photo diodes (of high quantum efficiency). Signal beam and LO need to be overlapped at the beam splitter. The two interference results in the beam splitter output ports are detected and the difference signal recorded (Fig. 7). The LO needs to be much more intense than the signal field. In this case the differential signal from the photo diodes in the interval f \\\\pm \\\\Delta f/2 is proportional to the quadrature amplitude X_{\\\\vartheta,f,\\\\Delta f}. Changing the differential propagation length before the beam splitter sets the quadrature angle to an arbitrary value. (A change by a quarter of the optical wavelength changes the phase by \\\\pi/2.) The following should be stated at this point: Any information about the electro-magnetic wave can only be gathered in a quantized way, i.e. by absorbing light quanta (photons). This is also true for the BHD. However, a BHD cannot resolve the discrete energy transfer from the light to the electric current, since in any small time interval a vast number of photons are detected. This is ensured by the intense LO. The observable therefore has a quasi-continuous eigenvalue spectrum, as it is expected for an electric field strength. (In principle, one can also characterize squeezed states, in particular squeezed vacuum states, by counting photons, however, in general the measurement of the photon number statistic is not sufficient for a full characterization of a squeezed state and the full density matrix in the basis of the number states has to be determined.)

Charles Meneveau, the Louis M. Sardella Professor in Mechanical Engineering and the associate director of the Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science (IDIES) at the Johns Hopkins University, focuses his research on understanding and modeling hydrodynamic turbulence, and on complexity in fluid mechanics in general. He combines computational, theoretical and experimental tools for his research, with an emphasis on the multiscale aspects of turbulence, using tools such as subgrid-scale modeling, downscaling techniques, and fractal geometry, and applications to Large Eddy Simulation (LES). He pioneered the use of the Lagrangian dynamic procedure for sub-grid scale modeling in large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulence. His recent work includes the use of LES for wind-energy-related applications and the development of the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database for sharing large-scale datasets from high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics calculations. Education 1989: Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, Yale University, May 1989 1988: Master of Philosophy, Yale University, 1988 1987: Master of Science, Yale University, 1987 1985: B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a, Valpara√≠so (Chile), 1985 His Ph.D. advisor was K. R. Sreenivasan and his thesis was on the multi-fractal nature of small-scale turbulence. At Yale he was also informally co-advised by B. B. Mandelbrot. Career and Research Meneveau's first postdoctoral position was at the Stanford University/NASA- Ames's Center. He has been on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University since 1990. His main appointment is in the Department of Mechanical Engineering with secondary appointments in the Departments of Environmental Health and Engineering and Physics and Astronomy. Professor Meneveau‚Äôs research is focused on understanding and modeling hydrodynamic turbulence, and complexity in fluid mechanics in general. Special emphasis is placed on the multiscale aspects of turbulence, using tools such as subgrid-scale modeling, downscaling techniques, and fractal geometry. Applications of the results to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) have facilitated applications of LES to engineering, environmental and geophysical flow phenomena. Currently Meneveau is focused on applications of LES to wind energy and wind farm fluid dynamics, on developing advanced wall models for LES, on modeling oil dispersion in the ocean, as well as on building ‚Äúbig-data‚Äù tools to share the very large data sets that arise in computational fluid dynamics with broad constituencies of scientists and engineers around the world Among Meneveau‚Äôs seminal contributions are basic advances to turbulence modeling and large eddy simulations. The advances were made possible by elucidating the properties of the small-scale motions in turbulent flows and applying the new insights to the development of advanced subgrid-scale models, such as the Lagrangian dynamic model. This model has been implemented in various research and open source CFD codes (e.g. OpenFoam) and expanded the applicability of Large Eddy Simulations to complex-geometry flows of engineering and environmental interest, where prior models could not be used. Among the application areas of Large Eddy Simulation being pursued in Meneveau‚Äôs group is the study of complex flows in large wind farms. Using the improved simulation tools as well as wind tunnel tests, Meneveau and his colleagues identified the important process of vertical entrainment of mean flow kinetic energy into an array of wind turbines. This research has clarified the mechanisms limiting wind plant performance at a time when there is enormous growth in wind farms. The research has led to new engineering models that will allow for better designed wind farms thus increasing their economic benefit and helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Meneveau has participated in efforts to democratize access to valuable ‚Äúbig data‚Äù in turbulence. As deputy director of JHU‚Äôs Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science, he led the team of computer scientists, applied mathematicians, astrophysicists, and fluid dynamicists that built the JHTDB (Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases). This open numerical laboratory provides researchers from around the world with user-friendly access to large data sets arising from Direct Numerical Simulations of various types of turbulent flows. To date, hundreds of researchers worldwide have used the data, and flow data at approximately sixty trillion points have been sampled from the database. The system has demonstrated how ‚Äúbig data‚Äù resulting from large world-class numerical simulations can be shared with many researchers who lack the massive supercomputing resources needed to generate such data. Meneveau also has performed groundbreaking research on understanding several multiscale aspects of turbulence. As part of his doctoral work at Yale, Meneveau and his advisor established the fractal and multifractal theory for turbulent flows and confirmed the theory using experiments. Interfaces in turbulence were shown to have a fractal dimension of nearly 7/3, where the 1/3 exponent above the value of two valid for smooth surfaces could be related to the classic Kolmogorov theory. And a universal multi-fractal spectrum was established, leading to a simple cascade model, which has since been applied to many other physical, biological and socio-economic systems. Later, as a postdoc at Stanford University‚Äôs Center for Turbulence Research, Meneveau pioneered the application of orthogonal wavelet analysis to turbulence, introducing the concept of wavelet spectrum and other scale-dependent statistical measures of variability.

Shay in February 1978 as the Model A & Model T Motor Car Reproduction Corporation. Harry Shay arranged with Ford Motor Company to build a limited run, modern-day reproduction of the Ford Model A Roadster, with a rumble seat, that was to be sold through the network of Ford Automobile Dealers and built in Battle Creek, Michigan. It was hoped that displaying the vehicles in Ford dealer showrooms would increase potential customer visits and sales. History=Design= While having the outward appearance of the classic automobile the reproduction was built with a fiberglass body and used a modern frame and powertrain. The Model A used the same 2.3L 4 cylinder engine as a Ford Pinto with the option of a automatic or a 4 speed manual transmission. Five different body styles were offered including a left hand spare tire mount behind the front fender, a dual spare mount behind each front fender, a spare tire mount on the rear of the vehicle, a pickup truck version, and a Model A C cab/panel truck. Harry Shay was quoted at the time that the vehicle was ‚Äúan illusion of a Model A‚Äù and only the appearance would be authentic. A number of design patents were applied for and awarded involving components for the vehicles that Shay Motors built. The vehicles were offered with a 12 month 12,000 mile warranty. Keeping the production numbers under 10,000 units would exempt Shay Motors from having to incorporate modern Federal regulations into the reproductions. The production of a 1955 Thunderbird was also started in 1980 with different models planned as the company grew. =Closure= Shay Motors was unable to keep up with the orders received and experienced problems with some of the early Model A's produced. The production method used was to have a team of four people completely assemble each vehicle instead of using a traditional assembly line. In 1982 Shay Motors was struggling with cash flow problems as well as high interest payments on loans along with a number of lawsuits. The company ceased production in mid-March 1982 and, despite trying to reorganizing through bankruptcy, the company's assets were sold to Camelot Motors, Inc. in April 1983. Final production numbers for the Shay Motor Corporation Model A were 5,000 units along with 200 units of the Thunderbird reproductions during its time in business. Harry Shay continued to work in the auto industry until 1990; he died in 1995 at age 70.\\"Harry Shay Was Copy Car King\\", Automotive News, August 14, 1995.

His father was from Martinique and his mother was from Guadeloupe. As a young man he was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, and helped refugees from slavery escape to Canada via the Underground Railroad. He was involved in the rescue of George Latimer, whose case became a major political issue in Massachusetts. With Joshua Bowen Smith and William Cooper Nell, he was prominent in the movement to desegregate the Boston public schools. In 1859 he moved from Boston to Cambridge, where he lived the rest of his life. He was the first person of color to be nominated for the Cambridge Common Council. He declined, clearing the way for his friend J. Milton Clarke, who became the first African American to serve on the Council. In 1874, against his wishes, Fatal was elected to the Council, where he served a term of one year. Afterwards he worked for the United States subtreasury for 25 years. He also owned a home furnishings store. He married four times; his fourth wife died circa 1897. All of his Martinique relatives were killed in the eruption of Mount Pel√©e in 1902. He was survived by an adopted daughter who was living in Worcester, Massachusetts, at the time of his death.

Life  Hans Otto Friedrich Julius Grisebach was born at G√∂ttingen where August Grisebach (1814‚Äì1879), his father, held a professorship in Botany at the university. He studied at the Polytechnikum in Hannover with the influential architect-professor Conrad Wilhelm Hase between 1868 and 1873 (with an interruption in 1870/71 for military service followed by a trip to Italy). He moved on from Hannover to Vienna where he worked between 1873 and 1876 for the architect F. Schmid, a proponent of the Gothic Revival style. A three-year period working in Wiesbaden was followed by an international study tour round Europe, taking in France, Spain, Italy and Malta, after which he settled, in 1880, in Berlin. He became a member of the Arts Academy in 1888. He worked between 1889 and 1901 with August Dinklage who joined him as an employee and soon became a partner in the firm during what turned out to be a particularly productive period. Hans Grisebach was an enthusiastic book collector who during the final ten or so years of his life devoted more time to the old books, which he had been gathering since he was a young man, than to his architecture. In 1908, backed by finance from various printers and publishers, around 2,000 books from his library were acquired for the library of the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts) in Berlin. The focus of the collection is on European arts from the earliest times till the beginning of the nineteenth century. It includes numerous incunabula and abundant source material on architecture history and theory. While many of Grisebach's most important architectural work - especially in the Berlin area - was damaged or destroyed during the Second World War, the core of his book collection, held at what is now the Berlin Arts Museum, has survived largely intact.  Work  Villa Neisser (1897/98) Grisebach undertook various projects in the Historicist and German Renaissance Revival styles. Sources note that whereas other architects contented themselves with imitating former styles in their revivalist designs, Grisebach was never afraid to apply his imagination creatively and generously, and - especially with domestic commissions - to incorporate elements of cosiness. He designed the Chemistry Pavilion for the 1893 World Fair in Chicago and again for the 1900 World Fair in Paris. Perhaps the most striking of his creations is the Schlesisches Tor overground metro station in Berlin, though it must be acknowledged that this development also carried unmistakably the architectural signature of August Dinklage who was working for/with Grisebach at the time. Other projects dating from the years of the partnership in respect of which it is not always clear which of the partners took the lead include St John's (\\"die Johanneskirche\\") in Gie√üen and St. Peter's (\\"die Petrusskirche\\") in Frankfurt - both of which were Evangelical churches. In 1891/92 Grisebach built himself a home, incorporating a studio-workshop, known today as the Villa Grisebach, at Fasanenstra√üe 25 in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Close by he built another house, at Fasanenstra√üe 39, featuring a \\"Bremen-style\\" front gable, and using the ideas of his client Richard Cleve, who also had incorporated various pre-fabricated elements, sourced primarily from The Netherlands, such as reliefs, bay-windows and pillars. Grisebach's best known building must be the \\"Wiesenstein House\\" (\\"Haus Wiesenstein\\") in the hamlet of Agnetendorf (as it was known before 1945) in Lower Silesia, built in 1900/01 for Gerhart Hauptmann, in which the writer lived for the rest of his life. Other high-profile clients included the well-known physician, Albert Neisser and his wife Toni, for whom in 1897/98 Grisebach built the so-called Villa Neisser at Scheitniger Park in Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was known at that time). This family home became a meeting point for celebrities such as Gerhart Hauptmann, Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Grisebach built the \\"Villa R√∂hl\\" at the Timmendorfer Beach (near L√ºbeck) for the Wahllaender/Gropius family. Walter Gropius used it as his summer house till 1933. (Today the Villa R√∂hl survives as an hotel.) The artist Max Liebermann became a personal friend: Grisebach was involved in the reconstruction of the Liebermann family home alongside Berlin's Pariser Platz and in the design of the Liebermann family grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Pankow. For his part Liebermann contributed wall paintings to the Schloss Klink (\\"Castle Klink\\") which Grisebach and Dinlage, inspired, it was said, by the Ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley, built between 1896 and 1898 for Arthur von Schnitzler in the lakeland between Berlin and Rostock. (This is another Grisebach building that has subsequently been converted into an hotel.) Newly wealthy industrialists from the west were also among his clientele, including the textiles magnate Paul Andreae for whom in 1882/83 Grisebach designed the flamboyant two-storey Gut Mielenforst \\"manor house\\" in the hills east of Cologne. Another of his more eye catching commissions is the Schloss Tremsb√ºttel \\"mini-palace\\" near Bargteheide to the northeast of Hamburg. The client was the Remscheid entrepreneur-contractor Alfred (Fritz) Hasenclever, who wanted a prominently sited Historicist-style building as a belated wedding gift for his wife, Olga. Dating from 1893/94 the building has retained many of the fashionable decorations and details characteristic of the times, both internally and on the outside. Like Schloss Klink and Villa R√∂hl, Schlo√ü Tremsb√ºttel has been converted into a hotel. All three buildings are therefore accessible to the public (2017).

Two Amtrak crew members were killed and 116 other crew and passengers were injured. Crash The collision happened at around 2:35 a.m. in Cayce, about 4 miles southwest of Columbia. An Amtrak Silver Star passenger train with 139 passengers and 8 crew on board was traveling south from New York to Miami when it collided with CSX train Q210-03 (Cayce, SC-Smyrna, TN), an empty Autorack train. The Silver Star was hauled by GE P42DC locomotive 47, while Q210-03 was headed by two GE AC4400CWs, 130 and 36. As a result of the collision, the lead engine and \\"several cars\\" of the Amtrak train derailed, killing 2 crew members and injuring 116 of the 147 people on board. The lead locomotive of the CSX train was severely damaged, and has since been scrapped. Injured passengers were taken to several local hospitals, but none had life-threatening injuries, according to a Lexington County spokesman. There were at least two fuel leaks from the trains, with an estimated of fuel spilled before a hazardous materials team was able to contain the area.  Aftermath  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Federal Railroad Administration, and CSX Transportation began investigations shortly after the accident. On July 23, 2019, NTSB publicly announced that Amtrak‚Äôs and CSX Transportation‚Äôs failure to properly assess and mitigate the risk of conducting switching operations during a signal suspension, coupled with a CSX conductor‚Äôs error, led to the collision of the Amtrak train with the CSX train. Amtrak locomotive No. 47 was severely damaged and is presumed scrapped, and CSX locomotive No. 130's cab and front area was completely destroyed. No. 36 suffered minor damage and is expected to be put back into service. Both No. 130 and No. 36 were towed to the nearest CSX shop, where No. 130 was cut up and scrapped.  Reactions  U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his thoughts and condolences were with the victims of the accident. He thanked those involved in the rescue effort. According to South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, it appeared that the CSX train was stationary and on the correct track, while the Amtrak train was on the wrong track. ABC News reported that a switch was incorrectly lined and locked for a siding track instead of the main track for which Amtrak had the authority to occupy. Amtrak chairman Richard Anderson said that the signaling system in the area was not working due to a signal suspension (for signal maintenance purposes) and that trains were being dispatched manually by CSX dispatchers. He later told press that CSX was responsible for the wreck because a switch was lined and locked off the mainline towards the siding.

Depending on manufacturing process, they may have some excess silicon or carbon, or have a small amount of oxygen. Relative to organic fibers and some ceramic fibers, silicon carbide fibers have high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion. (refs) These properties have made silicon carbide fiber the choice for hot section components in the next generation of gas turbines, e.g. the LEAP engine from GE (General Electric). There are several manufacturing approaches to making silicon carbide fibers. The one with the longest historical experience, invented in 1975 and called the Yajima process, uses a pre-ceramic liquid polymer that is injected through a spinneret to produce solidified green (unfired) fibers that go through a series of processing steps, including significant time in high temperature furnaces to convert the polymer to the desired SiC chemistry. These fibers are typically smaller than 20 microns in diameter and supplied as twisted tows containing 300+ fibers. Several companies employ some variation of this technique, including Nippon Carbon (Japan), Ube Industries (Japan), and the NGS consortium (USA). A second approach utilizes chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to form silicon carbide on a central core of a dissimilar material as the core traverses a high temperature reactor. Developed by Textron (now Specialty Materials Inc located in Massachusetts) over 40 years ago, the silicon carbide deposit resulting from the gas-phase CVD reaction builds up on a carbon core with a columnar microstructure. The fiber, sold as the SCS product family, is relatively large in diameter, measuring from approximately 80 to 140 microns. Laser-driven CVD (LCVD) is a related approach using multiple laser beams as the energy source to incite the gas phase reaction, with the significant difference that the fibers are grown as-formed and not on any core structure,,. The LCVD fibers are fabricated in a parallel array as each laser beam corresponds to a deposited fiber, with growth rates ranging from 100 microns to over 1 millimeter per second and fiber diameters ranging from 20 to 80 microns. Free Form Fibers, based in upstate New York, has developed the LCVD technology for the past 10 years.

It is considered as one of Bellini's first mature works, though there are doubts on its dating and on who commissioned it. The work's technique is not only an early use of oils but also of blue smalt, a by-product of the glass industry. It had already been used in the Low Countries in Bouts' 1455 The Entombment, but this marked smalt's first use in Italian art, twenty years before Leonardo da Vinci used it in Ludovico il Moro's apartments in Milan in 1492. Bellini also uses the more traditional lapis lazuli and azurite for other blues in the work. Mauro Lucco, Giovanni Carlo Federico Villa, Giovanni Bellini, Silvana Editoriale, Milano 2008. It was originally located in San Francesco church in Pesaro in Marche, when that church was suppressed under the French occupation in 1797. The altarpiece was initially moved to the city council and after various issues it was entrusted to the city's art museum, where it still hangs. Pierluigi De Vecchi ed Elda Cerchiari, I tempi dell'arte, volume 2, Bompiani, Milano 1999. Dating No documents survive to date the altarpiece definitively. Oils only became popular in Venice after the arrival of Antonello da Messina in 1475, so it is unlikely to have been produced before that date. In his will in 1476 the painter Giovanni Pizzimegli offered to make a payment to help meet the cost of a high altarpiece for the church of San Francesco, but does not specify if the work was planned, in progress or complete, meaning it cannot definitely be identified with the Pala of Pesaro. The oldest theories by Roger Fry, Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle and Frizzone date it to around 1481, whereas in 1914, the critic Roberto Longhi initially dated it to 1465‚Äì1470; and then in a re-analysis performed in 1927, dated it to 1475. Most critics agreed with Longhi until Pallucchini (1959) and Meiss (1963) proposed 1470‚Äì1471, based on comparisons with the altarpiece's central scene of the Coronation of the Virgin with the Enthroned Madonna with Saints by Marco Zoppo (now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin). The work shows a number of forts, such as the one held by saint Terence of Pesaro on the predella, which Everett Fahy identified as Fortezza Costanza, planned by Francesco Laurana for the Sforza at Pesaro in 1474 and completed in 1479, although its final appearance had already been publicized on a medal by Gianfrancesco Enzola dated to 1475. The similarity is not precise enough to prove this hypothetical dating. In 1909 Vaccia stated that the fortress in the background of the Coronation scene was based on Rocca di Gradara, captured from Pesaro by Rimini in 1463, which would make the altarpiece a celebration of the capture itself or of an anniversary of it. More recent studies by Battisti and Castelli have suggested the 1480s, linking the work's iconology to political events such as Camilla d'Aragona's regency from 1483 onwards or religious disputes of the period, such as those between the Franciscans and Dominicans. Another theory links the work to the marriage celebrations between Costanzo I Sforza and Camilla d'Aragona in 1474. Components=Coronation of the Virgin= Coronation of the Virgin The main central panel shows the coronation of the Virgin, unusually shown on earth rather than in heaven. To the left are Saint Peter and Saint Paul and to the right are Saint Jerome and Saint Francis. Mary and Christ sit on a marble throne whose open back reveals a realistic rocky landscape, surrounded by a border that is identical to the original gilded intaglio frame for the work. In the upper centre is the dove of the Holy Spirit, with cherubim and seraphim to its left and right. The floor is set with marble inlays, which emphasise the perspective and balance of the composition. Bellini combines lessons drawn from his brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna with clear light and a synthesis between architecture, figures and landscape drawn from Piero della Francesca and the oil technique of Antonello da Messina, both of whose work he may have seen on a possible trip to the Marche, his mother's homeland. =Pilasters= The cornice is held up by two pilasters, each 61 cm by 25 cm and each with a single deep perspective. The left hand one shows the saints Catherine of Alexandria, Lawrence, Anthony of Padua and John the Baptist, whilst the right hand one shows blessed Michelina, Bernardino of Siena, Louis of Toulouse and Andrew. Many of these saints were promoted by the Franciscans around this time. =Predella= Saint Terence Below the work is a predella showing a central nativity scene. To its left are scenes of St George and the dragon, Conversion of St Paul and Crucifixion of St Peter, whilst to its right are St Jerome in the Desert, St Francis Receiving the Stigmata and Saint Terence. These scenes were carefully chosen - for example, Francis was the church's patron and was also linked to the Sforza via the Franciscan order, George was linked to the Sforza court as a 'holy knight' and saint Terence (shown as a Roman soldier) was Pesaro's patron saint. Placing St George and St Terence in the prime positions at far left and far right, usually used for coats of arms, probably underlined the Sforza family's military and civic power. Behind St Terence is an ancient Roman bust above an inscription praising Augustus and comparing him favourably with the Duke. =Pieta= Piet√† The work was previously topped by a 106 cm by 84 cm Pieta, which breaks away from previous treatments of the theme, not showing Christ's body frontally but resting on the edge of the tomb. A servant holds Christ up from behind, whilst Nicodemus hands a jar of ointment to a kneeling Mary Magdalene, who holds Christ's hand. The pieta was separated from the main painting in 1797 and taken to Paris, recovered in 1815 by Antonio Canova and taken to Rome. There it was allocated to the Pinacoteca Vaticana, where it still hangs. This Pieta was attributed to several other artists, from Bartolomeo Montagna to Giovanni Buonconsiglio, before it was finally attributed to Andrea Mantegna. Writing in 1913, Frizzoni recognised it as the upper part of the Pesaro Altarpiece, which was then topped instead by a painting of St. Jerome. This is now the consensus view, though Ileana Chiappini argues the two works have different focal points and so were created separately and only joined together later. =Frame= This refers to Venetian funerary monuments of the same era, such as doge Pasquale Malipiero's monument (designed by Pietro Lombardo for Santi Giovanni e Paolo) and Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece. Bellini further developed his use of the frame as an integral part of the painting in later works such as the San Giobbe Altarpiece and the Frari Triptych.

The reserve first opened in August 2007, part of the same project as La Vanille Reserve in Mauritius. It is named after the 18th century Huguenot settler Fran√ßois Leguat, who recorded much of the island's natural flora and fauna before it went extinct. The reserve includes a museum, several education centres and information areas, and a restaurant.Francois Leguat Reserve website Description=The Fauna= Drawing of a moving herd of Cylindraspis vosmaeri on Rodrigues An introduced Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) at Francois Leguat Reserve Introduced Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) at Francois Leguat Reserve Rodrigues was once home to two unique and endemic species of giant tortoise: the tall- standing, long-necked, saddle-backed Cylindraspis vosmaeri that browsed the trees and bushes; and the smaller, low, dome-shelled Cylindraspis peltastes that grazed grasses and ground vegetation. At the time of the arrival of human settlers, dense tortoise herds of many thousands were reported on Rodrigues. Typically for isolated island species, they were reported to have been friendly and unafraid of humans.Leguat de la Foug√®re, Fran√ßois (1707-8). Voyage et avantures de Fran√ßois Leguat & de ses compagnons en deux √Æles d√©serte des Indes Orientales. Amsterdam: J.J. de Lorme. 2 vols. (in French). By early accounts, the tall Cylindraspis vosmaeri in particular was a social animal that lived and interacted in herds, and showed no fear of humans. In the ensuing years, sailors and settlers slaughtered the tortoises in enormous numbers. Occasional individual tortoises are recorded as being found surviving in isolated valleys of the island until as late as 1802. They do not seem to have survived the ensuing period though, when settlers used vast fires to clear the entire island of vegetation, to access it for agriculture.Cheke A, Hume J (2008). Lost Land of the Dodo: An Ecological History of Mauritius, R√©union & Rodrigues. London: T & AD Poyser. The tortoises however, played a crucial role in the health of the island's indigenous vegetation and ecosystems. Their movements and grazing rejuvenated the vegetation and the seeds of many plants needed the tortoises for dispersal and germination. For this reason, nearly two hundred years after the extinction of their endemic predecessors, the reserve introduced 500 Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and 40 Radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata). This is in order to play the role of the original species, in ensuring the health of the natural vegetation. Currently the population of these introduced tortoises has risen to 2000. Other animals include the Rodrigues Fruit Bat (Pteropus rodricensis), the rarest bat in the world and one of only three endemic animals to survive in Rodrigues (the other two are birds). In 1970, only 70 of these bats remained, but extreme conservation efforts have now helped the species recover. =The Flora= Polyscias rodriguesiana The reserve conserves a portion of Rodrigues island's almost extinct coastal flora. Along with Anse Quitor Nature Reserve next door, it is the only remaining patch of this ecosystem. The vegetation is being restored and over 100,000 plants from 33 indigenous and endemic species have been planted. The giant tortoises perform an important role - once played by Rodrigues extinct giant tortoise species - of rejuvenating and maintaining the ecosystem, through their grazing and movements.http://www.journalmcd.com/index.php/mcd/article/view/277https://www.bradtguides.com/destinations/africa/mauritius/rodrigues-20/francois- leguat-giant-tortoise-and-cave-reserve.html =The Caves= The cave system in the reserve includes the Grande-Caverne (500 meters long) and the Caverne-de- la-Vierge (255 meters), along with others that are closed or not yet rehabilitated.

Halictidae Insects described in 1915 ","title":"Augochlorella pomoniella"},{"id":"56495828","text":"Augochlorella is a genus in the bee family Halictidae, commonly called sweat bees. They display metallic coloration, ranging from reddish to gold to bluish green, as is typical for other genera in the tribe Augochlorini.  Identification and appearance  Augochlorella are very small sweat bees that are easily confused with the related genus Augochlora but differentiated by the pointed tip of the marginal cell (squared off in Augochlora), an orthogonal epistomal sulcus, and no strong basal lobe on the inner metatibial spur.. These features can only be viewed under a microscope. Augochlorella aurata Augochlorella pomoniella Origin and distribution The tribe Augochlorini is distributed between northern Argentina to southern Canada, but mostly concentrated to the tropics of the Americas. They are the most abundant bees in the Neotropical fauna. Only a few species of Augochlorella reach the temperate Nearctic region. Augochlorella striata occurs further north than any other member of the tribe. Sexual dimorphism Both sexes of Augochlorella have an average length of , but males are more slender than females, and have relatively longer antennae.  Sociality  Augochlorella bees are often eusocial, unlike many other Augochlorini, which are typically either solitary or semisocial. An example of sociality in this genus is Augochlorella aurata which contains a mixture of solitary and social nest foundresses. These fertile colony-establishing females produce an initial brood of 1-2 worker bees, which are female, before switching to a male-biased brood, while others produce males first. Female-biased broods can also occur in both solitary and eusocial nests, but that is less common. In this and other eusocial species, workers are mostly sterile and slightly smaller than their mothers. Augochlorella aurata tends to be solitary at high altitudes and latitudes. It‚Äôs also more often solitary in environments where the growing season is shorter, but if the growing season is longer then the species tends to be social. This tendency to base their sociality on the growing season can also be found in other bee species as well as in some species of spiders. A maritime Canadian climate can lead to reduced duration of brood production, fewer workers per nest, and fewer reproductive bees. Additionally, nest foundresses may produce a mixture of workers and reproductively-capable bees based on these conditions.  Nesting  Augochlorella nests can be found in fields as well as wooded locations; well-drained areas, in a wide variety of habitats. The ground is usually flat or sloped and mostly bare. The nests are underground, and the bees create a cavity with a cluster of cells made of soil. There are many ways that bees construct their nests, but usually they excavate the cavity first and then create brood cells within that cavity. The cluster of cells is supported by additional pillars of soil. The burrow tends to be vertical and it can be anywhere from 5 to 25cm deep; the depth of the burrow depends on how moist the soil is. In part of its range, the species Augochlorella aurata is active from the start of April until the end of September. Females construct pollen balls, the sole food source for the offspring, starting the second week of May until the middle of August, and workers start expanding the nests in mid June. Queens start making their nests in the middle of April, and usually finish up around the first week of May. The number of cells the bees manage to make varies according to how many worker bees are present in the nest, but usually it is around three cells per female. After they lay the first set of eggs, there is a two week period of inactivity, and then another set is laid. The mean number of brood cells within the nests increases gradually during the summer, reaching a maximum of 12. Only a few cells are used twice and the number of offspring produced per nest average between 14 and 15, which shows that brood cells are not reused often. Augochlorella aurata and Augochlorella persimilis can sometimes occur together in mixed aggregations.  Ecological and economic importance  The genus Augochlorella consists of generalist pollinators, and visit plants such as Apocynum cannabinum, Erigeron strigosus, Pycnanthemum tenuifolium, Solidago odora, and Euthamia graminifolia. Augochlorella aurata is found in Rockefeller State Park Preserve in New York City where they can be seen pollinating dogbane, fleabane, mountain mint, wild roses, and goldenrod. Wild bees can be important pollinators in cities like New York and keep gardens and parks healthy. Augochlorella aurata is also an important pollinator for many wildflowers and crops, including stone fruits, pome fruits, alfalfa, sunflower, pepper, strawberry, tomato and watermelon plants, making this species very valuable for commercial fruit and vegetable farming. In general, sweat bee populations will increase in an area if there are wildflowers and nesting areas available for them.  Parasites  The family Halictidae contains a few social parasites and cleptoparasitic bee genera, and these parasites affect the genus Augochlorella as well. Some prominent cleptoparasites include Sphecodes (like Sphecodes pimpinellae), Microsphecodes, and some Lasioglossum species. Sphecodes females will typically kill the existing Augochlorella egg or larva in the cell before they lay their own egg. In most other cleptoparasitic species, eggs are laid on the unfinished cell walls or through sealed cells where the cleptoparasite larva will kill the existing egg or larva and eat the host's stored food. Mite associations with Augochlorella include Laelaspoides ordwayae, which are kleptoparasites that feed on pollen stored in brood cells. Although Laelospoides usually do not harm the developing bee directly, the bee is harmed since there is less food available for it to consume.  Predators  Augochlorella has many general predators including birds, asilid flies, and spiders.  Flight  The typical flight distance for Augochlorella aurata is 66-230 yd. (60-210 m).

The game is inspired by the Japanese tokusatsu shows Space Sheriff Gavan and Space Sheriff Sharivan. It was later ported to Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is included in the Arcade Archives series for PlayStation 4. The game has a sequel on Super Nintendo Entertainment System, called \\"Cosmo Police Galivan II: Arrow of Justice\\".  Gameplay  In the game, the player takes the role of the last remaining member of the Cosmo Police, who runs and jumps around a multi- directional scrolling environment on planet Cynep, with caves, baroque rooms and underwater zones, destroying or avoiding waves of constantly attacking robots, aliens and alien ships. The player starts the game as an unarmed human, whose only attacking options are kicking and punching, but picking up a POW item encases the human in a robotic suit and arms the player with a laser gun. Collecting the blue POW items while in the suit awards the player with a powerful beam weapon for a limited time, while the red POW item gives the player a three-shot cannon. POW items are dotted throughout the levels and can also be gained by shooting the blue robot aliens. The player's character has an energy bar that decreases whenever the player is hit. Should this fall below the halfway point, the robot suit will be lost and the player will once again be an unarmed human. Collecting a POW item while in human form will restore the player's energy. If a POW is collected while wearing the suit, however, the player's energy will NOT be increased but their weapon will receive a power-up. The game's platforms are littered with springboards that fire the player high into the air when stepped on. Some platforms - often containing POW items - can only be reached via a springboard. At the end of every level, the player has to defeat a boss. The game only features two levels which, when completed, repeat endlessly.

Street workers make up the bulk of Fiji's prostitutes. Many of the prostitutes are Asian, especially Chinese that provide sexual services for the growing number of tourists arriving in the country and also locals. Some come into the country on student visas. In 2014, it was estimated that there were 857 sex workers in Fiji. Even though buying and selling sex in public is illegal in Fiji, police have no legal authority to arrest prostitutes without an official report being lodged for the police to take action. Child trafficking is a problem and many foundations are urging Fiji to crack down on child trafficking. Legislation The Crimes Decree 2009 sets out the legislation regarding sex work and replaces the provisions of the earlier Penal Code. The Decree criminalises the following aspects of prostitution: * Section 217 - Procuring for prostitution * Section 230 - Knowingly living on the earnings of prostitution * Section 231 - Soliciting for immoral purposes, seeking or buying sex in a public place * Section 233 - Brothel keeping * Section 233 - Anti-trafficking provisions Law enforcement Since new legislation was introduced in 2009, there has been increased enforcement, especially towards transgender sex workers, street workers and their clients. Sex workers report that in 2011 they were rounded up by the military and suffered humiliation and abuse and were subjected to forced labour. During police crackdowns sex workers are subjected to assault, theft and rape. Police are allegedly open to bribes. Sex trafficking Fiji is a source, destination, and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Family members, taxi drivers, foreign tourists, businessmen, and crew on foreign fishing vessels have allegedly exploited Fijian children in sex trafficking. Some Fijian children are at risk of trafficking as families follow a traditional practice of sending them to live with relatives or families in larger cities, where they may be subjected to coerced to engage in sexual activity in exchange for food, clothing, shelter, or school fees. Women from China, Thailand, Malaysia, and other East Asian countries are deceptively recruited by the lure of legitimate jobs in their home countries or while visiting Fiji, sometimes by Chinese criminal organisations, and then exploited in illegal brothels (posing as massage parlors and spas), local hotels and private homes.

Gianfrancesco was trained in his father's studio and by the goldsmith Alessandro da Parma and his son Pietro da Parma, who were active in work for Padua's Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua. His first phase lasted from around 1455 to around 1471. It was marked by early attempts to move from casting to minting to produce medals. He and the Venetian Vittore Gambello spearheaded this development. Enzola's early medals are rudimentary, cutting straight into the metal of the small 4 cm diameter negative-matrices from which they would be struck, similar to those already used for coins. This phase included his series for count Pier Maria II de' Rossi and his mistress Bianca Pellegrini, medals for Francesco Sforza and single medals for Cecco Ordelaffi, lord of Forl√¨ (1457) and Taddeo Manfredi, lord of Faenza (1461). They were inspired by the tradition established by Pisanello, showing humanist profile portraits on the recto and a related heraldic or allegoriccal scene on the verso. Their relief was usually very crushed and slightly unclear. Biographical dictionary entry From 1472 to 1473 he was master of the mint at Ferrara. He was not confident in producing medals using coining and so abandoned it in favour of casting. This improved the quality of his medals and increased their level of relief. This second phase from around 1474 to around 1478 included his series for Costanzo I Sforza (1474, 1475, 1478 and other undated examples), considered to be his masterpieces. He also produced several small plaques, a signed seal design for the city of Parma and other unsigned seal designs. His career culminated with a 9.28 cm diameter medal of the condottiero Federico da Montefeltro, known via a two-sided reproduction on the small leather tondoes in the Biblioteca apostolica vaticana.cod.

Biography=Early years= Profittlich was born of a peasant farmer's couple: Markus Profittlich (1846-1920) and Dorothea Seiwert (1850-1913), the eighth of ten children, on 11 September 1890 in Birresdorf, German Empire. After finishing the elementary school in Leimersdorf, he was prepared in 1904 by a local parish priest to take up further education in Ahrweiler. From there, he moved to the school in Linz am Rhein at Easter 1909, graduating here from high school in 1912 and receiving a secondary school certificate and attended the seminary of Trier. His parents wanted him to become a diocesan priest to help them in emergency situations, but on 11 April 1913 he entered the Society of Jesus in 's-Heerenberg, Netherlands, where the German Jesuits settled as a result of their expulsion caused by the politics of the Kulturkampf of Bismarck. His older brother Peter (1878-1915) died as a missionary in Brazil. and Profittlich also wanted to become a Catholic priest. Eduard continued his studies in exile at the scholasticate of Valkenburg aan de Geul, Netherlands, after 20 September 1914. During the First World War he served as a nurse and surgical assistant from 1916 to 1918 in the Imperial Army. On 4 January 1916, Profittlich finally received the tonsure and consecration to subdeacon, in the Cathedral of Trier by Heinrich D√∂ring, SJ, (1859-1951), bishop of Poona, =Priest= Eduard Profittlich resumed his philosophical and theological studies in Valkenburg after the war and was there ordained deacon on 26 March 1922 by the Archbishop of Cologne Cardinal Karl Joseph Schulte (1871-1941). On 27 August 1922 Profittlich was ordained priest by Lorenz Schrijnen, bishop of Roermond, and on 30 August 1922 celebrated in his home parish church of St. Stephen in Leimersdorf his first Mass. Profittlich entered the new Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, founded in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, with the intention of preparing for clandestine missionary work in Russia. In 1923 he became a doctor in philosophy and in 1924 doctor in theology at the Jagiellonian University of Krak√≥w. From September 1924 to June 1925 he was a missionary in Czechowice-Dziedzice, Poland, and from August 1925 to Match 1928 in Opole, a German city with many Poles; from 9 March 1928 to 1930 he was parish priest in the Polish parish of Saint Ansgar in Hamburg, and after 11 December 1930 parish priest at St Peter and St Paul in Tallinn, appointed by the apostolic administrator of Estonia, Archbishop Antonio Zecchini, SJ, after his profession of perpetual vows on 2 February 1930. =Apostolic Administrator and bishop= On 11 May 1931 Profittlich was appointed Apostolic Administrator of largely Polish Estonia, due to his good knowledge of Polish and Polish affairs. On 28 September 1933, Pope Pius XI appointed him in exchange for his services as a protonotary apostolic in a private audience at the Vatican. The problems of the Catholic Church in Estonia were the small number of believers, their multilingualism and dispersion. As new administrator he quickly developed a pastoral plan. His sermons were particularly popular, attracting also those of other faiths. He began publishing the country's first church weekly magazine Kiriku Elu (The Life of the Church), which was read especially by the Estonian intelligentsia. The number of the faithful grew steadily and new parishes were established in: Narva, P√§rnu, Rakvere, Petseri, Valga and Kivi√µli. In 1934, they were supported by ten Catholic priests and Polish and Czech religious sisters. He gave special emphasis to the religious upbringing of the youth, in four schools and published in seven languages. Profittlich was a recognized preacher and a bishop. He began to address the issue of Estonian-language literature on the subject of religion. He tried to change the image of the Catholic Church as a \\"Polish church\\", and be more open and closer to Estonians. In 1935, he requested and received Estonian citizenship.[Komarov A., Tokareva E. Catholic Church and the formation of national identity in Estonia in the interwar period (according to documents of Vatican archives) // State, religion, Church in Russia and abroad. 2014. - No. 4 (32). - P. 151 - 152] After the signing of the treaty between the Vatican and Estonia in 1935, under which the legal status of the apostolic administration in Estonia was confirmed, on 27 November 1936 he was named titular archbishop of Adrianople and on 27 December 1936 consecrated archbishop at the parish church of St Peter and St Paul in Tallinn, while remaining an apostolic administrator. Profittlich was the first Catholic bishop in Estonia after the passage of Estonian territories to Sweden in the 17th century. With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, he remained in Tallinn even after the Soviet occupation of Estonia in June 1940, and went to the German embassy in Tallinn three times to obtain exit visas for certain Catholic priests and sisters and Baltic Germans imprisoned by the Soviets. However, the church's situation had deteriorated, with priest and faithful persecuted by the communists. He described the whole situation in a letter to the Pope. At that time, the German embassy in Tallinn insisted that he take German citizenship again and renounce his Estonian citizenship, but he refused. =Arrest and death= On 27 June 1941, a few days after the Third Reich attack on the USSR, Profittlich was arrested by eight NKVD agents and transferred to prison in Kirov, Russia, for anti-Soviet agitation and assistance to Catholic ecclesiastics abroad. He was repeatedly interrogated and on 14 October 1941 a bill of indictment was prepared in Kirov, in which he was accused of carrying out anti-Soviet agitation by using the religious feelings of the masses to incite hatred for the USSR and the Communist Party. In addition, he was accused of espionage in favor of the Third Reich, proven by his visit to the embassy in Tallinn. After the next interrogations, on 17 October 17, he was confronted with further evidence of anti-Soviet talks with his fellow prisoner. He always maintained his innocence. The trial began on 25 October 1941, and he was found guilty. His appeal to the Supreme Court of the USSR was rejected. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and work in the labor camp in Kirov, but on 21 November of the same year he was sentenced to death by shooting, for anti-Soviet activities and espionage for Germany. On 22 February 1942 he died in Kirov prison before the sentence was executed. =Profittlich's faith witness= Bishop Profittlich was ready to accept the martyrdom for the faith. In a letter to relatives and acquaintances on 8 February 1941, he wrote that the shepherd's place is with the flock where he shares the joy and suffering. He wrote that it is a great pleasure to experience the presence of God to whom we have given everything and that he is ready to give God his life for all: \\"My life ‚Äì and, if necessary, my death ‚Äì is life and death for Christ.\\" =The Mystery of the Archbishop's Death= For 50 years after his arrest the future of the Archbishop was unknown. It was suspected that he was imprisoned in Ufa and later in Kazan. Even searching for members of his family did not bring anything new to the matter. A breakthrough came on 30 March 1990, when Estonia regained its independence. On 12 June 1990 the Supreme Court informed the Catholic Church about the fate of the Archbishop and the court has completely rehabilitated the clergy post mortem, and declared him innocent of the alleged crimes. Archives were also opened, in which documents of the Archbishop's case were kept. =Process of holiness= His honor is named on the premises of the Tartu Catholic Education Center, and a memorial plaque (open on 11 September 1990) has been placed in the St Peter and St Paul Roman Catholic Church in Tallinn. The Bishops' Conference of the Russian Federation initiated on 30 January 2002 the beatification process of Archbishop Eduard Profittlich (along with 15 lay people, priests and bishops). After the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the \\"nihil obstat\\" under the title \\"Causa Beatificationis seu Declarationis Martyrii Servorum Dei Eduardi Profittlich Archiepiscopi titularis Hadrianopolitani in Haemimonto Administratoris Apostolici Estoniensis, ex Societate Iesu et XV Sociorum\\", on 30 May 2003 an ecclesiastical procedure was opened in Saint Petersburg for Eduard Profittlich's beatification.

She was built by William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde for the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). When the LMS was nationalised in 1948 she passed to the British Transport Commission and onward to British Rail in 1962. She was sold to Lefkosia Compania Naviera, Panama in 1965. Renamed Venus she was for service in Greek waters. It is understood she saw use as an accommodation ship in Burmeister & Wain, Copenhagen. Construction As well as having mechanical stokers and all deck machinery mechanically driven she was the first British ship to have a fire protection automatic sprinkler system. As built she had places for 80 cattle and was on occasion referred to as a cattle boat. Service=Pre-war service= The LMS ordered Princess Maud and she was completed by William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton in 1934. She was a development from the slightly smaller from the same builders, in 1931. Both ships worked the Stranraer - Larne crossing in the 1930s. =Second World War service= In the Second World War, Princess Maud served as a troop ship and initially operated the Dover‚ÄîBoulogne route to France from January 1940. Princess Maud assisted in Dunkirk evacuation but was shelled in the engine room, taking fatalities on 30 May 1940. On 4 June 1940, following repairs, she was able to return to the evacuation, rescuing 1270 in a single trip, being the penultimate ship away from Dunkirk. She subsequently assisted the evacuation of British and French troops from Veules-les-Roses around 12 June 1940, at the time of the surrender of the 51st Highland Division at Saint- Valery-en-Caux, a few miles to the west, transporting 600 British and French troops of the 2,280 rescued. She then reverted to serving on the Stranraer- Larne route on behalf of the Admiralty until, in 1943, when she received modifications for D-Day landing operations to turn her into an infantry assault trip capable of launching six Landing Craft Assault (LCA) boats via hand hoists. For the D-Day landings, she was attached to the US Task Force Operation Neptune Force O at Omaha beach. For the remainder of 1944 and into 1945, she worked various cross-channel routes well past the end of the war in Europe. =Post-war Service= Following a refurbishment after the second world war including a conversion to oil burning she resumed on the Stranraer ‚Äì Larne route on 1 August 1946. The following year saw her reallocated to the Holyhead ‚Äî D√∫n Laoghaire route when the TSS Hibernia and TSS Cambria were laid up due to coal shortages. With the coming of the MV Cambria and MV Hibernia to the route in 1949 she became the relief ship also covering other routes on the Irish Sea. She had a brief return to the English channel on Southampton Guernsey St Malo for a couple of months in 1951 before returning to Anglesey. By 1963 a British Transport Commission indicated Princess Maud was becoming increasing costly to maintain and passengers were known to avoid travelling on her, she was therefore marked for disposal with an estimated credit of ¬£32,000. =Mediterranean= In 1966 she was sold to Lefkosia Compania Naviera, Panama and underwent a refit emerging painted white with a new name Venus with widened doors for loading cars. She was operated by Cyprus Sea Cruises of Limassol serving in Mediterranean waters until 1969. Her route included the ports of Brindisi, Ancona, Piraeus, Limassol and Haifa. =Accommodation Ship= Her final service was as a static accommodation ship known as the Nybo in the Burmeister & Wain shipyard, Copenhagen from 1969. Fate In 1973 she was taken to Bilbao, Spain and scrapped. Miscellaneous An earlier ship of the same name, the SS Princess Maud (1902), operated ferry routes in Scotland. It was torpedoed and sunk on 10 June 1918 by a U-Boat. The Southend Motor Navigation Company Company operated four craft named Princess Maud overlapping the lifespan of the TSS Princess Maud, one was lost at Dunkirk in 1940.

(BBC). Biography Boveri's ancestors originally came from Savoy and settled at the beginning of the 17th century in Iphofen, Lower Franconia. By 1835 they were in Bamberg. Walter was born in 1865 as the third of four sons of the doctor Theodor Boveri. The second oldest son Theodor Boveri junior became a well-known biologist. As a 17-year-old Walter Boveri joined the Royal Engineering School in Nuremberg. He finished this in 1885 and then moved to Switzerland. There he was first volunteer and later assembly manager for electrical systems at Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon (MFO). In 1887, Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown, technical director of MFO, envisaged setting up his own business. Boveri teamed up with him and started looking for investors, but remained unsuccessful for several years. In 1891 Boveri married Victoire Baumann. Before the marriage, he received a generous loan from his future father-in-law, the Zurich silk industrialist Conrad Baumann. Brown and Boveri signed an association agreement in December 1890, and three months later they chose Baden as the company location. The founding of Brown, Boveri & Cie. (BBC) took place on 2 October 1891. Two years later, Boveri received Swiss citizenship. In 1895 he had the Villa Boveri built for himself and his family. Brown took care of the company's technical affairs, while Boveri, though technically gifted, took on the role of visionary commercial director. He was assisted by his cousin Fritz Funk, whom he had taken on as a limited partner in the company. Boveri was responsible for growing BBC into a large international company. In connection with the construction of the Ruppoldingen hydro-electric plant near Rothrist, Boveri founded the power company Olten- Aarburg AG in 1894, which became Aare Tessin AG in 1936. He decided that another company was needed for the planning, financing and construction of power plants so, in 1895, he founded Motor AG which later became Motor- Columbus.http://www.alpiq.it/images/mc_chronicle_tcm61-48606_tcm102-54340.pdf After Brown retired to private life Boveri was, from 1911 to 1924, Chairman of BBC. He presided over various electricity companies and, during World War I, the Soci√©t√© Suisse de Surveillance Economique. His work on railway electrification earned him a place on the board of Swiss Federal Railways. As president of various municipal commissions, he was also active in Baden's local politics.http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D29605.php Boveri's sons Theodor and Walter junior later worked in various roles within the company. His brother Robert (1873-1934) led the subsidiary, BBC Mannheim, for several years until his death. His son William Boveri was employed there until the 1970s as a director.

In 1448 he defeated the Venetians in a river battle on the Po at Casalmaggiore. In 1471 he was sent by Sforza as ambassador to the court of Pope Sixtus IV in Rome. After the death of Duke Francesco Sforza, Pier Maria Rossi was one of the triumvirate who in fact governed the duchy on behalf of the then underage Gian Galeazzo Sforza. However, when the latter was ousted by his uncle, Ludovico Sforza, the fortunes of the Rossi family started to crumble. In 1482 an alliance of Milanese troops with those of the rival Sanvitale, Pallavicino and Da Correggio families, led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, besieged the Rocca dei Rossi at San Secondo. Pier Maria resisted gallantly but, after the Milanese started to storm all his other fortresses, surrendered and retired to the Castle of Torrechiara, which he had built for his long-time great love, Bianca Pellegrini.

The temples are located near sea, about eleven miles east of Dwarka. History These temples are built between 7th and 10th century. The Phamsana style temples belongs to middle of 8th century, built during the reign of Saindhavas. Large number of sculptures and Saindhava coins, for the first time, were found during the excavations in 1965. The monuments are associated with Durvasa Rishi by locals and called Durvasa Rishi Ashram. The site is inscribed as the Monument of National Importance (N-GJ-121) and is maintained by Vadodara Circle of the Archeological Survey of India. Architecture left There are five temples and a long pillared mandapa within an enclosure. Temple No. 1 (old shrine/Sun Temple/Dhyan Mandir) is built in neo-Dravidic Phamsana type, according to the classification by M. A. Dhaky and J. M. Nanavati. It has square cella and plain walls on which rises a five tiered superstructure from a vimana-vedika base. These tiers has chandrashala engravings in decreasing numbers from five to two while the topmost tier is lost and there is karnakutas at the corners. The temple has lost its mandapa. The temple may have been constructed in sandhara layout. If true, it seems that the exterior walls were disappeared long ago. This temple is east facing. Temples No. 2 and 3 are both of phamsana type, of penthouse variety. These temples show the early Maha-Gurjara architectural influence. These temples are west facing. Temple No. 2 has a Nagara ground plan and an open porch with short pillars on dado. The dado, on its east side of the temple, has pillar-motif and niches, similar to the Gop Temple. The roof has only its lowermost course surviving and there is a row of dentils below it. Above the plain door-frame of this temple, there is a panel depicting the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. The faces of the demons in this panel has similarities with the panel found on the parapet of the Sun temple at Akhodar. Temple No. 3 is a square in plan and is smaller in size. It had a superstructure similar to the Temple No. 2. Temple No. 4 is also similar to it but is east facing. These two temple has open porch with short pillars on dado. The west facing Temple No. 5 is a square cella with plain walls crowned by multi-tiered phamsana type superstructure. In 2007, the remnants of the submerged temple complex were found north of the existing temple complex. The temple has only its jagati (plinth) surviving which suggest the temple was east facing. They also found the yoni of Shivalinga suggesting that they were Shiva temples. The temple complex may have submerged due to rise in sea level and seismic activity.

Johnson, based on characters created by Pat Mills and Tony Skinner. The film stars Scott Adkins, Ashley Greene, Ray Stevenson, Michael Jai White and Ray Park. The film was released on 6 February 2018 in the United States and on 16 April 2018 in the United Kingdom. The film was released to positive reviews, with critics praising the action and Adkins' performance. Plot Mike Fallon is an assassin who specializes in disguising his kills as accidents. He is a regular at an assassins‚Äô pub called the Oasis, where a retired Big Ray is the bartender. Fellow regulars include Carnage Cliff, who kills his victims with an axe; Poison Pete; Mic and Mac, military veterans; Finnicky Fred, who invents and sells unorthodox weapons; and Jane the Ripper, an expert swordswoman. After killing an accountant named Archie Rudd, Mike gets a call from Milton, who assigns the assassins their missions. Milton asks Mike to pick up his payment for the kill in an alleyway, but there Mike is attacked by an amateur assassin, whom he kills easily. Mike accuses Milton of setting him up, but Milton denies this. Mike learns that his ex-girlfriend Beth has been murdered in a botched burglary, and that she was pregnant with his baby. Hearing that the alleged perpetrators had OD'd immediately afterwards, he becomes suspicious. He steals the police report and deduces that Mic and Mac were responsible, as they specialize in disguising assassinations as random street crimes. Mike accuses Mick and Mac, and they confess to killing Beth but deny knowledge of their client‚Äôs identity. Enraged, Mike fights and defeats them both, and Big Ray reminds Mike never to get emotionally involved in his line of work. Mike goes to Beth‚Äôs apartment and asks her girlfriend Charlie whether Beth‚Äôs environmentalist activities made her enemies. They argue until Cliff breaks in and attacks Charlie. Mike inadvertently kills Cliff, tracks down Milton, and tortures him to reveal who ordered the hit on Beth: a man named Leonard Kent. Big Ray reluctantly orders a hit on Mike for killing Cliff. Years earlier, 15-year-old Mike worked as a paperboy and was bullied every day on his route. While hiding from his bullies, he noticed a man mysteriously walking away from a house that then explodes. After recording and spying on him for weeks, Mike confronts the man and blackmails him to teach him to be an assassin. Big Ray takes him on as an apprentice and has him kill the leader of the bullies as his first kill. Ray then has photographs incriminating Mike in the murder, and warns to never betray him. Ray teaches Mike what he needs to be a professional assassin and becomes a father figure to Mike. Charlie reveals that Beth had collected information on Pankot Petroleum, a corrupt Indian oil company, provided by Archie Rudd. Mike confronts Kent, but Kent turns over a recording of another man ordering him to have Beth killed. Mic and Mac suddenly break in, killing Kent. Mac is killed in friendly fire, and Mike bludgeons Mic with a fire extinguisher. Pete ambushes Mike outside the building, but Mike kills him easily. He spares Fred by knocking him out and goes to the house of Kent‚Äôs employer, oil tycoon Atal Zim. He kills Jane with her own katana, rejects Zim's bribery attempts, and decapitates him. Back at the Oasis, Mike confronts Big Ray and Milton. He plays the rest of Kent‚Äôs recording, revealing that Milton had ordered Mike killed in the alleyway and assigned Mic, Mac, and Cliff to eliminate all loose ends. Enraged, Big Ray assaults Milton, and Mike offers him a Band-Aid that Fred had developed for poisoning. Milton applies it and slowly dies. Big Ray allows Mike to leave but warns him to never return to the Oasis. Mike leaves and vows to protect the city as a vigilante.

The founders of the P.C.(M.L.)B. had broken away from the Communist Party of Belgium of Jacques Grippa (itself a splinter-group of the main Communist Party of Belgium or P.C.B.), as they accused Grippa of having sided with the 'Chinese Khruschtev' Liu Shaoqi.Centre des Archives communistes en Belgique. Le PCB et la scission ¬´grippiste¬ª de 1963 The party was the largest of the splinter groups of Grippa's party. P.C.(M.L.)B. started its own youth and students organizations. The party had around 130-150 members, concentrated in Centre, Borinage and Brussels. Mergers and splits The party was the sole Belgian party to receive recognition from the Communist Party of China. As such it managed to amalgate a number of other factions. In 1968 the Borain Communist Movement merged into P.C.(M.L.)B.. This group had emerged out of a split in the P.C.B. in and held 3 seats in the municipal council. The P√¢turages group was led by Raoul Danhier. A party cadre conference held June 28, 1970 the name of the party was changed to the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Belgium (Parti communiste marxiste-l√©niniste de Belgique, abbreviated P.C.M.L.B.). Fernand Lefebvre was named second secretary of the party. The party was active within the 'Centre de diffusion et de documentation pour le Vietnam' and 'Comit√© national Palestine'. Whilst P.C.M.L.B. called for blank vote in the 1970 municipal election, the party did allow the P√¢turages branch to present a local list. The list won 3 seats in the municipal council. In 1971 Lefebvre was elevated as the sole leader of the party. His exact title varied over the years, from Party Spokesperson, Central Committee Chairman to Central Committee Secretary. In 1972 the 'Red Guard' faction, a spontanist group in Liege that had split away from P.C.(M.L.)B., reunited with the party. This group was led by Mazurkevitch Sarlet, √âdouard Sarlet and Jean Derkenne. In the same year the Communist Party of Belgium (Marxist-Leninist) (P.C.B.(m.-l.) of Arnold Hauwaert began dialogue on unity with P.C.M.L.B.. The two parties merged on June 9, 1973. The publications of the two parties merged, now being published as Clart√© et L'Exploit√©. Nevertheless, former P.C.B.(m.-l.) members broke away in 1976 and founded the Revolutionary Communist Party (P.C.R.). In 1979 the Communist Struggle (Marxist-Leninist) faction merged into P.C.M.L.B.. In January 1979 Clart√© et l'Exploit√© was transformed into the bimonthly La Voix Communiste. Later years By the early 1980s, the party had declined in influence, having merely a few dozen members. The party supported independence for the Wallon and Flemish peoples. In 1982 P.C.M.L.B. contested the municipal election.

Ideology MUP-R was founded with the purpose of bringing together those who feel left-wing and Republican and who disagree with the policies of United Left (IU) after the leadership of Julio Anguita, especially the alliances with the Socialist Party (PSOE). MUP-R criticized the inaction of the IU, supporting a rupture with the socioeconomic regime of the monarchy of Juan Carlos I and considered that unity among the popular classes will lead to the victory of a Popular and Federal Republic of Spain.

MUP continued to be centered in Elche, organizing some social protests, such as those in 2004, which mobilized more than 1,000 people due to the closure of footwear factories. In 2007 the MUP adopted its current name and officially registered as a political party.

A separate hearing, Continental Bank of Canada v Canada [1998] 2 SCR 358, dealt with the related transactions that followed the creation of the partnership. Background Continental Bank, a banking corporation, decided to wrap up its operations in December 1986 by selling its assets and those of its subsidiaries. The buyer, Central Leasing Corp, agreed to purchase most of the leases in one of Continental Bank's fully owned subsidiaries, Continental Bank Leasing Co. Because the assets were depreciable, and Leasing Co would have to pay recaptured Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) on the leases upon selling them, the buyer proposed a partnership arrangement wherein Leasing Co could retain its deductible CCA. In the series of transactions, which occurred over a period of five days during the Christmas holidays, Leasing Co entered into a partnership with some of the buyer's subsidiaries. Leasing Co then transferred the leases to the partnership, using a rollover under section 97(2) of Canada's Income Tax Act, in exchange for a 99% interest in the partnership. Then, Leasing Co transferred its share in the partnership to its parent corporation, Continental Bank, in a tax-free transfer under section 88(1) of the Income Tax Act. At this point, the buyer's subsidiaries held a 1% share, and Continental Bank a 99% share, in a partnership which owned the leases. Continental Bank then sold its share in the partnership to the buyer. As a result, Leasing Co was able to avoid paying its recovered CCA, and the buyer now effectively owned the leases with unchanged tax attributes. Analysis=Definition of \\"Partnership\\"= Justice Bastarache outlines the details of the transactions and discusses the elements of the definition of a \\"partnership\\" in section 2 of the Partnership Act. Bastarache J ultimately dissents on the later issue of Continental Bank's contravention of the Banking Act, but the court unanimously agrees that the initial partnership between Continental Bank Leasing Co and the subsidiaries of Central Leasing Co was valid. In determining that the partnership was valid, the court examines the three essential elements of partnerships in Canada: a partnership is a business, it is carried on in common, and it is carried on with a view to profit. On the first, Bastarache J passes the partnership because it is a trade, occupation, or profession as per section 1(1)(a) of the Partnership Act. The partnership is also deemed to carry on business in common because, as long as management and duties are outlined in the partnership agreement, there are no requirements about the length of a partnership relationship, or that the partnership need expand its business in that time. That is, it sufficed that the partnership carried on a nominal level of business over the Christmas holidays. Last, the court concluded that the pursuit of profit need only be an ancillary purpose to the creation of the partnership. =Dissolution of Partnership for Illegality= The second major issue for the court was the validity of the partnership in light of section 174 of the Banking Act, which prohibits banks from entering into partnership relationships. Because section 34 of the Partnership Act invalidates partnerships where partners are carrying on business illegally, the Minister of National Revenue argued that neither Continental Bank nor its subsidiary could be a partner. On this issue, the majority decision (written by McLachlin CJ) and the dissent (Bastarache J) differed. The majority concluded that this did not affect the validity of the partnership because Continental Bank Leasing was a distinct entity from the bank, and the bank was only an investor in the partnership without directly participating. Dissent Bastarache J differs on the issue of the validity of the partnership under section 34 of the Partnership Act. Because Continental Bank Leasing Co had received a tax benefit by violating a provision of the Banking Act, Bastarche J determined that the partnership was invalid for reasons of public policy.

Early life Me≈üale Tolu was born to second-generation emigrated Turkish parents as the youngest of three siblings in Ulm, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany in 1984. Her father Ali Rƒ±za Tolu is an auto mechanic. She was reared by her grand mother after her mother died in a road accident during a holiday trip to Turkey in 1990. She completed her secondary education with the high school diploma Abitur at the Anna-Essinger-Gymnasium in Ulm. Tolu studied Ethics and Spanish language at the Goethe University Frankfurt for teaching in a gymnasium. In 2007, Tolu acquired German citizenship, and renounced her Turkish citizenship. After she gave birth to her son Serkan in Neu-Ulm end 2014, she moved with her husband Suat √áorlu to Istanbul, Turkey to work as a reporter and translator. However, her permanent residence remained in Neu-Ulm, Bavaria, Germany. Journalist and translator career From 2014 on, Tolu √áorlu worked in Istanbul, Turkey for various media. She was employed by the radio station \\"√ñzg√ºr Radyo\\". The radio station was closed by a governmental decree after the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt. She also worked as a translator for the leftist news agency \\"Etkin Haber Ajansƒ±\\" (ETHA). Arrest in Turkey Around 4:30 local time on May 1, 2017, an anti-terror squad of the Turkish Police forcibly raided the residence of the family √áorlu in Kartal, Istanbul Province. As her husband was already arrested in Ankara on April 5, she was alone at home with her two and half year old son. After her arrest, her residence was searched and devastated. She committed her child to a neighbor's care as she was hauled off by the police. Her brother H√ºseyin went the same day to Istanbul to take care of the child. Later, her father took over the care of the little boy in the residence in Istanbul. Tolu √áorlu was accused of spreading propaganda for the illegal Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Communist Party of Turkey (MLKP) and membership in the organization. She was detained in the Bakƒ±rk√∂y Women's Prison on May 6. She was incarcerated in a prison quarter for 24 inmates. After two weeks, her son could stay with her in the prison. Only in the beginning of June, German diplomats were allowed to visit her in the prison. In August, the public prosecutor demanded 15-year sentence in prison for her. The court ruled in a routine session on August 23 that she had to remain in detention due to a possible risk of absconding and a not yet completed collection of evidence. The first court session, at which 18 suspects were involved, took place in Silivri, Istanbul on October 9. She rejected all allegations and complained about her detention. Mid December 2017, the court decided her release from prison. However, she was not allowed to leave the country. She had to report her presence at the police station every Monday. The next court hearing of Tolu √áorlu was set for April 26, 2018.

Their extreme expressions of grief are unusual in Bellini's oeuvre and may have been influenced by Donatello's reliefs for the high altar of the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua.

It is most notable for its human-like face on the body of the vacuum cleaner. The vacuum has several variations, including different names on the cap (including Hetty, Harry and James) as well as different models designed for different applications.  History  Numatic International vacuum cleaners with faces on the body or canister were originally invented in 1979, 123 years after the invention of the first vacuum, but they did not actually feature names on their caps until 1981. In 1981, the first Numatic International model to have a name on its cap (\\"Henry\\") was created. The first model of Henry started as something of a toy, with the functionality of a vacuum. The vacuum's lovable face appealed to children and adults alike, and was very popular for it. Henry was also one of the first vacuums to use Microfibre dust bags, which are large capacity dust bags known as HEPA-FLO bags, and are made of a strong material that carries dust and other unwanted materials into them and retains them unlike any paper bags which tend to rip and leak dust. Since the introduction of Henry in 1981, it has sold 7-8 million units worldwide, with around 20,000 more units sold each week, roughly 2857 per day. In 2017, the European Union introduced a new law that gave vacuum cleaners a limit to their wattage, making 900W the maximum. Generic Henrys (and Hettys) can be found on online shopping websites and in electronics stores. It is uncommon to come across a generic Charles, George, James, Harry or Jack (the last of which was exclusive to Tesco stores before it was discontinued). They are most common in the United Kingdom where they are manufactured, but can also be found in other countries like the United States. In 2014, Chris Duncan (who founded Numatic International in 1969, created the compact shape for the cleaners, and is still the company's sole owner) got #96 on Management Todays Britain's Top 100 Entrepreneurs list and was said to have a worth of ¬£103 million. Numatic International also manufacture spray mops, sold under the Henry and Hetty brands as \\"Henry Spray Mop\\" and \\"Hetty Spray Mop\\".  Model  A Henry HVR200 and Hetty HET200 *Henry Professional (HVR240) - A slightly larger version of the standard (9-litre) model for professional and retail applications. *Henry (and Hetty) Compact (HVR160 and HET160) - Smaller and more compact versions of the standard Henry models, 6-litre capacity. *Henry Cordless (HVB160) - A more compact version of the standard Henry model running off two 36-volt batteries, 6-litre capacity. *Henry Xtra (HVX200 and HVX160) - A version of the standard (9-litre) Henry model designed for carpet care and cleaning pet hairs. A smaller and more compact version of this model (which, like all the other \\"compact\\" Henry models, has a 6-litre capacity) also exists. *Henry Micro (HVR200M) - A version of the standard (9-litre) Henry model designed for reducing exposure to dust-related allergens. *Henry Allergy (HVA160) - A smaller, light blue version of the standard Henry model for capturing allergens, 6-litre capacity. *Henry Wash (HVW370) - A larger, dark blue version unlike any one of the standard Henry models, carpet cleaner, 15-litre capacity. = Names = The vacuums are also available with different names. All the original series are based on British names. The names of the vacuums are on their caps. Vacuums with different names are generally of different colours and applications. Their faces remain identical on all models (except for Hetty, as her face has long eyelashes), but depending on the size of the head or body, the distance between the eyes and mouth can vary (excluding earlier models, as the faces were originally three stickers that needed to be applied to the vacuums by hand). *Henry (HVR200) - Red, base model. Originally released without rewinding cable as model HVC200, but one was added at a later date. Also available in blue, green and yellow at one time. The \\"Allergy\\" and \\"Wash\\" models are only in light blue and dark blue respectively. *Basil (NB200) - Yellow, lower-cost version of Henry which was also available in red, blue and green. Its colour was later changed to lime green when it was rereleased as a Halloween special edition in 2005, but it had become discontinued by the end of that year. *Edward (EVR370) - Larger red vacuum with a 15-litre capacity that was also available in blue, green and yellow, now discontinued. *Charles (CVC370) - Larger blue wet-and-dry vacuum with a 15-litre dry and a 9-litre wet capacity which was also available in red, green and yellow at one time. In the late 1980s, this model and some others were also manufactured with a cream-and-brown colour scheme. *George (GVE370) - Larger green \\"all-in-one\\" vacuum with a 15-litre dry and a 9-litre wet capacity which was also available in red, blue and yellow at one time. In 2015 the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, was called on to help make several blue instances of this model when he visited Numatic International's manufacturing plant in Chard, Somerset. *David (JVR225) - Green, introduced alongside George and another green vacuum with a 15-litre capacity called \\"William\\" in 1990 as model DVR200, now discontinued. William was a lower-cost version of Charles that did not last very long before it was also discontinued. *Wendy (NV250) - Numatic's first \\"female\\" vacuum cleaner. Green, introduced in 1997 as a Machine Mart exclusive, now discontinued. *James (JVP180) - Yellow, professional vacuum and high performance with a caddy top and an 8-litre capacity. Originally introduced in 2002 as model NNV200 and coloured purple, it was rereleased at a later date (and its colour was changed from yellow to blue in 2019). *Harry (HHR200) - Green, originally released under the name of \\"Henry Hound\\" in 2003 and designed specifically for pet owners. * Hetty (HET200) - Short for Henrietta, pink \\"feminine\\" version of Henry, introduced in 2007 to be marketed towards females. As mentioned above, its face is different from all the other models' because it has long eyelashes. *B&Q; Bertie and ScrewFix Bertie (PSP200A) - Orange and Blue, introduced in 2013 as a B&Q; and Screwfix limited edition with a caddy top like that of James, now discontinued. *John and Lewis (JL150) - Green and Purple, introduced in 2014 as a John Lewis and Partners limited edition, now discontinued. *Jack (PSP200-11) - Blue, introduced in 2015 as a Tesco limited edition with a caddy top like that of James, now discontinued. Some Henry models opt to instead say \\"Numatic\\" on the cap, such as the NBV190. Some do not even have anything on their caps and provide a more standard look, like the WV370, but these are mostly not considered Henrys because models that have nothing on their caps do not have a face. A very small amount of other models feature other words on their caps, such as the MFQ370 which features the word \\"Micro-filter\\".

Summerfield is known for his \\"evocative series of black and white images, shot on 35mm film, which co-opt the traditional genre of documentary photography to realise a more personal and inward looking vision.\\" He has said his photographs are exclusively about abandonment and loss. Life and career After taking an Art Foundation course at the Oxford Polytechnic, Summerfield attended Guildford School of Art, studying firstly in the Photography Department, then joining the Film department the following year. In 1967, when still a first-year student, he made photographs that appeared in 1970 in Bill Jay's magazine Album.\\"Paddy Summerfield: New talent\\", Album, issue 2 (March 1970), pp. 43‚Äì45. Jay made a PDF of this available from his website (which no longer exists); here is a 26 April 2012 Wayback Machine copy of this. Between 1968 and 1978, Summerfield documented Oxford University students in the summer terms. His pictures published in Creative Camera, and on its cover in January 1974, were recognised as psychological and expressionist, unusual in an era of journalistic and documentary photography. Throughout his life, Summerfield has focused on making photographic essays that are personal documents. From 1997 to 2007 he photographed his parents, his mother with Alzheimer's disease and his father caring for her. Like It Is was Summerfield's first London exhibition, a group show in Dixon's Photographic Gallery, Oxford Street, in 1967. Since then, his work has been exhibited at other London venues, including the ICA Gallery, the Serpentine Gallery, the Barbican, and The Photographers' Gallery in its Newport Street home. In 1976, When Nicholas Serota was director of the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, he offered Summerfield the opportunity to exhibit Beneath the Dreaming Spires, his first one-man show, in 1976. During his early career, he was awarded several Arts Council grants.  Publications = Books by Summerfield = *Mother and Father.

When stable, the system absorbs economic shocks primarily via self-corrective mechanisms, preventing the adverse events from disrupting the real economy or spreading over to other financial systems. Financial stability is paramount for economic growth, as most transactions in the real economy are made through the financial system. Without financial stability, banks are more reluctant to finance profitable projects, asset prices may deviate significantly from their intrinsic values, and the payment settlement schedule diverges from the norm. Hence, financial stability is essential for maintaining confidence in the economy. Possible consequences of excessive instability include financial crisis, bank runs, hyperinflation, and stock market crashes.The World Bank GFDR Report Empirical measures=Firm-level stability measures= The Altman's z‚Äêscore is extensively used in empirical research as a measure of firm-level stability for its high correlation with the probability of default. This measure contrasts buffers (capitalization and returns) with risk (volatility of returns), and has done well at predicting bankruptcies within two years. Despite development of alternative models to predict financial stability Altman's model remains the most widely used.Shumway, 2001Chava, Jarrow, 2000 An alternate model used to measure institution-level stability is the Merton model (also called the asset value model). It evaluates a firm's ability to meet its financial obligations and gauges the overall possibility of default. In this model, an institution's equity is treated as a call option on its held assets, taking into account the volatility of those assets. Put- call parity is used to price the value of the implied ‚Äúput‚Äù option, which represents the firm's credit risk. Ultimately, the model measures the value of the firm's assets (weighted for volatility) at the time that the debtholders exercises their ‚Äúput option‚Äù by expecting repayment. Implicitly, the model defines default as when the value of a firm's liabilities exceeds that of its assets calculate the probability of credit default. In different iterations of the model, the asset/liability level could be set at different threshold levels. In subsequent research, Merton's model has been modified to capture a wider array of financial activity using credit default swap data. For example, Moody's uses it in the KMV model both to calculate the probability of credit default and as part of their credit risk management system. The Distance to Default (DD) is another market-based measure of corporate default risk based on Merton's model. It measures both solvency risk and liquidity risk at the firm level. =Systemic stability measures= Unfortunately, there is not yet a singular, standardized model for assessing financial system stability and for examining policies. To measure systemic stability, a number of studies attempt to aggregate firm-level stability measures (z-score and distance to default) into a system-wide evaluation of stability, either by taking a simple average or weighing each measure by the institution's relative size. However, these aggregate measures fail to account for correlated risks among financial institutions. In other words, the model fails to consider the inter- connectedness between institutions, and that one institution's failure can lead to a contagion. The First-to-Default probability, or the probability of observing one default among a number of institutions, has been proposed as a measure of systemic risk for a group of large financial institutions. This measure looks at risk-neutral default probabilities from credit default swap spreads. Unlike distance-to-default measures, the probability recognizes the interconnectedness among defaults of different institutions. However, studies focusing on probabilities of default tend to overlook the ripper effect caused by the failing of a large institution. Another assessment of financial system stability is Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES), which measures the contribution to systemic risk by individual institutions. SES considers individual leverage level and measures the externalities created from the banking sector when these institutions fail. The model is especially apt at identifying which institutions are systemically relevant and would impact the most on the economy when it fails. One drawback of the SES method is that it is difficult to determine when the systemically-important institutions are likely to fail.Bharath, Shumway, 2004 To enhance predictive power, the retrospective SES measure was extended and modified in later research. The enhanced model is called SRISK, which evaluates the expected capital shortfall for a firm in a crisis scenario. To calculate this SRISK, one should first determine the Long-Run Marginal Expected Shortfall (LRMES), which measures the relationship between a firm's equity returns and the market's return (estimated using asymmetric volatility, correlation, and copula). Then, the model estimates the drop in the firm's equity value if the aggregate market experiences a 40% or larger fall in a six-month period to determine how much capital is needed in order to achieve an 8% capital to asset value ratio. In other words, SRISK gives insights into the firm's percentage of total financial sector capital shortfall. A high SRISK % indicates the biggest losers when a crisis strikes. One implication of the SES indicator is that a firm is considered ‚Äúsystemically risky‚Äù if it faces a high probability of capital shortage when the financial sector is weak.Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon, Richardson Another gauge of financial stability is the distribution of systemic loss, which attempts to fill some of the gaps of the aforementioned measures. This measure incorporates three key elements: each individual institution's probability of default, the size of loss given a default, and the contagion resulting from defaults interconnected institutions.Eijffinger, 2009 References Finance ","title":"Financial stability"},{"id":"56496980","text":"Dead Christ Supported by Two Angels is a tempera on panel painting by Giovanni Bellini, now in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin.

She was the first woman to be dean of the Division of Social Sciences at the University of Southern California. She was a Women's Rights activist.  Education  Carol Nagy was born in Chicago, Illinois on February 23, 1939. Nagy completed high school in Oak Park. As Nagy was preparing for college at the University of Wisconsin, she met and married her husband, and transferred to the University of Connecticut. Jacklin completed a BA and MA in psychology at the University of Connecticut. Short on money, Carol Jacklin became a teacher at the University of Connecticut and then San Jose City College. After attending a psychology conference she realised she wanted to get a PhD in developmental psychology, after which she applied and was accepted for postgraduate studies at Brown University. She completed her PhD at Brown University in 1972.  Research  Jacklin moved to Stanford, where she completed postdoctoral studies alongside Eleanor Maccoby. Jacklin and Maccoby began to observe parent-child interactions, identifying negative portrayals of women in scientific literature. Their research was published in the critically acclaimed 1974 book \\"The Psychology of Sex Differences\\", which became front page of The New York Times Book Review. In 1975 it was a best seller in The New York Times. Here they dismissed many beliefs about gender differences: that girls are more social than boys, have lower self-esteem and are better at rote learning, arguing that the evidence does not support the existence of gender differences. At Stanford Jacklin became a vocal women's rights activist, who campaigned against injustices facing women. She was a founding member of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research alongside Myra Strober. In 1983, The New York Times described her as a \\"leading expert on gender differences\\". Jacklin and Maccoby were two of the first researchers to study the differences between boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô learning. Jacklin moved to the University of Southern California in 1983, where she was the first woman to become a tenured psychology professor. She was the first woman to be chair of the psychology department in 1990, the first paid chair of the Program for the Study of Women and Men in Society, and the first woman to be appointed Dean of the Division of Social Sciences in 1992. Jacklin took leave to work with biologists researching endocrinology at CalTech, and implemented policy change to fairly treat women faculty members and students. In 1995 Jacklin became Dean of the College of William and Mary. She instituted changes in the university's recruitment of women and minorities. With her extensive knowledge of gender differences and similarities, she served as an expert witness in sexual discrimination cases against corporations such as AT&T; and General Motors. She helped women seeking admission to the Virginia Military Institute and the Citadel. Jacklin retired to San Diego, where she became a certified Master Gardener. Jacklin had a daughter, Beth Nagy, and son, Phillip Jacklin. She wrote a newspaper column \\"Mountain Greening\\" for local newspapers. In 2011 she rejected Chemotherapy for a diagnosis of terminal cancer, and died one week later.

Luntama. Proceedings Volume 10562, International Conference on Space Optics ‚Äî ICSO 2016; 105620F (2017); . International Conference on Space Optics ‚Äî ICSO 2016, 2016, Biarritz, France. Monitoring space weather includes events such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic storms, solar proton events, etc. Monitoring would help predict arrival times at the Earth and any potential effect on infrastructure. If funded, both Lagrange missions would launch in the 2020s. Overview Lagrange points in the Sun‚ÄìEarth system (not to scale) prominence eruption recorded on 7 June 2011 by SDO in extreme ultraviolet To ensure an effective capability to monitor potentially dangerous solar events, ESA initiated a study of two potential future space weather satellites called Lagrange.. The Lagrange mission concept is overseen by the Space Situational Awareness Programme at ESA. On 2 February 2018, ESA signed technological contracts (Phase A) to be led by Airbus UK and OHB SE of Germany to design the spacecraft specifications and the instruments' integration process. UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and Mullard Space Science Laboratory will assess the requirements of the science payload. This mission concept proposes positioning two spacecraft in orbit at the L1 and L5 Lagrangian points, respectively, where gravitational forces interact to create a stable location to save propellant and from which to make observations. L1 is in the solar wind 'upstream' from Earth, so measurements at L1 provide information about the space weather coming toward Earth. In contrast, the L5 point provides a way to monitor coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the 'side' in order to estimate their speed and direction. Objectives The preliminary Lagrange mission objectives are: *the spacecraft at L1 is to provide observations of the solar wind speed, density, temperature and dynamic pressure, charged particle environment and the direction and strength of the interplanetary magnetic field. *The spacecraft at L1 would also monitor the solar disk and solar corona and measure solar energetic particles that may be associated with solar flares and the onset of coronal mass ejections. *The spacecraft at L5 would complement measurements made from L1 by providing a side-view of the propagation of plasma clouds emitted by the Sun toward Earth. *The spacecraft at L5 would monitor of the solar disk and corona and carry out measurements of the interplanetary medium.  Payload To achieve these objectives, the satellites at the L1 and L5 positions have to carry different types of remote- sensing and in-situ instruments. The suggested optical instruments take heritage from ESA and NASA science missions like SOHO, STEREO and Solar Orbiter, but the instruments would be optimized for operational space weather monitoring. The notional science payload may require: ;Optical instruments *Coronagraph ‚Äì for onset and characterisation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). *Heliospheric imager (HI) ‚Äì A wide-angle visible-light imaging system for the detection of coronal mass ejection events directed toward Earth. *Magnetograph - would scan a selected solar spectrum to generate 3D maps of the magnetic field. *EUV imager ‚Äì Imaging of the complex solar corona (the Sun's atmosphere) will support monitoring of the magnetic complexity and activity in the corona and location of the flaring active regions. *X-ray flux monitor ‚Äì Detection of solar flares and quantification of the flare energy. ;In situ instruments *Magnetometer ‚Äì Measurement of the interplanetary magnetic field. *Plasma analyser ‚Äì To measure angular velocity components of the solar wind approaching the Earth and estimates of geomagnetic storm strength. *Radiation monitor ‚Äì Monitoring radiation storms (Solar particle event) is crucial, as these can disrupt and damage spacecraft, aircraft and ground systems. *Medium energy particle spectrometer ‚Äì This can monitor clouds of medium-to-low energy ions approaching the Earth.

Ferrer was a Spanish Dominican who had only been canonised in 1455 and his order was continuing to promote his cult. The altar was finished in 1464 according to a receipt issued by one Olricus de Argentina to the then prior Giovanni da Merano regarding the fabrica Sancti Vincentii.Fogolari, 1932 The altarpiece was mentioned as a work of Bellini in 1581 by Francesco Sansovino and some argue that he may have produced its many canvases in stages, given their stylistic differences. From left to right the central register shows Saint Christopher, Saint Vincent Ferrer and Saint Sebastian. The upper register shows a Piet√† flanked by an Annunciation scene, with the archangel Gabriel to the left and the Virgin Mary to the right. Above the Piet√† there was originally a lunette showing God the Father, to which Mary directed her gaze; this was recorded in 1664 by Boschini but later lost.

Her party was in opposition and the incumbent governor and senator were respected men in the community. But Afegbua who had won an international hairstyling competition in 1977, calculated that wooing more women to vote could give her a victory. Her victory in the competition had made her name popular within her Etsako community, she targeted women voters and as her campaign gained steam it was too late to curb.

It produces medium-sized, annual fruit bodies that are soft, and have a strong, distinct smell. The fungus is a saprophyte that feeds on coniferous wood of logs lying on the ground, and causes brown rot. It is a rather rare species that only occurs in old-growth forest. Taxonomy The fungus was originally described by Swedish mycologist Lars Romell in 1911, who called it Polyporus lapponicus. The type collection was made in Nattavaara (Sweden), where it was found growing on fir. Romell initially thought the fungus might be Climacocystis borealis, but ultimately rejected that opinion, as that species has an easily breakable fruit body, and its spores are of different size and shape. Amylocystis lapponica has been shuffled to several different polypore genera in its taxonomic history, including Ungulina (Pil√°t, 1934), Leptoporus (Pil√°t, 1938), and Tyromyces (J.Lowe, 1975). The fungus has microscopic characteristics that are typical of the genus Tyromyces, but differs by the presence of thick-walled amyloid cystidia in the hymenium. For this reason, A. Bondartsev and Rolf Singer created the genus Amylocystis in 1944 to contain the fungus. Polyporus ursinus, proposed by Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1915, is now considered a synonym of Amylocystis lapponica. Description The fungus has fruit bodies that range in form from crust-like to effused- reflexed (mostly crust-like, with edges curling out to form rudimentary caps). Individual fruit bodies measure up to wide, and have a dirty whitish to light buff surface colour that becomes reddish brown when dry or if bruised. Amylocystis lapponica has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae. These hyphae are mostly thick-walled and measure 4‚Äì10.5 ¬µm thick. The spores are cylindrical, hyaline, and smooth, measuring 8‚Äì11 by 2.5‚Äì3.5 ¬µm. They are unreactive in Melzer's reagent. Oligoporus fragilis is similar in appearance, but can be distinguished microscopically from Amylocystis lapponica by the lack of amyloid cystidia. Habitat and distribution Amylocystis lapponica decomposes fallen conifer wood, in which it causes brown rot. Its preferential hosts are spruce and larch, although it is occasionally found on fir. It has a circumboreal distribution in coniferous forests. In Europe, the fungus is restricted almost exclusively to old-growth forests. Several conditions are required to support local populations, including: \\"vegetative continuity (never cut), natural tree species composition, multi-aged structure, rich presence of dead wood in various stages of decay, relatively large area of virgin forest surrounded by near- natural forest, and a stable, cold and humid meso- and microclimate.\\" Because of this requirement the species is rare. For example, in the Czech Republic, despite the long and intensive history of polypore study in that area, A. lapponica has only been recorded from the Boub√≠nsk√Ω prales virgin forest, even though there are other old-growth forests in the country. Similarly, in Poland it is known only from Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest (Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park). Both the Czech and Polish locations have a similar management history‚Äì\\"minimal influence by man\\". In contrast to its rarity in Central and Southern Europe, A. lapponica is known from hundreds of localities in Finland and Sweden, and dozens in Norway. Here the fungus is used as an indicator species to help evaluate areas in need of conservation. The fungus is widely distributed in western North America. It is also found in China. In Europe, the fungus has been recorded from 12 countries, and is red-listed in 7 countries. In 2004, Amylocystis lapponica was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. In both the Czech Republic and Poland, where it is considered critically endangered, the fungus is found on their Regional Red Lists and as such is protected by law. The discomycete Hyaloscypha epiporia grows only on the surface of old polypores fruiting on softwood, and is often found on old, partly decayed fruit bodies of Amylocystis lapponica.

The municipality encompassed the northern part of what is now Heim and Orkland municipalities and the southeastern part of Hitra municipality in Tr√∏ndelag county. The administrative centre was the village of Heim where Heim Church is located. History Originally (since 1838) the municipality was a part of the municipality of Hemne (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1911, the large municipality of Hemne was divided into two: Hemne (population: 3,425) in the south and Heim (population: 1,533) in the north. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Heim ceased to exist as a municipality. The district of Vestre Heim (Western Heim, the area west of the Hemnefjord) with its 711 inhabitants was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Hemne and Vinje to form a new, larger Hemne municipality. At the same time, the district of Austre Heim (Eastern Heim, the area east of the Hemnfjorden) with its 724 residents was merged with the neighboring municipality of Snillfjord and part of the municipality of Agdenes to become a new, larger municipality of Snillfjord. Name The parish of Heim was established in 1884. It is named after the old Heim farm (), since the Heim Church is built on its ground. The name is identical with the word heimr which means \\"home\\", \\"homestead\\", or \\"farm\\". Government All municipalities in Norway, including Heim, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of HeimHeim was made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

Lindsay Wildcat Academy Charter School is an alternative school for disenfranchised students who have dropped out of the regular public school system. Originally called Wildcat Academy, the school was founded in 1992 by Amalia Betanzos and Ronald Tabano as an alternative public school. It was converted to a charter school in 2000. The school currently operates two campuses. The original location is at 17 Battery Place, in lower Manhattan. The second is in the Banknote Building, 1239 Lafayette Avenue in the Hunt's Point section of The Bronx. A third campus in the Banknote Building, the Second Opportunity School, which was established in 1997 in cooperation with NYC Department of Education Chancellor Rudy Crew, catered to students on one- year suspension from NYC high schools. In 1999, the Second Opportunity School had 16 staff and 100 students. Although the school had success working with troubled students, the City spent $60,000 per student, making it one of the most expensive public schools in New York City. After 2006, the Second Opportunity School was run solely by the NYC Department of Education. For the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year, JVL Wildcat Academy Charter School had 468 students, of which 98% were minorities and 89% were economically disadvantaged. There were 23 full-time teachers, for a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. US News and Word Report ranked the school's students as having 82% mathematics proficiency and 84% English proficiency, significantly higher than the district ratings (for 522 schools) of 53% in mathematics and 71% in English. As of 2018, there are 500 students between the two locations. The Bronx campus serves freshmen and sophomores. The school occupies three floors in the Banknote building, with a lease running to 2022. The space was renovated using a $1 million grant from the Charles Hayden Foundation. The Bronx campus houses the school's Culinary Internship program, which teaches cooking and other skills necessary to work in a restaurant, as well as the student-run JVL Wildcat Caf√© and hydroponics garden.

(ed.) (2011) Radical Thread. The 62 Group 1962-2012. Tunbridge Wells: Direct Design Books They were concerned about the limited professional opportunities available to embroidery graduates at the time.

Embroidery graduates were frustrated because galleries would not take work \\"if they thought it was a woman's hobby\\"Walker, A.

This meeting created a formal link with the Embroiderers' Guild and at this point, any embroiderer could become a member. Early in the group's existence (1964‚Äì65), members realised that the open membership created problems with the quality and consistency of work submitted for exhibitions. It was around this time that selection for membership and exhibitions was instigated and became a fundamental principle of the constitution. This shift also brought about a change to the group's title, as they became 'The Professional Group of the Embroiderers' Guild'. The first exhibition was remembered by Audrey Walker MBE \\"It consisted mostly of small framed panels but the quality of the drawing, design and the subject matter was really remarkable\\"Walker in Millar, L. (ed.) (2011) Radical Thread. The 62 Group 1962-2012. Tunbridge Wells: Direct Design Books Walker reflects 'I thought, this is amazing. Why don't I know about this?' By 1965, she had joined the 62 Group and was exhibiting.'Jan Beaney was terrific, she insisted I joined. It was wonderful to have the support of this group. To share a passion.'Johnson, P 1997, 'Sources of inspiration', /Crafts (0306610X)/, 145, pp. 42‚Äì45, The Group was then sponsored by the Art Exhibitions Bureau, an organisation which toured exhibitions throughout the UK. This enabled the group to reach a wider public and to make sales of artwork. The increased pressure to produce artwork became a problem and so touring finished after two years. Following this the group were successful in securing exhibitions at prestigious London venues including The Royal Festival Hall (1967), The Victoria & Albert Museum (1970 and 1972), the Commonwealth Institute (1972) and TUC Congress House (1970 and 1972). This period helped to establish a regular programme of exhibitions for the group. Twenty years after the group was first founded members recognised that the term 'embroidery' was limiting to the scope of the group and the decision was made to open membership to artists of any textile discipline. Formal ties with the Embroiderers' Guild were severed and the group was renamed 'The 62 Group of Textile Artists'. A 1997 review of The 62 Group exhibition 'The Language of Touch' questions if, after broadening the range of textiles disciplines, \\"one wonders if it is not also too diverse. Does the backbone of embroiderers and stitchers wish to be faced with competition from, for example, classic tapestry weavers? It is not absolutely clear where the group will go from here.\\" An article in Fibrearts mentions the same exhibition and comments that \\"The extraction of old ideas and injection of new ideas were of benefit. The result was a leaner, stronger body of work than had been seen before. The avant-garde was made up of new members.\\" Throughout the 62 Group's history, many members have been teachers, lecturers and academics, influencing the future of textile art through their support for textiles in arts education \\"we have had a major influence in expanding the acceptance of experimental textiles into the general curriculum in schools, colleges and universities\\". The group's members have also contributed extensively to publishing about contemporary textiles in journals such as World of Embroidery (now Embroidery) and Crafts and have also published seminal books on the subject. Exhibitions Between 1963 and 2011 The 62 Group held 85 exhibitions, mainly in the UK but also in Japan, Israel and Netherlands.

She was powered by a 2,400 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and fueled by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. History The Hagarty was constructed in 1914 by the Collingwood Shipbuilding Company of Collingwood, Ontario for the St. Lawrence & Chicago Steam Navigation Company of Toronto, Ontario. The Hagarty was the sister ship of the ill-fated James Carruthers that was lost in the Great Lakes Storm of 1913. The J.H.G. Hagarty in the Soo Locks The Hagarty would have her telescoping steel hatch covers replaced with single piece spruce hatch covers, she also had her cabins, decks removed and replaced. This delayed her launch for several months. Her owners believed that the design of the Carruthers contributed to her foundering. This was thought because the steamer Howard M. Hanna Jr. which was badly damaged in the storm had been taken to Collingwood, Ontario for repairs. John Leich the yard's superintendent had a few things to say when the Hanna arrived in Collingwood. The Hanna had suffered severe cracks in her hull, she did not break in two completely, however her cabins had taken severe damage. He also pointed out that: \\"The starboard side of the forecastle has been stove in with heavy seas and the structure there shows how lightly she was built.\\" Leich said this was exactly what they wanted to avoid with the redesigning of the Hagarty. The Hagarty entered service on July 28, 1914 clearing Collingwood running only on ballast bound for Detroit, Michigan where she entered the Great Lakes Engineering Works' Ecorse, Michigan drydock for repairs caused by her launching. On July 27, 1916 the St. Lawrence & Chicago Steam Navigation Company's fleet was sold to the Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. of Montreal, Quebec. In 1926 she was renamed Hagarty. Scrapping In 1968 the Hagarty was sold to the Steel Factors Ltd. She was later resold to a Spanish scrapyard. She Departed Toronto, Ontario, for Kingston, Ontario on May 15, 1968 in tow of tugs Graeme Stewart and G.W. Rogers. She parred down the St. Lawrence Seaway with the steamer Collingwood towed by the tugs James Battles and the Salvage Monarch. They arrived in Santander, Spain on October 28, 1968 for scrapping.

Retrieved February 4, 2018.  Research  Qian's research concentrates on development economics, political economy, and economic history. A common theme in her research is to use institutional details, policy shocks, large demographic and historical data to understand the detailed processes of long-run economic, cultural and institutional development. Her research has been influenced by the works of Amartya Sen. In her most well-known paper - Missing Women and the Price of Tea in China - Qian uses the impact of China's economic opening to estimate the effects of parents' relative contributions to a household's income on the difference between boys' and girls' survival rates, which stands at the core of the phenomenon of \\"missing women\\" in China. In particular, she finds that China's post-1978 economic opening caused the price for tea in China to increase as a consequence of greatly increased external demand, which in turn tended to increase the income of women in tea-producing regions; this, in turn, had a substantial positive impact on survival rates for girls and educational attainment for all children.Qian, N. (2008). Missing Women and the Price of Tea in China: The Effect of Sex-Specific Earnings on Sex Imbalance. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 123(3), pp. 1251-1285. She (together with Xin Meng and Pierre Yared) also documents that the centrally planned grain procurement policy contributed to around half of the mortality during China's Great Famine.Meng, X., Qian, N. and Yared, P. (2015). The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959‚Äì1961. The Review of Economic Studies, 82(4), pp. 1568-1611. One of her works, falling under development economics, focuses on the how family size effects a child's educational attainment, a relevant question in the field of labor economics. Her extensive research in China led her to conclude that an increase in family size has a negative effect on child educational attainment, an issue that is specifically prevalent in developing countries. Another influential study shows that U.S. food aid is largely driven by U.S. objectives and can lead to more conflict in recipient countries.Nunn, N., Qian, N. (2014). U.S. Food Aid and Civil Conflict. American Economic Review, 104(6), pp. 1630-66. A well-cited finding using historical data (together with Nathan Nunn) is that the introduction of the potato within the Columbian exchange may have been responsible for at least a quarter of the population and urbanisation growth observed in the Old World between 1700 and 1900.Nunn, N., Qian, N. (2011). The Potato's Contribution to Population and Urbanization: Evidence from a Historical Experiment. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 126(2), pp. 593-650. A paper with Nathan Nunn and Sandra Sequeira shows that historical immigration to the United States increased productivity and innovation. Another paper shows that workers in low-income countries accumulate less skills on the job than workers in rich countries and this contributes to cross-country income differences. Additionally, Qian has done extensive research on the Chinese economy. Qian has consulted for the World Bank, the Global Development Network and the China Development Bank. She is the co-organizer of the China NBER Workshop and an expert for VOX China. Her findings have been published in journals such as the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy and the Review of Economic Studies, and featured in media outlets such as the New York Times, NPR and the Wall Street Journal.

She was an award-winning illustrator of children's books, and the recipient of a Caldecott Honor, as well as multiple Coretta Scott King Awards.  Early life and education  Byard was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to parents William \\"Bunny\\" Byard and Viola London- Byard. She had one sibling, an older brother, Michael Byard, who among other jobs, was a passionate gardener. In 1943, Byard's mother died when she was very young, and her large extended family became very important to her. Around that same time, her father was drafted in World War II. Byard was raised by her father and grandmother after her mother's death. Byard's father's family came from a Southern African-American tradition, and her paternal grandmother lived with them. Her father took over the role as head of the family when Byard's grandfather died. Her mother's family was from the Caribbean, from Barbados and Grenada ‚Äì her mother was born on an island called Balboa in Panama while her grandfather worked building the Panama Canal. Byard attended New Jersey Avenue School, then Central Junior High and then graduated from Atlantic City High School. Byard credits high school teacher Priscilla Gerard as an early motivator who taught her about the seriousness of art. Byard got a four-year scholarship to an art school in Ohio, but couldn't afford to go due to the death of someone close to her and her father's becoming ill with cancer. Byard instead began working as a simulation pilot at the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center near Atlantic City. She used this job to support herself while studying at Fleischer Art Memorial in Philadelphia from 1961 until 1963. Her mother's youngest sister Millicent lived in New York City, so after working and helping her father, Byard was able to go and live with her. From 1964 to 1968, Byard attended New York Phoenix School of Design at 33rd and Lexington, where she majored in illustration, and where she would later go on to teach. Byard also studied lithography with H. Morimoto and Robert Blackburn.  Career  Byard said that as she was growing up she was passionate about reading, and loved books, but always felt that there were no books or images of people that looked like her, her family, and extended family, and how they lived as people. During college, there were very few black students. In an effort to connect with other Black artists, Byard went to the 1971 Where We At exhibition in the village called Where We At: Black Women Artists: 1971, and was able to connect with other Black women artists like Faith Ringgold. She became a part of the group. In 1969 or 1970, Byard moved from Harlem into the Westbeth Artists Community two years after graduating from college. At Westbeth her neighbors included Freddie Waits and his son Nasheet Waits. At Westbeth, there was a Black Artists Guild that Byard said was formative. The Black Artists Guild that was initially a theater group founded in 1970. Byard went to see a production of Slave Ship, a play written by Amiri Baraka produced at Brooklyn Academy of Music. The play involved audience participation and singing. She was inspired by a character in the play and did a large painting based on the play. It turned out that many cast members also lived in Westbeth, and were part of this organization, based on Malcolm X's material left from Organization of Afro-American Unity, using the seven principles. Byard joined the group and participated in writing and making art. Byard defined herself as a community artist, and this particular focus may have led to her lack of wider recognition and commercial success. = Illustration = After finishing art school, Byard found work as a magazine illustration artist before shifting her focus to children's books. Her interest in performing arts led to one of her first book projects, a biography of ballet dancer Arthur Mitchell, who founded the Dance Theater of Harlem. In 1972, she received a Ford Foundation grant that funded three months of travel in Africa. She visited Senegal, Ghana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Egypt. In Ibadan, Nigeria, she painted a mural at the House of Light Temple. Byard returned to Nigeria as a delegate to the second Black and African Festival of Art and Culture (FESTAC) in Lagos in 1977. Her travel experiences informed the charcoal illustrations for her next children's book, Three African Tales by Adjai Robinson. Byard went on to illustrate more than 16 children's books over the course of her career. Her work often focused on the African-American experience and on stories of African heritage. She was concerned with increasing the representation of people of color in American children's books, and her illustrations reflect that interest in centering Black stories. In The Black Snowman (1991), Byard used pastels to illustrate a fantastical story in which a boy brings a black snowman to life using city snow and a magical kente cloth. She was a contributing artist for the children's anthology Jump Back, Honey: The Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar (1999), which also featured artwork by Jerry Pinkney and Faith Ringgold. Working Cotton told a story, based on Williams's own childhood experiences, about a family of African-American migrant workers in the San Joaquin Valley in California. As part of her research for Working Cotton, Byard's brother helped her learn about cotton. = Fine art = Byard had a lifelong fine-art practice in painting, sculpture, installation and mixed-media art. She was part of the Black Arts Movement, a founding member of the Black Artists Guild and an early member of Where We At: Black Women Artists Inc. (WWA), a collective that grew out of a groundbreaking 1971 show called \\"Where We At: Black Women Artists, 1971.\\" Her earth art installations had reference points in vernacular front-yard decorations and traditional African-American burial sites. One example of such outdoor installations is Praisesong for Charles (1988), which was originally shown in Baltimore. In 1990, her work was exhibited in a group show called Chaney, Goodwin and Schwerner, the Mississippi Three: The Struggle Continues at the SoHo 20 Gallery in New York City. In 1992 she collaborated with Clarissa Sligh on an environmental, mixed-media \\"portrait\\" of Malcolm X for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Byard was a participant in the 1998 Smithsonian exhibit Resonant Forms: Contemporary African American Women Sculptors, curated by Deborah Willis. The piece she showed, titled \\"Imani, the Seventh Day\\" (1993), was an installation featuring a chair with a ladderlike back and gourds (which she had grown herself) hanging off it, standing in a tray filled with black eyed peas and pennies. On the chair's seat were corn kernels and red and green candles. Over the course of her career, Byard also taught art at the Studio Museum in Harlem, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Foundation for the Arts, Baltimore School for the Arts, Maryland Institute College of Art, and Parsons School of Design.  Rent Series  The New York Public Library exhibited a collection of Byard's art known as the Rent Series in 2015. The artworks in the series, which she began painting in the 1980s, were inspired by boxes of rent receipts she found in her father's home after his death. Byard used the series to express the personal aspects of this discovery ‚Äì the reality of her father's struggle to provide a home for his family ‚Äì while weaving in larger themes related to African-American history and housing segregation. The paintings were loaned for the exhibition from the collection of her friend Alexis De Veaux.  Other work  During the 1970s, Byard also designed album covers for Strata-East Records, a New York City jazz label. Her drawings and collages were featured on album jackets for Stanley Cowell, Charles Sullivan, Sonny Fortune, Milton Marsh, The Piano Choir, and the Heath Brothers.

During the Japanese occupation of Guam in WW2, some local Chamorro women were forced to work in the Japanese military brothels set up on the island (I Tiempon Chapones) along with the Japanese and Korean woman the Japanese had brought there. After the American liberation of Guam, a number of brothels were set up to serve the American servicemen. The establishment of US bases on the island after the islands were liberated in WW2, increased the demand for prostitution. Red-light district The tourist area of the Tumon district of Tamuning the island's de facto red-light district. There are many massage parlours, 75% opening 24 hours a day. There have been ongoing discussions about establishing a legitimate red-light district since 2006. A Bill was introduced to the Legislature in 2010 by vice- speaker Benjamin Cruz. It proposed re-zoning Tumon and having all the adult entertainment establishment in one designated area. The Bill did not pass into law. Sex trafficking Sex trafficking is a problem on the island, although due to poor reporting the extent is not fully known. In 2012, a 70-year-old female was sentenced to life imprisonment for sex trafficking. She owned the \\"Blue House\\" karaoke bar where women were trafficked to from Chuuk in Micronesia. The women were promised employment in restaurants or stores but on arrival were forced to work as prostitutes. The manageress of the bar and 2 police officers also faced charges for their involvement. A third police officer disciplined by the police department. It has been suggested that lax policies on massage parlours contributes to sex trafficking. ReferencesExternal links * Exotic 2016 feature documentary about the commercial sex industry on Guam.

Sealegs craft are aluminium fabricated boats fitted with either a hydraulic amphibious system or an Electric amphibious system. Both amphibious systems consist of three wheels ‚Äì one fitted to the bow and two fitted to the transom of the craft. In craft with the Hydraulic system, these wheels are lifted, lowered and driven by the hydraulic system which is powered by a petrol engine mounted on the deck, In craft with the Electric system, the wheels are equipped with brushless high-torque electric motors, and powered by a central 48-volt 7-kWh lithium battery pack. Sealegs began production in 2005, and as of September 2015 the company had sold 1000 units into 50 countries. Sealegs craft can travel up to 39 knots on water and up to 7.5 km/hr on land. The craft are used in both recreational, and commercial applications worldwide. The commercial applications include but aren't limited to Rescue/response, patrol, and tourism, in the USA, Malaysia, Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand. thumb thumb thumb  History  Sealegs amphibious craft were invented by New Zealander Maurice Bryham. After prototyping the craft, he partnered with David Mckee Wright to incorporate Sealegs International and begin production in 2005. In June 2005, business man Maurice Bryham set a new world record for crossing the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle at 43 minutes and 12 seconds. This defeated a record of 1 hour and 40 minutes, set the previous year by Richard Branson in a Gibbs Aquada. In early 2009, David Mckee Wright crossed the Cook Strait in a Sealegs craft ‚Äì the first time this was done in an amphibious vehicle. In 2013, Sealegs CEO David Mckee Wright completed a circumnavigation of the South Island of New Zealand in a Sealegs 7.7m RIB, the first time an amphibious vehicle had done so. In December 2014, Sealegs released a collaboration with New Zealand boat builder Stabicraft ‚Äì the Stabicraft 2100 ST (Sealegs Technology). In September 2015, Sealegs International announced that it had produced and shipped its 1000th Sealegs craft. In September 2018, International announced the release of the Sealegs Electric.

Sealegs extended run time technology added an oil cooling system, which allows the craft to run for 30 minutes within every hour without overheating. Power Steering ‚Äì Sealegs craft are fitted with a Power Steering system. This system can be switched on and off by use of a dash switch. Enhanced Power Steering - or EPS uses smart PLC and magnetic sensor technology to provide a smooth transition from water to land. While operating a Sealegs craft with EPS on water the bow wheel remains central, but when the craft switches to land operation wheel steering locks in. During the transition, EPS ensures wheel alignment is central. Automatic Braking System ‚Äì Sealegs craft are fitted with a hydraulic braking system. This system requires hydraulic pressure to release, meaning that when the craft inboard engine is turned off, or if there is a failure in the hydraulic system, the brakes will lock.

It is one academic genealogy among more than 50 of the Academic Family Tree comprising academic genealogies of people working in academic settings. Neurotree and Academic Family Tree have been used as sources of information for the history and prospects of various academic fields such as psychology, meteorology, organizational communication, and neuroscience. Neurotree has also been used to address infometrics and to research issues of scientific methodology. Neurotree and the other academic genealogies of Academic Family Tree are volunteer-run; accuracy is maintained by a group of volunteer editors. Hierarchical connections between parents and children are defined as any meaningful mentoring relationship (research assistant, graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, or research scientist) between researchers. Continuous records extend well into the Middle Ages and earlier. As of 5 February 2018, Neurotree contained 116,874 people with 135,773 connections among them. As of 5 February 2018, Academic Family Tree contained 689,800 people with 606,600 connections among them. Academic Family Tree encompasses a broad range of disciplines. As of 5 February 2018, there were 55 disciplines spanning science (e.g., human genetics, microbiology, and psychology), mathematics and philosophy, engineering, and the humanities (e.g., economics, law, and theology). The two databases are closely linked. A search for a person in Neurotree gives results not only from Neurotree, but also from any of the 54 other trees in Academic Family Tree. A search for a person in from any of the 54 other trees in Academic Family Tree or from the main page of Academic Family Tree gives results from every tree of Academic Family Tree. Tools All trees under Academic Family Tree, including Neurotree, have a set of tools similar to those of conventional genealogy applications. One is Distance that allows a user to enter two scholars' names and to determine the number of degrees of separation between the two. For example, the number of degrees of academic separation between Isaac Newton and Marie Curie is 11. History Neurotree was founded in January 2005 by Stephen V. David, then an assistant professor in the Oregon Hearing Research Center of Oregon Health and Science University, and by Benjamin Y. Hayden, an assistant professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Center for Visual Science, University of Rochester.http://www.rochester.edu/news/experts/faculty- experts/benjamin-hayden/ David and Hayden founded Academic Family Tree soon after founding Neurotree. In November 2014, David received funding for Neurotree from the Metaknowledge Network. In November 2016, David received funding for Academic Family Tree from the National Science Foundation (NSF) SciSIP Program. In July 2019, David again received funding for Neurotree from the NSF.{{cite weburl=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1933675&HistoricalAwards;=false Relation of Neurotree and Academic Family Tree to other academic genealogies One other notable discipline-specific academic genealogy is the Mathematics Genealogy Project.

The sketch pokes fun at the numerous degrees awarded by universities and folk high schools, which grant their recipients social status without providing any meaningful qualifications for the labor market. The term has since gained currency in German to refer to superfluous, useless, vanity-driven, or purchased academic qualifications (such as from a diploma mill), similar to the English terms underwater basket weaving or Mickey Mouse degree. Loriot sketch The sketch \\"Yodeling School\\" was produced by Radio Bremen as part of the episode Loriot VI and first broadcast on Das Erste on 7 December 1978. The sketch takes place in the Institute for Modern Yodeling, where the adult students are practicing yodeling texts (for example: \\"Holleri du d√∂dl di, diri diri dudl d√∂\\"). The yodeling instructor, Dr. Vogler is meticulously dictating the correct pronunciation to his students, who repeat his dictation in unison. In response to an incorrect answer (\\"D√∂ dudl d√∂\\") by Mrs. Hoppenstedt (Evelyn Hamann), Dr. Vogler corrects her and says that \\"D√∂ dudl d√∂ is future perfect tense used at sunrise.\\" Mrs. Hoppenstedt is interviewed after the course by a reporter Viktor Schmoller (Loriot) for the \\"Women's Journal of Radio Bremen\\". In the interview, Mrs. Hoppenstedt explains her participation in the course that as a housewife and mother, when the children are out of the house, she wants to have the feeling that she is standing on her own feet, and wants to have \\"something of her own\\", a \\"Jodeldiplom.\\" Jodlar-Prob A serious \\"yodeling diploma\\", the so- called \\"Jodlar-Prob\\" exists in the Allg√§u Alps.

The game offers players a wizarding experience, allowing them to cast spells by drawing glyphs, collect ingredients, brew various potions, battle magical creatures, and duel other players for glory and treasure.  Gameplay  Using a mobile device's GPS function and augmented reality technology, Maguss brings a wizard's world to life by populating real locations with beasts and magical creatures to fight, ingredients to gather, and treasure chests to unlock. Players choose from one of four classes (Paladin, Rogue, Druid, or Warden), each with its own blend of starting attributes, spells, strengths, and weaknesses. Players also customize an avatar to represent their character. Characters possess an array of skills (Brewing, Exploration, Herblore, Sorcery, Invocation, Charms, and Dark Arts) that they can raise by accomplishing related activities. For example, collecting and opening a chest raises Exploration, while casting Sorcery spells raises the Sorcery skill. By exploring the world map, players may encounter monsters, harvest ingredients, and discover treasure. They can also replenish their health by walking from one location to another. Players raise their overall Player Level from defeating opponents‚Äîmonsters or other players. As they advance in level, they can raise their attributes and gain access to various tiered equipment and wandering monster encounters. = Spellcasting = Spellcasting in Maguss allows players to engage monsters (and each other) in arcane combat. Casting spells involves unlocking them, assigning them to glyphs, practicing their use, and applying them in duels. Spells fall under four categories: Sorcery (direct damage), Charms (healing and buffs), Invocations (defense), and Dark Arts (damage while also debuffing enemies). Players unlock additional spells as they gain experience in a particular spell category. Players have access to a set of glyphs which function as slots for spells. To ready a spell, the player must first assign it to a specific glyph. In combat, they have to draw the corresponding glyph within a given time limit to cast the spell it contains. This adds an element of skill to casting, as one needs to trace glyphs both quickly and correctly to unleash their effects. = Dueling = In Maguss, players may challenge monsters or other players in a combat. Duels are semi-turned based: each combat cycle, both participants cast spells during the allotted time, after which the spell effects are resolved one at a time, in a sequence alternating between the player and the enemy. The winner is awarded gold and experience points. Another game mechanic to duels is Heat, indicated by a meter and representing a wizard's stamina for spellcasting. The more powerful a spell, the more Heat it generates when used. Once a player overheats, they cannot cast a spell until they cool off again. The game offers 2 PvP modes: Proximity Mode, where players may duel nearby wizards, or a Ranked League through a global matchmaking system. Ranked Leagues run for 30-day long seasons, each with their own unique theme. For each Ranked League win, players earn Competitive Points which they can exchange for that season's unique armour illusions. Based on their final rank at the end of the season, players gain various rewards consisting of Competitive Points, League Badges, and Season icons. = Brewing = Another activity players may partake in is potion-making. By using recipes, player may collect the ingredients to use in a potion brewing mini-game, the results of which determines the drink's effectiveness. Potions may have a multitude of effects, ranging from healing to buffing stats. More advanced recipes become available as the player improves their Brewing Skill. = Equipment = Players may collect a variety of equipment: wands, headgear, tops, bottoms, rings, amulets, and books. Each piece of gear can boost stats or provide a unique benefit, such as giving bonus gold or experience points upon winning duels. These boosts depend on the item's tier as well as its quality (Poor, Good, Mint, Excellent, Legendary). Besides regular equipment, players can also wear armour illusions. These can be worn over equipment, allowing players to alter their look while maintaining their current gear. = Monetization = The monetization model consists of in-app purchases and optional rewarded ads. The game includes 2 currencies: Gold (soft currency) and Magic Dust (premium currency). While some items (potions and recipes) can be purchased for both currencies others (equipment, spells) are only available for gold. Luxuries, such as cosmetics (armor illusions, alternate spell effects), ingredient and magical creature packs and boosters are only available for premium currency. All ads are optional and rewarding. Watching an ad can speed up brewing time, prolong booster for a little bit more or earn Bazaar tokens. In Bazaar (a special shop category) players can exchange Bazaar tokens earned from watching ads for premium items such as armor illusions, boosters or even Magic Dust.  Development = History = Ondrej Tokar first conceived of Maguss in July 2014, and later formed the Software Company Mawa s.r.o., a remote indie team based in Central Europe. By June 2015, the team had a prototype of a Maguss Wand ready for a kickstarter campaign, which launched a month later. On October 10, 2017, Maguss launched on Indiegogo, eventually reaching 214% of targeted funding within 30 days. Game testing followed until November 10. December 2017 saw the end of the IndieGogo campaign and the launch of the closed alpha iteration. = Maguss Wand = Part of Maguss's development was the creation of a device that mimicked a magic wand. The Maguss Wand provides an immersive approach to spellcasting‚Äîinstead of drawing glyphs on their mobile device, players may trace them in the air instead. Composed of a 350mm long plastic body with a single button and micro USB port for charging, the Maguss Wand is compatible with Android (version 4.1 Jellybean and newer) and iOS (version 7) and tethers to mobile devices using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The wand may be customized by replacing the grip, tip, and metal rings. Due to the high cost of mass production, distribution of the Maguss wand is currently on hold, pending investors‚Äô help. = Future = Maguss is set for a soft beta launch in February 2018, to last until December 2018. The team is set to add additional features to the core game, but plans have not yet been made public. While Mawa s.r.o remains interested in continuing Maguss Wand production, its future remains uncertain.  Awards  In December 2016, Maguss won the Slovak Startup Awards in the Art and Design category. In March 2017, Maguss also received the Slovak Forbes 30 under 30 Award. It has also received mentions in CNET, Engadget, Nerdmuch, and other media.

The show starred comedian Les Dawson (1931‚Äì1993), who had previously starred in the ITV sketch comedy programme Sez Les (1969‚Äì76), followed by Dawson and Friends (1977). The Les Dawson Show also featured sketch comedy, as well as stand-up comedy, guest appearances, dance numbers, and musical performances. Overview=Series 1‚Äì2= The Dougie Squires Dancers, pictured here in January 1968‚Äîten years before their first appearance on The Les Dawson Show In the first series, transmitted in 1978, Dawson co- hosted the show with Scottish singer-songwriter Lulu. In addition to comedy sketches and songs by Dawson, Lulu, and guests artists, each episode featured performances by the Dougie Squires Dancers, with choreography by Dougie Squires. The musical director at this time was John Coleman, and the arranger was Alan Roper. Episodes of this first series aired fortnightly rather than weekly. No new episodes of the show aired for more than three years. Then, in May 1981, BBC1 transmitted a bank holiday special that reunited Dawson with his longtime comedy compatriot Roy Barraclough, and Sez Les writer Terry Ravenscroft. It also replaced the Dougie Squires Dancers with Kids International, a multi-ethnic singing and dancing group assembled by the show's producer, Ernest Maxin.Barfe (2012), p. 146 Maxin, Barraclough, and Kids International stayed with the show through its second series‚Äîwhich premiered eight months later, in January 1982. For series two, Alyn Ainsworth joined-on as bandleader, and musical arrangements were handled by some new contributors to the programme, including Ivor Raymonde and Max Harris. Roy Barraclough wrote and/or performed. Later that year, Kids International got their own 30-minute Christmas special. The Kids International Show aired on 24 December 1982; Maxin produced and directed, while Alyn Ainsworth and orchestra provided music.Perry et al. (2014), p. 329 =Series 3‚Äì4= For the third series, which aired in 1983, Maxin remained as producer, but Ronnie Hazlehurst became the show's musical director, and comedian Eli Woods joined the cast. Kids International, however, were becoming so popular there was a threat that they would upstage Dawson. Dawson said that he advocated for their removal until Maxin and Jim Moir (the BBC's head of variety) finally relented.Barfe (2012), p. 167 To replace of Kids International, Maxin conducted auditions to assemble a tap-dancing act named the Roly Polys. When the selection process was complete, the troupe had seven dancers: Marie Ashton, Bea Aston, Sue Cadman, Audrey Leybourne, Thea Macintyre, Ann Stephanie, and lead dancer Mo Moreland.Barfe (2012), pp. 167‚Äì68 As a matter of BBC policy, Maxin himself was obligated to retire when he turned 60 in 1983.Barfe (2012), p. 168 Dawson was not happy with Maxin's replacement, Robin Nash. Nash was the former head of variety at the BBC, and had also served as head of comedy. Even so, Dawson and (show co-writer) Terry Ravenscroft found the man to lack an innate sense of comedy.Barfe (2012) p. 169 Nash's tenure as the show's producer lasted for one series. After BBC1 transmitted the fourth series of The Les Dawson Show in 1984, Dawson took over Terry Wogan's role as host of Blankety Blank, a comedy game show on the same channel. Meanwhile, Dawson's wife Margaret was gravely ill. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer years earlier, and finally succumbed in April 1986. After her death, Dawson swore off the \\"wife jokes\\" for which he had become known. No new episodes of The Les Dawson Show were produced until a Christmas special in 1987. Comedy writers David Nobbs and Barry Cryer were recruited for the special, but much of the content was material rehashed from Dawson's earlier sketch comedy series, Sez Les.Barfe (2012), p. 185 BBC1 repeated the special on 21 December 1988. =Series 5= Dawson was still host of Blankety Blank when The Les Dawson Show resumed for a fifth series in 1989, and he was optimistic about the show's return. He recalls taping the series premiere at the BBC's Television Centre in London: \\"We had a twenty-five piece orchestra under the baton of John Coleman, John Nettles to partner me in the sketches, and, as a special guest, Shirley Bassey\\". Roy Barraclough was among the scriptwriters, and the show had a new producer: Stewart Morris. When the 1989 series aired, however, the ratings disappointed Dawson greatly. He ascribed the failure to a decision made by BBC1 to premiere the show during the broadcast run of Blankety Blank, rather than after. The final episode of The Les Dawson Show was a Christmas special that aired on 30 December 1989‚Äîfive weeks after the series five finale, and a few days after the Blankety Blank Christmas special. Blankety Blank, too, was soon cancelled; the 1989‚Äì1990 series was its last until BBC1 revived the programme in 1998, with Paul O'Grady as host. Dawson died of a heart attack in 1993. Episodes In addition to five series of six episodes, there were three Christmas specials and a bank holiday special.

This lake extends in the townships of Poutrincourt and Bouteroue. It is located west of the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second. The western part of the lake Poutrincourt hydrographic slope is accessible via the forest road R0223 (east-west direction) which passes to the north and a road branch on the east side of the lake. The forest road route 167 passes north-east of Nicabau Lake, connecting Chibougamau to Saint-F√©licien, Quebec. The Canadian National Railway runs along this road. The surface of Poutrincourt Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid- November to mid-April.  Geography Toponymy Formerly, according to various sources, this body of water was designated \\"Lake Ascatiche\\", \\"Lake Ascatscie\\", \\"Lake Askatiche\\", \\"Lake Askitichi\\", \\"Lake Scatsi\\" or \\"Lake Skatsi\\". The ancient appellations lake Ascatiche, Askitichi, Scatsie or Ascatsie, reported in the Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925) are deformations of the Innu expression \\"oskat assi\\" meaning \\"new earth\\", \\"where the wood is green\\" or \\"small raw skin\\" according to the authors. The toponym ‚ÄúPoutrincourt‚Äù, which appears on a map of the region of Chibougamau in 1934, is borrowed from the name of the township where it is and honors the memory of Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt and Saint- Just (1557-1615), a character intimately linked to the beginning of the colonization of Acadie in the 17th century. With Sieur de Monts, among others, he spent the winter of 1604-1605 on Sainte-Croix Island at the mouth of the river of the same name, on the border separating New Brunswick from the State of Maine. In 1606, Poutrincourt returned to Acadia as lieutenant governor of the fledgling colony. He made several other stays in Port-Royal, notably in 1607, in 1610 and in 1614.Source: Names and places of Quebec, work of the Commission de toponymie published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a dictionary illustrated in print, and in the form of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.

(2006). Tying Odysseus to the Mast: Evidence from a Commitment Savings Product in the Philippines.

(2009). Spousal Control and Intra-Household Decision-Making: An Experimental Study in the Philippines. American Economic Review, 99(4), pp. 1245-1277. * Most of the (surprisingly small) variance in trust between trust games and dictator games played in Russia, South Africa, and the United States, can be accounted by reciprocity expectations, with a smaller role for unconditional kindness, while variance in trustworthiness is mainly accounted for by unconditional kindness (with Iris Bohnet and Nikita Piankov);Ashraf, N., Bohnet, I., Piankov, N. (2006). Decomposing trust and trustworthiness. Experimental Economics, 9(3), pp. 193-208. * Women (in Zambia) who are given concealable contraceptives in the presence of their husbands are 19% less likely to seek family planning services, 25% less likely to use the contraceptives, and 17% more likely to give birth (with Erica Field and Jean Lee);Ashraf, N., Field, E., Lee, J.

Untitled contribution to \\"Joining the BBC: A report by the BBC Pensioners' Association's Memory Project\\", n.p. the sister school of Dulwich College. She left school with six GCE O levels and a swimming certificate so that, unlike most BBC radio controllers, she was not a graduate, but, as she quipped, \\"an unqualified success\\". She believed, however, that this gave her a better understanding of what her audience wanted: \\"I am able to represent the listeners because I am one of them\\". Elocution, ballet and piano lessons, and visits to seaside concert parties in Eastbourne and to local venues such as the Croydon Grand Theatre and Streatham Hill Theatre, had made her keen to go into show business, but her father suggested that she should prudently pursue \\"Show Business with a PENSION\\", and this meant the BBC. From Clerk-Typist to Senior Secretary Line presented herself for interview at the BBC at the age of 16, while still at school, and declared that her long-term ambition was to be a producer, arousing much amusement in the lady who was interviewing her. But she did land a job as a clerk-typist and began work at the BBC at a salary of ¬£6.13s a week, rising to ¬£9.5s.6d after she passed the Proficiency Tests for Junior Secretaries in June 1959.;The Times (3 October 1989), p. 7. She took full advantage of the free tickets that were available to attend BBC audience shows at then famous studios such as the Paris Theatre, formerly a cinema, at 12 Lower Regent Street; 201 Piccadilly; and the Playhouse Theatre in Northumberland Avenue. Line moved on from Administration to a job as Production Secretary in the BBC Light Programme, the forerunner of Radio 2. She spent some time as second secretary on the comedy series The Navy Lark and worked for a short while on the variety programme the Billy Cotton Band Show. After she became secretary to Brian Matthew, who was then, most unusually, both a BBC producer and presenter, she was involved with two major pop programmes of the period - Saturday Club and Easy Beat. She also coined the title for a series on which she worked that featured an up-and-coming group: Pop Go the Beatles.Howlett, Kevin (1996). The Beatles at the BBC. London: BBC Books, p. 19. All she could later recall of the Beatles themselves, however, was that \\"they made paper darts out of [her] carefully typed scripts and threw them at each other\\", which she deeply resented. When Brian Matthew was especially hard-pressed, he would allow Line to undertake tasks that exceeded her remit as a Secretary, such as talking to artists about the songs they would be performing and, occasionally, choosing a record for the programme. Still only 20 years old, she found this \\"very exciting\\" and began to develop the skills that would stand her in good stead as a producer. On 22 February 1961, Line's twenty- first birthday, Matthew let her cast a whole Easy Beat show; she took much time and care over this and aimed to make her selection as \\"dispassionate\\" as possible, but was glad to be able justifiably to include one of her favourite groups as they were then chart-toppers: Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen. Line continued to progress upwards through the Secretarial Grades in BBC Radio but reached a ceiling beyond which no secretary could rise. From Producer's Assistant to Producer Line therefore moved to television and became a Producer's Assistant (PA) in Light Entertainment, where she worked on several notable musical, drama and comedy series: Juke Box Jury; the very first episode of Top of the Pops, broadcast on 1 January 1964 and starting off with The Rolling Stones live from a converted church in Manchester; Z-Cars; Blandings Castle, based on the P.G. Wodehouse stories; and Meet the Wife with Thora Hird and Freddie Frinton. At that time, however, very few women could access the higher echelons of television, and Line once more found her upward progress blocked. In contrast, BBC Radio was starting to encourage its women secretaries to train as producers and so Line returned to radio, her first love, as a junior producer. Despite the greater opportunities BBC radio offered to women, gender discrimination remained: Line was one of six new producers, three men and three women, but the three permanent staff posts went to the men and the three temporary posts to the women; the rationale for this was that the men probably had families to support while the women had only themselves and were likely to get married eventually. Line was, however, delighted to be a producer \\"in the last glow of the golden days of Radio. The old Light Programme - the days of really funny comedy, of live music and massive listening figures. The days when Radio was king\\". One of her first assignments was on the series Music While You Work. She went on to work with many popular music stars of the time, including Victor Sylvester, Edmundo Ros, the Oscar Rabin Band, Cyril Stapleton and Acker Bilk. When the Light Programme morphed into Radio 2 in 1967, Line became a producer of the series RoundaboutRadio Times (3 October 1967). and then produced Folk on Friday, introduced by her future husband, Jim Lloyd, who had an extensive knowledge of the folk scene.;Radio Times (10 April 1970); Line and Lloyd would marry in 1972; she has two step-children from Lloyd's first marriage. Line also produced Tony Brandon's afternoon show;Radio Times(8 July 1974). Sam Costa's late afternoon show;; Radio Times (20 October 1975). Joe \\"Mr Piano\\" Henderson's afternoon show; early morning shows hosted by Tom EdwardsRadio Times (12 March 1977). and Colin Berry;Radio Times (14 March 1977). and John Dunn's Drivetime.Radio Times (18 April 1977). From Chief Assistant to Controller By 1980, Line had decided to move from production into management; she became a Chief Assistant, a Controller's right-hand person with particular responsibility for network scheduling. She was Chief Assistant to David Hatch, who was Controller of Radio 2 and then of Radio 4. An especially challenging task in this role was the scheduling of Radio 4 bulletins on the Falklands War, which Line discharged successfully. Throughout the war Radio 4 kept all its listeners and gained many hundreds of thousands more who still used radio, rather than television, as their primary information source. In late 1985, Line returned to Radio 2 as the network's first woman Head of Music; Bryant Marriott was the Controller at that time. Line aimed to clarify the station's musical identity in terms that would enhance its appeal to older listeners; her keywords were \\"melody, familiarity, excellence and breadth\\"'.Carmody, Robin (28 November 2003). \\"Out of the Light 2\\". Retrieved 4 May 2018. Line was quoted in the Times (21 January 1986) as saying: ‚ÄúRadio 2 had been drifting about without a clear music policy. The youth audience has been overindulged and now it is time to return to the over-40s. There are an awful lot of over-40s in the country and perhaps some of them have given us up in the past\\".\\"Music for over-40s on Radio 2\\", The Times (21 January 1986), p. 5. Big band and jazz would predominate on Mondays, \\"big strings sounds\\" and a series about past and present musical stars on Tuesdays, and folk music on Wednesdays. Line's focus was on daytime programming, when Radio 2 had the most listeners, but she did recruit Paul Jones, an actor and once the singer with the group Manfred Mann, to host a new blues and country music series in the evening. Not everyone welcomed the over-40s emphasis: DJ David Hamilton, for example, departed from Radio 2 in high dudgeon, calling the network \\"geriatric\\" and complaining that \\"there‚Äôs only so much Max Bygraves and Vera Lynn you can play\\". But Line's changes proved popular with a substantial audience. One of Line's most notable achievements in this phase of her career was to persuade Bryant Marriott that the network should hire Derek Jameson, whom she had seen on a BBC 2 TV programme called Do They Mean Us? and thought would be the person for radio. Jameson began presenting Radio 2's breakfast show on 7 April 1986; in mid-May the BBC declared that he had \\"increased the number of listeners by 500,000, or 25 per cent\\" and Jameson himself was reported as claiming that listeners' letters \\"were coming in at the rate of 500 a week and all but a handful approved of his style\\"Times (20 May 1986). \\"Jameson's style sets radio record\\". At the end of the decade Line succeeded Bryant Marriott as Controller. Line as Controller On 1 January 1990, Line took up her post as Controller of Radio 2. Her aim was \\"to make Radio 2 as good as I possibly could, and the top station\\"'. Over the next five years she turned it from a network that had been \\"something of a joke\\" into one that started to be \\"taken much more seriously\\", as Robert Hanks put it in an Independent article in 1996. Line quickly established her authority and stamped her vision on the station: in her first three months, she moved Brian Matthew from the Round Midnight slot he had occupied for 12 years to the Saturday morning programme Sounds of the '60s, and dismissed Adrian Love. A Daily Mail article called her \\"The axe woman of the airwaves\\" and drew attention to the fact that she had even shortened the show presented by her own husband, Jim Lloyd, from 90 to 60 minutes. The article also, however, quoted Line's rationale for her actions: \\"I do not make decisions on a whim ... there's a good reason for everything\\". She argued that Brian Matthew's show \\"was no longer relevant to the 1990s\\" and that his audience was \\"extremely loyal\\" but \\"small\\", while Adrian Love's audience figures were falling and his removal would enable Line to extend Gloria Hunniford's very popular programme and \\"bring in more 'stars'\\"Ross, Deborah (22 March 1990). \\"The axe woman of the airwaves\\". Daily Mail, p. 7. As Controller, Line pursued a programming policy that combined music aimed at listeners in their fifties, as she herself was at the time, with a thrice- weekly arts series, and discussions on contemporary issues. She recruited Sheridan Morley to present a weekend arts programme that, in Sue Gaisford's view, proved to be as good as, and sometimes better than, its competitors on Radio 3 and Radio 4; moved Derek Jameson, in January 1992, from the breakfast show to a four-day-a-week late-night slot between 10.30pm and 12.00 midnight with his wife, Ellen; persuaded Terry Wogan to return to Radio 2 in January 1993, where he took over the breakfast show Good Morning UK! (duly renamed Wake Up to Wogan) from the Australian broadcaster Brian Hayes; inaugurated Hayes's own weekly phone-in current affairs programme Hayes over Britain, and his Saturday and Sunday slots; secured Michael Aspel's services for a Sunday morning programme; and, in 1993, brought in Sarah Kennedy to front the early morning show The Dawn Patrol. The BBC Annual Report in July 1994 praised Radio 2 for keeping its audience share the year before in spite of greater competition and for retaining the loyalty of its older listeners. Radio Joint Audience Research (RAJAR) figures released on 24 October 1994 showed it had become Britain's most popular radio station in terms of audience share - 12.9 per cent compared to its nearest rival, Radio 1, which had 11.8 per cent (though the latter still had more listeners).\\"Media / Talk of the Trade: Radio 2 is tops\\", The Independent (25 October 1994). During 1994, Radio 2 featured appearances by a constellation of stars - for example, Jos√© Carreras, Cybill Shepherd and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, some of whom performed exclusively for the network. It also offered a series of classic musicals such as Finian's Rainbow, Guys and Dolls, Salad Days and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\"1994: A year in the life of BBC Radio 2\\" (London: BBC Radio 2. implementing one of Line's clear policy objectives: \\"In the same way that Radio 3 is the home of the opera, we have consciously decided that Radio 2 is to be the home of the musical\\". Radio 2 also offered programmes tackling controversial and difficult topics such as testicular cancer and prostate problems, in the July 1994 campaign Man Matters, and domestic violence, in the October 1994 programme When Home Is Where The Hurt Is. In the spring of 1995, Radio 2 was named UK Station of the Year at the Sony Radio Awards.Brown, Maggie. \\"'Cinderella of radio' is station of the year\\". The Independent (27 April 1995). In the same year, Line was elected a Fellow of the Radio Academy\\"The Line Family\\", \\"Frances Mary Line OBE. Retrieved 6 May 2018. and in the 1996 New Year Honours list she was appointed OBE for services to broadcasting. Line knew that her network lost around 200,000 listeners annually to what was called in the BBC \\"Radio Grim Reaper\\" and she aimed to attract younger people to Radio 2 by scheduling \\"access points\\" for \\"the Beatles generation\\" - itself, of course, growing older - while retaining the loyalty of its core audience. She could still, however, sometimes anger segments of that core audience. Her temporary substitution of a Gilbert and Sullivan season for programmes by two much-loved Sunday presenters - Benny Green and Alan Dell - provoked a phalanx of elderly listeners to picket Broadcasting House in protest, bearing banners declaring \\"LINE IS OUT OF ORDER\\". Hate mail was frequent, as Line recalled: \\"I've lost count of the number of letters which began 'You cow... ' or 'Are You completely mad...'\\". Once when she moved David Jacobs's programme, she received a picture of herself, cut from a newspaper, with her eyes poked out. Line's husband Jim Lloyd thought she received more insults because she was a woman; she was also menaced by a stalker and, for over five years, by a never-identified person completing small advertisements in her name so that she received a hearing aid and then several daily phone calls from people selling insurance or double glazing or proposing to deliver concrete to her home. There were also, however, many accolades from listeners, for instance from \\"Norm\\", who cut out cartoon strips of Garfield the Cat, whited out the words in the balloons, and put in his own texts praising Radio 2. A \\"Mr S\\" from Hull invoked Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in a laudatory verse: For she doth teach the torches to burn bright And entertains me late into the night With harmony, and melody and mirth On Radio 2 - the greatest show on earth. Line retired from \\"the greatest show on earth\\" in February 1996 and Jim Moir replaced her. Life after retirement Line moved with her husband to Eastbourne, where she had once enjoyed the concert parties that contributed to her desire to enter show business. Under her married name of Frances Lloyd, she is a Vice- President of the Eastbourne Society and a member of the Eastbourne Ashridge Circle, possibly Britain's largest lecture society; she has been a Director of Marlborough Court (Eastbourne) Ltd since 2012Companies House.

This lake straddles the townships of Buade and Poutrincourt. It is located west of the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second. The western portion of the Buade Lake hydrographic slope is accessible via the R1032 forest road (North-South direction) which passes through the Ventadour River valley, on the west side. The forest road route 167 passes northeast of Nicabau Lake, connecting Chibougamau to Saint-F√©licien, Quebec; a secondary road is detached to serve the east side of Poutrincourt Lake. The Canadian National Railway runs along route 167.

The term was first used in this context around 1914 by Hugh T. Patrick, who was writing about trigeminal neuralgia, a condition in which pain fibers in the trigeminal nerve become hypersensitive. In people with trigeminal neuralgia, even a light touch to some part of the body‚Äîoften a tooth or a part of the face‚Äîcan give rise to an extended period of excruciating pain. Patrick referred to the sensitive part of the body as the \\"dolorogenic zone\\", and used the term \\"trigger zone\\" as a simpler equivalent. Through the 1920s and 1930s the term came into steadily wider use, but almost always in the context of neuralgia.Source: Google Scholar search for \\"trigger zone\\" in the year range 1920-1940. Starting in the late 1930s, other types of stimulation and other types of responses were characterized as having the properties of a trigger zone. In 1940, for example, Morison and Dempsey observed that a small area of the cerebral cortex could be triggered when electrical stimulation would evoke widespread activity in other parts of the cerebral cortex. In 1944 Paul Wilcox described triggering of epileptic seizure by electrical stimulation of another area of the cerebral cortex. The chemoreceptor trigger zone is an area of the medulla oblongata in which many types of chemical stimulation can provoke nausea and vomiting. This area was first identified and named in 1951 by Herbert L. Borison and Kenneth R. Brizzee. Parts of cells, rather than parts of the body, can also behave as trigger zones. The axon hillock of a neuron possesses the highest density of voltage-gated Na+ channels, and is therefore the region where it is easiest for the action potential threshold to be reached.

Benton married Reina Barrios on May 17, 1886, at the consulate of Guatemala in New York, whose consul was Enrique Toriello. Biography On April 4, the vanquished arrived in Guatemala City. His capacity and courage were recognized when the National Assembly promoted him to general of division and to the position of undersecretary of State in the office of the War. Then, President Barillas, who feared the influence of Reina Barrios for his great military prestige and for being a direct relative of the late Justo Rufino Barrios, appointed him Consul of Guatemala in Berlin, but when he arrived in Europe, the Consul in France informed him that his credentials had been withdrawn during the crossing and he practically evicted him from the consulate. Reina Barrios returned to the United States, where he met his future wife Algeria Brenton, who was 17 years old, had a distinguished family from Virginia, and worked as a vedette in New Orleans, Louisiana Algeria Benton and Jos√© Mar√≠a Reyna Barrios married on 17 May 1886. During these trips, Reina Barrios learned to speak English and French properly and write German correctly. In 1887, after returning to Guatemala, he assumed the Vice Presidency of the National Legislative Assembly and later in 1889, he was imprisoned by the government of President Barillas for his alleged participation in the revolutionary movements of Mataquescuintla, until the Superior Council of War decreed his freedom when proven innocent; while he was in prison, his wife Algeria Benton had to ask for help from Minister Antonio Batres J√°uregui so that he could bring food to Reina Barrios. After this situation he voluntarily moved to the United States; When the \\"First Totoposte War\\" took place in December 1891 after the coup d'√©tat of the Ezetas in El Salvador, he returned to Guatemala to collaborate with the army, but peace had already been signed with El Salvador without having initiated hostilities. . When the presidential contest began, he told General Barillas that he would take care of him and not prosecute him when he left the presidency. As a formal position, Algeria de Reyna held the post of First Lady of Guatemala, during the presidency of Jos√© Mar√≠a Reyna Barrios. By 1898, the relationship between Reina Barrios and Algeria Benton was cold and distant and had been for more than a year; But the lady was six months pregnant when the murder occurred. During a visit by the doctor, Reina Barrios made it clear that the problems that afflicted her were not pregnancy, but because of her alcoholism, making it clear to the doctor that the son of Mrs. Reina Barrios was not the president's. After the death of her husband, Algeria Benton lost her mind and returned to the United States leaving unresolved issues in Guatemala; the writer and historian Antonio Batres J√°uregui, who was an advisor to President Reina Barrios, indicates that perhaps it was due to remorse, since Algeria Benton had been pregnant with an extramarital affair with General Salvador Toledo, Queen's Chief of Staff, and to whom insistently He was accused of being implicated in the president's murder. Its luxurious residence located on the Paseo 30 de Junio, Villa Algeria, was abandoned for a long time. She left with a baby in her arms, whom she named Consuelo. She returned to New Orleans, and began to abuse alcohol and recreational drugs, eventually to be arrested in London and New York, accused of intoxication. Her relationship with her daughter was so distant that the New Orleans Times Picayune reported that the widow had abandoned her daughter on the steps of the Magdalena church in Paris. As a result of the poor health of the widow, in addition to her drug addiction and alcoholism, Consuelo was admitted to a convent in the city of London, on the orders of the Minister of Guatemala in London, Jos√© Tible, brother of the mother of Guatemalan chronicler Enrique G√≥mez Carrillo, who coincidentally, would also be Guatemala's consul in Hamburg. For the new year of 1910, Algeria Benton entered the Touro-Shakespeare Asylum in New Orleans, penniless and almost blind. The Touro-Shakespeare Asylum was built with funds left for that purpose by southern philanthropist Juha P. Touro, and was located on present-day Daneel Street, between Joseph Street and Nashville Avenue. The building was demolished in 1932. Consuelo Reina Barrios lived under the tutelage of President Manuel Estrada Cabrera who had instructed Jos√© Tible to send her to live in a convent in England: the St Mary's Abbey School in Hendon Middlesex. Until then, she went to her mother to visit her from time to time accompanied by a nurse who cared for her, because by then Mrs. Benton de Reina was already immersed in a serious problem of drug addiction and alcoholism Algeria Benton lived her last years in New Orleans and died April 20, 1915, while visiting friends in Biloxi, Mississippi. By then, Consuelo had already returned to Guatemala, and there she became seriously ill with Spanish influenza after the earthquakes of 1917 and 1918 and was sent to New Orleans, United States in 1918, because her grandmother, C.B.

It is the 7th largest and 6th most populous island of the islands in Nagasaki Prefecture. The island, 33.16 km¬≤ in area, had 9767 inhabitants . The island is dominated by the Citrus unshiu plantations. The island access is by road and rail transport from the mainland of Kyushu through seven bridges linking it to Sasebo and Saikai cities. The main access routes are Japan National Route 202 and Japan National Route 205. Geography The Hario island is composed of rhyolite lava flows, resulting in very irregular coastline, except of north-eastern portion where the smoother tidal channel approximately 100 m wide separate Hario island from the Kyushu island. The heavily eroded lava plateau is mostly unsuitable for rice agriculture, with the island dominated by the Citrus unshiu orchards instead. The northern part of the island is hilly, forming an intricate valley network. The bay on the northern tip of the island houses US military station. The housings are concentrated on the north-east, along the tidal channel. History Up to J≈çmon period the obsidian commonly found on the Hario Island was an important raw material for the stone tools. Later, an attempt was made to make porcelain using a local rhyolite outcrops, but was abandoned. Following a severe power struggle between ≈åmura Domain and Hirado Domain during Sengoku period, the island was eventually absorbed into Hirado Domain and development resumed. Thanks to the shallow sea around, land reclamation was extensive starting from the Edo period. By the end of Edo period, the island housed a Smoke signal station to notify Hirado Island of the passage of the Dutch merchants to the Dejima. In 1936, the has connected Hario island to the Saikai city, putting the end to the ferry operations. Currently islanders are focusing on citrus unshiu, livestock breeding and cultured pearl production, and small scale fishing too to earn a living.

It is necessary to account for changes in the Earth's oceans to correct for the marine reservoir effect.

Livin Lite RV was an American manufacturer of recreation vehicles sold under the CampLite and QuickSilver brands. It was based in Shipshewana, Indiana. The company was most recently managed by KZ Inc., a subsidiary of Thor Industries. Livin Lite made truck campers, fold- down tent camping trailers, travel trailers, and toy haulers. They were known for their advanced lightweight aluminum construction techniques. In February 2018 KZ told dealers that Livin Lite production would cease in the first half of 2018. History The company was founded in 2003 in Wakarusa, Indiana by Scott Tuttle and acquired by Thor Industries in 2013. Tuttle's mission was to create lightweight all aluminum trailers with no wood that would last for decades--he called them \\"generational campers,\\" because they were built so they could be passed down from one generation to the next. Tuttle remained president until 2015. =Tuttle years= The QuickSilver toy hauler was the primary product line in the early years. Livin Lite also built trailers to transport snowmobiles, para-planes, motorcycles, and racecars, along with mobile offices and toy haulers. Most of these were custom builds. In 2009, the first Livin Lite 10-foot travel trailer was produced under the CampLite name, featuring aluminum laminated interior walls. 2011 brought about the first use of liquid propane appliances, including an electric water heater, furnace, and the replacement of the hand pump with an actual water tank and pump. The optional porta-potty was replaced with a cassette toilet. Azdel, a composite made of a blend of polypropylene and fiberglass, became available shortly after CampLite‚Äôs introduction, and replaced the cold look of the interior aluminum sidewalls. The change from aluminum interior walls to Azdel was popular, allowing for a softer, warmer interior by offering wood-look cabinetry while staying away from wood products. Livin Lite started offering two different colors of wood-look Azdel, and were able to maintain aluminum- framed cabinetry construction. In 2012, the CampLite travel trailer front profile was redesigned to be more aerodynamic. In 2013 they launched a fifth wheel trailer built with the same construction principles: aluminum chassis, aluminum frame, and no wood. Three lengths were offered: 26, 28, and, 32 foot. =Thor/KZ era= The Thor era began in the fall of 2013, but Tuttle stayed on until 2015. Thor's Crossroad's RV briefly managed Livin Lite, but Thor's KZ took over in early 2016. A few months after taking over the management of Livin Lite, KZ's senior managers stated their commitment to Livin Lite's all- aluminum roots in an interview with Rick Kessler of RV Business magazine. KZ president Aram Koltookian discussed the value proposition of Livin Lite's success in creating lightweight products. As an example of KZ's commitment, Koltookian highlighted how KZ General Manager Dave Boggs was able to re-source lighter materials removing 458 pounds from Livin Lite's 21-foot bunkhouse trailer. RV Pro magazine reported on February 14, 2018 that dealers were told by KZ that Livin Lite's entire product line was being discontinued.  Construction  The lightweight all aluminum frame, including the chassis, makes Livin Lite's towable products atypical in the RV industry. Even Airstream, with its aluminum shell and monocoque construction, utilizes a heavier steel chassis and builds its trailers on top of a wood floor. Floor rot and rusted frames are big problems in recreational vehicles, including Airstreams. Wood frames (walls and roof) are common in recreational vehicles and are no more durable than wood floors when they get wet. Livin Lite eliminated both the steel chassis, wood floors, wood frames, and wood finishes, creating a product designed so it won't rust or rot over time. Livin Lite cabinetry too is built on aluminum frames. Azdel is also used extensively in Livin Lite products, including as a wood substitute for cabinet finishes, in the walls, and on the roof. Prior to 2015, CampLite and QuickSilver trailers had aluminum floors, walls, roofs, and exterior. Under Crossroads and KZ more fiberglass and composites were utilized instead of aluminum throughout. KZ has remained committed to the no wood and no steel vision of Livin Lite's founding years. During the brief Crossroads RV period circa 2015, wood was introduced to some models, which alienated some of the customer base. In 2016 KZ said they were returning to the company's no wood vision, although they would give customers the choice of wood on some cabinetry--while the infrastructure of the trailer would remain true to Tuttle's vision.

The company is led by its CEO Bryan Brister.  Overview  The company developed Capacitive DeIonization (CapDI), a desalination method that removes dissolved salts from brackish water. In 2016, the company opened an automated robotic production facility in Texas.  Capacitive deionization (CapDI)  Capacitive deionization (CapDI) is an electrical process that combines oppositely charged electrodes with anionic and cationic selective membranes. When salt water flows into the cell between an electric field, the ions move through the selective membranes to the oppositely charged electrodes and desalinated water leaves the cell. When the surface of both electrodes is covered with ions, the electrodes are cleaned by reversing the electrode polarity. The ions are pushed from the electrodes and are trapped between the membranes. The concentrated brine that forms between both membranes can then be removed from the cell. When the polarity of the electrodes is reset to normal, the cell is ready for use again. In 2017, the company launched a point-of-use (PoU) device named DiUse. The device is self cleaning and delivers no-salt water softening and low cost brackish water desalination. The device is internet enabled and can be remotely monitored and controlled.  Partners  Atlanta-based AquaRecycle, a water recycling systems developer, partnered with Voltea to soften the water for laundry reuse in the United States. The company collaborated with Liquid Purification Engineers International (LPE) to enter the desalination markets of Thailand and Asia.  Funding  The company backed ‚Ç¨6 million from Anterra Capital, Rabobank, ETF and Unilever. The company raised another ‚Ç¨10 million in 2017.

It is considered by many to be the \\"Mother Church of Black Catholics\\". It administers St. Augustine Catholic School, located in the same building.  History  Because of Jim Crow laws in the 1850s, emancipated black Catholic attendees of St. Matthew's Cathedral on Rhode Island Avenue were segregated and relegated to worship in the basement of the church. In 1858, the group of emancipated black Catholics founded Saint Martin de Porres Church, in honor of Peruvian Dominican brother St Martin de Porres. It was the first Black Catholic parish in Washington D.C., and its original location was on 15th Street NW, near L Street. This parish also operated the first school for Black children in Washington D.C., inaugurated five years before the Emancipation Proclamation, after which education of Black children gradually became mandatory. =Saint Martin de Porres era= Old St. Augustine, circa 1899; view from 15th Street with two horse-drawn carriages.

The parish has continuously served a primarily Black middle-class community of professionals, it was a 60-foot building with two Gothic spires, and seating for 2,500 people.

It blends elements of trap music, an offshoot of Southern hip hop, with elements of EDM like build-ups, drops, and breakdowns. A variety of artists spurred trap's move into pop and EDM. History In 2012, a style of electronic dance music (EDM) incorporated elements of trap music, creating \\"dirty, aggressive beats [and] dark melodies.\\" Electronic music producers, such as TNGHT, Baauer, RL Grime and Flosstradamus expanded the popularity, and brought wider attention to the derivative forms of trap. This genre saw the use of techno, dub, and electro sounds combined with the Roland TR-808 drum samples and vocal samples typical of trap. In the later half of 2012, these various offshoots of trap became increasingly popular and made a noticeable impact on the American electronic dance music scene. The music was initially dubbed simply as \\"trap\\" by producers and fans, which led to the term \\"trap\\" being used to address the music of both rappers and electronic producers, to much confusion among followers of both. Instead of referring to a single genre, the term \\"trap\\" has been used to describe two separate genres of hip hop and dance music. The new wave of the genre has been labeled by some as \\"EDM trap\\" to distinguish it from the rap genre. The terms \\"Trap-techno\\" and \\"Trapstep\\" are often labeled by producers to describe the musical structure of an individual track. The evolving EDM trap has seen incorporation and stylistic influences from dubstep, in which trap has been hailed as the superseding phase of dubstep during the mid 2010s. The new phase typically plays at 140 BPM with strong bass drops, which has been growing in popularity since 2013. In 2013, a fan-made video by Filthy Frank, of electronic trap producer Baauer's track \\"Harlem Shake\\" became an internet meme, propelling the track to become the first trap song to hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This challenge consisted of one person dancing to the rhythm of the song until the beat dropped, in which then whoever else within the video would dance along with the person dancing in the beginning. Five EDM trap producers performed at the 2013 Ultra Music Festival in the United States, including DJ Craze, Baauer and Flosstradamus. The 2013 Tomorrowland festival featured a \\"Trap Stage\\". On February 10, 2013, All Trap Music released their debut compilation album which featured 19 tracks from artists including RL Grime, Flosstradamus, Baauer, Bro Safari and 12th Planet. Described by the music press as the first album of its kind it reached number two in the iTunes dance chart with Vibe stating it was \\"the world's biggest- selling EDM trap album ever.\\" In 2013, DJ Snake and Lil Jon released the single \\"Turn Down for What\\", which became both a commercial hit charting in several countries and a critical hit. Rolling Stone voted \\"Turn Down For What\\" as the second best song of 2014, saying that, \\"The year's nutsiest party jam was also the perfect protest banger for a generation fed up with everything. DJ Snake brings the synapse-rattling EDM and Southern trap music; Lil Jon brings the dragon-fire holler for a hilarious, glorious, glowstick-punk fuck you.\\" Trap music has also found fame internationally, especially in South Korea. In November 2014, the K-pop duo G-Dragon and Taeyang of the South Korean boy band BIGBANG, released their single \\"Good Boy\\", where it incorporated strong elements of trap and electronic flavors. The single garnered 2 million views in less than 24 hours and was met with positive reviews from music critics. In June 2015, trap again resurfaced in the K-pop sphere when BIGBANG released their commercial hit single \\"Bang, Bang, Bang\\". The single was a critical and commercial success in South Korea reaching the apex of the Gaon Digital Chart, eventually selling more than 1 million digital singles by August 2015.
