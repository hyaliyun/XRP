He ran for mayor in 1981, coming in third in the general election behind New Jersey State Senator Wally Sheil and eventual winner Gerald McCann. Cucci again ran for mayor in 1985, coming in first in the general election and forcing a runoff election with McCann. Cucci won the runoff, and was sworn in as Mayor of Jersey City at one minute after midnight on July 1, 1985. While mayor, Cucci threatened to foreclose on the Statue of Liberty and sell it at auction due to an outstanding water bill of over $940,000 owed to the city by the United States Department of the Interior.

While on a goodwill visit to Peru, Cucci's wife and the wife of Cusco Mayor Carlos Chacon were killed when the railroad car in which they were riding derailed and fell 700 feet off an embankment. The crash was suspected to have been caused by sabotage by either Maoist Shining Path guerrillas or a nationwide labor strike in Peru at the time. Peruvian authorities determined that the sabotage, a 10-inch steel rod wedged onto the tracks, was the work of guerillas.

This view was most famously advanced in the 1930s (during the Great Depression) by the staff of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. The position can be characterized as: In his 1929 budget speech, Winston Churchill explained, \\"The orthodox Treasury view ... is that when the Government borrow[s] in the money market it becomes a new competitor with industry and engrosses to itself resources which would otherwise have been employed by private enterprise, and in the process raises the rent of money to all who have need of it.\\" Keynesian economists reject this view, and often use the term \\"Treasury view\\" when criticizing this and related arguments. The term is sometimes conflated with the related position that fiscal stimulus has negligible impact on economic activity, a view that is not incompatible with mainstream macroeconomic theory.  History  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, during the height of the Great Depression, many economists (most prominently John Maynard Keynes) tried to persuade governments that increased government spending would mitigate the situation and reduce unemployment. In the United Kingdom, the staff of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, notably Ralph George Hawtrey and Frederick Leith-Ross, argued against increased spending by putting forward the \\"Treasury view\\".F.W. Leith-Ross to Sir Richard Hopkins and P.J. Grigg, 3 April 1929, quoted in G.C. Peden (2004), Keynes and His Critics, p. 80 Simply put the Treasury view was the view that fiscal policy could only move resources from one use to another, and would not affect the total flow of economic activity. Therefore, neither government spending nor tax cuts could boost employment and economic activity. This view can historically be traced back to various statements of Say's law. Keynes argued against this position, and particularly in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, provided a theoretical foundation for how fiscal stimulus can increase economic activity during recessions. Opinions are currently sharply divided on the Treasury view, with different schools of economic thought holding contradicting views. Many in the \\"freshwater\\" Chicago school of economics advocate a form of the Treasury view, whereas economists from saltwater schools reject the view as incorrect. A number of prominent financial economists (including Eugene Fama) have recently advocated the strong form of this view ‚Äì that of no possible impact. However, it is categorically rejected by Keynesian macroeconomics, which holds that economic activity depends on aggregate spending (at least in the short run). It is related to, and at times equated with, theories of Say's law, Ricardian equivalence, and the Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition. Noted macroeconomists such as Milton Friedman and Robert Barro have advocated a weak form of this view, that fiscal policy has temporary and limited effects.  Arguments for  Arguments equivalent to the Treasury view are frequently rediscovered independently, and are often in turn criticized by Keynesian macroeconomists. = Accounting = One line of argument is to use the accounting equations in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to say that, as a matter of accounting, government spending must come from somewhere, and thus has no net impact on aggregate demand, unemployment, or income. Positions on this argument are far apart: advocates of the accounting argument for the Treasury view argue that as a matter of accounting (by definition) fiscal stimulus cannot have an economic impact, while critics argue that this argument is fundamentally wrong-headed and mistaken.DeLong, Fama's Fallacy I A Keynesian reply, by Paul Krugman, is that :...[this] commits one of the most basic fallacies in economics ‚Äî interpreting an accounting identity as a behavioral relationship. That is, NIPA accounting equations hold for a fixed GDP: the point of fiscal stimulus is to change GDP, and that changes in government spending are only exactly offset by decreases in other spending or investment if GDP is unchanged. Keynesians argue that fiscal stimulus can increase GDP, thus making this point moot. Another Keynesian reply, by Brad DeLong, is that these make assumptions about saving and investment, and ignore basic monetary economics, notably velocity of money: if (for a given money supply) velocity of money increases, (nominal) GDP increases, as GDP = Money Supply * Velocity of Money: a dollar of government spending need not crowd out a dollar of private spending, either as an accounting matter or as a behavioral matter, as it may increase velocity of money. = Economic model = An argument advanced by Milton FriedmanDeLong, Fama's Fallacy IV in the converse context (fiscal restraint via tax increases having a braking effect, as opposed to fiscal stimulus having a stimulating effect) begins with the NIPA argument above, then continues from the accounting to an economic model: :To find any net effect on private spending, one must look farther beneath the surface. specifically: :[S]ome of the funds not borrowed by the Federal government may be added to idle cash balances rather than spent or loaned. :In addition, it takes time for borrowers and lenders to adjust to reduced government borrowing. concluding: :However, any net decrease in spending from these sources is certain to be temporary and likely to be minor. and instead advocating monetary policy as the bottom line: :To have a significant impact on the economy, a tax increase must somehow affect monetary policy‚Äìthe quantity of money and its rate of growth. This analysis, while disputed by Keynesians (who argue that the effects of fiscal stimulus are more significant than Friedman argues), is considered a legitimate approach, and not dismissed out of hand as wrong-headed.

Opening narrationPlot After having a number of credit cards revoked for lack of payment, Linda Wolfe, a mother of three and a compulsive spender, is invited to become a cardholder for a mysterious credit company called The Card. Entering the company she notes a woman clutching a baby emerging from a door labeled Acquisitions, then entering through a door called Disbursements behind a glass window. During her appointment with office manager Catherine Foley she discovers they have reviewed her credit history and because it is so poor she will have to agree to special terms of payment: she will be required to make payments weekly and if she misses a payment there will be severe penalties. Nevertheless, they want her as a cardholder and she immediately signs without bothering to read the contract. Linda's husband Brian soon discovers the new card and that Linda has used it already to buy herself a bottle of perfume. He begs her to be very careful this time but one week later she is already delinquent on her payment. Then her cat mysteriously disappears, but when she asks her family about it no one seems to remember that they ever had a cat, nor is there any evidence the cat existed. Later, when Linda and Brian attempt to buy a refrigerator she discovers she neglected to make the first payment but isn't overly concerned. The following week, after she once again neglects to pay on time, their dog disappears and again none of the family remembers ever owning a dog. Then, Linda's car breaks down and she needs a mechanic and since she only has twelve dollars in cash she uses her credit card. As a result of using her card again while still delinquent, Linda's three children disappear. Of course, Brian doesn't know anything about the children and this pushes Linda over the edge of sanity. Linda starts to realize that the credit card company might be behind it all. She goes to The Card and sees what their Acquisitions and Disbursements are about as she sees her own children going through the doors. Catherine informs Linda that because she failed to make her payments they repossessed her pets and children to cover her bills, along with all memories that anyone but her have of them. Catherine explains to Linda that The Card tries to disburse its acquisitions in what they believe to be better environments. Linda frantically tries to buy back her children with a check from her and Brian's joint account. Catherine accepts it but warns that if the check doesn't clear another penalty will be assessed. Linda arrives home to tell Brian about the check but he tells her the bank has already called him about it and he cancelled it. Everything then starts to disappear around her‚Äîcar, furniture, and her husband. She cuts the credit card (which now has her maiden name Wilson on it) to keep more things from disappearing but it's too late. As the card falls to the ground, her house and everything in it‚Äîincluding Linda‚Äîdisappears. The only thing that's left is the cut credit card lying on the ground which is now nameless, implying that, as a final penalty, Linda has been wiped from existence.

It was originally described as Simblum periphragmoides in 1831, and has been known as many different names before being transferred to Lysurus in 1980. The saprobic fungus has a pantropical distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, Australasia, and the Americas, where it grows on fertile ground and on mulch. The fruit body, which can extend up to tall, consists of a reddish latticed head (a receptaculum) placed on top of a long stalk. A dark olive-green spore mass, the gleba, fills the interior of the lattice and extends outwards between the arms. Like other members of the family Phallaceae, the gleba has a fetid odor that attracts flies and other insects to help disperse its spores. The immature \\"egg\\" form of the fungus is considered edible. Taxonomy and naming A sketch of \\"Dictybole texensis\\", a deteriorated specimen of L. periphragmoides thought by Atkinson to be a new species.

Klotzsch designated it as the type species of Simblum, a genus differentiated from the similar genus Lysurus by having the fruit body ending in a spherical, chambered head, with gleba developing within the depressions of the chambers.Miller and Miller (1988), p. 82. Lysurus periphragmoides is a morphologically variable species; as a result, it has acquired an extensive number of synonyms, as various authors have decided that the different forms warranted being designated as new species. Donald Malcolm Dring's 1980 monograph on the Clathraceae (a family that has since been subsumed into the PhallaceaeKirk et al. (2008), p. 148.) transferred the taxon to Lysurus, explaining \\"a distinction between \\"Simblum\\" and Lysurus in the original restricted sense cannot be easily maintained because there are examples of intermediates states\\", and he lumped 18 synonyms under L. periphragmoides. In one noted example of an author being too eager to assign a new name, in 1902 George Francis Atkinson described a specimen he found in Texas, otherwise similar to Simblum but with a loose net drooping from the head; he initiated the new genus Dictybole to include his \\"new\\" species D. texense. The species was, according to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, merely a decomposing or insect-damaged specimen of L. periphragmoides that had been preserved in alcohol. Lloyd criticized Atkinson's poor judgment in his self-published journal Mycological Notes, and later, humiliated him under the pen name N.J. McGinty. William H. Long later (1907) transferred Atkinson's taxon to the genus Simblum, claiming that the yellow arms and longer spores were sufficiently distinct to consider it distinct from L. periphragmoides (then known as Simblum sphaerocephalum); however, according to Dring, D. texense should also be considered a synonym of L. periphragmoides. Despite Dring's renaming, and the subsequent acceptance of his subsuming of the genus Simblum into Lysurus,Kirk et al. (2008), p. 634. the species is still occasionally referred to Simblum sphaerocephalum. The specific epithet periphragmoides means \\"fenced in all around\\", and refers to the latticed structure of the cap. The fungus is commonly known as the \\"stalked lattice stinkhorn\\" or \\"chambered stinkhorn\\". Description Immature fruiting bodies of L. periphragmoides start as round or oval \\"eggs\\" that may be up to in diameter. On the underside of the egg are whitish rhizomorphs that anchor it to the substrate.Miller and Miller (1988), p. 90. The peridium is white to buff-colored on the external surface, and has a gelatinous layer inside. An egg cut in half lengthwise reveals internal layers, including a tough white outer peridium, and a thick layer of firm, translucent, gelatinous matter transversed by strands (trabeculae) of denser white tissue. The strands are anastomosing partitions, connecting with the peridium externally and with the bars of the receptaculum within. The gelatinous layer is therefore divided up into many irregular longitudinal chambers. Close-up of latticed receptaculum The egg eventually ruptures as the stalk expands and breaks through, creating a volva at the base of the stipe. In maturity, the fruit bodies, are up to tall, with a latticed spherical cap (the receptaculum) atop a long yellow or reddish stipe. In general, Old World specimens tend to be yellow, while New World specimens are reddish, although exceptions have been noted in the literature. The receptaculum is typically in diameter and forms a red or orange lattice, or mesh. There are typically between 20 and 100 small pentagonal to hexagonal meshes in the receptaculum; the arms of the mesh have sharp ridges on the outer surface, corrugations on the sides, and are flat to weakly ridged on the inner surface. The internal surfaces of the receptaculum are covered with an olive-green spore-bearing gleba, which sometimes seeps through the mesh holes. Like most stinkhorn species, the gleba has a foul odor, comparable to rotten meat, but it is \\"less-offensive\\" than most. The smell of fresh, newly exposed gleba has been reported to be sweet, similar to amyl acetate; the foul odor forming only after it has been exposed to air for some time. The stipe is by thick, and is hollow and spongy. The walls of the stipe are made of an inner layer of large tubes and two or three outer layers of small tubes. Specimens may occasionally be found with fused heads on two separate stipes arising from a single volva. A variety with a white fruit body is known, Lysurus periphragmoides var. albidum (originally described as Simblum texense var. albidum by Long). It was reported growing from sandy alkaline soil in semi- arid regions of New Mexico, but has not been reported again since Long's collections in 1941. Spores are elliptical or oblong in shape, smooth, inamyloid, and have dimensions of 3.5‚Äì4.5 by 1.5‚Äì2.5 ¬µm. The use of scanning electron microscopy has revealed that L. periphragmoides (in addition to several other Phallales species) has a hilar scar‚Äîa small indentation in the surface of the spore where it was previously connected to the basidium via the sterigma. Like many of the stinkhorns, L. periphragmoides is generally considered only edible when in its immature \\"egg\\" form. =Similar species= Lysurus periphragmoides is morphologically distinct, and unlikely to be confused with any other species. Within the genus Lysurus, L. mokusin has an angular stipe and a receptacle of four to five clasped arms, contoured like the stipe with alternating ribs and furrows. L. cruciatus has a rounder stipe with receptacle arms that are not clasped together at maturity. The receptacle of L. gardneri, found in southeast Asia, India, and Africa, is made of five to seven reddish-brown fingers that are initially pressed together before separating. Habitat and distribution This species is typically found growing solitary or in groups on lawns, mulch, pastures, and open woods. A North American field guide notes an association with apple orchards and cornfields. Lysurus periphragmoides has a pantropical distribution. The fungus has been reported from Africa (Mauritius, Tanzania), Asia (Jilin Province, China, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia), Australasia (New Guinea), North America (Bahamas, Dominica, Mexico) and South America (Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela). The distribution extends north to the Ryukyu Islands in Asia. It is fairly common in South America, but is usually restricts its appearance to periods of wet weather in southern North America.

He is a charismatic person and a versatile artist who has a broad musical taste, acting and directing capabilities. In his over 50-year-long (celebrated 2011) musical career he has recorded 8 albums, has been a performer at many festivals, and won many awards.  Early life  Since his early years he has been interested in poetry. At the age of 20 he won a countrywide recitation competition. Gifted with a very strong voice and a good diction he started an acting career at the theatre in his hometown and then moved to the capital city of Poland, Warsaw.  Musical career  In 1965 he met Tadeusz Nalepa, with whom he created the band \\"Blackout\\". After two years of playing together he split with the \\"Blackout\\" and started playing with band \\"Bizony\\" (eng. \\"Bisons\\"). As a vocalist with this band he changed his name, stage appearance and recorded his big holiday hit song \\"Spacer DzikƒÖ Pla≈ºƒÖ\\" (eng. \\"Walking on a Wild Beach\\"). He was aiming into a more ambitious repertoire and in 1968 he appeared at the Opole music festival with the song \\"To Ziemia\\" (\\"It's Earth\\"), winning the journalists' prize. In 1973 he won another award performing \\"Jask√≥≈Çka Uwiƒôziona\\" (eng. \\"Imprisoned swallow\\") at the Opole festival. Since 1970 he started acting only as soloist. He was singing in many festivals in Poland, and abroad winning prizes. Because of his \\"Jesus-like-look\\" image (he has long hair, a beard and always wears a cross necklace), and liberty-themed songs, he experienced problems with the communist government which often cut off his appearances on TV, and censored his lyrics.  Moving to the USA and further career  Stan Borys has always been fascinated with the United States, and finally in 1975, after several attempts and going through obstacles created by the government, under the pretense of going on an artist exchange, he managed to relocate permanently to the US. On the other side of the Atlantic, he continued his musical career and started singing at various music clubs, working with Polish and American artists and polishing his English. Despite being thousands of miles away from Poland, he cherished his love for Polish poetry, which he promoted in his radio program in Chicago. In 1983, celebrating the 100th anniversary of C.K. Norwid's (a Polish poet) death during the World Norwid Conference held at the University of Illinois in Chicago, he directed and starred in the theater performance \\"Norwid\\". His acting and vocal talent led to acting roles in other plays e.g. \\"The good Woman of Setzuan\\", \\"Polish Bethlehem\\". He was married several times. His third wife was Agata Pilitowska, is a Polish actress who lives in Toronto.  Visiting Poland  After 1989 he started visiting Poland again. In 1991 he performed at the Opole and Sopot festivals, and played Jean Valjean in the musical Les Mis√©rables. In 1998 he recorded a new album \\"Niczyj\\" (eng. \\"Nobody's\\") with several well-known international artists as well as performed on tour in Canada, and throughout the US. The album had not been available in Poland until 2004. Stan Borys performed during the celebrations of the Polish accession to the European Union on April 30, 2004. The same year he took part in some charity concerts. Because of many performances in Poland Stan Borys has now a house near Warsaw. In the USA he lives near Death Valley, where as he says he has a good atmosphere for his work.  Trivia  Stan Borys practices yoga as well as meditation techniques and breathing exercises, which helps him in his vocal performances. He is a fan of muscle cars. His first automobile after moving to the United States was a Pontiac sports car. Currently he drives a Nissan Z.

Pizzo Carbonara is located about 10 km NW of Petralia Sottana. It is a limestone massif, and rainwater falling on it eventually emerges at the foot of the castle rock of Cefal√π on the north coast of Sicily. Its summit is more of a plateau than a peak, so that it is not easy to determine the highest point. In good weather, Pizzo Carbonara is readily climbed from the Piano Battaglia (1605 m), which can be reached by road, the round trip taking about 2 hrs 30 minutes for an average fit person. It does not involve any rock-climbing or scrambling. However, as of 2006, there is no clearly marked path up the mountain, accurate maps are not readily available, and the plateau is prone to mist. Accordingly, it is advisable to carry a compass or GPS when climbing the mountain. Guidebooks do not recommend climbing it in winter. References * Amann, P. (2001). Landscapes of Sicily.

The company was founded in 1995 by Martin Sprock in Atlanta, Georgia, and currently operates more than 100 locations. In November, 2011, Planet Smoothie was acquired by Tasti D-Lite LLC who also operates Tasti D-Lite stores. In June 2015, Quick-Service Restaurant Franchisor Kahala Brands purchased both Planet Smoothie and Tasti D-Lite in a deal that brings their 128 locations into the portfolio of about a dozen fast food, treat and sandwich chains such as Blimpie and Cold Stone Creamery owned by the Serruya family of Canada. Together, the Tasti D-Lite and Planet Smoothie locations will now be run from the Kahala Brands corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. Advertising  In 2007, Planet Smoothie decided to send one person on a trip from Orlando to San Diego to assume the role of Cup Man, the chain's longstanding brand character. The 22-market \\"Good for You, Good for the Planet\\" tour took Cupman coast-to-coast in a biodiesel converted ice cream truck designed to raise awareness of green issues in markets across the country. Candidates were required to submit a video of why they felt they would make the best Cup Man for the 30-day green trek. Joel Moss Levinson, of Dayton, Ohio was named the winner. For Joel's winning entry, he wrote a song with lines such as ‚ÄúI wanna be your Cupman‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm environmentally responsible, I recycle, reduce and reuse, that‚Äôs why I want to drive your car that runs on biodiesel fuel.‚Äù Joel garnered enough online votes to be chosen as the company's walking, talking, touring CupMan. Joel has since won 11 contests ‚Äî earning more than $200,000 in money and prizes. He has been featured in the New York Times, The Jay Leno Show and an Access Hollywood Rising Star.

The robbery, of workers' wages from the Schnurmann rubber factory, was carried out by Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus, Jewish Latvian immigrants. Of the twenty-three casualties, two were fatal and several others serious, among them seven policemen. The two thieves committed suicide at the end of the pursuit. Helfeld and Lepidus were members of the Latvian Socialist Party responsible for smuggling revolutionary literature into Russia. Both had been living with Lepidus's brother Paul in Paris in 1907 when Paul was killed by the premature detonation of the bomb he was carrying to assassinate the president of France, Armand Falli√®res. They fled France to north London, where they became members of a small group of Latvian agitators. For some time before the robbery, Helfeld was employed at the Schnurmann factory. The bravery of the police during the chase led to the creation of the King's Police Medal, which was awarded to several of those involved in the pursuit. A joint funeral for the two victims‚ÄîPolice Constable William Tyler and Ralph Joscelyne, a ten-year-old boy‚Äîwas attended by a crowd of up to half a million mourners, including 2,000 policemen. The event exacerbated ill feeling towards immigrants in London, and much of the press coverage was anti-Semitic in nature. This affected public sentiment after another criminal act by Latvian immigrants in December 1910, culminating in the Siege of Sidney Street, in which three policemen were murdered. Background=Immigration and demographics in London= Schnurmann rubber factory: scene of the robbery In the 19th century the Russian Empire, then including Latvia, was home to about five million Jews, the largest Jewish community in the world at the time. Subjected to religious persecution and violent pogroms, many emigrated, and between 1875 and 1914 around 120,000 arrived in the United Kingdom, mostly in England. The influx reached its peak in the late 1890s when large numbers of Jewish immigrants‚Äîmostly poor and semi-skilled or unskilled‚Äîsettled in the East End of London; the concentration of Jews in some areas of London was almost 100 per cent of the population. Because of the influx of Russians into one part of Tottenham in North London, the area gained the nickname Little Russia. Some of the expatriates were revolutionaries, and many were unable to adapt to life in London. The social historian William J. Fishman writes that \\"the ' (crazy) Anarchists were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape\\"; the terms \\"socialist\\" and \\"anarchist\\" had been conflated by the British press to refer generally to those with revolutionary beliefs. Several revolutionary factions were active in East and North London. One tactic often employed by revolutionaries in Russia was the expropriation of private property to fund radical activities. The influx of √©migr√©s, and the associated rising rates of violent crime, led to widespread concerns and press coverage. As a result, the British government passed the Aliens Act 1905 in an attempt to reduce immigration. The popular press reflected the opinions of many; a leading article in the Manchester Evening Chronicle supported the bill to bar \\"the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil\\". The journalist Robert Winder, in his examination of immigration into Britain, opines that the Act \\"gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might ... have remained dormant\\". =Criminals= Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the ' \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Falli√®res, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham. Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police. Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery. Salnish, who often went under the name Jacob Fogel, had been an active revolutionary since the age of 13. He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia. Special Branch suspected a political element to the crime based on Salnish's involvement, but as both Helfeld and Lepidus died during the chase, the motivation for the crime was never established. Robbery and chase=Wages snatch= On 23 January 1909 Helfeld and Lepidus waited outside the Schnurmann factory. At the same time every week Schnurmann's chauffeur, Joseph Wilson, drove to a bank in nearby Hackney with Albert Keyworth, a 17-year-old office boy. They collected the week's wages‚Äîon the 23rd it was ¬£80 in gold, silver and coppers‚Äîand returned to the factory, arriving at about 10:30 am. The car stopped to allow Keyworth‚Äîholding the bag of money‚Äîto open the gates; as it started to pull off, Lepidus grabbed the boy and tried to take the bag from him, but Keyworth held him off. Wilson stopped the car and came to Keyworth's assistance. As the trio wrestled, Wilson fell to the ground and Lepidus managed to take the bag. Helfeld joined the fight; he drew his gun‚Äîa .32 calibre Browning‚Äîand fired several times at Wilson. The shots hit Wilson's coat; one pierced his clothes and cut across his abdomen. The police report stated that it was \\"in a miraculous and unaccountable way [that] he escaped injury\\". =Chase= Two police constables (PCs)‚ÄîTyler and Newman‚Äîat the nearby police station heard the shots, left the station and chased the two men down Chesnut Road. Part way down the road, George Smith, a passer-by, threw Lepidus to the ground. As they wrestled, Helfeld fired at Smith four times; two shots went through his cap‚Äîone of which scraped his scalp‚Äîanother hit him in the collarbone and one missed altogether. As the two gunmen ran down the street, other members of the public joined the chase, as did several off-duty policemen from the station‚Äînone carrying firearms‚Äîsome on foot, but some having commandeered bicycles from passers-by. One policeman was able to return fire with a pistol borrowed from a member of the public. The car from the factory joined in the pursuit, driven by Wilson; he paused and PC Newman boarded the car before they gave chase again. Tyler ran alongside the car. As the car approached them, the two criminals turned and opened fire. One round broke the car's water pipe, disabling it, and Wilson received a minor wound to the neck; Newman's cheek and ear were damaged by one shot. Members of the public attempted to take cover, but one‚ÄîRalph Joscelyne, a ten-year-old boy‚Äîwas caught by a round to the chest. Someone took him to hospital on a bicycle, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. The gunmen continued their escape, and headed towards Tottenham Marshes. PCs Tyler and Newman took a short cut, and confronted the two men near the site of a rubbish incinerator. Tyler approached the men and, when he was within , was heard to say \\"Come on; give in, the game's up\\". Helfeld took aim and shot him; the bullet went through his head. The two criminals took off again, while Tyler was carried to a nearby house and an ambulance summoned. He was taken to Tottenham Hospital, where he died five minutes after arrival. Helfeld and Lepidus crossed the nearby railway line and followed the west bank of the River Lea until they crossed over; they were able to hold off the crowd from the bridge. Men who had been duck shooting on the marshes used their shotguns to return fire and when the two criminals moved on from the bridge, local footballers joined in the chase. Helfeld and Lepidus ran along the western bank of the Lee Navigation canal; local workmen followed on the opposite bank in an attempt to cut them off, but several were wounded when the two men fired at them. The pair crossed the canal at Stonebridge Lock, then crossed another bridge and again held off the chasing crowd from the bridge's parapet. One policeman, PC Nicod, borrowed a pistol from a bystander and made his way through the scrub until he was close enough to fire, but the gun was faulty; he was seen by Helfeld and Lepidus, who fired on him, wounding him in the calf and thigh. thumbleftupright=1.75alt=Map of Tottenham and Walthamstow, showing the route the two criminals took.The route of the chase, showing: 1. The Schnurmann rubber factory 2. Tottenham police station 3. Where Ralph Joscelyne was killed 4. Where PC Tyler was killed 5. Where Helfeld shot himself 6. Where Lepidus committed suicide Helfeld and Lepidus continued their flight along the south side of Banbury Reservoir. As they crossed an area of open land, they sheltered behind a haystack and held off the pursuers, who numbered about 20 at this point. The two ran on until they reached Chingford Road, where they boarded a number 9 tram; many of the passengers escaped, and the driver, who saw the armed men, ran up the front stairs of the vehicle and hid on the top deck. Lepidus threatened the conductor with a pistol and ordered him to drive; although he had never driven a tram before, he managed to get the vehicle moving. Lepidus stayed with his pistol trained on the conductor, while Helfeld shot at the pursuers behind them. One policeman commandeered a pony and cart; he was armed and tried to get close enough to manage an aimed shot, but Helfeld shot the horse and the cart overturned. A tram on the return journey from that of number 9 was commandeered by a policeman; 40 others boarded it and it reversed down the track in pursuit. The conductor, wanting to get rid of the two men, told them that there was a police station around the next corner. The two criminals jumped off the tram near a horse-drawn milk float, shooting the driver and stealing his vehicle. They fled in the direction of Epping Forest. The milk cart overturned when the men tried to take a corner too fast, and they threatened a grocer's boy before stealing his delivery cart; Lepidus drove while Helfeld sat at the back, shooting at pursuers. A policeman commandeered a car and he, with an armed colleague, kept up pursuit. The cart did not travel very fast because, unbeknown to Lepidus, its brake was still on, and one of the wheels was not operating. The horse was soon spent, and the two men abandoned it, taking off on foot along the bank of the River Ching. The footpath was bordered by a -high fence and, as it continued, it narrowed to the point of being impassable. It was too late for the men to turn back and they decided to climb over; Lepidus managed to make it, but Helfeld, exhausted by the chase, could not manage to climb. He shouted to Lepidus to save himself and, as the police closed in, he put the gun to his head and shot himself. The bullet entered the head half an inch above the right eye and exited through the forehead on the other side. He was disarmed before he could fire again, and was struggling as he was overpowered; he was taken to Tottenham Hospital. =Oak Cottage= The bed where Lepidus committed suicide Lepidus continued his flight into Hale End, Walthamstow. He crossed the nearby railway line and took refuge in Oak Cottage, a small two-up two-down where a Mrs Rolstone and her children were present. Mrs Rolstone was at the front gate, having left the house on hearing the police whistles, when Lepidus entered the house behind her and bolted the door. When she saw Lepidus through the window‚Äîlocked in with her children‚Äîshe screamed, which attracted the police. When Lepidus went upstairs, one policeman, PC Dewhurst, broke in through a downstairs window and removed the children from the house. PC Charles Eagles borrowed a pistol from a bystander and climbed a ladder at the back of the house. He was in a position to shoot, but he did not understand how the safety catch worked, and the gun failed to fire. Eagles descended and entered the house with PC John Cater and Detective Constable Charles Dixon. The three noticed sooty hand prints on the wall, where Lepidus had tried to hide up the chimney. Using a double-barrelled shotgun, Dixon shot through the door of the bedroom Lepidus had entered, while Cater and Eagles shot with revolvers. All three entered the room as Lepidus pulled a sheet over his head. Eagles and Dixon both fired as they entered, while Lepidus shot himself in the head. The police dragged him outside, where he died a few minutes later. The incident had lasted over two hours and covered a distance of ; Helfeld and Lepidus had fired an estimated 400 rounds of ammunition. Twenty-three casualties were reported, two of them fatal and several others serious. Seven policemen were among the casualties. The bulk of the money from the robbery was never recovered, with the exception of a ¬£5 bag of silver coins found on Lepidus. Aftermath=Inquests= The Daily Mirror, reporting the funeral of PC Tyler Two inquests were held on 26 January 1909, that of Lepidus in Walthamstow, and that of PC Tyler and 10-year-old Ralph Joscelyne in Tottenham. The coroner in the Walthamstow inquest described Lepidus as a \\"secret revolutionary agent\\", and said that the law would have to change to stop such criminal elements entering Britain. Although Constable Eagles believed he had fired the shot that killed Lepidus, the round extracted from the dead man's head indicated otherwise. The jury passed a verdict of suicide. The inquest at Tottenham heard evidence through the day and adjourned until the following week. When the verdict was given, it was for the wilful murder of PC Tyler by Helfeld, for which the coroner used the authority of his court to commit the Latvian to trial. Joscelyne's death, the jury decided, had been caused by Helfeld and Lepidus together. =Victims' funeral= Joscelyne and Tyler's joint funeral was held on 29 January 1909, attended by Sir Edward Henry, the Commissioner of Police, and Herbert Samuel, Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. The cort√®ge passed along a two-and-a-half mile (four km) route lined by 2,000 police officers and a large crowd, estimated at up to 500,000. The lengthy procession included white- plumed horses drawing Joscelyne's coffin and black-plumed horses drawing Tyler's; each was draped with a Union Jack. They were escorted by policemen, a police band, men from the local fire brigade, a contingent from Royal Garrison Artillery and tramway employees. A volley of guns was fired at the end. The two were buried near each other at Abney Park Cemetery. =Lepidus and Helfeld= Lepidus was buried the same day as Joscelyne and Tyler. He was interred in unconsecrated ground in a Walthamstow cemetery in a ceremony closed to the public. An armed guard was kept around Tottenham Hospital in case Helfeld tried to escape. Although his wounds had begun to heal, he contracted meningitis. Surgery was carried out on 9 February to remove pieces of bone pressing into the wound; the meningitis worsened and he died on 12 February. Before his death he said the only words he was heard to have uttered in hospital: \\"My mother is in Riga.\\" An inquest recorded a verdict of suicide. He was buried in an unconsecrated area of a cemetery near Tottenham Hospital. Impact Ralph Joscelyne's father died soon after his son's murder; Ralph's mother kept the shoes her son had been wearing on the day he was killed. Following her wishes, they were buried with her when she died in 1953. A collection was taken for PC Tyler's widow, which raised ¬£1,055; she was only paid the interest, in addition to her widow's pension of ¬£15 a year. She later married PC Williams, who had taken part in the chase; he died in 1925. On her death, the capital sum of the money raised for her was paid to the Metropolitan and City of London Police orphanage fund. The King's Police Medal was established by a Royal Warrant, dated 7 July 1909, to recognise the bravery of the officers who had pursued Lepidus and Helfeld. Eagles, Cater and Dixon, the three officers who broke into Oak Cottage to apprehend Lepidus, were among the first recipients announced on 9 November 1909. The three were also among five officers promoted to the rank of sergeant without the need for the usual examination; Nicod and Dewhurst were the others who rose in rank. Two others were raised to the highest level of their pay grades. Seven were granted financial awards from the Bow Street Court Reward Fund. In November 1909 a monument to PC Tyler was built at his grave; the ¬£200 cost was paid by members of the Metropolitan Police. The memorial was designated a Grade II listed structure on 24 March 1997 by English Heritage (now Historic England). A cross was carved into a wall where PC Tyler was shot, and a plaque in his memory was installed at Tottenham police station. A blue plaque in memory of Joscelyne was placed at the Church of the Good Shepherd, Tottenham, and one indicating the end of the chase at the approximate site of Oak Cottage (now destroyed). Following the events at Tottenham, Sir Edward Henry set up a board to examine compensation claims made by members of the public. The board was also instructed to examine whether the firearm used by the police‚Äîthe .450 Webley Revolver‚Äîwas suitable, and whether sufficient numbers had been issued. The recommendation was that the Webley should be replaced by the Colt Automatic pistol, although no change was made. A subsequent decision was for a British-made firearm, the Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol. These changes had not been implemented by the end of December 1910, when a group of Latvian revolutionaries undertook an attempted break-in at a jewellery shop, which led to the Siege of Sidney Street. That event led to the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others and a gun battle which involved the military being deployed in London. A further review after the Sidney Street murders resulted in the Metropolitan Police replacing the Webley revolver with the Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol in 1911; the City of London Police adopted the same weapon in 1912. The events of the Tottenham Outrage were re-enacted in Doctor Brian Pellie and the Secret Despatch (1912), a silent film. A fact-based, but highly fictionalised re- imagining of the events form a sub-plot of the 2014 novel The Tottenham Outrage by Matthew Baylis. Although there was some initial confusion about the backgrounds of Helfeld and Lepidus‚ÄîThe Star reported that they were Italians‚Äîthe actions of the two men led to a debate on immigration control. In early February 1909 Herbert Gladstone, the Liberal Home Secretary defended the Asquith government's record on immigration, citing the number of foreign dissidents who had been expelled from Britain for criminal activity. The popular press reported the case extensively, and some newspapers, particularly The Daily Mail, focused on attacking the Aliens Act 1905, blaming it for being too open and making it too easy to enter the country. The French anarchist newspaper ' called Helfeld and Lepidus \\"our audacious comrades\\" who came \\"under attack\\" from what they called \\"citizens, believers in the State and authority\\". The perception of immigrants was affected by the outrage and, according to the Metropolitan Police Service, it \\"provoked some misplaced public anti-Semitism\\", which affected public opinion two years later in the Siege of Sidney Street. In December 1909, during the events that led to the siege, a leading article in The Times described the Whitechapel area as one that: > harbours some of the worst alien anarchists and criminals who seek our too > hospitable shore. And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife. > The present affair inevitably recalls the extraordinary and fatal outrage > which occurred at Tottenham less than two years ago.

She was present during the final traumatic months of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, observer to the French Revolution and survived to see their daughter return twice during the Bourbon Restorations. Life She was the daughter of the Marquise de Tourzel, Louise-F√©licit√©-Jos√©phine de Cro≈∑ d'Havr√©, the last governess of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette's children. = Experiences during the Revolution = Following her mother's appointment as governess to the children of France, Pauline lived intimately with the royal family at the Tuileries Palace. She is said to have giggled at the humour of the Comtesse de Provence, dined with the royal family, and was taught billiards by King Louis XVI himself despite not being formally presented at court, much to the horror of Mesdames Tantes Madame Victoire and Madame Sophie. Pauline de Tourzel was adored by the dauphin Louis-Charles, who found in her a more playful alternative to his Governess, her mother, the Marquise de Tourzel, whom he was to nicknamed Madame Severe; the two were said to play endless games during the families house arrest in the Tuileries. Pauline was crucial in persuading the young dauphin to be dressed in girls clothes for the Royal Families flight to Varennes, convincing the shy young boy that it was all part of a wonderful game of soldiers. During the royal families refuge with the deputies of the National Assembly he cried constantly worrying about the fate of his beloved Pauline following the massacre at the Tuileries, only ceasing when they were reunited at the convent. During her time in the Tuileries and later the Temple Prison, Pauline developed an intimate friendship with Marie Antoinette‚Äôs eldest daughter Marie Th√©r√®se who was only a few years her junior. During the 10 August (French Revolution), the royal family, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two children, the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, the Queen's close friend the Princesse de Lamballe, and Pauline‚Äôs mother, the children's governess, fled to safety, seeking refugee with the deputies of the National Assembly moments before the storming of the Tuileries by a Parisian mob. The Princess de Tarante offered to look after Pauline, who was to stay behind with the other women that still served, whilst her mother went with the royal family to H√¥tel de Ville, seeking refuge with the National Assembly. Pauline de Tourzel herself suggested that the ladies-in-waiting, who gathered in one of the queen's chambers, should shut the windows and illuminate the room. When the mob entered the chamber where the ladies-in-waiting were gathered, the Princesse de Tarente, according to Pauline de Tourzel, approached one of the revolutionaries and asked for his protection.Memoirs of the Dutchess de Tourzel, governess to the children of France during the years 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, 1793 and 1795, 1886 He agreed, and escorted her and Pauline de Tourzel from the palace.Memoirs of the Dutchess de Tourzel, governess to the children of France during the years 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, 1793 and 1795, 1886 Following this example, the rest of the ladies-in-waiting departed the palace in about the same way.Madame Campan, Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, Project Gutenberg The princesse de Tarente and Pauline de Tourzel was escorted from the palace by the rebel, who left them on the street; they were there discovered by a mob who brought them to prison, but the prison director let them free, and de Tarente brought de Tourzel with her to her grandmother, from which she could later be united with her mother.Memoirs of the Dutchess de Tourzel, governess to the children of France during the years 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, 1793 and 1795, 1886 Pauline rejoined her mother and the royal family at the convent where the assembly had detained them on the following day. Pauline accompanied the Royal family when they were transferred into the Temple Prison where she slept in the kitchen with Madame Elizabeth. On the 19th of August Pauline along with her mother, The Marquise de Tourzel and the Princesse de Lamballe were removed to the La Force Prison for interrogation. Prior to the September massacres, an unidentified Englishman helped Pauline escape from the prison; she was soon joined by her mother, who also escaped the massacres, though their fellow prisoner Princesse de Lamballe was killed. She and her mother were advised by their rescuer, a \\"Monsieur Hardi\\", to leave Paris because Pauline had had escaped the prison illegally and was in danger of arrest, and they left for the countryside, were they lived incognito in Vincennes and at the property of her son in Aboundant outside of Dreux.Memoirs of the Dutchess de Tourzel, governess to the children of France during the years 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792, 1793 and 1795, 1886 She continue to visit Marie Th√©r√®se throughout her confinement in the Temple Prison, and continued to write to her during her exile after she left France in 1795, sending her a flower from the grave of her parents. =Later life= Pauline de Tourzel married Alexandre L√©on Luce de Galard de Brassac de B√©arn, and was thereafter known as Comtesse de Bearn. Because of their well known sympathies for the Bourbon family, they were not well regarded by emperor Napoleon and their correspondance was reportedly surveilled by the secret police. Pauline and Marie Th√©r√®se were reunited on 29 April 1814 at the Palace of Compiegne following the Bourbon restoration. Pauline became a lady-in- waiting to Marie Th√©r√®se and went with her to the graves of her parents Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. She accompanied Marie Th√©r√®se on her trip around France, to provinces like Bordeaux but was eventually parted from her on 3 August 1830 following the abdication of Charles X.

The airfield was inactivated after 1946 and returned to Japanese control in 1972. Currently it is a part of Yomitan village, where it has been redeveloped into a golf course and recreation area. History This airfield was originally built by the Japanese on what used to be Uzza neighborhood of village (now Yomitan). It was seized by the United States during the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945. It was allocated to the Eighth Air Force in July 1945 to station B-29 Superfortress bombers to fly strategic bombing missions in the planned Invasion of Japan. The airfield was never used for combat operations due to the surrender of Imperial Japan on 2 September 1945. It was however, used by the Fifth Air Force's 7th and 8th Combat Cargo Squadrons (2d Combat Cargo Group) from 20 August 1945 until 5 January 1946 flying Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft. After the transport units moved to Yokota Air Base, the facility was closed and used as a surplus storage depot for equipment left on Okinawa after the war was over. There were many tanks, various trucks, crates of airplanes, graders, bulldozers, and crates of other equipment. Eventually, most of this equipment was sent to Japan and then to Korea during the Korean War. During the 1950s and 1960s the airfield was used as an auxiliary training facility for Kadena and Naha Air Bases. It was returned to Japanese control in 1972.

He was active in two armed conflicts; the Spanish Civil War as a member of the International Brigades and the Second World War as a member of the British Empire's Merchant Navy. Early life Doyle was born in a North King Street tenement in Dublin, Ireland and became interested in politics during the 1930s. In 1933, he was part of an anti - communist mob that attacked Connolly House. He joined the Irish Republican Army (IRA) after losing his left eye in a brawl with Blueshirts. He quickly became more interested in social rather than Irish nationalist issues and in 1937 decided to volunteer for the International Brigades, motivated in part by the fact that his friend and IRA veteran Kit Conway had been killed in action in the Battle of Jarama on Doyle‚Äôs 21st birthday. Service in Spain He initially attempted to travel to Spain by stowing away aboard a boat bound for Valencia, where he was detained and expelled. He eventually returned by crossing the Pyrenees from France. After he returned to Spain, he reported to a battalion at Figueras. He was initially required to train new recruits because of his IRA experience, but disobeyed orders to get to the front. Capture and release After fighting at Belchite, he was captured at Gandesa by the Italian fascist Corpo Truppe Volontarie in 1938, along with Irish International Brigade leader Frank Ryan. He was imprisoned for 11 months in San Pedro de Carde√±a - a concentration camp near Burgos. There he was once brought out to be shot and he was regularly tortured by Spanish fascist guards and interrogated by the Gestapo before being released in a prisoner exchange. World War II service Doyle enlisted in the British merchant navy during World War II before settling in London with his Spanish wife, Lola. He became active in the Fleet Street print trade unions. A regular visitor to Spain and Ireland for International Brigade commemorations, he published an account of his experiences in Spain in Brigadista: An Irishman‚Äôs Fight Against Fascism. In an interview with The Irish Times, he said: \\"I thought there was a danger that Ireland would go fascist and that was one of the motivating factors in making up my mind to go to Spain.\\" Family Doyle and his wife Lola later gave birth to a son, noted film editor and special effects wizard Julian Doyle, who worked on such films as \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" and \\"Time Bandits\\". Death Doyle's ashes in the funeral procession, Dublin 2009 Bob Doyle died at the age of 92 on 22 January 2009. His ashes were carried at the head of a funeral procession through the streets of Dublin.

Born in Brownsville, Tennessee, he was a graduate of Vanderbilt University and a member of the \\"Fugitives\\" a literary movement of the 1920s. He worked for the Memphis Press, The Commercial Appeal, and the Nashville Banner newspapers before leaving for New York to become the Sunday Editor for the New York World. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the U.S. Army, 76th Field Artillery during World War I and saw action during at Somme, St. Michel, and Meuse-Argonne, France. He was honorably discharged in France on July 12, 1919. Wills wrote two novels; Hoax (1922), the life of a young man from the age of eighteen to twenty-seven, and Harvey Landrum (1924), a psychological study of chinless Harvey Landrum, who tries to conceal a sense of inferiority behind a false front of bravery, are written in a frank but restrained prose style. He and Allen Tate co-wrote a book of poetry called \\"The Golden Mean; and other poems \\" which was published in 1923. Background His father was Asa Mann Wills, who gave his son the identical name of the son's uncle, William Ridley Wills, who was one of the founders of the National Life and Accident Insurance Company in Nashville in 1902. His mother was Della Belle Womack. While a student at Vanderbilt University, Wills and his younger cousin Jesse Ely Wills (father of Ridley Wills II) were both members of the Fugitives literary movement. After the returning from France, William Ridley Wills married Louella Wilson and they had 5 children: Andrew, William, David, Louella, and Thaddeus. They divorced in 1942 in Duval, Florida. He spent the last four years of his life as a patient at the Bay Pines Veterans Hospital in Florida where he also served as the editor of the hospital newspaper. He died on September 8, 1957.  Allen Tate's view of Wills  Allen Tate wrote of Wills in the book \\"The Golden Mean\\": \\"Ridley Wills came into the crass universe like a Spring wind with a napkin under its chin. He has subsequently attended many banquets and stol'n the scraps. We shall be somewhat glad for Ridley reaches into the very cul-de- sac of human passion; in fact, he reaches into human passion. Ridley Wills' genius is uncontested; he doesn't even contest it himself. His mind is immediate; it has no middle term. His intuition of reality points only to foreknowledge, and that, perhaps, is why he knows practically nothing of the past. Ridley Wills is quite at his ease in the novel. I think that Ridley has a very bright future behind him, because he is more than successful in his collaboration with me. He permanence is established-he is certainly the most parabolic young man of the Younger Generation.\\" References 1897 births 1957 deaths 20th-century American poets Vanderbilt University alumni 20th-century American novelists American male novelists American male poets Writers of American Southern literature 20th-century American male writers People from Brownsville, Tennessee ","title":"William Ridley Wills"},{"id":"21283832","title":"Asian Tour International"},{"id":"21283837","text":"The 2010 New Orleans mayoral election was held on February 6, 2010 to elect the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana.

Most historians describe Joiada as the son of Eliashib, ca. 433-410 BCE. However, there are two existing problems with the chronologies. First, it is believed that Joiada may be the grandson of Eliashib. The word \\"son\\" may refer to a father-son relationship, but alternatively refers to a grandson or brother. However, it is suggested that (Ezra 2:43 & Neh 12:23) are related and may be referring to another Eliashib and Johanan because they were common names at that time. The second problem involves the time span of the list given because some believe the list Eliashib to Joiada to Jonathan to Jaddua was a time span of 150 years. It is also possible that not all of the names of the high priests are included. The only information given about Joiada is that his son married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite for which he was driven out of the Temple by Nehemiah.(Neh 13:28) This is important because the books of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah contain severe instructions against marrying foreign women. These foreign marriages led to tension between the Jewish governor and the high-priestly family. The son of Joiada was removed from the temple by Nehemiah and banished from Judah, however nothing suggests that Joiada's family received further punishment.

His reign is estimated to have been from c. 410‚Äì371 BCE; he was succeeded by his son Jaddua. The Bible gives no details about his life. Johanan lived during the reigns of king Darius II of Persia (423 BC ‚Äì 405 or 404 BC) and his son Artaxerxes II (404 BC ‚Äì 358 BC), whose Achaemenid Empire included Judah as a province. Murder in the Temple Flavius Josephus records that Johanan's brother Jesus was promised the high priesthood by Bagoas, general of Artaxerxes. Jesus got in a quarrel with Johanan in the temple and Johanan killed him. Bagoas knew that Johanan had slain Jesus in the temple saying to him \\"Have you had the impudence to perpetrate murder in the temple.\\"Antiquities xi. 7.1, Josephus Bagoas was forbidden to enter the temple, but he entered anyway saying \\"Am not I purer than he that was slain in the temple?\\" Bagoas had not seen such a savage crime and responded by commanding the Persians to punish the Jews for seven years. His son Jaddua eventually took over the position when Johanan died, as briefly mentioned by Josephus, but was not accepted in the book of chronicles according to Nehemiah 12:23. Archaeology=Letter from Elephantine papyri= Among the Elephantine papyri, a collection of 5th century BCE Hebrew manuscripts from the Jewish community at Elephantine in Egypt, a letter was found in which Johanan is mentioned. The letter is dated \\"the 20th of Marshewan, year 17 of king Darius\\", which corresponds to 407 BCE.Pritchard, James B. ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, Princeton University Press, third edition with supplement 1969, p. 492 It is addressed to Bagoas, the governor of Judah, and is a request for the rebuilding of a Jewish temple at Elephantine, which was destroyed by Egyptian pagans. The letter includes the following passage: > \\"(...) We have also sent a letter before now, when this evil was done to us, > to our lord and to the high priest Johanan and his colleagues the priests in > Jerusalem and to Ostanes the brother of Anani and the nobles of the Jews, > Never a letter have they sent to us. (...)\\" It has been suggested that the Anani that is referred to here might be the same as in 1 Chronicles 3:24. =Yohanan coin= On a silver coin from the late Persian period, Dan Barag and other scholars have identified the Hebrew phrase (\\"Yo·∏•anan the priest\\").Betlyon, John Wilson, \\"The Provincial Government of Persian Period Judea and the Yehud Coins\\" Journal of Biblical Literature Vol. 105, No. 4 (Dec., 1986), pp. 639‚Äì642 Because it is generally dated between 350 BCE and Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia, around 333 BCE,Fried, Lisbeth S., A silver coin of Yohanan Hakk√¥hen, Transeuphrat√®ne 26 (2003) pp. 67, 85 (pdf) the coin is usually attributed to a second high priest called Johanan, who is not mentioned in the Bible. Thus, the coin seems to lend support to the hypothesis by Frank Moore Cross from 1975 that there were two subsequent father/son pairs of high priests called Johanan and Jaddua, the latter pair of which was accidentally omitted from the biblical text because of haplography. However, Lisbeth Fried has challenged this late dating of the coin and has suggested a date between 378 and 368 BCE. She believes that the coin refers to the same individual as the one mentioned in Josephus and Nehemiah, and that it is unnecessary to propose a second Johanan. Name There is dispute over his actual name. Neh 12:11 lists him as Jonathan, while 12:22 mentions Joiada's successor as Johanan. Josephus also lists him as Johanan (John).Antiquities 11:297‚Äì302, Josephus According to the Anchor Bible Dictionary there is also a dispute regarding the genealogy of Johanan. Neh 12:10‚Äì11 lists Johanan as the grandson of Eliashib while Neh 12:23 identifies him as the son of Eliashib. \\"Although it is possible that Heb ben is to be translated as 'grandson' in Neh 12:23; cf. NEB, JB)\\" There is yet to be extrabiblical proof that a man named Jonathan ever served as high priest. This has led many to believe that the biblical text has a copy mistake.From Joshua To Caiaphas: High Priests after the Exile 54‚Äì63, James Vander Kam See also *List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources References 5th-century BC High Priests of Israel 4th-century BC High Priests of Israel 5th-century BC clergy 4th-century BC clergy 5th-century BCE Jews 4th-century BCE Jews Year of death unknown Year of birth unknown High Priests of Israel ","title":"Johanan (High Priest)"},{"id":"21283957","text":"Eliashib ( ‚ÄôElyƒÅ≈°√Æ·∏á, \\"El restores\\") the High Priest is mentioned in Nehemiah 12:10,22 and 3:1, 20-21,13:28 and possibly the Book of Ezra of the Hebrew Bible as (grand)father (Nehemiah 12:22) of the high priest Johanan (Ezra 10:6). Some also place him in different parts of Nehemiah including 12:23 and 13:4,7, but this is disputed. Nehemiah 3:20-21 places his home between the area of two working groups constructing the walls of Jerusalem on the south side of the city. He helped with the refortification of this wall (Neh 3:1). The size of his house indicated his wealth and high socio-economic status (Neh 3:23-21). This places him as someone who lived during the time of Nehemiah. In the year 445 BCE, Eliashib was the high priest when Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem in the 20th year of Artaxerxes I (Nehemiah 1:1, 2:1).VanderKam, From Joshua to Caiaphas (The High Priests of the Persian Period) Josephus puts Eliashib as a contemporary of Ezra during the reign of Xerxes, in Ant. 11.5,6-8. He also dates his reign as high priest through the reign of Cyrus the Younger, who Josephus mentions is \\"also called by the Greeks, Artaxerxes\\". Josephus outlines this story in Antiq. 11:185- Antiq 11:297. The last quotation of this story states, \\"When Eliasib the high priest was dead, his son Judas succeeded in the high priesthood.\\"(Antiq 11:297) Eliashib's grandson was married to the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite (Neh 13:28) and, while Nehemiah was absent in Babylon, Eliashib had leased the storerooms of the Second Temple to Sanballat's associate Tobiah the Ammonite. When Nehemiah returned he threw Tobiah's furniture out of the temple and drove out Eliashib's grandson (Neh 13:4-9). According to David Kimhi,Rabbi David Kimchi's Commentary upon the prophecies of Zechariah David Kimchi, Alexander McCaul \\"Satan is spoken figuratively of Sanballat and his companions, who were adversaries to them, and caused them to stop from their work. Jonathan has thus interpreted it, \\" And the sinner * stood at his right hand to oppose him. \\" this is the political background to the allegorical vision of Satan, the Angel of the Lord and Eliashib's (possibly deceased) grandfather Joshua the High Priest in Zechariah 3.

Kleppa (February 4, 1920 ‚Äì May 27, 2007) was a Norwegian-born physical chemist and a pioneer and leading authority in the study of metals, molten salts, ceramics and minerals at high temperatures. Kleppa was a professor at the University of Chicago, where he held appointments in the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Geophysical Sciences, the James Franck Institute, and the College. He was the director of the James Franck Institute and the Materials Research Laboratory. Biography Kleppa was born in Kristiania, Norway to Per and Karen Kleppa. After completing secondary school, Kleppa received his Master of Science degree in chemical engineering in 1946 and his Ph.D. in 1956 from the Norwegian Institute of Technology. =During World War II= His education, however, was interrupted by the German invasion of Norway. As a leader in student government, Kleppa helped organize organized readings at which participants extolled freedom and Norwegian nationalism and took part in other resistance activities. Feeling that the situation was getting dangerous, Kleppa along with five or six others then decided to disguise themselves as berry pickers and flee Norway for neutral Sweden. After the war, Kleppa learned from his aunt that he crossed the border on the very day that she had received a letter from the Gestapo seeking to question him. After a year of teaching chemistry and physics in Uppsala, Sweden he flew to Great Britain, where he served in the Norwegian Army as an Intelligence Officer. Kleppa served as an officer in a Norwegian military unit while in Britain. In 1943, he was sent to Iceland for eight months to teach U.S. soldiers to work in cold weather environments and to train them in winter warfare tactics. In Iceland Kleppa also befriended Kristjan Eldjarn, who later became Iceland's third president. =At the University of Chicago= The author of over 350 scientific publications, Ole Kleppa worked at the University of Chicago from 1947 until his death in 2007. He arrived at the University shortly after marrying his wife, Abbie Joy Stodder. As a scientist at Chicago, Kleppa developed a series of calorimeters capable of making difficult scientific measurements less complicated. One of his primary achievements was the development of the Kleppa calorimeter, an instrument that measures tiny amounts of heat as new materials form at high temperatures. He built a series of calorimeters in order to measure precise enthalpies of formation at high temperatures. Kleppa‚Äôs calorimeters determined how much energy a particular compound alloy, or mineral requires to form. The results of these findings were much sought after by engineers and scientists working on marketable applications and by curious theoreticians pursuing basic research. The alloys, minerals, and compounds that Kleppa collected and interpreted data on has been widely used in the aviation industry and by physicists developing superconducting materials for advanced technological applications including nuclear reactors. Ole Kleppa also made a unique contribution to the field of molten salts, as his measurements and methods gave rise to great progress in the field. Kleppa served as the Associate Director of the James Franck Institute from 1968 to 1971 and then its Director from 1971 to 1977. He also served as Director of the Materials Research Lab at the University of Chicago from 1984 to 1987. During his career, he held positions on the board of editors of the Journal of Chemical Thermodynamics, Journal of Physical Chemistry, and Journal of Phase Equilibria. Kleppa was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, of the Norwegian Institute of Technology, and a Fellow of ASM International and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Kleppa retired as a Professor Emeritus in 1990, but he maintained his lab and continued to receive grants until his death. He held on to his Norwegian citizenship until 2000, when he became a U.S. citizen. He was a friend and colleague of R. Stephen Berry, Stuart Rice, Robert Gomer, Thomas Rosenbaum, and Nobel Laureates Yoichiro Nambu and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Ole Kleppa died on May 27, 2007 at University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas.

Life Castle Leslie, the family estate in Glaslough John Powell Leslie was the second son and one of twelve surviving children born to Charles Powell Leslie (1731-1800) and Prudence Leslie (1745 - ?). The Leslies were a numerous and prolific family with a long history of service in the Church of Ireland; his great-grandfather was Charles Leslie, a noted Non-Juror member of the Church of Ireland and one of the most prominent Jacobite propagandists after the 1688 Glorious Revolution. Born 12 October 1772 on the family estate at Glaslough, County Monaghan, John married Isabella St Lawrence (1790-1830), daughter of the Bishop of Ross and they had eight children. In 1807, Leslie was appointed Dean of St Fin Barre's, Cork and then Bishop of Dromore in 1812, a position briefly held by his distant relative Robert Leslie in 1661. In 1819, his elder brother Charles, a prominent supporter of Lord Liverpool's government unsuccessfully petitioned for him to be made Bishop of Clogher, which included the family estate at Glaslough. This went to Lord John Beresford, later Primate of All-Ireland and John had to wait until 1820, when he was made Bishop of Elphin before becoming the first bishop of the united diocese of Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh in 1841.

The genus has lignin and contains secondary cell walls, traits which are normally associated with the vascular plants. It is similar to the genus Bossiella. Calliarthron is calcified, but also has uncalcified joints that allow it to flex in response to the waves to which it is subjected. These joints start out calcified, and decalcify as they grow older. After decalcifying they grow much longer, then fatten themselves up in the same way as xylem formation, resulting in secondary walls.  Species  The 2 species currently recognised are:Paul W.

It is located on Hennepin County Road 15, across from Lafayette Bay on Lake Minnetonka. The house was built in 1887 for Charles Telford Thompson, an attorney and civil leader, and his wife. It was listed on the National Register as a typical example of the types of Queen Anne summer homes that middle and upper-class Minneapolis residents owned on Lake Minnetonka during the end of the 19th Century. An identical house owned by Samuel A. Harris, Charles Thompson's brother-in-law, once sat adjacent to the Thompson Summer House, but was demolished in 1968. In the 1990s, the house faced deterioration from erosion and rot. In an effort to stabilize the foundation and rebuild the wraparound porch while preserving the character of the house, the owners undertook a major restoration project. The project, conducted by Wes Foss, the husband of Thompson's great-great granddaughter Debbie, was featured on a three-part episode of Hometime on PBS and won an award from the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota in 2005. The house is currently one of the oldest extant summer houses on Lake Minnetonka and is in excellent condition. It is still used strictly as a summer home (as it has always been) and frequently hosts family gatherings.

It is one of the largest retailers of DIY building materials in Denmark, and they primarily sell to nonprofessionals but also to professional tradesmen. The name, Silvan, comes from the Latin word for forest, silva. Silvan has 41 DIY stores situated near larger cities around Denmark. The average size of the stores is 2,400 square metres excluding warehouse, administration, garden center and drive-in. In addition to the 41 DIY stores, Silvan also has a webshop with more than 22,000 articles. The day-to-day operations of Silvan A/S takes place in the head office in Brabrand near Aarhus where approximately 100 people are employed. History Silvan was established back in 1874 when the grocers Johan Christian Strudsberg and Peter Thomsen established and opened the company for the first time under the name: Tr√¶last- og Kulhandelen Silvan. In 1894 Silvan was registered as a partnership and in December 1900, the company was bought up and turned into a joint-stock company by industrialist Vilh. Lange, factory owner H. P. B. Kierulff, wholesaler C. J. Christensen and grocer Christian Lund. In 1913 the company changed its name to Akts. Tr√¶lasthandelen Silvan as the coal trade was sold to A/S Slagelse Kulkompagni. From then onwards, Tr√¶lasthandelen Silvan sold mainly timber and building materials. In 1968, Silvan opened the first store in Slagelse with an even broader product offering. Here customers could also buy hand tools, gardening equipment etc. Together with STARK, Silvan has through the years been owned by Danske Tr√¶last which in 2006 changed its name to DT Group. Danske Tr√¶last was established back in 1896 under the name: Aarhus Tr√¶lasthandel.

They did a similar effort later in London's Carnaby Street on shopping bags (1999), and converted an Amsterdam church into the Kessels Kramer Advertising Office in 1998 with big playground furniture, a fort, fake diving board, and lifeguard shack. Sean Griffiths, Charles Holland and Sam Jacob are the main members of the group. Emma Somerset Davis has been a previous member and a director of the group and lead artist collaborating on FAT's art exhibitions and projects over ten years. The group operated on a limited budget with their early projects and acts as a collective that is anti-hierarchical. They have been influenced by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, Stanley Tigerman, Situationists, Mannerism, the Arts and Crafts movement, Archigram, and Jeff Koons. They \\"steal copy, collage and make overt references to all kinds of high and low architecture; reusing, rescaling, recolouring; remaking their sources in the wrong materials,\\" with their first projects being redesigns of interiors such as the Brunel Rooms nightclub in Swindon (1995) where a running track, swimming pool, garden shed and lounge were added.

The group has been described as \\"very young\\" and \\"very controversial\\", having \\"brought work in the ultra-cool Netherlands,\\" success on the international lecture and exhibition circuit. Members of the group describe FAT's work as figurative, eclectic and \\"not constrained by notions of taste.\\" They view mainstream architecture as abstract, and say their work is direct and traditional like the \\"Natural History Museum... It‚Äôs got little animals all over it.\\" The group started out with a \\"small powerful, furiously debated body of built work, some of it up before the protagonists hit thirty\\". Recent work FAT's design for a ‚Äúbicycle surveillance shelter‚Äù or guard huts for bikes in Scheveningen is a small pyramid on one side and a battlemented castle on the other. FAT calls the work a \\"nonument\\" and it was popular enough to feature on a 69c Dutch stamp. FAT also completed the Woodward Place building in the United Kingdom with a Dutch-gables-on-steroids treatment that \\"has the functionalists choking on their herb tea\\" in a rejection of tidiness and uniformity that embraces clients use of crazy self-built fireplaces, half-timbering and nick-nacks. FAT believes that \\"people should be encouraged to customise their homes,\\" and won a competition to redesign the Brookes Estate tower block in London with a plan for \\"a matrix from which homes of various styles and sizes sprout, quite literally\\" and where tenants will choose from various design options. FAT also did the ¬£3.5 million makeover of the Saint Lucas Art Academy in Boxtel with \\"clever space planning behind a new facade of pseudo-gothic tracery in moulded concrete.\\" FAT was brought in with a limited budget by the KesselsKramer advertising firm, whose church office it had designed 10 years prior, to help establish the technical art college for young students (16‚Äì20 years), in a more suitable and striking building.

In the dialects of other Tangsa communities, the term for \\"God\\" takes variants such as Rangwa, Rangkhothak, etc. Traditionally, the Tangsas rarely practiced any kind of religious rituals dedicated to the God. However, they generally used various ways to invoke spirits to either receive their benevolent influences or to protect themselves from their malevolent activities. The rituals were mostly invocations, which predominantly involved offerings of animals, rice, rice-beer, eggs, etc. wrapped in leaves of a particular plant and then placing them at a sacred location specific to that particular ritual.

This original missive was apparently written not long after Ardashir had overthrown Ardavan, and Tansar appears to have been responding to charges levelled at Ardashir, and the delay in accepting Ardashir's suzerainty. Representative of those charges is the accusation that Ardashir \\"had taken away fires from the fire-temples, extinguished them and blotted them out.\\" To this, Tansar replies that it was the \\"kings of the peoples [i.e. Parthians' vassal kings]\\" that began the practice of dynastic fires, an \\"innovation\\" unauthorized by the kings of old. A similar response appears in Book IV of the 9th century Denkard. The letter was revised in the 6th-century, during the reign of Khusrow I Anoshiravan. The legend that the Arsacid Parthians had allowed Zoroastrianism to fall into neglect stems from the same period. The letter was translated into Arabic in the 9th century by Ibn al- Muqaffa, and from Arabic into New Persian in the 13th-century when Ibn Isfandiyar, an Iranian Muslim, put it in his History of Tabaristan (a mountainous region in northern Iran). The Ibn Isfandiar version, which dates to 1210-1216, is the only one that survives. The importance of the Letter of Tansar was first perceived by James Darmesteter, who published the first critical translation of it in 1894..

He is principally celebrated for having been the first person on whom the title of \\"Archiater\\" is known to have been conferred, and also for having been the inventor of a very famous compound medicine and antidote, which was called after his name Theriaca Andromachi, which long enjoyed a great reputation. Andromachus has left us the directions for making this strange mixture in a Greek elegiac poem, consisting of 174 lines, and dedicated to Nero. Galen has inserted it in two of his works,Galen, De Antid. i. 6, and De Ther. ad Pis. c. 6. vol. xiv. pp. 32-42 and says that Andromachus chose this form as being more easily remembered than prose, and less likely to be altered.

The airfield as such was inactivated after 1946 but part of the former airfield is still used as a training facility for parachute drops and vertical take off and landing aircraft such as the F-35. The facility is referenced as FAC6005 by Okinawa Prefecture. History=Invasion and construction= Location of Ie Shima Airfield The airfields on Ie Shima were built by the Japanese prior to the American invasion and subsequent Battle of Okinawa in April 1945. It was seized by elements of the United States Army 77th Infantry Division after intermittent bombardment of the island by the United States Navy Fifth Fleet from 25 March through 16 April when the invasion of the island commenced. The island was not declared secure until 24 April. Prior to the invasion, the Japanese commander on Okinawa, believing that Ie Shima could not be held for more than a few days, ordered that the airfields on the island be destroyed by the end of March 1945. Thorough demolitions followed. The runways were ditched and blasted and the entire central area sown with mines, as defense against possible airborne attack. The airfields were also mined by unused aerial bombs and mines made from drums of gasoline. Base development proceeded rapidly once the mopping up was completed. Although initially delayed by the large number of mines, soldiers from the 805th Engineer Aviation Battalion, 1892nd Engineer Aviation Battalion, the 1902nd and the 1903rd Engineer Aviation Battalions, and several other engineering units quickly repaired the enemy airfields and began the construction of new runways, along with a series of interlinking taxiways, revetments, maintenance facilities along with a containment facility for personnel. The coral foundation of the island and the rubble of the town of Ie facilitated the work. There was ample room for dispersal area, and the sloping ground on the sides and ends of the central plateau provided space for housing base personnel. Japanese civilians were evacuated to Tokashiki in the Kerama Islands. Engineers discovered a large limestone basin on the north coast which produced 100,000 gallons of fresh water. Under these conditions work proceeded rapidly and by 10 May one fighter group was based on the island. By the middle of the month three runways were ready for operational use along with taxiways. In addition, radar and air warning facilities installed, although much construction work remained. =Operational units assigned= By 14 June three fighter groups and one night fighter squadron were operating from the airfield. As expected, Ie Shima proved to be an ideal base for the support of operations on Okinawa and for preparing later attacks on the Japanese homeland. * Headquarters, 43d Bombardment Group, Fifth Air

the 345th Bombardment Group and 80th Fighter Squadron P-38 Lightnings escorted two Japanese Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bombers. The Japanese aircraft carried a delegation from Tokyo en route to Manila to meet General MacArthur's staff to work out details of the surrender. The Betty bombers were painted white with green crosses on the wings, fuselage and vertical tail surface and use the call signs Bataan I and Bataan II. After the delegation landed at Ie Shima, they boarded a C-54 Skymaster and were flown to Manila. After the meeting, they returned to Ie Shima. One of the two Bettys crashed on its way back to Japan out of fuel, due to an incorrect conversion of liters to gallons when the bombers were refueled. The crew were helped by a local fisherman, and returned to Tokyo by train. =Postwar use= With the end of the war, many of the units assigned to Ie Shima were reassigned or inactivated. By the end of 1946, the facility was closed and placed in reserve status. The American military still controlled roughly one third of the island in 2010. As of May 2019, according to the \\"Ie Island Guide Map\\" posted at the ferry landing, the American Military controls roughly 15% of the island as the \\"Ie Shima Training Facility,\\" used primarily by the U.S. Marine Corps. In the late 1950s the air station was used as a bomb gunnery range. In March 1955, occurred what has been called the second Invasion of the island by the American military. After the expropriation of their lands and houses at gun-point, many local farmers were injured when trying pick up spent cartridges left by aircraft performing gunnery practice. There were two Air Force units stationed on the island in the early 1960s. One was Detachment 1, 1962nd Communications Group which operated a radio receiver site. The other was a unit responsible for operating the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing's bomb gunnery range on the island. Although small, the base looked much like a full-fledged base which included barracks, mess hall, fire department, security guards and guard dogs, a small motor pool and even a Non-Commissioned Officers Club. Although the air force station had a usable runway which was occasionally used, transport of personnel and supplies to the island was on the local civilian ferry from Motobu Port on Okinawa. In 1963 the island experienced a severe drought. For a while all the water wells on the island except for one dried up. That one well was on airfield property controlled by the U.S. Air Force. The officer in charge dispatched his fire department personnel to use the station's pumper truck to pick up water at the well and to distribute the water to several locations on the island. As a result, Air Force officials on Ie Shima and Okinawa received several letters of appreciation from local officials. =Current use= The three runways that were in use when World War II ended still exist. The United States military maintains the western runway as a small unimproved coral runway. It also has a simulated LHA deck, and a drop zone for parachute training, being part of a military training facility operated by the United States Marine Corps. There is a detachment of usually less than 20 Marines which operates the range. F-35 operations have been conducted at the USMC facility. An admin and housing facility for personnel has been built at the Northern end of the derelict middle airstrip. The eastern runway is now Iejima Airport and is used by a small civilian air carrier, and the central one is now abandoned and is used as a thoroughfare for residents to get from the north to the south side of the island. The Simulated LHA deck is used by Marine Wing Support Squadron 172 Marine Aircraft Group 36. The coral runway is also still in use for touch and go operations. The Iejima Light House is located within the U.S. military fence line at the southwest end of the island. The U.S. Marine Corps, along with the Japan Coast Guard, periodically hosts a memorial ceremony for the light keeper killed during the battle of Ie Shima in WWII.

His election to that See having been confirmed on 26 August 1771, he was consecrated a bishop by Frederick Cornwallis, Archbishop of Canterbury (with Richard Terrick, Bishop of London; Zachary Pearce, Bishop of Rochester; and William Markham Bishop of Chester) on 8 September 1771 at Lambeth Palace chapel North was Bishop of Lichfield for three years before his election as Bishop of Worcester was confirmed on 27 December 1774; he then remained in Worcester for six and a half years until his election to the See of Winchester was confirmed on 5 June 1781. Throughout the period of his appointments to these two Sees his half-brother remained Prime Minister. North was enthroned (by proxy) at Winchester Cathedral on 25 June 1781 and continued as Bishop of Winchester until his death, following a long illness, at Winchester House, Chelsea on 12 July 1820. He was then buried at his cathedral on 21 August 1820. Marriage and family Mrs Brownlow North with her son Charles Augustus North (1785-1825) (Richard Cosway, 1791) On 17 January 1771, North married Henrietta Maria Bannister, who died on 17 November 1796. His eldest son Francis North, 6th Earl of Guilford and his youngest Charles Augustus North both became Anglican priests; of his four daughters, one (Henrietta) married a priest and another (Elizabeth) married Thomas de Grey, 4th Baron Walsingham.

It is located on Avenida Ortega y Gasset Ensanche La Fe, Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional of the Dominican Republic. The HGPS is technically and administratively managed by a board set up by Decree No. 131, April 18, 1996 and ratified by Congress through Law No.78-99, dated 24 July 1999. The Board is composed of distinguished doctors, businessmen, and individuals dedicated to serving the Dominican community as well as ex officio members: the Secretary of State for Public Health and Social Welfare, the Director of the Dominican Social Security Institute, the Chairman of National Council of Businessmen and the Secretary of Labor. Under the supervision of the Board, the HGPS has an organizational structure headed by the Executive Directorate, responsible for coordinating the planning and management to achieve its goals. Dependent on this Directorate are the Financial Management and Administration Directorate, Medical Directorate and the Directorate of Hospital Support. These in turn have different departments headed by managers and service units under the supervision of their heads. HGPS medical staff is composed of specialists, sub-specialists and general or internal practitioners, grouped into the following departments: Internal medicine and specialties, General Surgery and specialties, OB-GYN, Gastroenterology and Endoscopy, Pediatrics and specialties, Family Medicine Education and Research, Orthopedics and Traumatology. Other services offered are: Diagnostic Imaging, Pathology, Geriatrics, Physical medicine and rehabilitation, Dentistry, Laboratory and Blood Bank, Cardiology, Onco Hematology, Ophthalmology, Breast Pathology, Emergency Medicine, nursing, pharmacy, nutrition and social work. Each year, the HGPS benefits more than 13,000 low-income patients who receive up to a 40 percent discount or are exempt from payment according to their financial condition. The HGPS receives a grant from the Dominican Government that covers the annual cost of exemptions and discounts to patients with limited resources. Since 2003, the HGPS is a teaching facility and has three medical residency programs in the areas of Family and Community Medicine, Medical Emergency and Disasters and Rehabilitation Medicine, supported by the Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE). At present, the HGPS has become a major center for training and education for the health sciences faculties of major universities in the country: UNIBE, INTEC, UNPHU, UCE, UASD, and the Catholic University Santo Domingo (UCSD), for both its undergraduate and graduate programs. The HGPS is recognized as a center of excellence in Dominican medicine, setting quality standards for the entire country. History The medical institutions of the Plaza de la Salud: the General Hospital (HGPS) and the Centers for Diagnostics and Advanced Medicine and Medical Conferences and Telemedicine (CEDIMAT), part of the concept created by Dr. Juan Manuel Taveras Rodriguez, a world-renowned Dominican medical specialist, considered the father of Neuroradiology. In 1996, President Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, by decree designated an area of for these buildings. The area is divided into equal parts between HGPS and CEDIMAT and shares its grounds with other health institutions such as the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO / WHO), the Emergency Operations Center (COE) and the Presidential Commission for AIDS (COPRESIDA) among others. The initial construction was built with funds by the Dominican State. Law 163-03, dated February 10, 2003, approved the grant contract between the Dominican State and the Boards of both HGPS and CEDIMAT for the assignment and transfer of land of the Plaza de la Salud. The law was promulgated by the Executive Power, dated 13 September 2003. HGPS Highlights *It has helped more than 140,000 low- income patients with discounts and waivers of its health treatment plans, helping to improve their quality of life and their physical and emotional well-being. *Blood Bank with a high level of reliability and credibility, as well as the creation of the section of Cryopreservation of stem cells at the Blood Bank, which supports the HGPS's bone marrow transplant services (only one in the country). *It is a teaching hospital facility with a board of educational programs in the following specialties: Family and Community Medicine, Medical Emergency and Disasters and Rehabilitation Medicine. *Conducts a yearly Scientific Symposium to present the institution's research and medical advances. *CENTOX, the first Poison control center in the Dominican Republic. *Followed the successful pregnancy, delivery and birth of the first sextuplets in the Dominican Republic with only 26 and a half weeks of gestation. The children are now 4 years of age and healthy (2009). *Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) as a national reference of care. *Pacemaker Clinic *Hemodialysis Unit *Center for Integrated medicine *Thorax Pain Unit *Organ and tissue transplantation program., which has a Transplant Counsel and an Organ Captivity Coordination Unit. The program achieved the first kidney transplant from a deceased donor in the country, liver transplants from deceased donors and corneal transplantation. *Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Hospital, with Urodynamics and Isokinetic Diagnostics units. *Volunteerism unit to work with the hospital community with a high degree of solidarity and commitment. *First Primary Care Center of the Dominican Republic. *The country's first outpatient surgery program. *The permanence of the only functioning hospital bioethics committee in the country, meeting regularly since 1997. *Implementation of the first free hip and knee replacement program in the country called Operation Walk, a medical mission for patients with limited resources. It was led by a team of local and international specialists from Brigham and Women's Hospital and since 2008, has benefited over 80 Dominican patients and their families. *Units of Care and Solidarity (UNASOL), offering medical assistance to thousands of people affected by tragedies of force majeure. *Diabetic foot Clinic to prevent and treat all foot diseases in any patient. *Dengue Clinic, as a national reference for all those who present symptoms. Criticism Since its inception, the HGPS has been perceived by the Dominican people as being a State-run facility that should offer free services as it was initially built using State funds. However, by decree, the HGPS was created to provide non- profit medical assistance and uses the fees for services to continue to run its day-to-day operations. While the HGPS receives a government grant to cover services offered to low-income patients at discount or free of charge, the cost of operations can only be met charging a below market fee for its renown medical services.

The neutrons are captured, forming deuterium and releasing a gamma ray with an energy of 2.2 MeV (the binding energy of deuterium), which is subsequently detected. The detector array consists of 4 rings of 12 detectors each, where each ring is concentric around the neutron beam. The polarization of the incoming neutron beam is alternated rapidly to study the spin correlation of the direction of the emitted gamma ray. The measured quantity is the difference in the number of gamma rays emitted within a solid angle between the two neutron spin states. This difference (divided by the sum) forms an asymmetry with possible parity-violating and parity- conserving components, where the former is known as A_gamma. By studying the parity-violating correlation between the spin of the incoming neutron (its polarization) and the direction of the emitted gamma ray, one primarily probes h_pi (traditionally known as f_pi), the long-range coupling constant used to describe the hadronic weak interaction. The first phase of the NPDGamma experiment was carried out at Los Alamos National Lab in 2006, but did not have the statistical sensitivity to test theoretical predictions (A_gamma=Oleft(10^{-8}right)). The current phase of the NPDGamma experiment is running at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Lab. Production data began in the spring of 2012.

Early life and education Timpson was born and grew up in Silicon Valley, California at the height of the computer age. Although still regularly frequenting that area, he has also lived in Los Angeles, Upstate New York, Michigan, Kansas, Memphis, England, and Taiwan. Most recently he resided in Tampa, Florida before moving to Seoul, Korea in August 2010. A child of the multicultural era in Northern California, he was intrigued with Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian, and Oceanic traditional music in his formative years; seeds that would eventually bear a lasting impact on his musical style. In recent years, with his research on Chinese instruments, he has become a doubler/improviser on various Chinese wind instruments, such as suona, guanzi, yamudi, dizi, xiao, chiba, xun, koudi, bawu, hulusi, sheng, hulusheng and other related instruments from Asia and the Middle East. He earned a BM at the University of Southern California, an MA at the Eastman School of Music, and a DMA at the University of Michigan; his notable teachers include Samuel Adler, William Albright, William Bolcom, Morten Lauridsen and Joseph Schwantner. Career Although clearly a composer of the concert art-music genre, his definitive style combines elements of European, American, and Asian musical sources. His music is written for nearly every medium, including orchestral, chamber, band, percussion, electronic, vocal, and even non-western instruments. His two most well-known and performed compositions are Chasin‚Äô Bill for Chinese silk and bamboo ensemble and CRUSH for soprano saxophone and Chinese Guzheng. The nature of his music is eclectic, stemming from maximalism to minimalism, modernism to postmodernism, and fluidly combines tonality and atonality. His musical beginnings were borne out of playing baritone saxophone and bass clarinet, often manipulating the latter instrument with guitar pedals; he was also co-founder of the group Jazz on the line with fellow saxophonists Rent Romus (Aaron Repke) and Dan Magay. This led to a strong interest in American improvisational forms, especially Cool Jazz, Progressive Bebop, Free Jazz, and non-commercially oriented Jazz Fusion. He would later evolve incorporations and influences of funk, new wave, heavy metal, new jack swing, electronica, trip hop, and shibuya-kei into his music. He has recently been appointed as Associate Professor of Music Composition at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, Korea. He is a former faculty member in the same fields at University of South Florida, University of Kansas and Rhodes College and in 2009, was a Senior Fulbright Research Scholar (Humanities) in Taipei, Taiwan to write a book on orchestration for Chinese instruments. A musical style that merges American jazz and pop, Asian traditions and the European avant-garde, his compositions have been featured throughout the United States, France, Czech, Ukraine, Canada, Japan, and Taiwan. Timpson won the ASCAP Grant for Young Composers, the BMI Student Composers Award, the DownBeat Magazine award for extended composition, and was twice nominated for the American Academy of Arts and Letters composition award. He also won the Brian M. Israel Prize (The Society for New Music and the New York Federation of Music Clubs), the Lee Ettelson Composer‚Äôs Award, National Federation of Music Club‚Äôs Youse competition, second places at the Music From China International Competition and in NACUSA (National Association of Composers of The United States of America)‚Äôs composition competition, very highly commended in England‚Äôs Kathryn Thomas Flute Competition, and honorable mention at the National Federation of Music Club‚Äôs Beyer competition. His compositions appear on Albany/Capstone, CRS, NACUSA, and ERM recording labels, and have been published by World-Wide-Music. Three of his works were recorded by the Kiev Philharmonic and a fourth by the Chinese National Film Orchestra. His works were premiered in Carnegie Hall, Merkin Hall, and Taiwan National Concert Hall, and his orchestral compositions were premiered by The Florida Orchestra and the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra. Timpson‚Äôs works have also appeared on radio shows throughout the U.S., Asia, and Europe. His music is published by HoneyRock Music and American Composers Editions.

It is the second book in the Alexander and Cass Cleave Trilogy, which also contains the novels Eclipse, published in 2000, and Ancient Light, published in 2012. Plot summary Axel Vander, famous man of letters and recently widowed, travels to Turin to meet a young woman called Cass Cleave. Cleave is a literary researcher who has discovered two secrets about Vander's early years in Antwerp. The first is that, in the years prior to World War Two, Vander contributed some anti- Semitic articles to a right-wing newspaper, and secondly, that he is not Axel Vander at all. He is Vander's childhood friend; he appropriated Vander's name and identity after the man disappeared and was presumed dead. Background The novel is partly inspired by two scandals regarding famous academics that occurred in the 1980s: the posthumous discovery of anti-Semitic texts written during World War II by literary critic Paul de Man, who had an influential postwar career in the United States; and the murder by Louis Althusser of his wife H√©l√®ne Legotien. Althusser was a well-known Marxist philosopher Banville has said that this is one of his favourite novels ‚Äî \\"a dark, hard, cruel book\\", one in which he came closest to achieving what he set out to write at the start of the writing process.

The song, which was originally released on Tape from California (1968), has been described as \\"one of the most potent antiwar songs of the 1960s\\". One of Ochs' biographers wrote that \\"The War Is Over\\" is his \\"greatest act of bravery as a topical songwriter\\". Background American involvement in the Vietnam War escalated significantly during 1966. The number of American troops fighting in Vietnam increased that year from 184,000 to 450,000. In 1966, poet Allen Ginsberg decided to declare that the Vietnam War was over. The idea of ending the war simply by declaring it over appealed to Ochs, who organized a rally in Los Angeles to announce that the war was over. To publicize the rally, he wrote an article in the Los Angeles Free Press titled \\"Have Faith, The War Is Over\\": > Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, friends, do what I and > thousands of other Americans have done ‚Äî declare the war over. Ochs wrote a song for the rally, in which he, like \\"thousands of other Americans\\", declared the war was over. The song \\"The War Is Over\\" alludes to war films and their heroes and asks \\"what's this got to do with me?\\" The song describes anti-war protesters as \\"angry artists painting angry signs\\" who have become \\"poisoned players\\" in a cycle of endless anti-war demonstrations that have failed to end the war. The song mockingly suggests that young men enlist in the army to \\"serve your country in her suicide\\", but adds that \\"just before the end even treason might be worth a try ‚Äî this country is too young to die\\". Each verse of the song ends with variations on the words, \\"I declare the war is over, it's over, it's over\\". Ochs recorded \\"The War Is Over\\" for his fifth album, Tape from California. The musical arrangement, by Bob Thompson, incorporates martial beats, brass horns, and flutes. The opening is a theme from the National Emblem March by Edwin Eugene Bagley. Other parts of the arrangement include quotes from John Philip Sousa's patriotic march \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\", implying that opposition to the Vietnam War was patriotic. As the song fades out, the horns play part of Ochs's own \\"I Ain't Marching Anymore\\". Notable performances Ochs first performed the song in public at the \\"War Is Over\\" rally in Los Angeles on June 23, 1967. \\"The War Is Over\\" became one of Ochs' best-known songs. He performed before 150,000 demonstrators in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 1967. In November, Ochs planned a \\"War Is Over\\" rally in New York. After Ochs sang \\"The War Is Over\\", several thousand demonstrators marched from Washington Square Park to Times Square and then to the United Nations. In August 1968, Ochs performed \\"The War Is Over\\" during the protests in Chicago, inspiring hundreds of young men to burn their draft cards. When Ochs sang the line \\"even treason might be worth a try ‚Äî this country is too young to die\\", he was interrupted by five minutes of cheering. He couldn't finish the song and had to leave the stage. On August 28, 1969 Ochs sang the song at Chicago's Grant Park Bandshell on the first anniversary of the Democratic Convention's \\"The whole world is watching\\" police riot. The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, and a final \\"War Is Over\\" rally was held in New York's Central Park on May 11. At the rally, Ochs sang \\"The War Is Over\\" in public for the last time. Single release A&M; Records released \\"The War Is Over\\" as a single in 1968. The B-side of the single was \\"The Harder They Fall\\", another song from Tape from California. The version of \\"The Harder They Fall\\" on the single is a rock version of the song that has never been released on any album or compilation.

He was a barrister at the Supreme Court. Holmes was born in Geelong in 1845, the son of Mathew Holmes. His mother was in poor health and the family moved to Scotland in 1854 to have better access to health care. They lived on a large estate in Lasswade. He received his education at the University of Edinburgh and The Queen's College, Oxford; he graduated from Oxford in 1866. He was admitted to the Middle Temple as a barrister in 1870. With his family having moved to Otago in New Zealand in 1864, he emigrated to Dunedin and was admitted to the Supreme Court soon after he arrived. Holmes made two first-class appearances for the team, the first during the 1870‚Äì71 season, and the second three seasons later. On his debut, against Canterbury, he scored 12 runs in both innings in which he batted, though Otago would lose the match by an innings margin. In the second and final match in which he played, Holmes scored a duck, though Otago won the match by an innings margin, restricting Canterbury to just 38 runs in their second innings. In 1874, he took a position as a law lecturer at the University of Otago. In the mid-1870s, he joined the law firm of William Downie Stewart shortly after John Denniston had joined, and the firm was then known as Stewart, Holmes and Denniston, and acquired an extensive practice in Otago. Early in 1881, Holmes and Thomas S. Weston of Christchurch were appointed as examiners of candidates for admission to the New Zealand bar; they were the first to be appointed to this position. On 13 August 1873, he married Lillie McLean Waldie, the fourth daughter of Thomas Waldie, at Wyndholm near Ballarat in Victoria, Australia.

He also wrote the definitive biography of John Douglas, and played a part in the preservation of Albert Dock in Liverpool. Biography Edward Hubbard was born in Birkenhead in 1937 and studied architecture at Liverpool University where he discovered that his vocation was for the history of architecture rather than for its practice. When the Victorian Society was founded in 1958, Hubbard became an early member and in 1965 he established its first regional group in Liverpool, acting as its honorary secretary for 13 years. When the group was launched the first speaker was Nikolaus Pevsner, and Hubbard was to work with him for the next 20 years in helping to compile the series of the Buildings of England, and later the Buildings of Wales. He did the preparatory work for the South Lancashire volume, was joint author of the Cheshire volume, and helped to prepare the Staffordshire volume. He wrote the Clwyd volume for the Buildings of Wales which was published in 1986.Howell, Peter, in When they were preparing the Cheshire volume, Hubbard drove Pevsner around the county. In the introduction to the book, Pevsner says of Hubbard, \\"...his even temper and his psychological treatment of my moments of despondency were invaluable\\".Pevsner, Nikolaus in In 1976 Hubbard was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1980, with Michael Shippobottom, he organised an exhibition at the Royal Academy on Lord Leverhulme, which led to the joint publication in 1988 of A Guide to Port Sunlight Village. Hubbard was concerned with conservation, in particular with the upgrading of the listing of Albert Dock in Liverpool from Grade II to Grade I, which resulted in its preservation as a commercial and tourist attraction. In his work with Pevsner, Hubbard had become an admirer of the works of John Douglas. When he enrolled with the University of Manchester for an MA degree, Douglas was the subject of his thesis. This proved to be a substantial work of scholarship and Hubbard hoped it would be published. However he developed ankylosing spondylitis which led to an increasing degree of disability, and he died in 1989. The work was edited by Peter Howell and published posthumously by the Victorian Society in 1991 as The Work of John Douglas.

rises to high (above sea level) at to the north of the valley of the River Aeron and south of the valley of the Afon Wyre. It rises gently from the surrounding land and is farmed almost to the summit which is given over to coniferous forestry plantations. It is crossed, almost at the summit by an ancient drovers road now classified as the B4337 road which gave access from the northern parts of Ceredigion to South Wales before the coastal route down to Aberaeron was developed. Evidence of past use as a drovers road comes from some of the names of the farms adjoining the road such as Llundain East (East London in English). The route crossed the Afon Wyre at the old ford at Llanrhystud, passed over Trychrug before descending to the River Aeron and the crossing at Talsarn before continuing on to Lampeter.

High, a BBC children's spy-fi adventure series shown primarily on the CBBC channel. M.I. High Agents Rose Gupta (Saint Hope's Student and M.I.9 Spy, Series 1-5), played by Rachel Petladwala. Rose is the team's scientific, technical and analytical expert and has a high IQ, winning various competitions and producing miscellaneous inventions throughout the series. At school, Rose is shown as a stereotypical type of 'nerd' with big glasses, either with her hair tied up or tied back. She is usually always shown carrying several books. At times she can get frustrated over stupidity, clumsiness or not knowing something. When Daisy and Blane leave and Rose gets into her second year of being a spy she is more confident in herself and is being recognised by the class and Rose also develops more skills in her physical techniques as time goes by. She is the eldest of three siblings and her parents own the local DVD rental store. She hinted that she may have a small crush on Blaine's friend, Stewart, in \\"The Worm\\" and is annoyed that Stewart prefers Daisy to her. In a later episode it is shown that the Worm himself has a big crush on Rose. In the episode 'Eyes on Their Stars', Rose is shown to play the tuba, although in the episode, she switches to clarinet at the end of the episode. She also has a hidden talent for singing, shown when she sang with Crush. In season 3 she temporarily joins a school for exceedingly intelligent children, but returns to Saint Hope's when its true purpose is revealed. In the episodes \\"The B Team\\" and \\"The New Grand Master\\", Rose develops a crush on Scoop, and at the end of the former she states \\"The real Scoop is brave, thoughtful and kind, and the only thing holding him back is himself.\\" In \\"The Gran Master\\", it is revealed that Scoop still likes Rose in spite of not knowing that she's a spy, and each wants to go to the disco with the other. She reprises the role in each series until series 5. Series One and Two cast from left: Rose, Blane & Daisy. Blane Whittaker (Saint Hope's Student / M.I.9 Spy, Series 1-2), played by Moustafa Palazli was one of the three original agents in M.I. High along with Daisy and Rose. Blane is the team's hot-headed martial arts expert. He is also a karate black belt champion, and holds the UK long jump record. Blane has been best friends with Stewart since the age of six, but after joining M.I.9, he hasn't been able to spend as much time with Stewart as he's wanted to. It was mentioned in \\"Nerd Alert\\" that Blane has an older brother who's in the military. Blane's hobbies include watching martial arts films and playing video games. He also has a crush on Daisy and got extremely jealous at Chad when Daisy fancied him. After the end of series two, both he and Daisy leave the series, to go off and help train new child agents for M.I.9. Daisy Millar (Saint Hope's Student / M.I.9 Spy, Series 1-2), played by Bel Powley was one of the three original agents in M.I. High alongside Blane and Rose. Daisy is the beautiful master of disguise of the team. In many episodes she dresses up and goes undercover. She is also considered by Lenny to have superior social skills. Daisy is an only child. Her parents both work abroad. In \\"The Power Thief\\", we learn that her father is the chairman of a museum trustee board and is famous because of the position. She has met The Queen because of her father's position and lives in a big country estate, although she tells no one at school about her family or where she lives, only Blane finds out the truth in \\"The Power Thief\\". She loves they boy band \\"Crush\\". She has a crush on Blane but hasn't told him, though he asks her in the episode \\"Spy Animals\\" whether she fancied him or not while she was under the influence of truth serum, she started to say \\"Yes\\" until Lenny gave her the antidote to the serum and she quickly said, \\"you're kidding, I'd rather go out with Stewart\\". She became very jealous of Irena when Blane shows an interest in her. Daisy is very girly and she often calls Rose a 'Geek' and in the episode \\"The Others\\" she says that Rose and The Worm could get married and have 'Geeklings'. Her friendship with Rose isn't really strong since Daisy teases her about her nerdiness while Rose questions Daisy's fashion. After the end of series, both she and Blane leave the series, to go off and help train new child agents for M.I.9. Lenny Bicknall (Saint Hope's Caretaker / M.I. High Supervising Agent, Series 1-2), played by Danny John-Jules. Lenny was an M.I.9 agent deep undercover posing as Saint Hope's School's caretaker. He has an old war wound on his hip which causes him to walk with a limp. He has been with M.I.9 for many years and has been involved in several espionage missions. His storeroom is the secret entrance to the M.I. High base under the school, and he has his own personal spy gadgets including a signalling device concealed within the handle of his broom, which he uses when in caretaker guise contact agents under his care. He doesn't get on well with the school's headmaster, Mr. Flatley because Lenny spends more time with the agents than he does fixing things. Lenny cares greatly for the agents under his care. Lenny has been known to get very nostalgic often monologuing about his days as a young agent. Lenny moves on from M.I. High at the end of series 2, and is replaced by Frank, the former head of training at M.I.9. Series Three to Five cast from left: Carrie, Oscar & Rose. Oscar Cole (Saint Hope's Student / M.I.9 Spy, Series 3-5), played by Ben Kerfoot. Oscar is the team's cover, 'social chameleon' and infiltration expert, speaking over 14 different languages. Oscar's mother, Jade Dixon-Halliday, betrayed M.I.9 for S.K.U.L. She appears to be a double agent, switching sides continuously to gain the advantage. Oscar seems very insecure about his mum, not wanting anybody to find out what she is like. He finds out his real name is Oscar Dixon-Halliday which is double-barrelled after both his parents. His name was changed to Oscar Cole by M.I.9 who wanted to protect his identity after his mother left to join S.K.U.L. In \\"Return of the Mummy\\", she is believed to be on S.K.U.L.'s side. Oscar's father, Edward Dixon-Halliday, went missing in action in a mission that he took up in Africa when Oscar was 4 and Oscar believed that he had died. However, as revealed in \\"The Lost Hero\\", is alive and was working as a mole in S.K.U.L. after taking 9 years to escape from Africa. It is also revealed that Oscar did not live with foster parents but instead an M.I.9 agent, who tried bonding with him but failed. Before it was revealed that Oscar's father was alive he was very close to Frank, much closer than Rose or Carrie. This is especially shown in \\"Operation Flopsy\\" when Oscar turned to Frank alone about S.K.U.L and his mother. Carrie Stewart (Saint Hope's Student / M.I.9 Spy, Series 3-5) played by: Charlene Osuagwu. Carrie is the team's martial arts expert. A keen gymnast, who has ambitions to become a professional gymnast, she is a member of the British gymnastics team as shown in \\"The Visit\\". \\"Agent X\\" tells us that her mum encourages this idea, and she gets Carrie to keep an internet blog, so that when she is famous, her fans can keep track of her. In the episode \\"Run Carrie Run\\" her hope saves the world from the grandmasters despair bomb. She is an experienced and highly skilled martial artist, proficient in Karate, Jim-Do, and judo. She is quite capable of fighting far more experienced individuals, including Ivan Awfulcold, Well Fit Jim, Anita Blackwell and even the extremely skilled and experienced Jade Dixon Halliday. She is also enthusiastic with physical fitness and extremely athletic. She is a strong-willed, independent and very capable M.I.9 Agent. Carrie has an alarmingly low tolerance of panic, stress and annoyance, shown in \\"The Patient\\" when she suffers from traumatic panic attacks, undergoes stress disorders in \\"The First to Crack\\". But she puts aside these personal issues to complete the mission. Series Seven cast from left Keri, Dan, Aneisha & Tom. Aneisha (Neesh) Jones (Saint Heart's Student / M.I.9 Spy, Series 6‚Äì7), played by Oyiza Momoh. She is the master of disguise in the group, and was originally spotted by M.I.9 for changing identities, though this was only noticed by them, and no one else. According to Stella she was spotted with the President of the United States and the Foreign Secretary, and intelligence suggested that she had a front-row seat at the 2013 Royal Wedding. Her excuse was that she needed big names for her petition of human rights. Her favourite subject would probably be drama‚Äîafter all she is the master of disguise in the group and can pull off very convincing accents. She is also Mrs King's niece, which causes a few issues when Mrs King returns as deputy head in series 7. As well as being a master of disguises, Stella leaves M.I.9 for good. She trusts her instincts to tell her what's right and wrong; successfully identifying Jenny Lane as the Crime Minister and trusting Zoe from the start. Although she has some basic martial skills, Aniesha is not at such a standard as Zoe and Dan, causing her to feel left out when the three go on field work. Zoe and Aneisha seem very good friends, Aneisha trusting Zoe from the start. She and Zoe often hang around together, and it is shown in episode 7 Aneisha cares for her a lot. Despite this, she sometimes gets jealous of Zoe's martial arts skills. Dan and Aneisha work very well together and she cares for him very much, but sometimes he avoids her or leaves her to check out the field alone for Zoe because she has advanced combat skills. It is usually Zoe who saves them both from KORPS agents because she is used to KORPS more than either of them. Aneisha and Tom are the best of friends and Tom pranks Aneisha a lot sending love messages to Roly using voice software, which she found very annoying saying she was going to dedicate her entire life to getting him back. Even though they do annoy each other she is still a good friend to him and comforts him when he is upset. Aneisha gets along with Frank well but sometimes he doesn't listen to what she says especially when her instincts are correct. In the first episode she identified Jenny Lane as the Crime Minister but when she was first suspicious he denied this. Roly fancies Aneisha but she just finds him extremely annoying and even says she would chuck him back in the prison they escaped from in Prison Break. She also finds Byron just as annoying mainly because he has an annoying singing voice and he always is playing his guitar. She is seen as a counterpart for Daisy as both are masters of disguise. Daniel 'Dan' Morgan (Saint Heart's Student / M.I.9 Spy, Series 6‚Äì7), played by Sam Strike. Dan is an expert at martial arts, parkour, and is a field agent alongside Zoe and Aneisha. It is implied throughout most of the series that he fancies Zoe who in return has mutual feelings. Dan is unofficially nicknamed \\"Mr. Practical\\" due to his sceptical view towards fantastical theories (as seen in \\"The Dark Wizard\\") and often has an \\"old- school\\" approach to his spywork. He was recruited by M.I.9 after being seen performing parkour when chasing after some thieves who stole an old lady's handbag. He and Zoe often go on action missions together both being trained in fighting. He is very suspicious of people and careful with who he trusts. When Zoe first joined the team, Dan made it very obvious he did not trust her, but when she defended the team from a laser beam sent by the Grand master, the bond of trust was formed. Dan shows certain traits of autism in the series 6 episode Old School. It is obvious that Zoe and Dan like each other as they frequently back each other up in what the other is saying and care for the other and it would be amazing if they admit this. Zoe often gets called Dan's girlfriend and they often get called 'Romeo and Juliet' throughout the series. They share a romantic hug in 'The Dark Wizard'. Dan gets on well with his mentor Frank, each trusting the other to do the right thing. Dan shows in Episode 1/2 that he believes Frank is innocent, and goes out to prove this, showing that he trusts the older mentor. Zoe is Dan's girlfriend, but when Zoe first joined M.I. High he made it obvious he didn't trust her. However, as the series progressed, it became clear they were good friends, and as shown in episode 9, the Dark wizard, they are more than good friends, as they share a romantic hug together and Dan is prepared to risk his life for her, confronting the wizard who has her in his grasp. He also says later on:I'm lucky because I get to work for M.I.9, defeat the villain and save the princess for real. In Series 6 Episode 4, Dan asks Zoe out on a date which she said yes to but Zoe didn't realise it was a date until Tom said to her \\"I thought he was never gonna ask you out on a date\\" and Zoe replied \\"a date?\\" as she did not know what was going on. Zoe cares for Dan in the same way he does for her and always tries to keep him out of danger and has saved his life many times with her advanced combat skills. Aneisha feels left out every time they do a mission because Dan always go with Zoe. He comforts her when she is upset for example in Prison Break when she is locked up she doesn't speak for 4 days. Melissa fancies Dan a lot and thinks he's amazing. So do her friends as he does get a lot of the girls attention. He says he'd do anything to get away from her, which shows he doesn't like her at all as he fancies Zoe. Dan is seen as a counterpart for Blane as both are martial experts, hotheads of their team and also fancies a girl whose on their team. Tom Tupper (Saint Heart's Student / M.I.9 Spy, Series 6-7), played by Oscar Jacques. Tom is the technical genius of the group; often creating gadgets to help out the team and hacking into various mainframes to stop KORPS. He was spotted when he hacked into NASA and reprogrammed the Mars rover to write Tom on the face of Mars. Often calling himself the boy genius, Tom seems to have a very sarcastic sense of humour. He sent Roly a message from Aneisha saying I Love You in Aneisha's voice, which Aneisha doesn't find very funny.

(Save Kittens with Unconditional Love), he threatened to blow up Saint Hope's unless Mr. Flatley turned down his million-dollar inheritance from his dead Great Aunt Jemima.

After the bomb was stopped, he was arrested and jailed. It was revealed that the entire inheritance was worth a grand total of ¬£5 exactly. Saint Heart's Mr. Kenneth Flatley is the new headteacher of Saint Heart's that M.I.9 has arranged. * Played by: Chris Stanton Roland 'Big Roly' Donaldson * Played by: Paul Bamford Melissa Allbright It is very obvious that Melissa fancies Dan and there are only a couple of episodes that show this but they are very obvious examples. Episodes include: * Played by Tallaluh Grieve. The Dark Wizard (Series 6 Episode 9) and The Germinator (Series 6 Episode 8) * Played by: Tallulah Greive Brian 'Byron' Ditchwater * Played by: Josh Haynes Mr McNab * Played by: Brian McCardie Is a rather strict deputy head. He is the opposite of Mr Flatley, and they often argue. He leaves at the end of Series 6 for unknown reasons. Mrs. King joined Saint Heart's in Series 7, taking over the teaching role from Mr. McNab. She is also Aneisha's Auntie. Saint Hope's Mr. Kenneth Flatley is the headteacher of Saint Hope's and Saint Hearts, and is the only character to appear in all 7 series. He is easy going but has a determined streak and an obsession for getting things right. He really believes in Saint Hope's School and its pupils. He has great patience and works long hours without complaining. Though there has been no improvement in school results, morale or truancy levels, Mr. Flatley's optimism remains undented. He was slightly jealous of Lenny, showing this by making him do menial jobs, however he seems to get on better with Frank, and uses a friendship with him to assist with escaping Mrs. King. Mr. Flatley is absolutely terrified by Mrs. King. Episode 'The Mole' reveals that Mr. Flatley is terrified of moles. He also seems to have a little crush on Miss Templeman as shown on \\"Spy animals\\". He is usually quite weedy and pathetic, rather cowardly, but, manages to get on with kids in a lighthearted way. He also runs a Morris Dancing club after school. * Played by: Chris Stanton Mrs. Hermione King is a new teacher to Series Three and Seven. She is introduced as the new deputy head of Saint Hopes. Mrs. King does not like the way that the school is run, and believes that they should revert to traditional teaching methods, and is constantly pointing out how bad the school's exam results are. Mrs. King indicates to the Ofsted reporter that visits the school that she feels she should become headteacher, although the Ofsted reporter criticises her for not taking her job as part of a team. She is very strict and hates Mr. Flatley. She got a storyline towards the end of the show, where she found out about the M.I.High agents, but, they managed to erase her memory and later in the episode \\"Mrs. King: License to Spy\\" when the mindwipe started to fail, her memories got mixed up and she started to think that she was an agent; causing the kids a lot of trouble and making Frank uncomfortable because she constantly flirted with him. She is deputy head at St Hearts from series 7. * Played by: Channelle Owen Avril Franklin is another character to join St Hopes in series 3. A goth artist who seems to have a crush on Oscar, which sort of frightens him. She is rather caring though, for example, in episode 3 (series 3), \\"Agent X\\", when the school is evacuated, she comes out, anxious because she hasn't seen Oscar exit the school. She cares about a variety of real issues, such as the environment, animal rights and human rights. She often criticises anything that could be exploitation, does not deal with \\"real issues\\" or encourages competition. She is often referred to as an \\"emo\\", but does not show emo characteristics, apart from the way she dresses, she is more of a hippie, believing in peace and justice. She does not like the government and refuses to join M.I.9 in \\"The B team\\" until she learns that Oscar is in danger, at the end of the episode Oscar kisses her on the forehead, she then walks off blushing. * Played by: Jenny Huxley Golden Davina Berry is the thick and ditsy one in the class. She only cares about what she looks like and has a fear of folk music which she overcomes in \\"The Mole\\". She joins St. Hopes in series three. Davina is generally seen hanging around with Donovan, who she gets on with most of the time but she bosses him around, but in series 5 begins to show a close friendship with Avril, despite their differences. She joins Avril and Scoop to become a new spy in 'The B Team', using her expert make up skills to help the team save the day. She is closest with Carrie out of the three main spies, whom she makes a special bond with in 'The Patient' when, on a night time trip to the loo, they both seemingly encounter 'The Grey Lady of St. Hopes'. This relationship is then shown again when Davina offers to take Carrie shopping and \\"sort out [her] wardrobe\\" at the end of 'The B Team'. * Played by: Eliza Cummings-Cove. Donovan Butler is a character quite similar to Davina, a young good looking boy who seems to be focused on fame and money. He is mainly seen hanging around with Davina and seems to have a fear of corduroy which he overcomes as shown in \\"The Mole\\", Donovan was also added into the series at season 3, he is seen most of the time hanging around with Davina. In series 4 stops wearing posh clothes and starts to wear trendier clothes e.g. trainers, he also has his ear pierced and he also has spiked up hair. Donovan and Davina are like best friends. He is about as dumb as Davina, but she talks more, so says more stupid things. *Played by: Joseph Cocklin Scoop Doggy who is actually called Timothy Hinklebottom. He has a very thick character, however as revealed in \\"The B team\\" he is quite clever and has the potential of a spy (though this is mainly thanks to 'Smart-Ease'). Rose Gupta saved Scoop's life once in \\"The New Grand Master\\", and he was determined to find the mystery girl who saved his life. Carrie teases him a lot because of his stupidity \\"act\\" as Rose put it. He temporarily found out about Rose's spy status in \\"The B Team\\", and in the same episode realised she was the girl who saved his life (though his memory of it was erased along with Avril's and Davina's). In \\"The Gran Master\\" he tries to ask Rose to the disco, but is too afraid to do so, which shows that he may still subconsciously know who she is. He is also secretly a talented artist, which is found out in \\"The New Grand Master\\". *Played by: Sam Melvin Ms Helen Templeman is a teacher at St Hopes and Blane, Rose and Daisy's form teacher. Luckily for the school, but unluckily for the spy team, their form teacher is a young, sensitive, ambitious teacher. She secretly fancies Lenny but is too shy to tell him. However, in \\"Spy Animals\\", she nearly reveals her secret while given a truth serum. She also reveals that Mr. Flatley disgusts her because he is such a whiny pathetic man. Mechanics is one of her hobbies. Miss Templeman is not featured in series three and it is not explained why, she is replaced instead with the nastier Mrs. King. * Played by: Jane Cameron. Stewart Critchley is Blane's best friend and side-kick, he believes in UFOs and the supernatural. His favourite TV programme is Star Trek and he also runs the school radio club. Stewart knows nothing about Blane being a spy but Blane has been close to telling him a few times. However Stewart gets suspicious how Blane keeps disappearing all the time. Stewart has feelings for Daisy, but indicates he likes Rose more. Stewart has earned his Green Blue Peter Badge and can be seen wearing it on his coat and school uniform. Stewart, like most of the characters from the first two series', disappears at the start of series three. * Played by: Scott Gibbins. Fifty Pence, real name Julian Hamley, is the school bully at St Hopes. He always gets bad grades at school and thinks he is a great rapper. He has won a brave kid award. In \\"Spy Animals\\" we learn that his bullying is the result of him overcompensating for his feminine side and that he always wanted to be a ballerina. The name \\"Fifty Pence\\" is believed to be a parody of the American rap musician Curtis James Jackson III who uses the stage name 50 Cent. * Played by: Sam Ardley. Kaleigh is the tough ring-leader of the class gang, and has a 'couldn't care less' attitude. She is friends with Daisy and Zara, and only cares about her hair and her nails. She is rather overweight. She can be quite bossy and makes fun of Rose. * Played by: Leonie Boyd. She is replaced by the character of Letitia in series two, who is very similar to her, she disappears before Series Three, like most of the students from Series One and Two. * Played by: Princess Webb. Zara is friends with Daisy and Kaleigh, the popular girls in School. She is constantly confused and seems to be a bit ditzy but she doesn't mind, as long as her clothes are in season and she is looking fashionable. She is easily told what to do by Kaleigh or Letitia; she disappears before the beginning of Series Three. * Played by: Bethany Denville.

It turned out that she was innocent and is later reinstated in MI9.. * Played by: Rebecca Palmer M.I.9 Presenter / Agent (1950's M.I.9 Training Film) From the old school M.I.9, he is a bit like Q from the James Bond films.

She is talking to Lenny in \\"The Big Freeze\\" saying that she has had to cancel her barbecue. She later appears in \\"Spy Animals\\" being at M.I.9 in the bugged meeting room. In \\"Forever Young\\" she talks to Lenny saying they need results. However, by the Crimewave episode, the Head of M.I.9 was replaced by another woman. The same Head of M.I.9 appeared in more episodes in Series 3 onwards. * Old Head of M.I.9 played by: Victoria Wicks (Series 1-2). * New Head of M.I.9 played by: Adjoa Andoh (Series 3-5).

The Head of M.I.9 gets cross with him for his idiocy and rudeness in episode 5 and 6 of series 4. He is first shown as an incompetent agent, but, due to him being of a very high rank, the show made him slightly less pathetic, he has a long run of bad luck whenever the M.I. High kids are involved, and they usually make him look like an idiot, which adds to his hatred of them. He is shown after \\"Run Carrie, Run!\\" to be a competent enough agent, but, very bad under pressure. * Played by: Jonathan Rhodes Maurice Hutchinson' (M.I.9 Animal Expert) is introduced in series 3. He is the M.I.9 animal expert and somewhat resembles a rabbit because he has a nose which can't stop twitching and has small buck teeth. Chief Agent Stark is not very pleased that M.I.9 employed him.

She puts it up for sale on the black market, and Blane poses as the son of an oil baron to buy the plane. Blane really fancies her, much to Daisy's annoyance, especially as she doesn't find out about her until quite late, as she had her own mission; investigating Stewart in an invisibility suit. Irene finds out Blane isn't really an oil baron,(thanks to her heavy, Mr X, who is later revealed to be called Tyrone) just as he is about to buy the plane, so Blane has to stop her getting away with the money (almost crashing the plane in the process, and then running out of fuel), and MI9 punish her by making her teach adults to fly. Her dad then has to spend some quality time with her. She asks if Blane can come and help too, but Daisy quickly puts her in her place and literally pulls Blane away from her, making her feelings toward him very clear, and leaving Blane very embarrassed! * Played by: Jemma McKenzie Brown M.I.

Party raiding can easily occur in jurisdictions which allow open primary voting. As examples, Texas permits open primary voting (though a voter cannot vote in both primaries), while neighboring Oklahoma operates under a closed primary system (although a state party may open its primary to independent voters at the sole discretion of the party chairman). In a closed primary state, party raiding entails crossover registration. A notable example of attempted party raiding was Operation Chaos in the Democratic primary in 2008 when Rush Limbaugh encouraged Republicans to vote for Hillary Clinton in an effort to weaken Barack Obama politically. Another occurred in the 2012 Republican primaries, where many Democratic voters in Michigan voted for weaker GOP candidate Rick Santorum over front-runner Mitt Romney in order to disrupt his campaign.

Development Developed from the earlier Wib.3 the Wibault 7 was a C.I category single-seat high-wing braced parasol monoplane fighter powered by a Gnome-Rhone 9Ad radial engine. The main difference from earlier aircraft was the use of an all-metal construction system which was patented by Wibault. The first prototype flew in 1924, and was followed by two more prototypes. Despite being placed only third in the competition (behind the Nieuport-Delage NiD 42 and the Gourdou-Leseurre GL.32), an order for 25 Wib.7s was placed in January 1927. These were followed in production by 60 aircraft for the A√©ronautique Militaire as the Wib.72 which entered service in 1929. 26 Wib.7s were built for Chile under licence by Vickers in England.

It is one of the oldest race tracks in the country and traditionally hosts events such as a yearly race in the Brazilian F√≥rmula Truck Championship, as well as several legs of the various local Drag Racing championships, attracting up to 60,000 spectators.  History  The history of Guapor√©'s race track begins with the arrival of Dr. Nelson Luiz Barro, a doctor from Caxias do Sul whose carrier made him move to the city of Dois Lajeados and, in 1967, to Guapor√©. In his spare time, Barro raced a Simca Chambord (# 64) and eventually became State Champion. = Establishment of AGA and first circuit = Barro manageded to entice many young people with his passion for racing and, on 1 September 1969, they founded the Guaporense Racing Association (AGA - Associa√ß√£o Guaporense de Automobilismo), a group still responsible for maintaining the site. The newly formed group went looking for a place to build a race track and found the city's then-aerodrome, closed off by the aviation authority at the time. Supported by mayor Otolip Dalbosco, they built a circuit around the aerodrome's two runways, which were perpendicular to each other, thus the peculiar \\"T\\" shape of the track, still noticeable today. The first circuit, made of oil-impregnated dirt, was completed in only 3 years and, on 21 December 1969, it was inaugurated with a race involving 72 cars from all over the state and with the supervision and approval of the state's racing authority. The event's success brought great attention to AGA's work, setting the cornerstone to future developments. = Asphalt circuit and growth = With the success came the goal of giving the racetrack a more definitive shape through the application of a layer of asphalt concrete over a better designed circuit, the construction of the pit lane, garages and all the infrastructure necessary for larger events. The association not only managed to get support from the City, State and Federal Governments but also from neighbouring cities, several private businesses and even the Army. After much work, on 17 October 1976, the Guapor√© Municipal Raceway was completed with its tarmac track. The celebration coincided with the 5th Race of the 1976 Brazilian Formula Ford Championship. The first international event took place on 17 November 1985 on the occasion of the 10th Race of South American Formula Three Championship. = New challenges = Over the past decades, the main event hosted by the Aut√≥dromo de Guapor√© has been the annual race in the F√≥rmula Truck Championship, with great attendances by people from all over the country. Despite being AGA's main source of income, F√≥rmula Truck, allied with insufficient maintenance, resulted in the severe degradation of the asphalt layer, compromising safety conditions and impeding larger events such as Stock Car Brasil from taking place. Even the drag races that used to draw younger enthusiasts in large numbers were reduced due to irregularities in the main straight that forced contestants to race an eight of a mile, instead of the usual quarter mile. In late 2010, after a long and difficult process of searching for support, AGA finally managed to execute de long-awaited replacement of the asphalt layer, rejuvenating the circuit and allowing the eventual return of greater importance championships. They still have great challenges to face such as the restoration and upgrade of the pit lane area, improvement of the tracks safety features and visitor infrastructure. The delay to finish such works and the many new race tracks being built in the state, including the very modern Velopark near the state capital, allied to the city's limited capacity for receiving tourists, make the task of bringing back the great national races a very challenging one.  Facilities  The auxiliary facilities to the Vitacir Paludo Circuit include 40 pit lane garages, with large nearby off-loading ramps, a refuelling station, tyre repair facilities and a VIP area above the pit lane. The judges' tower also has a press room, sign-up area, administration office and judges' room, all big enough to host medium-sized events. There are two restaurants and a two-floor bathroom that can be used by teams and VIP guests. The medical office is located on a separate building next to the pit lane exit and has a terrace that allows clear view of all the track. The permanent equipment is minimal and limited, but all races are held with the presence of Mobile ICUs. Access to the internal area is through a tunnel that crosses the track near the tunnel corner, thus the name. The track itself is characterized by the accentuated banking of the corners, many of which bank more than 10¬∞. The main straight is about 800 m long and 17 m wide. These traits make the circuit a very fast one, worsening still the safety shortcomings of the track, that lacks sufficient containment barriers and escape areas in many corners. AGA plans to address such concerns over the next stages in the remodelling efforts, now that the track surface problem has been dealt with, after consulting with specialists to find viable solutions considering the space concerns in most problem sites. Spectators most commonly settle themselves on the hill side that borders the so-called Radiator Corner, where many camp during the events and watch the races while using the barbecue grills available on-site and the facilities of the Radiator Cabin, the restaurant established on the top of the hill. When more space is needed, bleachers are erected on the outer sides of corner 2 and the main straight, both places provide excellent view of the track.

It is based in Norfolk, Virginia and offers services in 12 acute care hospitals, with 3,739 beds, 853,000 members in its health plan, 10 nursing centers, and three assisted living facilities across the two states. Sentara Healthcare operates its own managed-care plan in Optima Health which covers 450,000 subscribers in the region. It also operates four medical groups. History Although Sentara Healthcare as a corporation was founded in 1972, its origins date back to 1888. That year, the Norfolk Women's Christian Association founded the 25-bed hospital known as the Retreat for the Sick in Norfolk, Virginia. Ten years after its foundation, the hospital was renamed to the Norfolk Protestant Hospital. In 1936, its name was changed again to the Norfolk General Hospital. Norfolk General was the site of the region's first successful open-heart surgery in 1967. Another Norfolk hospital called the Sarah Leigh Hospital was founded with 35 beds in 1903 by Dr. Southgate Leigh. At the time, the Leigh Hospital was a state-of-the-art facility built with rounded corners, a fire suppression system, and basic air handling. Norfolk Protestant Hospital in 1907. Norfolk General and Sarah Leigh Hospital formed the foundation of Sentara Healthcare in 1972. Indeed, that year, Norfolk General Hospital and Leigh Memorial Hospital merged to form a joint corporation called Medical Center Hospitals. One of the first projects undertaken by the merged entity was the construction of a new Leigh Memorial Hospital. The 250-bed hospital was completed in 1977, relocating from its original home in the Ghent neighborhood to its present location on Kempsville Road. In 1981, Elizabeth Carr, the nation's first baby born using the in vitro fertilization procedure, was delivered at Norfolk General Hospital. On February 25, 1982, the organization deployed its Nightingale air ambulance for the first time. It was the first hospital-based air ambulance in the state of Virginia. It has successfully completed over 20,000 missions from Sentara Norfolk General Hospital as of 2017. In 1983, the organization's name was changed from Medical Center Hospitals to Alliance Health System. In 1984, it began offering the Optima Health Plan HMO. In 1987, the corporation adopted the name \\"Sentara Health System\\" (later \\"Sentara Healthcare\\"). The names of its properties were also rebranded, including the two main hospitals, and multiple medical care facilities. Emergency responders from the McDonald Army Health Center Installation Support Team and Sentara Norfolk General Hospital (Nightingale) during a transport exercise in 2015. In 1988, Hampton General Hospital joined the system. The following year, doctors at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital performed the region's first successful heart transplant. In 1991, Sentara purchased the Humana Bayside Hospital in Virginia Beach, renaming it Sentara Bayside Hospital. In 1996, Sentara and the Williamsburg Community Hospital entered into a formal partnership which saw Sentara taking a 49% equity stake in the hospital. Sentara eventually took over full ownership of the hospital in 2002, and it later adopted the name, Sentara Williamsburg Regional Medical Center. In 1998, Sentara merged with Tidewater Health Care, a Virginia Beach-based healthcare system that operated Virginia Beach General Hospital. The organization became known as Sentara Healthcare at that time. Also that year, the Sentara Foundation was created as the charitable arm of the organization, providing grants to other local healthcare entities. In 2000, Sentara Norfolk General Hospital and other Sentara hospitals became the first in the nation to employ \\"eICU\\" services in which doctors remotely monitor patients in the ICU. In 2002, the five-story Sentara CarePlex Hospital was completed and replaced the Sentara Hampton General Hospital in Hampton. Sentara Norfolk General under construction for expansion in 2016. In 2005, Sentara announced a deal to merge with Obici Health System, which operated Louise Obici Memorial Hospital in Suffolk. That hospital was renamed \\"Sentara Obici Hospital.\\" The deal was finalized in early 2006. That year, the 300,000 square-foot Sentara Heart Hospital was completed in Norfolk. In 2011, the Sentara Princess Anne Hospital (a joint venture with competing health system, Bon Secours) was opened in Virginia Beach. At that time, the Sentara Bayside Hospital was renamed \\"Sentara Independence\\" and became an outpatient campus and nerve center for Sentara IT operations. Sentara continued adding hospitals to its network in the intervening years, including Potomac Hospital in Woodbridge (2009), Rockingham Memorial Hospital in Harrisonburg (2010), Martha Jefferson Memorial Hospital in Charlottesville (2011), Halifax Regional Hospital in South Boston (2013), and Sentara Albemarle Medical Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina (2014). In March 2016, David Bernd stepped down as the system's CEO and was replaced by then president and COO, Howard P. Kern. Bernd had served as CEO since 1995 and had been at the company since 1972. Kern has been with Sentara since 1980. In 2016, Sentara announced a $199 million expansion to its Norfolk General Hospital. In 2018, it announced a $93.5-million cancer center to be built in Norfolk, scheduled to be completed in 2020. In August 2020, Sentara Healthcare and Greensboro-based Cone Health announced their intent to merge. Operation As of 2019, the Sentara Healthcare network includes 12 acute care hospitals, 10 nursing centers, and an assisted-living facility. It is Virginia's third-largest employer. It also operates more than 300 sites of care in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina with various outpatient facilities, home and hospice services, and its own health plan called Optima Health. Sentara also owns the Nightingale Regional Air Ambulance, a specialized helicopter equipped with cardiac and pulmonary equipment, like an intra-aortic balloon pump and 12-lead EKG monitor.

Facts Messer UK Ltd supplied Britvic with carbon dioxide for its drinks. It was contaminated with benzene, a carcinogen. Britvic had to recall its products and it sued Messer to recover its costs, arguing that it was in breach of contract. A term in the contract limited liability of Messer under s 14 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (which by virtue of UCTA 1977 can only be limited as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness). The judge found that the only relevant express term in the supply agreement was that the carbon dioxide would conform with British Standard 4105. But the implied term under Sale of Goods Act 1979 s 14 also applied. Breach of both terms allowed the recovery of damages. Messer appealed, arguing that BS 4105 could not be regarded as containing an express term that gave rise to damages and that the term limiting s 14 did in fact satisfy the reasonableness test. Judgment Mance LJ dismissed the appeal and held in favour of Britvic. The judge had in fact been wrong on the first point, that BS 4105 contained an express term relevant to benzene and giving rise to damages, because it could not be read as a general undertaking of suitability. But the judge had been right that Messer's exclusion of liability for s 14 SGA 1979 was unreasonable. As a supplier, rather than manufacturer, this represented that it complied with BS 4105, the required purity level at the time. Although you could comply with BS 4105, this did not mean the carbon dioxide was suitable for use. The exclusion was unreasonable because it contradicted the assumption that manufacture and supply would exclude introduction of foreign elements. Buyers could not be expected to test for elements they had no reason to suspect. So it must be the responsibility of Messer, and ultimately the manufacturer. Mance LJ concluded as follows. Thorpe LJ and Neuberger J concurred.

Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital has also been designated a Sinus Center of Excellence in the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital officials said it is one of only two hospitals in Westchester and only the fourth in New York to receive the distinction. Patients with chronic sinusitis are treated with balloon sinuplasty, a minimally invasive and innovative system, by physicians in the Division of Otolaryngology. The technique, which uses a balloon to spread and open the sinuses, can replace conventional sinus surgery that requires removal of bone and tissue to open passageways. Dr. Matthew J. Kates, chief of head and neck surgery in the Division of Otolaryngology, called it the first innovation in sinus surgery in nearly 20 years. Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Cortlandt Manor is the other sinus center in Westchester county. Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital serves both the local community, the greater Southern Westchester region, northern New York City, and western Connecticut. It is the largest private teaching hospital in Westchester County, with residencies in Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Anesthesiology, and Pediatrics, and fellowship programs in Laparoscopic Surgery, Endocrinology, and Gastroenterology. Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital is a designated Perinatal Hospital and Stroke Center, and is the only designated New York State Area Trauma Center in Southern Westchester County. Specialty facilities include a New York State Department of Health designated level 3 neonatal intensive care unit and the Harriet and Bernard Miller Adult Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory. There are programs in cancer care, bariatric weight loss, renal dialysis, laparoscopic surgery, orthopaedics, gerontology, and sleep medicine. The facility offers primary, acute, emergency and long-term health care.

It was inaugurated in 1988. The park offers 1200 trees and shrubs, a 100-metre-long waterfall fountain (the longest in Paris), and 1000 m¬≤ of lawn accessible to the public. It also contains a wooden playground for children, ping-pong tables and an open-air theatre. At the top of the park lies the Maison de l'Air, a small museum designed to educate visitors to the importance of fresh air and to the problems of pollution. The park also prides itself on its display of annual flowers. The gardeners prepare the flower beds two years in advance, in tight collaboration with the horticultural center of Rungis. Their compositions have received prizes numerous times at the Concours des D√©corations Florales Estivales (Summer Floral Decoration Competition), which takes place each year in September. History The Parc de Belleville In the Middle Ages, numerous religious communities acquired plots of land on the hill. They cleared fields, planted grape vines, and tapped numerous springs. Taverns and guinguettes competed for places there from the fourteenth to eighteenth century. In the mid-eighteenth century, the celebrated publican Ramponneau's tavern \\"Au Tambour Royal\\"Jean Ramponneau is commemorated in rue Ramponneau. served a young, slightly effervescent wine made from the Belleville grapes called Piquette. Over time this use has changed and the name now refers to a drink made from pomace and water, and is figuratively used to refer to a bad wine. The opening of a gypsum quarry in the nineteenth century attracted a population of seasonal workers (often stonemasons), who worked on Baron Haussmann's construction projects during the winter and returned home in the summer to tend their fields. The area was deemed insalubrious, which didn't improve with the closing of the quarry. In the 19th century, the cottages which at the time stood on both sides of the steps leading up to the present-day park gave the hill an appearance similar to that of Montmartre. They belonged to Julien Lacroix, one of the most important landowners of the hill of Belleville, and a street which runs alongside the park now bears his name. At this time, a grand party was organized each year on the hill for Mardi Gras. On the last day of the carnival, Mardi Gras, all of Paris came en masse to witness the \\"descente de la Courtille\\", one of the three major Mardi Gras processions named after the cheap restaurants that lined the rue de Belleville. Among them, \\"Le coq Hardi\\" (The Hardy Rooster) and \\"La carotte filandreuse\\" (The Coriaceous Carrot), were well known for the drinking binges of their patrons. At the end of the 20th century, the cottages disappeared, giving way to more modern buildings and the Parc de Belleville. A vineyard growing Pinot Meunier vines from Champagne and Chardonnay vines from Burgundy still lies at the top of the park as a reminder of the area's viticultural history.

Early recorded versions of the name are of the form Hothenei and hodni which are believed to contain the adjective 'hawdd' meaning for example, pleasant or easy. Later forms such as Honddye have undergone metathesis whereby -ddn- became -ndd-. It rises within the county of Powys near the Gospel Pass at the head of the Vale of Ewyas down which it flows, passing southwards into Monmouthshire to Llanvihangel Crucorney before turning northeastwards to join the River Monnow at the point on the Wales-England border where that river too makes a sudden change of direction. The only significant tributary to join the Honddu is the Nant Bwch though numerous smaller streams flow down the steep sides of the Vale of Ewyas to add to the river's flow.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL13 'Brecon Beacons National Park: eastern area' It is likely that the Honddu continued on a southerly course beyond Llanvihangel Crucorney prior to the last ice age but has since been diverted by the presence of a large terminal moraine which stretches impressively across the valley to the west of the village. The southwest to northeast alignment of both the Honddu and the Monnow appear to be related to the course of the Neath Disturbance, an ancient geological weakness, which runs through the valley to the north of the Sugarloaf and on towards Hereford. The upper valley of the Honddu has the characteristic U-shape of a glacially scoured valley though it is not clear where the ice originated that cut this deep trench through the eastern Black Mountains. The modern Honddu is thus something of a misfit river. It has been speculated that glacial ice from the Wye valley glacier invaded the Vale of Ewyas over the Gospel Pass, though no evidence of any glacial till containing clasts of rock from mid Wales has yet been found within the valley to support that proposal.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 214 'Talgarth' & accompanying sheet explanation A view of the ruins of Llanthony Priory, with the Honddu in the foreground Within the valley is Llanthony Priory, a popular attraction for the many visitors to the National Park. Towards the lower end of the Vale of Ewyas is Cwmyoy with its celebrated church, distorted by the movement of the hillside on which it stands; the entire hamlet has been built on an ancient, and not entirely dormant, landslide.

The Arizona memorial is the small white dot on the left side above Ford Island Pearl Harbor is an American lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. It has been long visited by the Naval fleet of the United States, before it was acquired from the Hawaiian Kingdom by the U.S. with the signing of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is now a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. Its surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941, promptly led The United States to declare war on the Empire of Japan making the Attack on Pearl Harbor the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II. History Pearl Harbor was originally an extensive shallow embayment called Wai Momi (meaning, ‚ÄúWaters of Pearl‚Äù) or Puuloa (meaning, ‚Äúlong hill‚Äù) by the Hawaiians. Puuloa was regarded as the home of the shark goddess, Kaahupahau, and her brother (or son), Kahiuka, in Hawaiian legends. According to tradition, Keaunui, the head of the powerful Ewa chiefs, is credited with cutting a navigable channel near the present Puuloa saltworks, by which he made the estuary, known as \\"Pearl River,\\" accessible to navigation. Making due allowance for legendary amplification, the estuary already had an outlet for its waters where the present gap is; but Keaunui is typically given the credit for widening and deepening it. =Nineteenth century= Pearl Harbor in the 1880s. During the early nineteenth century, Pearl Harbor was not used for large ships due to its shallow entrance. The interest of United States in the Hawaiian Islands grew as a result of its whaling, shipping and trading activity in the Pacific. As early as 1820, an \\"Agent of the United States for Commerce and Seamen\\" was appointed to look after American business in the Port of Honolulu. These commercial ties to the American continent were accompanied by the work of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. American missionaries and their families became an integral part of the Hawaiian political body. Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, many American warships visited Honolulu. In most cases, the commanding officers carried letters from the U.S. Government giving advice on governmental affairs and of the relations of the island nation with foreign powers. In 1841, the newspaper Polynesian, printed in Honolulu, advocated that the U.S. establish a naval base in Hawaii for protection of American citizens engaged in the whaling industry. The British Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Crichton Wyllie, remarked in 1840 that \\"... my opinion is that the tide of events rushes on to annexation to the United States.\\" From the conclusion of the Civil War, to the purchase of Alaska, to the increased importance of the Pacific states, the projected trade with countries in Asia and the desire for a duty-free market for Hawaiian staples, Hawaiian trade expanded. In 1865, the North Pacific Squadron was formed to embrace the western coast and Hawaii. in the following year was assigned to cruise among the islands, \\"a locality of great and increasing interest and importance.\\" This vessel surveyed the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands toward Japan. As a result, the United States claimed Midway Island. The Secretary of the Navy was able to write in his annual report of 1868, that in November 1867, 42 American flags flew over whaleships and merchant vessels in Honolulu to only six of other nations. This increased activity caused the permanent assignment of at least one warship to Hawaiian waters. It also praised Midway Island as possessing a harbor surpassing Honolulu's. In the following year, Congress approved an appropriation of $50,000 on March 1, 1869, to deepen the approaches to this harbor. Astronaut photograph of Pearl Harbor from October 2009 After 1868, when the Commander of the Pacific Fleet visited the islands to look after American interests, naval officers played an important role in internal affairs. They served as arbitrators in business disputes, negotiators of trade agreements and defenders of law and order. Periodic voyages among the islands and to the mainland aboard U.S. warships were arranged for members of the Hawaiian royal family and important island government officials. When King Lunalilo died in 1873, negotiations were underway for the cession of Pearl Harbor as a port for the duty-free export of sugar to the U.S. With the election of King KalƒÅkaua in March 1874, riots prompted landing of sailors from USS Tuscarora and . The British warship, , also landed a token force. During the reign of King KalƒÅkaua the United States was granted exclusive rights to enter Pearl Harbor and to establish \\"a coaling and repair station.\\" Although this treaty continued in force until August 1898, the U.S. did not fortify Pearl Harbor as a naval base. As it had for 60 years, the shallow entrance constituted a formidable barrier against the use of the deep protected waters of the inner harbor. The United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom signed the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 as supplemented by Convention on December 6, 1884. This treaty was ratified in 1887. On January 20, 1887, the United States Senate allowed the Navy the exclusive right to maintain a coaling and repair station at Pearl Harbor. (The US took possession on November 9 that year). The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898 and the desire for the United States to have a permanent presence in the Pacific both contributed to the decision. =Naval presence (1899‚Äìpresent)= Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941 Following the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, the United States Navy established a base on the island in 1899. On December 7, 1941, the base was attacked by the Imperial Japanese Navy airplanes and midget submarines, causing the American entry into World War II. There was no meaningful plan for the air defense of Hawaii, for American commanders had no understanding of the capabilities and proper employment of air power. As it was, had the Pacific Fleet acted on the war warnings it undoubtedly would have sortied and been at sea on December 7, where the major ships would have been sunk in deep water, making salvage impossible. Shortly after the devastating Japanese surprise attack at Pearl Harbor two American military commanders, Lt. Gen. Walter Short and Adm. Husband Kimmel, were demoted of their full ranks. The two American commanders later sought to restore their reputations and full ranks. Post-World War II Over the years, Pearl Harbor remained a main base for the US Pacific Fleet after World War II along with Naval Base San Diego. In 2010, the Navy and the Air Force merged their two nearby bases; Pearl Harbor joined with Hickam Air Force Base to create Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. In December 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a joint visit to Pearl Harbor with US President Barack Obama. This trip marked the 75th anniversary of the attack, and was the first official visit by a sitting Japanese leader. In December 2019, A US Navy sailor killed two civilian workers and wounded another, before shooting himself at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. On May 11, 2020, it was announced that a joint expedition by Ocean Infinity, with its ship the Pacific Constructor, and the operations center of SEARCH Inc. headed by Dr. James Delgado, had discovered Nevada's wreck. It is located at a depth of 15,400 feet (4,700 m) off the coast of Hawaii and about 65 nautical miles southwest of Pearl Harbor. Archaeologists also documented the two tripod masts, portions of the bridge, sections of deck and superstructure, and a tank placed on the deck for the atomic bomb tests. The hull was still painted and the number \\"36\\" was visible on the stern. As a result of the global health crisis COVID-19 pandemic, the ship has stayed at sea on a variety of taskings.

TREPOV by FEDOR ALEKSANDROVICH GAIDA (2012) He was responsible for organising the state requisitioning of grain faced by a scissor crisis in 1916, whereby the accelerated inflation of manufactured goods compared to agricultural goods led many peasants to remove their grain from the market. This measure, often associated with the later Bolshevik regime, where it was known as prodrazvyorstka, was implemented originally by the Imperial Russian Government. During the February revolution along with Nikolai Pokrovsky he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with representatives of the Imperial Duma. In 1918 he lived in Odessa. In 1919 he emigrated to England, where he became director of a Russian Bank in London. In 1920 Alexander Krivoshein offered him a post in the Government of South Russia, operating in the Crimea under General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel, but Rittikh refused.

An HD version was also released for the iOS and some Android and Symbian devices. Both versions have been removed from the Play Store, the game is now only available for Android devices from Gameloft's official website.http://www.gameloft.com/android-games/hero-of-sparta/ The game follows a storyline set in ancient Greece, wherein the player controls the protagonist throughout multiple landscapes while fighting mythical beasts. The game was moderately well received by critics. Gameplay The game consists of eight levels (five in the DS version) in which the player controls a Spartan king wielding a sword and fighting various mythical beasts. The player can collect different-colored orbs by defeating enemies, with each color corresponding to a different effect. Green orbs restore health, blue restore magical energy and red orbs grant experience points that can be used to upgrade the damage and special powers of weapons found throughout the course of the game. In some versions of the game, upgrading weapons to their maximum capacities will cause them to take on an \\"ultimate\\" form. The game features real-time events called \\"focus kills\\" that occur when certain enemies are nearly defeated. The player will be prompted to input a series of controls (or tap the screen) to perform a finishing blow on the enemy. Successful focus kills award the player with more orbs. In some cases, the player is required to perform focus kills to defeat bosses. Plot The story centers around the Spartan king Argos as he awakens on a beach shortly after his entire fleet of ships has been wiped out by a violent storm. While exploring the island, the spirit of an oracle apparently held in captivity pleads for Argos to rescue her. In exchange, the oracle offers to use her power to return Argos to his homeland. Reception The game has been directly compared to the God of War franchise, even being called \\"a shameless God of War rip-off.\\" Sequel A sequel Hero of Sparta II was released on July 29, 2010.

It was an Ottoman retaliation to a message sent by Skanderbeg to Murad II. The Albanian forces under Skanderbeg defeated the Ottoman forces under Firuz Pasha. It was the second major Albanian victory over the Ottoman Empire. Background After his victory at Varna, Murad II attempted to establish peace with Skanderbeg. Murad sent a message to Skanderbeg in which he reminded him of how he had taken the Albanian as his son and raised him in his court and tried to intimidate him by reminding him of the size and power of the Ottoman army. Skanderbeg received the letter and decided to respond. Skanderbeg reminded Murad how he had broken the Ottoman army at Torvioll and that with \\"the true faith of Jesus Christ, [he was] sure that [he] had chosen the greatest side.\\" When the Turkish ambassador left to send the message to Murad, Skanderbeg told his men to prepare for an incursion. The battle When the sultan had received the message, he gave command to Firuz Pasha a force of about 9,000 men. His task was to control Skanderbeg's movements and prevent him from moving into Macedonia. Firuz set out from Skopje planning to move quickly into Kruj√´ and surprising the Albanians. A large number of soldiers advanced thinking that they were going to battle with Hunyadi, who was regathering his army. Firuz had heard that the Albanian army had disbanded for the time being, so he planned to move quickly around the Black Drin valley and through Prizren. These movements were picked up by Skanderbeg's scouts who moved to meet Firuz. Kastrioti awaited the Turkish army at a valley near Prizren, and only brought along his personal guard of 3,500 men, composed of 2,000 cavalry and 1,500 infantry, while sending the rest of his troops home. The Albanian troops were commanded to move into forest of Mokra inside of a thin valley of which they knew the terrain. The Turks entered the valley and could not find an easy way out since the Albanians had blocked most of the main trails. The Ottoman cavalry were allowed limited movement due to the woods and were assaulted by the Albanian infantry. The Ottoman force routed leaving behind 1,500 dead and 1,000 wounded men or stragglers that were imprisoned by the Albanians. Firuz Pasha died in the battle.Demetrio Franco p. 310. Aftermath The Europeans were reassured by the battle of Mokra after the loss at Varna. Pope Eugene IV raised a hymn as a praise that Christendom has been provided with a new defender after he heard of the battle. Alfonso V of Aragon sent many praises to Skanderbeg along with the papacy to Durazzo. The papal ambassadors arrived at Kruj√´ sending the news that a new bishop, Peter Perlati, had been appointed. Skanderbeg sent four Ottoman standards that he had captured to Alphonso to prove his victories. Skanderbeg and Alphonso became close allies while also establishing connections with other European states.

He was a Royal Academician for almost fifty years, and painted many of the most notable figures of his time. Biography Born in London, Pickersgill was adopted in his youth by a Mr Hall, a silk manufacturer in Spitalfields, who financed his schooling and then took him into the family business. When war caused difficult trading conditions, Pickersgill opted to develop his talent for painting into a career, and was a pupil of landscape artist George Arnald between 1802‚Äì1805 before entering the Royal Academy Schools as a student in November 1805. James Silk Buckingham and his Wife in Arab Dress, 1816 His early subjects were varied and included landscapes and classical and historical themes, but he eventually settled to portraiture as his speciality. His first exhibit at the Royal Academy was a portrait of his benefactor Mr Hall, and during his lifetime he showed a total of 384 paintings there. He was elected to associate membership of the Academy in November 1822 and full membership in February 1826. Pickersgill was one of the pre-eminent portrait painters of his day. Robert Peel, William Wordsworth, George Stephenson, Jeremy Bentham, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Faraday were among the many notable people who sat for him. He famously painted author James Silk Buckingham and his wife Elizabeth in Arab costume in 1816, reflecting Buckingham's own travels in the East as well as the fashion of the times for the Orient. The National Portrait Gallery, London has over 50 of his portraits in its collection, including 16 original oils and 35 engravings after him, along with a small number of portraits of Pickersgill himself by others. From 1856‚Äì64 he was librarian of the Royal Academy. He retired from the institution in December 1872, and died at his home in Blandford Square, London at the age of 93. Pickersgill's brother Richard, son Henry Hall and nephew Frederick Richard were also painters. His wife Jeanette published a volume of poetry in 1827 entitled Tales of the Harem. After her death in 1885, Mrs Pickersgill became the first person to be legally cremated in the United Kingdom at Woking Crematorium. In his will Pickersgill left a bequest to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The lifeboat Henry William Pickersgill R.A., which served on the Dover station between 1878‚Äì88, was funded by this bequest. Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem The Oriental Nosegay by Pickersgill in her Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures (in The Troubadour, 1826) probably refers to his Oriental Love Letter (1824) in the R. A. collection.

Eriphia verrucosa, sometimes called the warty crab or yellow crab, is a species of crab found in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean from Brittany to Mauritania and the Azores. Individual crabs have been caught as far north as Cornwall. Formerly a frequent species in the Black Sea, it has decreased in numbers since the 1980s and is now listed in the Ukrainian Red Data Book of endangered species. Ecology E. verrucosa lives among stones and seaweeds in shallow water along rocky coastlines up to a depth of . It is reported to feed on bivalves, gastropods and hermit crabs, or on molluscs and polychaetes. In the Black Sea, E. verrucosa is the only native species capable of breaking into the shells of the invasive snail Rapana venosa, although it is unlikely that it will present an effective biological control of the invader. The species is threatened by eutrophication and pollution. Description E. verrucosa may reach a width of and a length of . The carapace is thick and smooth, ranging in colour from brownish-red to brownish-green, with yellow spots; its front margin is armed with seven \\"teeth\\" on either side, and five or six between the eyes. The claws are strong and have black fingers; one claw is generally larger than the other and is armed with rounded tubercles while the smaller claw bears sharper projections, arranged in lines. In the springtime, E. verrucosa migrates to shallow water, less than deep, and reproduction begins in May or June; the species is highly fecund. There are four larval stages, from zoea to megalopa.

Early recorded versions of the name are of the form Hothenei and hodni which are believed to contain the Welsh adjective 'hawdd', meaning 'pleasant' or 'easy', together with a suffix -ni. Later forms such as Honddey and Honthy have undergone metathesis whereby -ddn- became -ndd- (or -thn- to -nth- in anglicised form). It rises on Mynydd Epynt and flows southwards to join the River Usk at Brecon, which takes its Welsh name (Aberhonddu) from the river. The river has no major tributaries but acquires numerous streams during its 11-mile course. The valley of the Honddu is followed by the B4520 road which runs north from Brecon to Builth Wells. The road serves the hamlets of Upper Chapel, Lower Chapel, Pwllgloyw and Llandefaelog each of which, Pwllgloyw apart, sit at bridging points of the Honddu.

History The single \\"The Windows of the World\\" had been recorded 13 April 1967 in the same session which produced Warwick's recording of \\"(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me\\"1 also included on The Windows of the World album. The album featured four other recordings of Burt Bacharach/Hal David compositions, these four tracks all originating in a 9 April 1966 session and thus predating Warwick's December 1966 album release Here Where There is Love and being omitted from it; two of these four tracks had appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 the first being the December 1966 single release \\"Another Night\\" (#49) and the second \\"The Beginning of Loneliness\\" (#79) released March 1967 as the original A-side of the \\"Alfie\\". The other two album tracks from the 9 April 1966 session were the B-side of the single \\"The Windows of the World\\" entitled \\"Walk Little Dolly\\" and a track released for the first time on the album The Windows of the World entitled \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\". Bacharach had an especial dislike for the last-named track having been unable to obtain the desired results instead finding the arrangement rushed despite doing ten takes‚Äîtypically the tracks Bacharach recorded with Warwick required at most three takes often requiring only one‚Äîand it was Scepter Records owner Florence Greenberg rather than Bacharach who got \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" released on the album The Windows of the World.

The back cover of the original album listed the song \\"Taking a Chance on Love\\" (writers: Vernon Duke/John La Touche and Ted Fetter), introduced in the all-black 1940 Broadway musical Cabin In The Sky, which was not actually cut on the LP. The recording was located in 2003 and included on the Rhino CD rerelease of The Windows of the World (coupled with Valley of the Dolls). Originally there was no plan to release a second A-side single from The Windows of the World album, the intended follow-up to \\"The Windows of the World\\" single being the theme from the movie Valley of the Dolls with the Windows of the World album track \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" relegated to B-side. Disc jockeys however favored \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\"2 that track's breezy arrangement‚Äîdenigrated by Bacharach as \\"rushed\\"‚Äîproving to be the sound to effect a return for Warwick to the Top Ten for the first time since the spring of 1966 (when \\"Message to Michael\\" had been a hit); \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" peaked at #4 in December 1967 with its parent album concurrently peaking at #22. *1Warwick's rendition of \\"(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me\\" would have a single release in August 1968 as the B-side of \\"Who Is Gonna Love Me?\\"; the first-named track would also chart in its own right reaching #65. *2The \\"(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls\\" side of the single did become a chart hit in 1968 reaching #2.

The Asian species are typically found in the forest understory while the single African species has evolved to drier, sunnier conditions and is usually associated with inselbergs.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Taxonomy The genus Tricarpelema was created in 1966 by Kevin Cousins when he found that a Himalayan species then known as Aneilema thomsonii could not be satisfactorily classified within Aneilema nor the related genus Dictyospermum. He placed this species in the new genus as Tricarpelema giganteum. D.Y. Hong added two species to the new genus, namely T. chinense and T. xizangenese, in 1974 and 1981 respectively. Meanwhile, in a 1975 Ph.D. thesis, Robert Faden treated Tricarpelema as a subgenus of the closely related genus Dictyospermum, while in 1980 R.S. Rao added another Indian species to the genus, namely T. glanduliferum. By 1991 Faden had recognised the genus as distinct and added yet another species to it, this time T. philippense. He and J. Cowley published a sixth species in 1996, T. pumilum, which is endemic to Borneo. Two years later Faden recognised a seventh undescribed species from Vietnam and also commented on an African plant that could be an eighth species. In 2007 both of these were described with the Vietnamese species being named T. brevipedicellatum and the African species T. africanum. As the African species differs from the Asian taxa in a number of important morphological features as well as in habitat, Faden assigned it to a new subgenus Keatingia. The taxonomic boundaries of some species are not completely understood, mainly due to a lack of herbarium specimens. For example, both T. brevipedicellatum and T. glanduliferum are each known from only two collections. A number of undescribed species are also likely to remain. For example, plants of T. philippense growing on Borneo are known to be larger than those in the Philippines, yet further differences have not been examined. Additionally, a single specimen collected from Burma shows characters that do not agree with any of the described species and likely represents a new species. Two more specimens, also from Burma, are distinct from the aforemetined specimen, but may represent a more southern distribution of the Chinese species. Robert Faden notes that further collections from Burma are necessary to better understand the genus in that country. Distribution and habitat Tricarpelema has its centre of diversity in tropical Asia. The genus can be found there from Bhutan and eastern India, west to Vietnam, southern China, and the Philippines, and south to Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. Many of the species from Asia have poorly understood distributions due to limited numbers of specimens. For example, three species in the genus are known from six collections or less. A single species occurs in western-central Africa in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. This disjunctive distribution is found in a number of other genera, such as Amischotolype and Calamus, each of which has a relatively low number of species in west-central Africa and many more in tropical Asia. Habitat information for most of the Asian species is poor, but most are known to be forest understory plants, often in moist situations. The African species, T. africanum, on the other hand, is found in relatively dry areas, often in full sun. It is also strongly associated with inselbergs. Robert Faden suggests that T. africanum may have adapted to drier conditions from members of the genus once found in African rainforests which later died out in response to prehistoric aridification of Africa. ; Species * Tricarpelema africanum Faden  Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea * Tricarpelema brevipedicellatum Faden  Vietnam * Tricarpelema chinense D.Y.Hong  Arunachal Pradesh, Sichuan, Myanmar * Tricarpelema giganteum (Hassk.)

Nooruddeen Durkee became a Muslim in his early thirties in al-Quds, Jerusalem. He was the founder of Lama Foundation and Dar al-Islam Foundation. His major contribution is in the area of education, and for many years specifically in the realm of teaching reading, writing, and reciting of Qur'anic Arabic, which grew out of his work in the translation and transliteration of the sacred texts of the Shadhdhuliyyah and finally the Qur'an. One of his main contributions is the development of a transliteration of the Qur'an which has enabled non-Arabic people to understand and recite Quranic Arabic. Additionally he serves as a khateeb and an imam for various nearby Muslim communities on the Eastern coast of United States. Noorudeen has been granted an 'ijaza in Islamic Calling (da'wah) by Umar Abdullah of the Comoro Islands, an 'ijaza in Islamic Introspection and Observation (muraqabah) by Seyed Ali Ashraf of Dhaka, Jeddahand Cambridge, and an 'ijaza in the Teaching, Propagation of Islam and the Nourishment of the Murids by Muhammad al-Jamal ar-Rif'aiof al-Quds ash-Shareef. In the professional world he was granted a master's degree [M.Arch] in Islamic Building in 1983 by Dr. Hasan Fathy of the Institute of Appropriate Technology in Kuwait. He maintained a Zawiya at the Islamic Study Center, Charlottesville, Virginia which is also the location of The Green Mountain School, the third school Nooruddeen has founded. Until his death in 2020 he lived there with his wife Noura Durkee on Green Mountain Farm in Keene, Virginia.  Biography  Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee was born 1938 in Warwick, New York, as Stephen Durkee. He grew up with his grandmother, a devout Catholic and herbalist, at Greenwood Lake, New York. During this time he made periodic trips to war-time NYC where his mother taught school, his father was in hotel business and his grandfather worked as ship chandler and cargo consolidator for the North Atlantic convoys. In 1944-1952 he was a student at Corpus Christi, a Roman Catholic Grade School in NYC with a broad interfaith exposure, after which he studied at religious and secular high schools in New York. In 1957-1960 he studied with Robert Lowe, Professor of the Fine and Applied Arts, Teachers‚Äô College, in Columbia University. In 1960-1966 he worked as an artist and creator of environments in NYC and San Francisco. Paintings in various private collections as well as the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art, NYC. Along with Gerd Stern and Michael Callahan, founded USCO and created first multimedia lightshows. Began lengthy correspondence with Meher Baba. Traveled and exhibited at universities and museums throughout the northeast; large exhibition at the Tibetan Museum in NY City; articles on work appeared in various publications in ArtNews and Life Magazine. 1965-1967 lived in California with Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) and lectured with him throughout the West. Worked for and found land in New Mexico while Alpert went to study in India. In 1967-1970 he initiated the Lama FoundationLama Foundation, San Cristobal, New Mexico http://www.lamafoundation.org/ in New Mexico which was one of the first centers in North America for Spiritual Realization and Interfaith Studies. During this time he served as Coordinator and Director of Programs and initiated contacts with teachers of many traditions, including Kalu Rinpoche, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi leading to his first contacts with nominal Sufism through the writings of Hazrat Inayat Khan, in person Murshid Samuel Lewis and later Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan. Organized, edited and produced Ram Dass' book Be Here Now, an international best-seller. In 1970-1971 he coordinated the International Work Camps in the Alps conducted by Pir Vilayat Khan. He also began a set of travels in the autumn and spring in the desert regions of North America coupled with excursions to the Subcontinent and Middle-East where he first came into contact with Muslims. He edited Pir Vilayat's book Towards the One. In 1972 he lived on Jabal Zaytun outside of al-Quds ash-Sharif in Occupied Palestine where he embraced 'Islam at the Madrasah of the Masjid al-'Aqsah. During this period he studied Tasawwuf with Muhammad al-Jamal, Na'ib of the Mufti of al-Quds, Hazim Abu-l-Ghazali of Amman, Jordan, and Abu Mutalib ash-Sharif of al-Khalil all, of whom were shaykhs of the Shadhdhuliyyah Order. He also received benefit from the teaching of Noor-i- Muhammad, a Naqshbandi from Bokharah who lived and taught within the precincts of the old Islamic city of al-Quds ash-Sharif (Jerusalem). In 1973-1976 he designed and built the Intensive Studies Center (also known as the I.S.C. or Islamic Sufi Center) in the mountains above San Cristobal, New Mexico. This center (which burned to the ground in a forest fire in the 90‚Äôs) contained the first mosque in Northern New Mexico and at this center many people came to hear for the first time about Islam from the perspective of Tasawwuf. Many young American people embraced Islam in this setting and went on to stay at the Center where they learned the rudiments of Islam and began to live as Muslims. During the years 1976-1979 he lived and studied in Makkah al- Mukarramah in the 'Ashrafiyyah area of al-Jiyad and attended the Markaz al- Lugahat-al-Arabiyyah, Kulliyat ash-Shari'ah, what was then Jami'at Malik 'Abdu-l-'Aziz and is now known as Jami'at Ummu-l-Qurra. During this time he developed the idea of a Muslim school and community in United States, and was able to begin raising funds for the project. 1980-1988 on the first day of new Hijri 1400 century he was the sole signatory on incorporation papers for the Dar al-Islam foundation in Abiquiu, New Mexico which he co-founded in 1979. Nooruddeen Durkee served from 1980-1988 as President of Dar al-Islam. During his term of Office the Foundation grew from an idea to a physical reality that, at the time of his leaving office, had assets of US$7 million, was debt- free and in full operation which included a mosque, a school, a number of residences and small businesses. Its purpose was to add as a living, artistic, social and cultural center for Islam in America. It drew visitors from all over the world, and residence, particularly but not exclusively from among Muslim converts from America. The Foundation is operative and remains debt free with a limited summer teaching program. During this period he also studied Islamic Architecture with world-renowned Islamic architect Dr. Hasan Fathy, who made the original drawings of Dal al-Islam. In 1985 he was awarded the degree of Master of Islamic Architecture by the al-Sabbah Institute of Appropriate Technology in Kuwait. During 1988-1993 after a conference on Islamic Education in Cambridge, England he moved with his family to Alexandria, Egypt. There he worked with his spiritual teacher, developed a circle of students, deeply involved in the Shadhdhuliyyah, and produced volume one, Orison of Shadhdhuliyyah and collected volume two, Origins of the Shadhdhuliyyah. He also began the first work on the Tajwidi Qur'an. During this same period he also studied the Shadhdhuliyyah Shari'ah Way for Lovers of Qur'an and Sunnah with Ibrahim Muhammad al-Batawi, who was a Professor of Islamic Philosophy for over 25 years at al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. In 1986 Nooruddeen was appointed by Ibrahim al-Batawi as his Khalifah in the Western Hemisphere. He also studied the science of Muraqabah (inner contemplation) with the Mujaddidi Naqshabandi Shaykh, Dr. Seyed 'Ali Ashraf, professor of Islamic Education at King Abdu-l-Aziz University in Jeddah and later Professor of Education at Oxford University in the UK, who granted him an 'Ijaza (certificate to teach) the Muraqqabah. In 1983 he was granted an 'Ijaza in Islamic Calling (da‚Äôwa) from Umar Abdullaah, a Ba'Alawi shaykh from the Commoro Islands who served as the Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. In 1999 he was granted an 'Ijaza and given 'Idhn to teach from Muhammad al-Jamal, of the High Council of Sufism in al-Quds ash-Sharif, Occupied Palestine, and in 2004 was granted a Khilafah by Hazrat Quttubuddin Yar Fardi of the Nizamiyya/Chistiyyah in Rahim Yar Khan in Pakistan, after a series of lectures he gave to large gatherings in the spring of that year. From 1994 till the present: He returned to America and settled in Charlottesville, Virginia, working full-time on the Tajwidi Qur'an which was published in 2003. During this time he founded the Green Mountain School as a conduit for teaching Qur'an and publishing of other books and lectures. He also established the an- Noor foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3), specifically for the publication of the Tajiwidi Qur'an and for the propagation of traditional moderate Islam. Nooruddeen died on at 11:55pm on September 13, 2020 in his home in Green Mountain, near Keene, VA. His burial took place Monday the 14th in Bedford, VA.  Major Contributions  The Transliterated Tajwidi Qur'an Translated & transliterated by A. Nooruddeen Durkee [English edited by Hajjah Noura Durkee] () Call number: BP 131.6 .T3413 2003. an-Noor Educational Foundation, Charlottesville, VA, 2003. It is a guide for non-Arabic readers to the pronunciation of the original text and to understanding some of the meanings revealed in the glorious Quran. Translated and transliterated into English from Arabic. The transliteration (based on Mesa and Hart's rules) is clear and accurate, and is found directly opposite its Arabic counterpart. The English appears ayat by ayat under the transliteration. The language is respectful yet contemporary and very understandable. Additions to or ‚Äòbridges‚Äô in the text, necessary for the sake of English reading, are clearly distinguished by brackets and contain no editorial comment. The volume contains extensive notes and charts on tajwid, the rules for reading Qur'an, and a large index. Its English is edited by Hajja Noura Durkee, with Arabic text hand-written by Munshi Muhammad Sharif and orthography by 'Ustadh Zafar 'Iqbal. The English 'translation' is built on a compendium of the shared understanding of previous translators such as M. Yusuf Ali, M. Pickthal, M. Asad, the Bewleys, and Um Muhammad. The transliteration is an improvement over previously done work by Muhammad A. H. Eliasi (Golden Press, Hyderabad, India, 1978) on a number of ground including: 1. The Arabic text in the Tajwidi Qur'an is approved both in Pakistan and by al-Azhar in Egypt, is clear and easy to read. 2. Has additional orthographic notation that aids the recitation. 3. The punctuation marks are obvious and clearly explained in the notes which is helpful for the non-Arab people. 4. Take advantages of available Latin fonts to reflect the more correct pronunciation. In 1994, Noorudeen began this work while living in Alexandria, Egypt, as an aid to non-Arabic readers of the Qur'an. After it was completed in 2000, he sent it to a select group of Arabic scholars, speakers and readers as well as to a representative cross-section of Muslim readers for further review and correction. This latter stage, coupled with careful revisions of form, layout and design, took 3 more years. It was printed and bound during Ramadan 1424-2003. Orisons of the Shadhuliyyah (first edition, Alexandria, Egypt 1991 (), second edition Singapore, 2005) Orisons of the Shadhdhuliyyah Origins of the Shadhdhuliyyah which is the translation of three books from the Arabic which deal with the origins of the Shadhdhuli School of Sufism. Two of these books are by the late Shaykh of Azhar, ‚ÄòAbdu-l-Haleem Mahmud, and the third is by Dr. Abu-l-Wafa Taftazani, the former vice-regent of Cairo University and the Shaykh ul-Mashaykh of the Turuq as-Suffiyyah of Egypt. Sequentially these books deal with the lives and teachings of ‚ÄòAbu-l- Hasan ash-Shadhdhuli, his Khalifah (successor) Abu-l-‚ÄòAbbas al-Mursi and one of his two successors, Ibn ‚ÄòAta‚Äô ‚ÄòIllah as-Sakandari. This book: ‚ÄúOrigins of the School of the Shadhdhuliyyah‚Äù is companion edition to the first volume, ‚ÄúOrisons of the School of the Shadhdhuliyyah () which was published in al-‚ÄòIskandariyyah (Alexandria), Egypt in 1991 CE [1411 Hijri]. This volume contains the complete collection in Arabic, English and Roman Transliteration of the ‚ÄòAhzab and ‚ÄôAwrad of the Shaykh which Shaykh Nooruddeen translated in collaboration with Dr. Ma‚Äôddawi az-Zirr and then edited and prepared for publishing during a five year stay [1989-94] in Alexandria. Dar al-Islam, Abiquiu, New Mexico Nooruddeen Durkee is the founder of Dar al-Islam,Dar al- Islam Official website http://www.daralislam.org/ a non-profit educational organization. It was a spiritual center of the first Islamic village in the United States.A Mosque in Abiuqiu by David Dillon. Published in Progressive Architecture, volume 6, issue 83, pg 90 Dar al-Islam was founded in 1979 to facilitate the growth of accurate and authentic knowledge of Islam among the American people with a commitment to build bridges among the Muslims and non- Muslims of America. Programs undertaken were focused on reaching beyond information to the contextual and experiential dynamics of living in multi- cultural society. Aerial view of Dar al-Islam site, under-construction in 1988 In 1975, while studying at the Markaz al-Lughat al-Arabiyyah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia he met a businessman and industrialist named Sahl Kabbani who was to become his partner in the endeavor of Dar al-Islam. Kabbani had studied engineering in the United States and was anxious to return something to the country that had contributed to his education. The two of them put together the plan for Dar al-Islam, with Kabbani reportedly contributing $125,000 to the foundation. Other money came from the Riyadh Ladies‚Äô Benevolent Association of Saudi Arabia, from the late King Khalid, and from two of his daughters, Charitable donations ‚Äì called sadaka ‚Äì in the Islamic tradition serve to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù the donor‚Äôs money. Planned as the eventual home of 150 families, it is the first Islamic village in the United States. The idea was to establish a community in the United States whose members could live a fully Islamic way of life. Dar al-Islam would be a place where American Muslims could engage in life's daily transactions according to their beliefs: the deen, or code of Islam. And in manifesting their faith, they would bear witness of Islam to others: the da'wa, or calling.Dar al - Islam: The Code and the Calling, by William Tracy Published in Saudi Aramco World, volume 39, number 3 The foundation purchased its first site from Alva Simpson, a well- established rancher along the Chama, for $1,372,000. The land included the mesa top, plus below the mesa ‚Äì a lust, fertile tract along the Chama River. A master plan was drawn up for the community, and the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy was called in to help make it a reality.Building for Allah: Abiqui, Denver Post, April 27, 1986 The Lama Foundation The Lama Foundation in New Mexico was founded in 1967 by Nooruddeen Durkee, then Stephen Durkee and Barbara Durkee, now known as Asha Greer or Asha von Briesen. It began with the purchase of 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land adjacent to federal forested land, and continues today as a place for people to visit and live. \\"Construction of the first buildings began in 1968. The following year, the foundation was incorporated as an ‚Äúeducational, religious and scientific‚Äù organization. It was one of almost thirty communes established in the region around that time, and one of the most well-known, along with Morningstar East, Reality Construction Company, the Hog Farm, New Buffalo, and The Family. By 1973, the vast majority of these communities had closed, but the Lama Foundation was able to continue because it had more structure and discipline than most others. Ram Dass was a friend of the founders, and he stayed at the Lama Foundation as a guest when he returned to America from India. During his visit, he presented the Durkees with a manuscript he had written, entitled From Bindu to Ojas. The community's residents edited, illustrated, and laid out the text, which ultimately became a huge commercial hit when published under the name Be Here Now. Dass also held seminars at the Foundation. So did other spiritual leaders, such as Samuel L. Lewis, who was buried there after his death in 1971.  Green Mountain School  Founded in 1995, The Green Mountain School is the third school Nooruddeen Durkee has founded. The major concentration of the school was and continues to be the teaching of the Qur'an. The School also serves as a local conduit for the dispersing of zakat and sadaqah (charity). It sponsors a weekly ma'idatu-l-rahmah (table of mercy), which gathers together orphans and widows from the refugee community, local university students and professors, and others among the poor, lately imprisoned and broken hearted to eat together, pray together, make dhikr together and read Qur'an together. The Green Mountain School, in concert with An-Noor Foundation, has for more than seven years run a prison chaplaincy for both men and women in maximum security state prisons.

Jackson Building in Asheville, NC. The Jackson Building is a 140 ft (43m) 15-story building in Asheville, North Carolina And is owned by the Blaney Estate such was completed in 1924 in Pack Square downtown. It was the first skyscraper in western North Carolina. History The site chosen by developer Lynwood B. Jackson for western North Carolina's first skyscraper was previously that of the tombstone business operated by Thomas Wolfe's father. It was only 27 by 60 feet and believed to be too small for a skyscraper, but it now holds the record for tallest building on the smallest lot. Jackson hired architect Ronald Greene. Jackson built the city's first skyscraper because he believed in Asheville's real estate market. The Neo-Gothic building was fully occupied when it opened in 1924. The observation tower had a 400x telescope and an 18 million candlepower searchlight intended to attract tourists. The grotesques on each corner are not functional; there are small holes in the mouths to let water escape and not freeze in the terracotta.

Taxonomic history = Etymology= The smooth helmeted iguana is named for the prominent casque, or crest on the back of its head and neck which has the appearance of a helmet. = Evolutionary history = The Corytophanidae family of lizards is thought to have Euramerican and Laurasian ancestral beginnings, and is believed to have moved down to the tropics after the Eocene period cooling, approximately 33‚Äì56 million years ago.  Geographic range and habitat  It can be found ranging from Chiapas in southern Mexico to north-western Colombia. The habitat they primarily occupy in this range are primary and secondary mesic rain-forest. These iguanas live predominantly in trees, but also hunt on the forest floor where they use leaf litter as a micro-habitat.  Description  The smooth helmeted iguana is a medium sized lizard with long slim legs and very long toes. It can be grey, olive, brown, black or reddish-brown with irregular blotches. The smooth helmeted iguana can change the color of its skin as a method of camouflage. As indicated by its name, the smooth helmeted iguana has a prominent crest on its head, which tapers to a saw-tooth ridge down its back. The crest is present in both males and females of the species, though the crest is larger in males. These iguanas are approximately in size when mature. They are a non-heliotherm species, meaning that they do not use the sun to increase their body temperature. Rather, they maintain their body temperature at around , close to the temperature of the forest floor habitat where they live. These lizards are very wary of predators and freeze at the approach of danger from up to away.  Behavior and ecology = Reproduction = Females lay five to six eggs in a depression on the forest floor. It is speculated that the crest on their head may be used in excavating the nest. = Diet = Corytophanes cristatus feeds on insects, spiders, worms, and other lizards. These organisms are extreme \\"sit and wait\\" predators and their foraging is brief and infrequent. Therefore, these lizards are considered to be opportunistic feeders. They are also specialist feeders that prey on extremely large arthropods and cicadas when available. If the lizard has no luck being a sit and wait predator, they will sometimes become active predators and look for their next meal. Typically, if this is the method they choose they will choose prey that is slow and easy to capture. = Interactions with algae and fungi = The smooth helmeted iguana has been observed to remain motionless for extended periods of time. It is thought that this behavior has resulted in their skin being used as a novel growing substrate for a species of fungus, Physarum pusillum. This species of lizard is also the only known vertebrate observed with a cormophytic plant growing on it.  Color change  The smooth helmeted iguana, like chameleons and other iguanas, has the ability to change its coloration from dark to light or vice versa, which aids in thermoregulation when basking in sunlight.  Conservation  The smooth helmeted iguana is common and widespread throughout its native range. There are no current conservation concerns for this species although deforestation can be a localized threat to smooth helmeted iguana populations.

It was designed by Frederick Clarke Withers, following principles of his late mentor, Andrew Jackson Downing, and built for a wealthy local family in 1859. Since then it has undergone very few revisions, making it a well-preserved exemplar of the style, Withers' houses and Downing's aesthetics. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description The house sits on a lot on Downing Avenue in Balmville, an affluent unincorporated residential enclave in the Town of Newburgh just north of the city of Newburgh. The Hudson River is a short distance to the east down a steady slope. It is surrounded by mature trees of species including beech, black walnut and catalpa. It is a two-and-a-half-story red brick building on a sandstone foundation with steeply-pitched gabled roof pierced by three brick chimneys. The south-facing front facade features a projecting central pavilion with white quatrefoil- pireced vergeboards at the overhanging eave. Dormer windows on either side are similarly appointed, as is the curving balustrade on an upper balcony. To the west of the doubled-doored entrance is a porch supported by chamfered posts and curved braces; to the east is a bay window. The east side has a similar porch but with a latticework frieze and arrows pointing to the entrance. Another vergeboard decorates the rear (north) gable and a two-story kitchen wing on the north. A garage wing has also been added there. Two more of the signature vergeboards decorate the rooflines of projecting gables on the west face. Inside, the floor plan is asymmetrical. Many of the original moldings and other wood trim remain, especially the Gothic fluted surrounds on the bay windows, which emerge from nearby pilasters. The fireplaces have their original marble mantels. A mansard roofed privy of brick and brownstone is located behind the house. It is included in the listing as a contributing resource. A carriage house to the northwest originally built with the main house has been extensively modified and converted into a residence. It is non- contributing. History Maple Lawn was commissioned by a resident named Walter Vail in the late 1850s. Little is known about him, but it was a time when those who had become wealthy from river trade and growing industrialization in Newburgh were building grand houses with Hudson River views for themselves either in the northeastern portion of the city or in relatively undeveloped Balmville just to the north. The house took its name from the abundant maples planted around it, which were later destroyed in a hurricane. It has seen almost no alterations since. The growth of Balmville in the later 19th century led to the carriage house being split off onto its own lot and separately developed as a residence in 1903. In the 1950s, the corbelling on the chimneys was removed and the garage wing added. At the time of its listing on the Register, the front balcony was described as having also been removed around the same time, but it has been restored since then. Aesthetics Downing had advocated the Picturesque as the ideal mode for his favored type of house, which integrated more seamlessly with its natural surroundings than houses built in the Greek Revival and Federal styles popular earlier in the century. After his death, Withers, who had worked for him following his emigration from his native England, was seen along with occasional collaborator Calvert Vaux as Downing's heir and successor.

His ideas for combining fictional orders of battle, visual deception and double agents helped define Allied deception strategy during the war, for which he has been referred to as \\"the greatest British deceiver of WW2\\". Clarke was also instrumental in the founding of three famous military units, namely the British Commandos, the Special Air Service and the US Rangers. Born in Johannesburg and brought up near London, Clarke joined the Royal Artillery as an officer in 1916 but transferred to the Royal Flying Corps after finding he was too young to fight in France. He spent the First World War learning to fly, first in Reading and then Egypt. Clarke returned to the Royal Artillery in 1919 and had a varied career doing intelligence work in the Middle East. In 1936 he was posted to Palestine, where he helped organise the British repression of the 1936 Arab uprising. During the Second World War, Clarke joined John Dill's staff and proposed and helped implement, an idea for commando raids into France ‚Äì an early form of the British Commandos. In 1940, Archibald Wavell called Clarke to Cairo and placed him in charge of strategic deception. As a cover, he was employed to set up a regional organisation for MI9, a British escape and evasion department. The following year Clarke received a war establishment and set up Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force with a small staff to plan deception operations. Once satisfied with the department's structure, he pursued intelligence contacts in Turkey and Spain. In late 1941 Clarke was called to London, where his deception work had come to the attention of Allied high command. Shortly afterward, while in Madrid, he was arrested wearing women's clothing, in circumstances that remain unclear. He was released and after being questioned by the governor of Gibraltar, allowed to return to Cairo. During Clarke's absence, deception hierarchy in Middle East Command had become muddled. Colonel Ralph Bagnold had taken over deception planning, pushing 'A' Force aside. Clarke was sent to El Alamein, where Allied forces were on the retreat, to work on deception plans. Upon his return, Bagnold was sidelined and 'A' Force reinstated as the primary deception department. Throughout 1942 Clarke implemented Operation Cascade, an order of battle deception which added many fictional units to the Allied formations. Cascade was a success; by the end of the war the enemy accepted most of the formations as real. From 1942 to 1945, Clarke continued to organise deception in North Africa and southern Europe. After the war, he was asked to record the history of 'A' Force. He retired in 1947 and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity. As well as pursuing a literary career that produced two histories and a thriller, he worked for the Conservative Party and was a director of Securicor. He died in London in 1974. Early life The Queen's South Africa Medal, which Clarke later attempted to claim for his infant presence at the Siege of Ladysmith in 1899 Clarke was born in Johannesburg on . His father, Ernest Clarke, grew up in Kingston upon Hull and moved to South Africa in the late 19th century, where he became embroiled in the Jameson Raid. Ernest managed to avoid prison for his part in the raid and, via a co-conspirator, obtained a job at a gold mining company. Once settled, Ernest married Madeline Gardiner, and a short while later, Dudley was born. During the Second Boer War, the Clarke family was trapped in the siege of Ladysmith. Although an infant at the time of the siege, Clarke later tried to claim a campaign medal. Soon afterwards, the family returned to England, moving to Watford, where Clarke's brother, the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke, was born in 1907. From an early age, Clarke wanted a career in the armed forces. In 1912, he attended Charterhouse School, where he was exposed to the glamorous parties and smart uniforms of the nearby military presence at Aldershot, including the newly formed Royal Flying Corps. First World War and inter-war period Eager to be in active service, Clarke applied to sit the Army Entrance Exam in 1915, as soon as he had reached the minimum age of sixteen and a half. To his own surprise (he had petitioned the Charterhouse headmaster for a recommendation, allowing him to bypass the exam, on the expectation of failing), he passed and in early 1916 attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In November 1916, Clarke was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. When his regiment deployed to France, Clarke had to stay behind because, aged 17, he was too young to fight. Frustrated, he applied to join the Royal Flying Corps and transferred to the School of Military Aeronautics in Reading in . The following April he was posted to Egypt to complete his flight training, where he stayed until . Despite his promotion to the rank of lieutenant, Clarke transferred back to the Royal Artillery on his return to England. After the war, Clarke had a varied military career that began with a posting to Mesopotamia in 1919. During the Iraqi revolt of 1920, he helped evacuate Europeans from the region by boat. While on extended leave in Turkey in 1922, he became involved in the Chanak Crisis, a threatened Turkish attack on British and French troops. Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists ‚Äì a first taste of the activities that would define his later military career. In 1925, during another period of leave, Clarke covered the Rif War for the Morning Post. Over the inter-war period, Clarke became involved in the theatre and drama establishments of his postings. In 1923, he re-formed the Royal Artillery Officers Dramatic Club and was responsible for the Royal Artillery's display at the 1925 Royal Tournament. In 1933 and 1934, he wrote and directed two Christmas pantomimes. =Palestine= In 1936, Clarke was posted, at his request, to Palestine, just in time to participate in the 1936 Arab uprising. The British presence in Jerusalem was minimal at that time, comprising two regiments of infantry and a motley collection of air and armour under the command of . Clarke, as one of only two staff officers, was faced with organising an effective response to guerrilla warfare. He first set to work improving communications between the small Royal Air Force contingent and the army. It was here that he met Tony Simonds, an intelligence officer sent to the region with express orders to set up an intelligence network. Clarke and Simonds worked to feed reliable information to British forces. Toward the end of 1936, more troops were dispatched to Palestine. Lieutenant General John Dill was placed in command, and Clarke became his chief of staff. In 1937, Dill was replaced by Major General Archibald Wavell, the commander who would later give Clarke free rein in Middle Eastern deception operations. In the preface to Clarke's 1948 book, Seven Assignments, Wavell wrote about their time together in Palestine: Second World War The Commando shoulder patch during the Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War Clarke was promoted to lieutenant colonel and began working on intelligence tasks. He worked with Wavell in the Middle East to research possible Allied supply lines, undertook two trips to Norway (in an effort to maintain its neutrality), and conducted secret missions in Calais and Ireland. In Clarke became a military assistant to General Sir John Dill (then Chief of the General Staff) at the War Office. On , inspired by childhood recollections of similar Boer forces as well as experiences during the Arab uprising in Palestine, Clarke sketched out an idea for small amphibious raiding parties, called Commandos. On , while Dill was inspecting the troops evacuated from Dunkirk, Clarke suggested the idea to him, and the prime minister approved the plan on the following day. Clarke, under Brigadier Otto Lunde, was tasked with setting up a new department, MO9, and began to recruit soldiers for what would later become the British Commandos. The first raid into France, Operation Collar, took place on 24 June 1940. Clarke obtained permission to accompany the 120-strong force, but was not allowed to go ashore. The attempt was not a major success, with only one of the four units managing to kill enemy troops. While waiting on the beach for his men to return, Clarke's boat was apparently spotted by a German patrol. Somehow Clarke was injured in the ear during, he said, an exchange of fire. Ernest Chappell, who was also on the beach, said that the patrol had not opened fire. =1941: Cairo= At various times in Cairo, Clarke worked alongside Montgomery, Wavell and Auchinleck. In Cairo, Archibald Wavell, Clarke's old commander in Palestine, was commanding the North African campaign. He believed that deception was a key part of warfare. On 13 December he summoned Clarke to Egypt, telling high command he wished to set up \\"a special section of Intelligence for Deception\\". While awaiting Clarke's arrival, Wavell initiated a successful deception against the Italian forces at Sidi Barrani. Clarke reached Cairo on 18 December, to be greeted by Tony Simonds ‚Äì another old hand from Palestine. Wavell put Clarke in charge, albeit under great secrecy, of broad strategic deception operations in North Africa. He held this position, under subsequent Mediterranean commanders, for the next five years. On his arrival in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who operated Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter- espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: that the key to deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want. Clarke had not forgotten his previous pet scheme: the Commandos. In , he met the American Colonel William J. Donovan while the latter was touring the region. Clarke's description of the 1940 British unit inspired Donovan to emulate the idea. Clarke suggested the name \\"Rangers\\", after the frontier force Rogers' Rangers in the film Northwest Passage, for Donovan's unit. In May of the following year the United States Army Rangers were founded. In February, Clarke suffered from an attack of jaundice that put him out of action for about six weeks. He was visited regularly by Maunsell who was, by that time, a firm friend. 'A' Force At first Clarke worked alone and in secret, under the official title \\"Intelligence Officer (special duties) to the Commander-in- Chief\\". He had neither staff nor official mandate, and worked from a \\"converted bathroom\\" at the British Army headquarters, Cairo. His cover role was to establish a regional department for MI9, the less secret organisation tasked with helping Allied servicemen in escape and evasion tactics. Far from being a token cover, Clarke ran MI9's Middle East department, in tandem with his deception work, until . Clarke's one-man show in deception was not to last long. In Clarke began Operation Abeam, fabricating the existence of a British paratrooper regiment in the region. It would be two years before such troops reached the Mediterranean, but Clarke hoped to play on Italian fears of an airborne assault. He created a fictional 1st Special Air Service Brigade, using faked documents, photographs and reports, which leaked back to the Italians. He even dressed two soldiers in \\"1 SAS\\" uniforms and set them to wander around Cairo, Port Said and Alexandria hinting at missions in Crete or Libya. By March, Clarke had another scheme in the works, a deception cover for Operation Cordite, the 6th Infantry Division invasion of Rhodes. His work interviewing locals about the Greek island could not be associated with the 6th so he adopted the guise of 'A' Force. The name was intentionally vague, designed to add to the mythology of his fictional airborne unit. Although at first only a cover name, the department soon became real and took control of deception in the region. On Clarke requisitioned , Cairo ‚Äì opposite and below a brothel ‚Äì and in April received an official mandate for his department. \\"Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force\\" moved into their new offices on and Clarke began to recruit his staff. Clarke's airborne SAS had another legacy. In David Stirling, an injured member of the early 8 Commando, envisioned a new special forces unit consisting of small commando teams intended to operate behind enemy lines. Clarke gave the project his full backing, and the unit was named \\"L\\" Detachment, Special Air Service ‚Äì in part to help solidify the existence of the larger fictional force in the minds of the enemy. Stirling's force later evolved into the modern-day Special Air Service. Clarke therefore had a hand in the formation of three famed military units. Phantom forces, of which the SAS was only Clarke's first, played a crucial part in deception operations during the war ‚Äì including along the Western Front in 1944 ‚Äì but for the rest of he worked hard to build his department. Consolidating deception Clarke's \\"War Establishment\\" granted him three officers, several enlisted men and a small array of vehicles. A recruitment drive paid off in the form of highly experienced staff. To help with visual deception he brought in Victor Jones and Jasper Maskelyne. He also recruited a Scots Guards officer, Captain Ogilvie-Grant, to manage the MI9 escape and evasion work, which had been adopted as cover for the whole of 'A' Force. Finally, the services of Major E. Titterington, originally a member of Maunsell's SIME, were obtained for help in creating forged documents; eventually Titterington's operation expanded to form a subsection of 'A' Force devoted to forgeries. With his office organised, Clarke was happy to leave day-to-day management to his staff. He then embarked on a trip to Turkey, where he worked to establish a network of misinformation as well as carry out his MI9 role. There he met two important figures in Turkish intelligence ‚Äì Brigadier Allan Arnold, the British military attach√©, and Commander Vladimir Wolfson, a Royal Navy attach√© ‚Äì and worked with them to open channels of misinformation to the enemy. In Wolfson, Clarke had found an important resource and, in his own words, began \\"a long and profitable partnership for Deception and MI9 matters in Turkey which was to last for the rest of the war\\". Clarke left Istanbul on , travelling covertly back to Egypt via Syria and Lebanon in order to reconnoitre the ground that British forces would have to invade when entering the country. He arrived in Cairo on . Despite Clarke and Wavell's successes in deception, the North African campaign was turning against the Allies. In 1941 Erwin Rommel had taken command of Axis forces and won early victories. Churchill replaced Wavell with Claude Auchinleck. Clarke's new commander was impressed with Wavell's setup, so 'A' Force and the rest of Middle Eastern Command continued to operate as before. Lisbon and London Clarke travelled to Lisbon on aiming, as with his earlier Turkey trip, to open up lines of deception into Axis forces. He spent around a month in the area, posing as a flamboyant journalist, before being summoned back to London. His successful deception activities in the Middle East had caught the attention of high command, and Clarke was asked to write a paper about his experiences. While in London, Clarke met many of his counterparts on the Western Front. He attended meetings of the Twenty Committee and Chiefs of Staff Committee (which was chaired by his old commander, John Dill). The paper on deception met with approval in the establishment and it was decided that a department similar to 'A' Force should be created in London. Clarke was offered the job, reporting directly to the Chiefs of Staff and War Cabinet. He declined, citing loyalty to the Middle East, but his decision was in large part due to the greater operational freedom and status he enjoyed in North Africa. The London Controlling Section was formed and, after some disorganisation, prospered under John Bevan, with whom Clarke would later work closely. The infamous photograph of Dudley Clarke wearing a dress which circulated among the Allied high command in late 1941 Pleased with his success in London, Clarke returned to Lisbon on posing as a journalist for The Times named \\"Wrangal Craker\\". His aim was to carry on the semi-undercover work of spreading rumours and misinformation to the Germans. Later that month, in Madrid, he was arrested while dressed as a woman. Guy Liddell, wartime counter-espionage head at MI5, said of the incident: \\"I'm afraid to say that after his stay in Lisbon as a bogus journalist he has got rather over-confident about his powers as an agent.\\" Clarke was released, apparently at the behest of a German contact who believed him to be \\"an important agent who was ready to assist the Germans\\", and made his way to Gibraltar. Clarke's run of bad luck continued. He was ordered back to London to explain the Madrid incident to his superiors but, after setting out on the ship Ariosto, the convoy was torpedoed by a U-boat on . The Ariosto was one of three ships sunk in the engagement, although he escaped harm and returned to Gibraltar. Rather than attempting another trip to London, Clarke was interviewed by the Governor of Gibraltar, Lord Gort, who judged Clarke's answers acceptable and concluded that \\"we can reasonably expect that this escapade and its consequences will have given him sufficient shock to make him more prudent in the immediate future\\". It is unclear why Clarke was wearing a dress, but reports of the incident indicated he had been following a lead and gone a little too far in his spy-craft. Photographs of his disguise, obtained from the Spanish police, circulated in London and were viewed mostly with amusement. He was allowed to return to Cairo and reached Egypt on . Although he escaped disciplinary action over the incident, it was the last time Clarke attempted his own espionage work. =1942: El Alamein= Back in Cairo, Clarke discovered that much had changed during his absence. The recently promoted Colonel Ralph Bagnold had been appointed \\"Chief Deception Officer\\" at Middle Eastern HQ and had taken charge of tactical deception. Clarke was annoyed at what he saw as a power grab and at the sudden high profile of deception operations (Bagnold's promotion was widely publicised). Over the next few months Bagnold secured more and more of the day-to-day management of deception operations leaving 'A' Force, and Clarke, in a training and advisory capacity. Despite this, Clarke's services were in high demand as the opening months of 1942 saw Allied forces in North Africa suffering serious defeats. On Auchinleck dispatched Clarke to Libya with urgent orders to assist in halting the German advances. Before leaving for the Eighth Army headquarters in Gazala, Clarke left a note, which he later described as \\"begging for the whole question of deception machinery in the Command to be reviewed completely afresh during his absence.\\" Once on the ground he found a shaken army conducting a hesitant withdrawal, and in urgent need of delaying tactics to slow the German advance. After brainstorming with his team in Cairo, Clarke envisioned Bastion, a deception operation to convince Rommel that his advance on Gazala was heading into a trap. The plan, which involved Victor Jones creating a strong fictional force of 300 tanks on the British right hand flank, was in full swing during February. The operation appears to have had limited effect. Rommel delayed his advance until May, when British forces were routed at the Battle of Gazala and the Germans resumed their push toward Egypt. Upon his return to Cairo, on , Clarke was pleased to find that Auchinleck had restored 'A' Force as the sole deception organisation at HQ. Bagnold's enterprise was entirely sidelined and he moved on to other things. Clarke, who in March was promoted to full colonel, said that Bastion had taught him much: \\"We learnt more Lessons from it than from almost any other plan and it helped us evolve three important principles.\\" By the end of March, Clarke considered the much-expanded 'A' Force, and his theory of deception, to have matured beyond the basic trial and error of the previous years. Operation Cascade In Clarke had begun to draft ideas for an ambitious order-of-battle deception. He had found that the process of convincing the enemy of the existence of a notional force was long and tedious. Operation Cascade was intended to create the fiction of a much increased Allied force in North Africa, including eight divisions, three new brigades, and even the 1st SAS. At first the plan was intended to deter the Axis from extending an offensive against the USSR southward into the region. After a slow start, in early 1942, Cascade began to take effect. As early as May, Axis intelligence began to overestimate Allied strength by nearly 30%. In July the operation expanded. Clarke introduced more and more fictitious divisions and by the end of the year the Germans had accepted many of them as real formations. By 1944, when the operation was superseded, it had completely fooled the enemy. Cascade was a major success for Clarke; it supported most of the subsequent major deceptions for the remainder of the war (by providing established fictional units) and proved that deception on a grand scale was a realistic strategy. El Alamein deceptions, August 1942 In May, before Cascade had become fully operational, Rommel defeated the British Army in Libya. Auchinleck rallied his forces at El Alamein and asked Clarke to draft plans for delaying the Axis advance, giving the Allies time to withdraw. Operation Sentinel was designed to convince Rommel, using camouflage, fakery and radio deception, that substantial British armour sat between him and the retreating Eighth Army. In spite of his success at El Alamein Auchinleck was replaced by Harold Alexander on , Clarke's third commander in under two years. Bernard Montgomery was handed control of the Eighth Army and instructed to push Rommel back. Montgomery knew Clarke, having taught him infantry tactics at the Staff College in 1931, and instructed him to prepare deception plans for the Second Battle of El Alamein. The plan involved major camouflage activity, Operation Bertram, radio deception, Operation Canwell and a disinformation campaign, Operation Treatment.Stroud, 2012. pp. 192‚Äì193. On 9 September Clarke was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The citation recognised his efforts in setting up A-Force, but referred to its less clandestine MI9 escape and evasion work. Clarke had his mind on other things besides awards and El Alamein. He delegated much of the ongoing planning to 'A' Force staff, as the department was now well established. Instead he flew to London and Washington in October to discuss strategic deception for Operation Torch, the forthcoming British-American invasion of the French North African colonies, leaving Charles Richardson (a planning officer at Eight Army HQ) and Geoffrey Barkas (Director of Camouflage, Middle East Command) to implement Operation Bertram. For the first time deception experts from across the theatres of war worked together. John Bevan of the London Controlling Section hosted an October conference for Clarke, Peter Flemming from India, and representatives from Washington. The meeting agreed on plans for a disinformation campaign, which would attempt to convince German high command that the Allied targets in Africa were Dakar and Sicily (the far eastern and western limits of the theatre). Four days after Montgomery's success at El Alamein, on , Allied forces landed in Morocco and Algeria to the surprise of German forces there. On Clarke, along with Bevan and Flemming, met Churchill to discuss all the Allied deception strategies. =1943: Barclay= 1943 would be the peak of deception operations for Clarke and 'A' Force ‚Äì in 1944 the focus switched to the Western Front. Until then he was very busy between Operation Barclay and the continuing Cascade. The main Allied push that year was toward Sicily, as decided by high command in January. Barclay was the elaborate deception with which Clarke was tasked, an operation to mislead the Axis into expecting attacks on the far eastern and western extremities of the northern Mediterranean theatre ‚Äì namely the Balkan Peninsula and southern France. On Clarke again met Bevan, in Algiers, to discuss strategy for Barclay. Building on Cascade he added the Twelfth Army to his fictional order of battle, and began to make them look like a convincing threat to Crete and the Greek mainland. For this new deception 'A' Force had strong support from London ‚Äì in April the famed Operation Mincemeat was used to help bolster Clarke's deceptive thrust toward Crete. By this point 'A' Force had much expanded beyond the small flat in Cairo, adding representatives with the army in Sicily and offices in Algiers and Nairobi. Clarke roved around the region acting as overseer of the department's operations. On 14 October he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), the citation (marked \\"not for publication\\") praised Clarke's ongoing work, referring to him as \\"irreplaceable\\". In December 1943, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier. Although the promotion did not include perks associated with higher ranks (such as a car and driver) Clarke used his charisma to obtain them anyway. =1944: Monty's double= In 1944 the Allies finally focused on France and the Western Front. Bevan and the London Controlling Section were tasked with inventing an elaborate masquerade to cover the Normandy invasion, a vindication of the theory pioneered by Clarke and Wavell: that every real operation should have a complementary deception. The focus on France left Clarke supporting the Allied push through Italy. He noted that \\"the peculiar circumstances of the Mediterranean Theater made it a sheer impossibility to have a hiatus of more than a week or two duration between Deception Plans.\\" In quick succession 'A' Force executed deceptions that included the operations Oakenfield and Zeppelin. Later that spring Clarke was inspired by a war film, Five Graves to Cairo, to create Operation Copperhead. Bernard Montgomery had recently been moved to England to take command of the ground forces intended for the Normandy invasion. To confuse the Germans, Clarke located a look- alike, pre-war actor Lieutenant M. E. Clifton James, and brought him to the Mediterranean under much ceremony. Through 1944 'A' Force was slowly winding down. Clarke was involved in planning Operation Bodyguard, a major cover plan for the Allied landing in Normandy, and he was tasked with executing the (largely political) deceptions in the Middle Eastern region. However, by the end of the summer 'A' Force's usefulness in operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to Caserta. Clarke, along with a skeleton staff, remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the Great Central Hotel where the department was disbanded. Clarke was mentioned in despatches on 19 October 1944, relating to his work setting up 'A' Force. The citation was announced in The London Gazette on 22 February 1945. Clarke received a further honour that year, when on 19 June he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). On 2 April 1946 he was awarded the American Legion of Merit. After the war Following the end of the war Clarke spent some time writing war histories. Until his retirement from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. The document was never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. Seven Assignments recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It was not his first attempt at a book. In 1925 Clarke had found a publisher for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was never finished. Following Seven Assignments Clarke then took a job at Conservative Central Office, as Head of Public Opinion Research, where he worked until 1952. During this later career he also served as a director of Securicor. In 1952 he resumed his literary career with the publication of The Eleventh at War, a history of the 11th Hussars. The following year he submitted a publisher's proposal for The Secret War, a full account of deception during the Second World War, but was prevented from writing it by the Official Secrets Act. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955. Clarke lived out his retirement in relative obscurity, despite the belief of his former commander, Field Marshal Harold Alexander, that \\"he did as much to win the war as any other single officer\\". Clarke died on , his address at the time was an apartment in Raleigh House, Dolphin Square, London. Most of his war work in military deception remained an obscure secret until the end of the 20th century and the publication of Michael Howard's 1990 official history, Strategic Deception in the Second World War. Legacy Clarke was widely regarded as an expert in military deception, and viewed by some of his peers as nearly legendary in status. In his 2004 book, The Deceivers, historian Thaddeus Holt identifies Clarke as \\"the master of the game\\", having been immersed in his deception activities for the entire war. Clarke evolved deception, almost from scratch, as a vital part of Allied strategy. The organisation that he and Wavell established proved a model for the other theatres of war, and his successes directly led to the creation of the London Controlling Section in 1941. He also misled German intelligence for several years ‚Äì to the extent that they overestimated Allied strength in North Africa by a quarter of a million men. The journalist Nicholas Rankin, writing in 2008, referred to Clarke as \\"the greatest British deceiver of WW2, a special kind of secret servant.\\" From the start of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of deception by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception. At the Tehran Conference Winston Churchill made his famous remark that in wartime 'truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.‚Äô Clarke's principle was the opposite. His thesis was that the lie (the cover plan) was so precious that it should be flanked with an escort of truths. Clarke also had a good appreciation of the complex interplay between Operations and intelligence in deception operations. He understood how to manipulate enemy intelligence agencies to build up the story he was trying to sell, and saw the importance of getting Operations, on his own side, to fit into those stories. Personal life Clarke is described as a charismatic, charming and theatrical character with a streak of creativity, a personality reflected in the escapades of his life and career. His self-deprecating humour and work ethic made Clarke a popular figure within the army, where he was considered to have odd \\"old world\\" habits and \\"an uncanny habit of suddenly appearing in a room without anyone having noticed him enter\\". Clarke was considered to possess an \\"original intellect\\", and to have odd habits, but was never seen as eccentric (a trait that was frowned on within the army establishment). Despite having middle-class origins, he aspired to the fringes of the upper-class establishment, in his words: \\"one of those in the inner circle, watching the wheels go round at the hub of the British Empire at some great moment in history.\\" From his time in Egypt during the First World War, Clarke fell in love with the country and he returned there as often as possible. He had a great respect for the inhabitants, writing that they had \\"the endearing qualities of humour and fortitude\\". Another particular love was film. In Cairo, during the Second World War, he was a regular at the cinema, a location that suited his photographic memory and preference for working at night; he often conducted meetings there. Films influenced his work in other ways, for instance in the inspiration he took from Northwest Passage to name the US Rangers. Clarke was inventive as well as frugal. While at flight school in Reading, and without any money to fund his recreation, he built \\"an apparatus composed of a bootlace, a lanyard and some straps off my valise, by which I am enabled to turn out the light without getting out of bed\\". The incident in Madrid, and Clarke's love of theatrics, raised questions about his sexuality. His arrest was somewhat hushed up at the time, which may have raised more questions than it prevented. There is no indication that Clarke was homosexual. He was involved in two bad relationships with women. In 1922 he met a Slavic woman called Nina in Wiesbaden, but she disappeared after Clarke smuggled currency to her friend in Bulgaria. Then in the late 1920s a woman in Sussex, who \\"meant everything in the world\\" to him, refused an offer of marriage. He often claimed to hate children and never married. Despite this Clarke was known for having beautiful female acquaintances, to whom his friends referred as \\"Dudley's Duchesses\\".

The airport serves Comiso (5 km/3 miles from it), Ragusa (15 km/9.3 miles from it), Vittoria and Gela. It changed from military to civil use during 2005‚Äì2008. The airport was opened to commercial and general aviation 30 May 2013. History Plan of Comiso Airport with its new 2,460m runway The control tower =1935‚Äì1980= The installation began as an aerodrome that was constructed in southeastern Sicily, at the foot of the Hyblaean Mountains (\\"Monti iblei\\") and near the city of Comiso. The airport was designed in 1934 under the fascist regime but building works did not start until 1935 and were finished in 1939. Magliocco Aerodromo was dedicated in 1936 and named in honor of Major General Vincenzo Magliocco, the first Sicilian to become a general officer in the Italian Air Force. Magliocco had been killed in the Ethiopian war in 1936. It became one of several key aerodromes in southern Sicily during the Second World War. German forces were stationed there in 1941, as part of Italy's Axis Alliance, and the German Luftwaffe in 1943 conducted air operations against Allied positions in Maghreb and Malta after its withdrawal from Tunisia. Aerial bombardments by the Allies rendered the airfield unserviceable on 26 May and 17 June 1943 in preparation for Operation Husky, the allied landings on Sicily. Just after the landing on the nearby Sicilian beaches two Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers took off from Comiso to bomb the landing beaches, only to be met by United States Army troops at the airfield when they landed for rearming and fuel. Ground assault forces of the II Corps, under the command of (then) Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, captured the base on 11 July 1943. Six days later, after quick repairs to the airfield, Allied air forces began operations at Magliocco, designated Comiso Airfield by the Allies, coming under the USAAF Twelfth Air Force. It was primarily used to support airborne and assault glider operations. Known allied units assigned to the base were: USAAF: * 340th Bombardment Group, 3‚Äì27 August 1943 (B-25 Mitchell) * 17th Troop Carrier Squadron, 3 September 1943 ‚Äì 8 July 1944 (C-47 Skytrain) * 16th Troop Carrier Squadron, 4 September 1943 ‚Äì 10 July 1944 (C-47 Skytrain) * 35th Troop Carrier Squadron, 7 September 1943 ‚Äì 9 January 1945 (C-47 Skytrain) * 18th Troop Carrier Squadron, 8 September 1943 ‚Äì 9 January 1945 (C-47 Skytrain) * 12th Troop Carrier Squadron, 22 October-9 November 1943 (C-47 Skytrain) RAF: * No. 43 Squadron, (Supermarine Spitfire) * No. 111 Squadron, (Supermarine Spitfire) * No. 243 Squadron, (Supermarine Spitfire) * No. 3201 Servicing Commando The airfield remained under Allied control when they left in early 1945. The airfield and facilities at Magliocco fell into disuse during the postwar years. In 1954 Alitalia, the Italian national airline, began commercial operations there. The facilities were extended, with a runway that was to be long, the airport was opened to civil aviation. The airport was also a base for the 41st Storm of Catania (Italian Air Force), until 1973. However, the airport was little used. =1981‚Äì1991= During the Cold War, on 7 August 1981, it was officially selected as the second European main operating base for BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles (GLCM), deployed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in response to the development and deployment of new intercontinental and intermediate range missiles by the Soviet Union. On 17 March 1982, Commander George W. Holland, of the U.S. Navy Civil Engineering Corps, arrived at Comiso as the resident officer in charge of construction (ROICC). The Air Force activated the 7024th Special Activities Squadron at nearby NAS Sigonella in May 1982 as a primary point of contact and liaison with Lelio Lagorio the Italian Minister of Defence regarding initial site preparations at Comiso. At Comiso, the buildings on the base were almost all bombed out shells and the runway had trees growing out of it. A few of the old buildings were refurbished and used by the USAF or the Italian Air Force, but most were demolished carefully, because of the large amount of Second World War unexploded ordnance, a new base was constructed from the ground up, which was completed on 13 August 1982. After demolition, limited facilities were constructed for the establishment of an interim base support facility or \\"porta-cabin city\\" for the 1983 summer arrival of the United States Air Force 487th Combat Support Group. The first permanently assigned U.S. military personnel arrived in April 1983 in the early stages of the construction of the base. There was a small Italian Air Force contingent there at that time, along with a U.S. Navy construction office. The 487th Combat Support Group was assigned to Comiso Air Station in May 1983; their efforts led to the 30 June 1983 activation of the 487th Tactical Missile Wing. Construction of permanent facilities began that summer, with the first major support facilities, which included the first two dormitories which were completed in late 1983. These facilities belonged to the first of three increments of construction, which would activate the wing and base in stages. During the summer of 1983, three large anti-nuclear demonstrations, largely funded by the Communist Party, were conducted around the base perimeter, with as many as 5,000 protesters at the events in late July, August and September. After these three demonstrations, which also involved a large number of Italian police, both local and national, the protesters appeared to lose interest and only a few very small incidents took place over the following years. From 1983 to 1991, Comiso Air Base was the largest NATO base in southern Europe and housed 112 BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles. Comiso Air Station was a very tightly controlled facility with a large security presence assigned due to the mission of the base, and the presence of nuclear-armed missiles which were stored at the base. The U.S. Air Force 487th Tactical Missile Wing and Italian Air Force host organisation jointly accomplished the NATO GLCM mission at Comiso until the base closed on 30 June 1991, a result of the signing of the Intermediate- range Nuclear Force Treaty in 1987. In the late 1990s, Comiso was used for the Rainbow Mission (Italian: Missione Arcobaleno), to house 5,000 Kosovars during the war in former Yugoslavia. The refugees were temporarily settled in the abandoned homes of the US military who left in 1991. =1992‚Äìpresent= Refurbishment work to reactivate the airport started in 2004 and was completed during the winter of 2008. The new runway is long and wide, ( with two hard shoulders, each of ) and has two fast exits (B and C); they connect to a taxiway wide. An ILS (Instrument Landing System) was installed and a new control tower high, was built. The first civil flight was made on a 30 April 2007, after the necessary tests and the inauguration of the new runway, but the airport was open to the traffic only on 30 May 2013.

This is achieved through the manipulation of de Bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly via the removal of errors and the simplification of repeated regions.Zerbino, D. R.; Birney, E. (2008). ‚ÄúVelvet: de novo assembly using very short reads‚Äù. Retrieved 2013-10-18. Velvet has also been implemented in commercial packages, such as Sequencher, Geneious, MacVector and BioNumerics. Introduction The development of next-generation sequencers (NGS) allowed for increased cost effectiveness on very short read sequencing. The manipulation of de Bruijn graphs as a method for alignment became more realistic but further developments were needed to address issues with errors and repeats. This led to the development of Velvet by Daniel Zerbino and Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics Institute in the United Kingdom. Velvet works by efficiently manipulating de Bruijn graphs through simplification and compression, without the loss of graph information, by converging non-intersecting paths into single nodes. It eliminates errors and resolves repeats by first using an error correction algorithm that merges sequences together. Repeats are then removed from the sequence via the repeat solver that separates paths which share local overlaps. The combination of short reads and read pairs allows Velvet to resolve small repeats and produce contigs of reasonable length. This application of Velvet can produce contigs with a N50 length of 50 kb on paired-end prokaryotic data and a 3 kb length for regions of mammalian data. Algorithm As already mentioned Velvet uses the de Bruijn graph to assemble short reads. More specifically Velvet represents each different k-mer obtained from the reads by a unique node on the graph. Two nodes are connected if its k-mers have a k-1 overlap. In other words, an arc from node A to node B exists if the last k-1 characters of the k-mer, represented by A, are the first k-1 characters of the k-mer represented by B. The following figure shows an example of a de Bruijn graph generated with Velvet: Figure 1: Example of read hashing and respective de Bruijn graph The same process is simultaneously done with the reverse complement of all the k-mers to take into account the overlaps between the reads of opposite strands. A number of optimizations can be done over the graph which includes simplification and error removal. =Simplification= An easy way to save memory costs is to merge nodes that do not affect the path generated in the graph, i.e., whenever a node A has only one outgoing arc that points to node B, with only one ingoing arc, the nodes can be merged. It is possible to represent both nodes as one, merging them and all their information together. The next figure illustrates this process in the simplification of the initial example. Figure 2: Simplified de Bruijn graph =Error removal= Errors in the graph can be caused by the sequencing process or it could simply be that the biological sample contains some errors (for example polymorphisms). Velvet recognizes three kinds of errors: tips; bubbles; and erroneous connections. Tips A node is considered a tip and should be erased if it is disconnected on one of its ends, the length of the information stored in the node is shorter than 2k, and the arc leading to this node has a low multiplicity (number of times the arc was found during the construction of the graph) and as a result cannot be compared to other alternative paths. Once these errors are removed, the graph once again undergoes simplification. Figure 3: Example of tips Bubbles Bubbles are generated when two distinct paths start and end at the same nodes. Normally bubbles are caused by errors or biological variants. These errors are removed using the Tour Bus algorithm, which is similar to a Dijkstra's algorithm, a breadth-first search that detects the best path to follow and determines which ones should be erased. A simple example is shown in figure 4. Figure 4: Example of bubble erase This process is also shown in figure 5 following on from the examples shown in figures 1 and 2. Figure 5: Example of bubble detection Erroneous connections These are connections that do not generate correct paths or do not create any recognizable structures within the graph. Velvet erases these errors after completion of the Tour Bus algorithm, applying a simple coverage cut-off that must be defined by the user. Velvet commands Velvet provides the following functions: ; velveth : This command helps to construct the data set (hashes the reads) for velvetg and includes information about the meaning of each sequence files. ; velvetg : This command builds the de Bruijn graph from the k-mers obtained by velveth and runs simplification and error correction over the graph. It then extracts the contigs. After running velvetg a number of files are generated. Most importantly, a file of contigs contains the sequences of the contigs longer than 2k, where k is the word-length used in velveth. For more detail and examples refer to the Velvet Manual ‚ÄúVelvet Manual‚Äù Retrieved 2013-10-18 Motivation Current DNA sequencing technologies, including NGS, are limited on the basis that genomes are much larger than any read length. Typically, NGS operate with small reads, less than 400 bp, and have a much lower cost per read than previous first generation machines. They are also simpler to operate with higher parallel operation and higher yield. However, short reads contain less information than larger reads thus requiring a higher assembly read coverage to allow for detectable overlaps. This in turn increases the complexity of the sequencing and significantly increases computational requirements. A larger number of reads also increases the size of the overlap graph, making it more difficult and lengthy to compute. The connections between the reads become more indistinct due to the decrease in overlapping sections leading to a greater possibility of errors. To overcome these issues, dynamic sequencing programs that are efficient, highly cost effective and able to resolve errors and repeats were developed. Velvet algorithms was designed for this and are able to perform short read de novo sequencing alignment in relatively short computational time and with lower memory usage compared to other assemblers. Graphical interface One of the main drawbacks in the use of Velvet is the use of the command-line interface and the difficulties users, especially beginners, face in the implementation of their data. A graphical user interface for the Velvet assembler was developed in 2012 and designed to overcome this problem and simplify the running of Velvet.

He went to Raining's School in Inverness, where he was taught by Alexander MacBain, a lexicographer of Scottish. He then attended the University of Edinburgh, studying English literature, philosophy and Celtic. After graduating in 1888, he became the examiner for the MA in Celtic. He then worked in South Uist in 1892, collecting oral Gaelic literature, before travelling to Vienna in 1893 and obtaining his doctorate. On his return in 1896, he studied at Jesus College, Oxford, and obtained a BLitt on Scottish Gaelic dialects. He married in Iffley near Oxford in May 1901 before his ordination as a Church of Scotland minister in June 1901. He served the parish of Eddrachillis, Sutherland, until 1906 when he was appointed as a lecturer in Celtic at the University of Glasgow. He had in the interim obtained a collection of Gaelic folksongs and tunes from the Isle of Skye, collected by Frances Tolmie, and these were published by the Folksong Society in 1911 upon his recommendation. He was an admirer of the work of John Francis Campbell and after Campbells' death in 1885 Henderson started working on Campbells unfinished book The Celtic Dragon Myth, eventually published in 1911.The Celtic Dragon Myth Henderson contributed some translation work, provided an extensively detailed introduction, and completed the editing of the manuscript for its eventual publication.

After his initial years in Goa he moved to Tamil Nadu where he mastered Tamil and wrote several books including a dictionary. He is considered to be the first European Tamil scholar. He strongly believed that books of religious doctrines should be in local languages and to this end he wrote books in Tamil. His efforts made Tamil the first non-European language to be printed in moveable type. Hence he is sometimes called The Father of the Tamil Press. After his death his mortal remains were buried in Our Lady of Snows Basilica in Tuticorin, India. Early life Henriques was born in 1520 in Vila Vi√ßosa, Portugal. He joined the Franciscan order but had to leave as he was of Jewish ancestry. He later studied Canon Law at the University of Coimbra till 1545.Padre Henrique Henriques, the Father of the Tamil Press He entered the newly founded Society of Jesus on 7 October 1545, in Coimbra (Portugal) and departed for India in 1546.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions p. 288 Missionary in India Henriques initially lived in Goa until 1557 and then moved to the Pearl Fishery Coast or Tuticorin, under orders of St. Francis Xavier, where he worked as a missionary from 1547 to 1549. In 1549, after the death of Antonio Criminali, he was elected superior of this mission, a post which he held till 1576. His progress in the development of the community and his concerns about the problems in the mission are explicit from the regular reports he wrote to his Superior General. Printing in India Henriques strongly felt that the mission could only be successful through the use of local languages. To this end he arranged for the printing of books on Christian doctrine in Tamil. Apart from being the first to produce a Tamil-Portuguese Dictionary, he set up the first Tamil press and printed books in Tamil script. The first such book printed in Tamil script was Thambiran Vanakkam (‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç) (1578), a 16-page translation of the Portuguese \\"Doctrina Christam\\", printed at Quilon(Kollam).

Before this 'Cartilha', a Tamil prayer book printed using Latin script, was printed in Lisbon by command of the Portuguese king and financed by the ParavarsParavar (Wikipedia article) of Tuticorin who also helped with scholarly assistance. He also printed Flos Sanctorum in Tamil (1586). This book contains the lives of Saints.

Early years Fiammetta was born in Kaneohe, Hawaii to parents Vince and Esther Fiammetta. He was raised in Walkersville, Maryland where he attended Walkersville High School. There, he competed in football and lacrosse all four years, and wrestling for one year. In football, he was a starter at running back. As a senior, he played in just one game before breaking his leg. In that game he recorded 144 yards and three touchdowns on 19 carries. During his high school career, he recorded 499 yards and 12 touchdowns on 60 carries. SuperPrep named Fiammetta the 25th-ranked prospect in the Mid-Atlantic. PrepStar named him a 2003 All- East Region player. College career Fiammetta accepted a football scholarship from Syracuse University. As a redshirt freshman in 2005, he played in ten games, mostly in a special teams role and did not recorded offense stats. As a sophomore in 2006, he saw action in all 12 games and had eight carries for 15 yards.

They described him as an excellent blocker, but with limited ball-carrying experience. NFL Draft Scout rated had him as the number-one fullback out of 87 prospective draft picks. He had the most bench reps at the combine by a back with 30 and posted impressive overall numbers for his position. =Carolina Panthers= Fiammetta was selected in the 4th round (128th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. As a rookie, he was a backup at fullback behind Brad Hoover. In 2010, he appeared in 14 games with 9 starts at fullback. On December 31, he was placed on the injured reserve list, with a left ankle injury that he suffered in the fifteenth game against the Arizona Cardinals. In 2011, he suffered a concussion in the preseason opener against the New York Giants. On September 3, he was waived after not being able to practice following his injury and the Panthers claiming fullback Jerome Felton. =Dallas Cowboys= On September 4, 2011, he was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys. He was waived on September 7, to make room for Laurent Robinson. He was re-signed on September 13 and went on to become a difference-making lead blocker for running back DeMarco Murray.

Most of the homes on this street are quite close to the sidewalk, since the hill drops away from the street and towards the lake very quickly, but Wright's entryway for the Hardy house is literally at the line of the sidewalk. The house is considered by some to be one of Wright's classics.

Retrieved: 27 January 2009. Nottely Dam was named for the Nottely River. The river itself was named after the Cherokee village of Naduhli, which was once situated along its banks.

Location The Nottely River, which rises near the Union-Lumpkin county line, flows northward across Union County before crossing into North Carolina en route to its mouth along the Hiwassee River. Nottely Dam is located upstream from the Nottely's mouth, just south of the Georgia-North Carolina state line. Nottely Lake stretches southward for along the Nottely to Blairsville, Georgia. Both the dam and reservoir are surrounded by the Chattahoochee National Forest. Capacity Nottely Dam is an earth-and-rock dam high and long. The dam's spillway is a concrete overflow \\"ski-jump\\" type situated adjacent to the dam and has a maximum discharge of . The dam utilizes a concrete intake tower (connected via footbridge to the mainland), where water is diverted into a tunnel and carried downstream. The lone generator at Nottely has a generating capacity of 15,000 kilowatts. Nottely Lake has a flood storage capacity of , of water surface, and of shoreline. Background and construction TVA's design plan for Nottely Dam, circa 1941 Before the completion of Nottely Dam, the upper Nottely River was a rugged gorge with several excellent potential sites for a hydroelectric dam. Several private entities--most notably the Southern States Power Company and Union Power Company--had bought up land along the river for future dam projects, but nothing ever materialized. After its creation in 1933, the Tennessee Valley Authority conducted an extensive survey of the Hiwassee watershed--which had been determined to be a major contributor to flooding in Chattanooga--and in 1940 completed Hiwassee Dam (a few miles downstream from the mouth of the Nottely). The outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1941 brought an emergency demand for electricity, which was needed to power aluminum production operations in East Tennessee. Nottely Dam (identified as the \\"Thompson Canyon site\\" in early reports), along with several other dam projects in the area, was authorized July 16, 1941. Work on the dam began the following day. Nottely Dam, shortly after construction in the 1940s The construction of Nottely Dam required the purchase of of land (most of it from Southern States Power and Union Power), of which had to be cleared. 91 families and of roads had to be relocated. The dam was initially built solely for flood storage, but was designed so that a generator could easily be added should the need for one arise. The dam was formed by building a rock and stone \\"crib\\" and lining the middle with earthen fill. The dam was built as quickly as possible in hopes of allowing its reservoir ample time to fill during the rainy winter months. The speed of its construction was aided by the use of rock-and-fill rather than concrete (the spillway was the only major section that required concrete) and the dam's relatively simple design, which was also employed at nearby Chatuge Dam. Since Nottely's reservoir would fill slowly and create mosquito-breeding environments, various precautions were taken to prevent malaria outbreaks. Nottely Dam was completed and its gates closed January 24, 1942. The project's final cost was just over $8 million. Throughout its early years, Nottely Dam was operated in conjunction with Hiwassee Dam and Chatuge Dam to allow maximum hydroelectric production at Hiwassee Dam. Nottely was outfitted with its own generator in the 1950s. ReferencesExternal links *Nottely Reservoir -- official TVA site *Nottely Dam. -- South View TVA Rd.

The purpose of Data Privacy Day is to raise awareness and promote privacy and data protection best practices. It is currently observed in the United States, Canada, Israel and 47 European countries. Data Privacy Day's educational initiative originally focused on raising awareness among businesses as well as users about the importance of protecting the privacy of their personal information online, particularly in the context of social networking. The educational focus has expanded over the past four years to include families, consumers and businesses. In addition to its educational initiative, Data Privacy Day promotes events and activities that stimulate the development of technology tools that promote individual control over personally identifiable information; encourage compliance with privacy laws and regulations; and create dialogues among stakeholders interested in advancing data protection and privacy. The international celebration offers many opportunities for collaboration among governments, industry, academia, nonprofits, privacy professionals and educators. The Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data was opened for signature by the Council of Europe on January 28, 1981. This convention is currently in the process of being updated in order to reflect new legal challenges caused by technological development. The Convention on Cybercrime is also protecting the integrity of data systems and thus of privacy in cyberspace. Privacy including data protection is also protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The day was initiated by the Council of Europe to be first held in 2007 as the European Data Protection Day. Two years later, on January 26, 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed House Resolution HR 31 by a vote of 402‚Äì0, declaring January 28 National Data Privacy Day.H.Res.31 Expressing support for the designation of January 28, 2009 as \\"National Data Privacy Day\\" On January 28, 2009, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 25 also recognizing January 28, 2009 as National Data Privacy Day.

Its newer name reflects its international scope, and currently it has over 8000 members spread over 110 countries. The laparoscope, a form of endoscope, often allows surgery to be done with smaller incisions and faster recovery (that is, in a minimally invasive way) compared with older open techniques. Vision AAGL was established with the goal of serving women with the best medical procedure related to Women's Health. Since inception the society has held dialogues, discussed and shared views on minimally invasive procedures. Meetings AAGL provides a number of Continuing Medical Education (CME) events to its members throughout the year, including the AAGL Global Congress on Minimally Invasive Gynecology held each November. Publications AAGL publishes the advancements in gynecologic laparoscopy and other conference proceedings in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, a part of AAGL.

Debate * Hysterectomy:In January 2014, there was a debate in relation to a Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy procedure called Uterine Morcellation. Morcellation involves using of a powered device to grind the tumor/fibroid into smaller pieces. The pieces are later removed through small incisions. The in house editors at Lancet Oncology had stated the use of morcellation to pose risks ten times higher to normal surgery. However, many doctors & members of other societies have defended the procedure by stating the risks to be 1-in-400 to 1-in-1000. The message board of AAGL had been the forefront of the debate till association decided to call off the debate because of the controversy. As per the leader of AAGL, they were preparing a paper investigating the risks in relation hysterectomy.

For reservations about this identification, see He was called to the bar in 1657. Details of his legal practice are unknown until his rapid promotion in April 1686, when he became a serjeant-at-law and was then appointed as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas and knighted. He was soon asked his opinion of the decision in Godden v Hales that the king could dispense with compliance with Acts of Parliament, and he agreed with the majority view that this was permitted. He was transferred to the Court of King's Bench in 1687. In that court, he was one of the judges who imposed a fine of ¬£30,000 upon the Earl of Devonshire, and was the presiding judge at the trial of the Seven Bishops for seditious libel. At this trial, he was opposed to the king's power to suspend laws in ecclesiastical matters, taking the view that there would be no parliament if this was allowed. As a result, he was sidelined after the trial ended in July 1688, returning to the post of a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1689 after the Glorious Revolution. He was summonsed to the House of Lords to explain the fine imposed on the Earl of Devonshire, which was said to be a violation of the principles of Magna Carta and of the privileges of the peers. He asked the pardon of the House, saying that he had been misled by some books that he looked upon as authorities.

(SIC Code 3672).https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.display?id=828&tab;=description PCC provided its products to companies in the electronics, instrumentation, medical, telecommunication, and automotive industries.http://www.p2pays.org/ref/05/04837.pdf The majority of the boards produced were multilayer (4, 6, 8, or 10-layer). In 1995, the environmental advances made by the firm were highlighted in a joint study by The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute in conjunction with the University of Massachusetts Lowell. In 2001, PCC was featured on an ABC-TV business news show called Business Now. The show featured the technology that the company used and the management disciplines that allowed it to compete effectively in the world PWB market. Peter Sarmanian was the founder and CEO of Printed Circuit Corporation. Sarmanian's contributions to the PWB industry as a whole have been recognized by the IPC on an annual basis.http://www.pcb007.com/pages/zone.cgi?a=47376&artpg;=1 Company history Peter Sarmanian started Printed Circuit Corporation in 1961 during the early days of the computer industry. Sarmanian was pursuing an undergraduate technical degree at Northeastern University after having returned from service in the Korean War.HighBeam His first significant production contracts were to manufacture printed circuit boards for the technology innovators of the 1960s - early minicomputer companies like RCA Computer Systems, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Data General Corporation. Sarmanian was a pioneer in the electro-chemical production of printed circuit boards. The new process offered far greater reliability for the printed circuit boards and far higher density (chips and circuitry per square inch) for packaging components.http://www.allbusiness.com/technology/computer- hardware/832494-1.html When Sarmanian launched the company, most computer and electronics manufacturers were fabricating their own boards. Independent suppliers, however, became increasingly efficient and were proving a more cost-effective solution for a broad range of printed circuit board applications. Likewise, computer and electronics manufacturers became more comfortable using suppliers for key electronic components, including printed circuit boards. Reductions in time to market, engineering/prototyping costs, and manufacturing ramp-up costs were being demonstrated by these suppliers to win business. In 1979, 40% of all rigid printed circuit board fabrication was being outsourced to suppliers like PCC. By 1989, that figure was about 60%, and by 1995, 80%. By 2001, 98% of all printed circuit board production was going to external suppliers. Industry analysts placed total bookings for printed circuit board production worldwide at approximately $30 billion in 2000, with the US market comprising about a third of that dollar volume. Sarmanian built a profitable company with approximately $30 million a year in revenue at its peak in 2000, and a fabrication plant on Route 128 outside of Boston.http://massachusetts.homefacts.com/WOBURN/epa/PRINTED-CIRCUIT-CORP.html At the time, he had 240 employees working two full shifts a day, and sometimes, another half shift for limited production of new prototype boards. Sarmanian died in July 2001 following a bout with cancer.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:2qSpMZh44WcJ:www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-81217159.html+%22printed+circuit+corp%22+woburn&cd;=8&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us&ie;=UTF-8&client;=firefox-a The company filed for reorganization shortly thereafter, then was acquired by Manchester, NH-based fabricator Electropac in October 2002.http://www.pcb007.com/pages/zone.cgi?a=40861&artpg;=5&topic;=0 Printed Circuit Corporation's business approach PCC had traditionally operated in the mid-range segment, providing boards to New England-based minicomputer companies. Sarmanian bought state-of-the-art equipment to keep pace with the industry, but he always did it as a follower. At the beginning of the 1980s, Sarmanian saw that volumes in the low-end were beginning to explode and decided to diversify. By 1995, only 50% of PCC's revenues came from its traditional mid-range customers; the other 50% came from low-end consumer electronics manufacturers. By 1995 his company was a $20 million a year business. However, this low-end high-volume strategy got the company into financial trouble when the market for video game cartridges for the Atari and Intellivision systems collapsed. By the early 1980s, offshore manufacturers had started low complexity, high volume fabrication. By the end of the decade, they dominated it. In this semi-automated, high volume process, the offshore producers were able to quote substantially lower prices due to cheap labor. By 1995, the consumer electronics manufacturers had moved virtually all their business to Asian fabricators. Because of this foray into the low-end, by 1995 PCC's profits had declined 90%. New management was brought in during 1996 and 1997 to help turn the company around. New management shed the unprofitable low-end business to refocus on the mid- range, more technologically complex segment of the market. These changes were made in time to capture some explosive growth. Historically, the PCB market had grown about 6% a year, but from 1995-2000 it grew at 10%. By 2000, the company's sales had increased to $30 million. Laser drilling, better solder masking for finishing printed circuitry, and semi-automated systems for electrical testing of finished boards were the major improvements needed to get to industry parity. PCC named Glen Kashgegian president and COO in 2000. In June 2001, Printed Circuit Corp. acquired the circuit board fabrication business of CPC in Randolph, MA. The End of PCC Amid the tech recession of 2001‚Äì03, the company failed to adjust as customers migrated to lower cost products from China, and filed for reorganization in September 2002. The company then was acquired by Manchester, NH-based fabricator Electropac in October 2002. Ultimately, as the North American Printed Circuit market continued to shrink and consolidate, Electropac closed their business and sold certain assets to another competitor, located in Nashua NH, named Mass Design. Environmental Battles In 1990, the company was fined $407,835 for allegedly violating state sewer regulations 60 times over two years and ignoring orders to stop. The penalty was the third-largest in the history of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority at the time.HighBeam References Companies based in Massachusetts Defunct semiconductor companies of the United States Electronics companies established in 1961 Electronics companies disestablished in 2002 1961 establishments in Massachusetts 2002 disestablishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Printed Circuit Corporation"},{"id":"21287174","text":"A trap line is used by some orb weaver spiders as a mechanism to alert them of a newly captured prey in their web.World Book Encyclopedia, 1972.

He was responsible for a religious revival among Sephardic Jews with his founding of Ma'ayan HaChinuch HaTorani, a network of Torah schools for Sephardic children in Israel, and was widely known for his ability to give blessings that were fulfilled. Early life Ben Zion Abba Shaul was born in Jerusalem to Eliyahu and Benaya Abba Shaul, immigrants from Iran. A shoemaker by trade, Eliyahu was also a Torah scholar and kabbalist; he was Ben Zion's first teacher. Eliyahu served as gabbai (caretaker and fundraiser) for the Ohel Rachel synagogue in the Bukharim Quarter of Jerusalem for 50 years. In his old age, his son Ben Zion became the rabbi of the synagogue and another son, Yaakov, became the hazzan. Abba Shaul was the eldest boy in a family of sixteen children. Despite their poverty, his parents were committed to raising a family of Torah scholars, even as many other families from Oriental and Sephardi backgrounds were lured into sending their children to Zionist schools. The family kept many halakhic stringencies, including grinding and baking their own matzot before Passover and avoiding all processed foods -- even sugar -- during the holiday itself. Abba Shaul continued to keep these stringencies even after he established his own family.Sutton, Rabbi David (2002). Hacham Ben Sion Abba Shaul. Printed in Torah Leaders: A treasury of biographical sketches. Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah Publications, pp. 178-194. At the age of 11, Abba Shaul entered Porat Yosef, the pre-eminent Sephardic yeshiva in Jerusalem. His first teacher was Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka (who was only 21 at the time) and his classmates included the future Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef. Later, Abba Shaul advanced to the highest shiur, taught by the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Ezra Attiya, with whom he developed a close bond. Abba Shaul abided by his rosh yeshiva's opinions on all matters and displayed the same approach to learning and to issuing halakhic directives as his mentor. Torah scholar Abba Shaul displayed great dedication to Torah study. He learned and reviewed each subject dozens of times until he knew most of Shas and poskim (halakhic commentaries) by heart. When Abba Shaul was 20 years old, Attiya selected him to be tested by Rabbi Eliezer Silver, a prominent American rabbi who was visiting Israel together with a prospective donor. Attiya had heard that in another yeshiva which this philanthropist had visited, only one boy was able to answer the rabbi's question, and only after 20 minutes. Silver asked Abba Shaul a difficult question in the obscure Talmudic order of Tohorot (laws of ritual purity). When Abba Shaul gave his answer, Silver remarked in astonishment that he had asked the same question of Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk (author of Ohr Sameach and Meschech Chochma) 40 years earlier, and that that sage had given the same answer. Abba Shaul later confided to Attiya that he had had a second answer to the question as well, but since the first answer secured the donation, he didn't want to show off. In 1948, Abba Shaul married Hadassah, the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Shaharbani, a Torah scholar and son of the kabbalist Rabbi Yehoshua Shaharbani, who was a student of the Ben Ish Chai. Abba Shaul studied one-on-one with his father-in- law, and his new wife attended his public lectures every Shabbat. She also tape-recorded his general lecture at the yeshiva; many of his written works come from those tapes. The couple was childless for many years. After ten miscarriages, Abba Shaul visited the Chazon Ish and the Belzer Rebbe, refusing to leave until each gave him a blessing for a child. Their only son, Eliyahu, was named after Abba Shaul's father. After his marriage, Abba Shaul became a teacher at Talmud Torah Bnei Zion, which he had attended in his youth. He continued to study at Porat Yosef Yeshiva. In time, Attiya asked him to serve as rosh yeshiva, but he refused to accept that position as long as his first teacher, Tzadka, was still alive. He did agree to serve as a lecturer at the yeshiva. After Tzadka's death in 1983, Abba Shaul acceded to the position of rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef. Rosh yeshiva In his capacity as rosh yeshiva, Abba Shaul maintained a heavy teaching schedule. For four hours each morning, he lectured to students in the yeshiva; in the afternoons, he taught the laws of Shulchan Aruch to dayanim (rabbinical judges). On Friday afternoons, he gave a halakha class and question-and-answer session to a packed audience in the Ohel Rachel synagogue, and on Shabbat day he delivered a three-hour discourse in the synagogue. His diligence in Torah study was legendary; it is said that when he finished delivering a shiur, he was soaked with perspiration. Abba Shaul was also well-versed in kabbalah. At first he learned privately on Friday nights. In the 1960s, however, seeing that the knowledge of kabbalah study was waning, he gathered a group of kabbalists and founded the Emet VeShalom Yeshiva for learning kabbalah at night. Once a year, on the yahrtzeit of the Rashash, he joined the group and showed his fluency in this esoteric wisdom. He also penned thousands of halakhic responsa in response to queries from the public at large, covering a broad range of topics. Some of his responsa are printed in his sefer, She'eilot U'Teshuvot Ohr LeZion, and he is quoted in the responsa of Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, who remained his good friend. Communal activities Abba Shaul cared about his students as a father for his sons. He tried to make sure that all his students married; his rebbetzin would suggest shidduchim from the many girls who helped her in her house. Seeing that married students were unable to manage on a kollel stipend, he established a special Friday kollel and traveled to the United States to raise money for it. Abba Shaul helped to launch a religious revival among Sephardi Jews in Israel as the founder of Ma'ayan HaChinuch HaTorani, a network of Sephardi schools which is the equivalent of Chinuch Atzmai. He promised to fund the first year of operation for any Talmud Torah that was opened in a city that did not already have one. He also worked to strengthen Sephardi communities in other countries. He traveled to England, France, Italy, Iran, Mexico, Panama, Colombia and the United States to establish rabbinical courts and to arrange for shochtim (ritual slaughterers), mohelim (ritual circumcisers), and rabbis. Abba Shaul joined other Torah leaders in Israel to fight against edicts that threatened the Torah way of life. These included the battle to preserve the sanctity of Shabbat, the fight to close mixed-sex swimming pools, and the battle against autopsies for religious individuals. In 1972, he assumed a prominent stand in opposition to the government's proposal of mandatory army service for girls. Together with Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka, he drafted a halakhic ruling which stated that mandatory army service for girls was in the category of yehareg ve'al yaavor (\\"be killed and do not transgress\\"). The text of his ruling was signed by 400 Torah leaders throughout Israel. Giver of blessings He was also known for giving blessings that were fulfilled. Once a woman who had had three Caesarean sections was told that her next child would be born by Caesarean as well. She went to Abba Shaul and demanded, \\"I won't leave until the Rav guarantees me that I'll have a natural birth.\\" He agreed. After the woman left, Abba Shaul's brother asked him, \\"How can you guarantee that?\\" \\"I can't guarantee anything,\\" he replied, \\"but what should I do? She wouldn't leave!\\" Sure enough, the woman had a natural birth. When her husband came to the synagogue to announce the \\"miracle,\\" Abba Shaul complained, \\"They are making me into an Admor!\\" When his shamash (assistant) asked him why his blessings were always effective, he replied, \\"If you love everyone in Klal Yisrael, you can do it, too.\\" To someone else, he explained, \\"God told Abraham, 'I will bless those who bless you.' When people come to me, they kiss my hand. They are blessing me. If someone blesses a Jew, they are blessed in return.\\" Illness and death In 1983, while delivering a eulogy at the funeral of Rabbi Yaakov Mutzafi, he suddenly felt ill and suffered a stroke a short while later. Half his body was paralyzed and his speech was slurred. Over the next 15 years, he suffered a series of mini-strokes that eventually made him a wheelchair user. Nevertheless, he continued to teach Torah and to involve himself in community affairs. His vast knowledge from years of learning became evident in his later years. As his eyesight dimmed, he asked students to come and to read the Talmud to him. One boy recalled being corrected on a Rashi in the tractate of Nazir; another on a Tosafot in Gittin. His son said that Abba Shaul corrected him while he read the words of the Rambam to him. He died in Jerusalem on 13 July 1998 (19 Tammuz 5758). An estimated 200,000 people of all denominations -- Sephardic, Hasidic, Ashkenazic -- attended his funeral. He and his wife are buried in the Sanhedria Cemetery in Jerusalem. He is survived by his only son, Eliyahu, who is rosh yeshiva of Ohr LeZion Yeshiva in Jerusalem.

It reportedly supported one of the largest wading bird rookeries in South Florida. The first documented inhabitant of Munyon Island in 1884, was a man named Rodgers who was known to be an eccentric \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" type who lived in a tent and made his living by selling green sea turtles which he caught in Lake Worth. The next inhabitants were the Pitts family, who bought the island in 1892 and built a two-story house. In 1901, the Pitts sold the island to Dr. James M. Munyon. In 1903, Munyon completed construction of the Hotel Hygeia. Named after the Greek goddess of Health, the five story, twenty- one room, eight bath hotel catered to ailing, wealthy Northerners who came to Palm Beach to recuperate on the tropical Island and drink of \\"Dr. Munyon's Paw-Paw Elixir\\", consisting primarily of fermented papaya juice, which he bottled on the island. The hotel burned to the ground in 1917 and from that time the island has remained largely uninhabited. The island was acquired by John D. MacArthur in 1955 and by the State of Florida in 1981.

MacArthur Beach State Park and the park also has a kayak launch. The launch is no longer accessible from the west side due to lack of maintenance of wooden bridge and storm damage. Kayakers must be attentive to the tide, during low tide the estuary becomes an impassable mud flat. The island has no bathrooms, but it does have picnic tables and grills. Wildlife Wildlife on and around Munyon Island includes blue sea grass, great blue heron, and little blue heron. The waters contain mojarras, sardines, mullet, pinfish, and snapper.

Florey learned to diagram sentences as a Catholic school student at St. John the Baptist Academy in Syracuse, New York. Diagramming sentences is useful, Florey says, because it teaches us to \\"focus on the structures and patterns of language, and this can help us appreciate it as more than just a vehicle for expressing minimal ideas\\". Florey said in a 2012 essay \\"Taming Sentences\\": > When we unscrew a sentence, figure out what makes it tick and reassemble it, > we interact with our old familiar language differently, more deeply, > responding to the way its individual components fit together. Once we > understand how sentences work (what‚Äôs going on? what action is taking place? > who is doing it and to whom is it being done?), it‚Äôs harder to write an > incorrect one. Sentence diagramming was introduced by Brainerd Kellogg and Alonzo Reid, professors at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, in their book History of English published in 1877. Reception Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Charles Harrington Elster calls the book a \\"pleasantly discursive and affectionate tribute to an antiquated art\\" in which Florey explains the concept and history of sentence diagramming with sentences by Lewis Carroll, Woody Allen, Henry James, Marcel Proust, Mark Twain, and William Faulkner. Publishers Weekly says Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog is \\"part memoir, part literary gossip, but mostly a guide to the lost art of sentence diagramming\\" which \\"hilariously ... answers such questions as, Why did Gertrude Stein hate commas?

It is believed to have linked the Rhine delta with the Lake Flevo, (today's IJsselmeer). They facilitated troop transport to the north, avoiding the need to cross the open North Sea. This was of strategic importance for attacks on the Germanic people living on the Frisian coasts and along the Elbe estuary in the German Bight. Drusus' son Germanicus used the canals dug by his father's army in a military campaign some decades later. The canals are mentioned by Roman historians who lived two centuries later. One of them is Suetonius who is referring to it in his VITA DIVI CLAUDI The exact location of the canals are unknown and it is the subject of debate by modern historians, archaeologists and geologists. It may have been located inland along the valley of the river IJssel (not yet a distributary of the Rhine branch in Roman times). Alternatively it may have been closer to the coast in the lagoon area north of Utrecht (one of many Roman border posts) connecting lagoon lakes and local branches of the Rhine delta.

In home aquaria, size constraints mean that only the smallest sharks are typically viable as pets. Public aquaria Until recently only a few benthic species of shark, such as horn sharks, leopard sharks, catsharks, and zebra sharks, had survived in aquarium conditions for up to a year or more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. A better knowledge of sharks has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) being able to be kept for far longer. At the same time, transportation techniques have improved and long distance movement of sharks is becoming easier. Several attempts to keep a great white shark in captivity have been attempted, but most specimens died or had to be released after a short time. One example, placed in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in Japan, only survived for three days. The longest a great white was held in captivity was at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, in September 2004. A young female was kept in an outdoor tank for 198 days before releasing her back into the wild. In the following years, the Monterey Bay Aquarium hosted five more juvenile white sharks for temporary stays before ending their program in 2011. =Behavior= When introduced to their new habitat some mature sharks have refused food despite the abundance and variety of feeding methods used.Essapian, F. (1962). Notes on the Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Copeia, 1962(2), 457-459. doi:10.2307/1440936 Over a period of years this results in sharks dying of starvation amidst plenty. Sharks are usually seen to live a solitary existence, rarely moving about in group events, although, a tank could house up to four or five species during the same time period. It has been commonly seen that lemon and nurse sharks occupy the bottom of the tank floor. Occasionally, they will take a swim no more than two or three feet off the bottom. Bull sharks, sandbar sharks, and sand tiger sharks continuously swim at mid-depth. Larger tiger sharks inhabit the upper region of the tank where their dorsal fin is breaking the surface frequently. Swimming patterns seen from sharks in captivity are that of blacktip, bull, and lemon sharks being active 24 hours and those of sandbars, nurse and sand tigers being active at certain times of the day/night.Hussain, S. M. (1991). The Behavior of Sharks in Captivity. Indian Journal of Fishtrits. Retrieved April 30, 2018. However, within some aquaria's this could be attributed to the different feeding times of these species. In captivity, sandbar, sand tiger, and nurse sharks are predicted to be less aggressive in that no aggressive biting is seen after feeding.Flunory, M., Ortiz, M., & Restrepo, A. (n.d.). A Behavioral Study of Sharks in Captivity. Retrieved April 30, 2018. The foremost behavior observed from those in captivity was curiosity, reasoning's being due to less competition for food and lack of stimulation. Home aquaria Most species of shark are not suitable for domestic aquaria and not every species of shark sold by pet stores make good inhabitants for personal aquaria. Some species of sharks can also be kept well in home saltwater aquaria. Uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark, which upon reaching adulthood will have far outgrown typical home aquaria. Public aquaria are generally not interested in accepting donated specimens that have overgrown their housing and some shark owners have been tempted to release them into the wild. =Housings= However, some species of shark can make prized additions to home aquaria. Species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet and can live up to 25 years. Sharks must be housed in aquaria at or exceeding 180 gallons in volume, with more active species requiring more space. Surface area is an even more significant consideration for aquarists than volume as it is the determining factor for the amount of oxygen that ends up being dissolved in the water, and therefore critical to the sharks' respiration. Choice of aquarium substrate is also important because a sharp, rough bed can irritate a shark's soft underbelly, or in severe cases lead to fatal infections. Shark aquaria are generally advised to be decorated \\"conservatively\\" in order to leave space for the animal to move more freely during daily activities. A cave, however, is often an appropriate addition for some shy species. =Diet and nutrition= Sharks are very frequently overfed by amateur aquarists, which can lead to obesity or unnaturally fast growth rates. Captive sharks are healthiest when fed at levels similar to their food intake in the wild. Usually this amounts to 1-3% of their body weight weekly. However, aquarium conditions and species disposition are considered by conscientious aquarists when feeding captive sharks. Relatively sedentary species, such as wobbegongs can live on feedings occurring once or twice weekly. More active species may require to be fed three or four times per week to maintain satisfactory health. Sharks living in cooler water temperatures have slower metabolisms than sharks in warmer water housings and therefore require less food. The most common staple food provided to captive sharks in home aquaria is frozen fish. The freezing process used to store foods for sharks often results in the food items losing nutrient value. Lost nutrients are replaced by vitamin supplements, which are marketed commercially, sometimes by companies generally associated with more typical pet foods (such as Purina Mills). Uncorrected nutrient deficiencies inherent in the frozen food diet can cause considerable detriment to the health of captive specimens. Conditions such as popeye, ascites, and anemia are known to occur in captive sharks that are deficient in some essential vitamin. Vitamin B deficiency results in a treatable condition where the shark's back arches and it swims in a circular motion. Feeding sharks frozen non-marine fish can result in deficiencies of omega-3 fatty acids, which can result in \\"fat infiltration of the liver,\\" which can impede the organ's function seriously enough for major health issues. =In community tanks= Sometimes sharks are unwittingly put in harm's way when aquarists include potentially dangerous tankmates in the same aquarium. Hobbyists generally don't think of other fish being a threat to sharks, but triggerfish, angel fish, puffers, and wrasses can all injure them. A large grouper is capable of consuming smaller sharks. Sometimes docile bottom feeding sharks are put at risk because of the fish that feed on the ocean bottom, sedentary sharks are simply an extension of the substrate.\\" Another problem aquarists keeping sharks with other types of fish have encountered is that the smaller, more passive aquarium-friendly shark species often have difficulty competing with their tankmates for the food provided by the aquarist. Sharks are predatory themselves and may maul or consume tankmates smaller or weaker than themselves.

Characteristics The term is not precise, but typically refers to topography where the peaks rise at least to above the surrounding terrain (as opposed to above sea level). The summits usually do not reach the tree line and were not glaciated after the last glacial period. In contrast, Hochgebirge is used to refer to mountain ranges rising above approximately to . The delineation corresponds with the differentation between Montane and Alpine level according to altitudinal zonation. Mittelgebirge ranges In the plural, die Mittelgebirge (as opposed to the singular, das Mittelgebirge), sometimes qualified as die deutschen Mittelgebirge, usually refers to the Central Uplands of Germany which is a belt of low mountain ranges or hills between the Northern Lowland and the Bavarian Alpine Foreland.Dickinson, Robert E (1964). Germany: A regional and economic geography (2nd ed.). London: Methuen, p. 18 ff. . The ranges stretch from the North German Plain up to the Alps in the south. The northern limitation is marked by the Mittelgebirge threshold (Mittelgebirgsschwelle), running from the Belgian Ardennes in the west along the Rhenish Massif, the Rh√∂n and Harz Mountains, the Thuringian Forest and the Fichtel Mountains to the Bohemian Massif on the Czech border, including the Bavarian Forest and the Ore Mountains, leading to the Bohemian Forest and to the Sudetes in the east. In the southwest, the Upper Rhine Plain stretches up to the Swiss border at Basel, accompanied by the South German Scarplands including the Odenwald range and the Black Forest, as well as the Swabian Jura and its eastern continuation, the Franconian Jura. Left of the Upper Rhine, the North French Scarplands reach from the Palatinate and the Vosges Mountains down to the Paris Basin. View over the Jura Mountains near Passwang Pass to the Black Forest Along the Swiss-French border run the Jura Mountains, a fold mountain range reaching up to , separated from the western Alps by the Swiss Plateau. Though located within the Alpine foothills, the Jura Mountains are usually considered a separate Mittelgebirge range, while the Kras Plateau, leading to the Dinarides, geologically forms a part of the Southern Alps. In Hungary, the Transdanubian Mountains form an extended Mittelgebirge range within the Pannonian Basin. Stretching from Lake Balaton to north of Budapest, marked by the Danube Bend, it separates the Little and Great Hungarian Plain. In France, the Massif Central, located between the Western Alps and the Pyrenees, even climbs to but does not reach the tree line due to its Mediterranean climate. In Italy, most parts of the Apennine Mountains running from the Maritime Alps down to the Strait of Messina are shaped by its Mittelgebirge character, though in Abruzzo peaks are up to high. In Britain well-known examples include the pikes of the Lake District, the Pennines, the Scottish Highlands and the Snowdon Massif, in Ireland the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, in the United States some ranges of the Appalachians, such as the Green Mountains (Vermont).

The center is located in a former resort complex, complete with swimming pools, and other recreational facilities. The Mohammed bin Nayef Counseling and Care Center is based in Riyadh. Saudi Prince Muhammad bin Nayef bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, son of a deputy prime minister, and a deputy minister for security, had played a role in setting up the program in 2007 after a series of terrorist attacks including bombings and kidnapping.  Program goals  Suspected terrorists currently enrolled in the program have either been caught by the Saudi security forces, surrendered themselves or are Guantanamo detainees. In June 2017, Mohammed bin Salman took over the leadership of the program. Detainees spend up to 6 months at the center, however if there are no clear signs of reform after 3 months, they are sent back to prison and answer to the judicial system. Guantanamo detainees undergo a specific program that lasts around 18 months due to the psychological trauma they experienced and the fact that they may represent a security threat. Determining whether former extremists are suitable for release is the responsibility of the Saudi Ministry of Interior and its security forces personnel. A condition of release is placing former detainees under a monitoring system similar to parole or probation. Many released detainees remain under constant surveillance.  Rehabilitation program  The core of the program is to return extremists to the \\"true Islam.\\" The program employs intensive religious instruction by deconstructing extremists‚Äô interpretation of the Holy Qur'an. Following rigorous debate, Islamic scholars and clerics, many employed by Saudi Arabia's universities, establish a foundation for different interpretation that brings extremists back in line to the true meaning of Islam. Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation program is modeled after a similar program implemented in Egypt in the 1990s. Indonesia and Singapore, in turn, established rehabilitation programs based on the Saudi Arabian model. Program discussions focus on (military and personal struggles), (unbelievers), (allegiance) and (loyalty to the Muslim community).  Program results  As of 2017, the program claimed to have treated over 3,300 men convicted of terrorism-related crimes with an 86% success rate. This success rate is measured by the number of men who did not return to jihad for at least 10 years after graduating from the center's program. In its initial years the program was described as successful. Commentators suggested other countries, like Yemen, should run similar rehabilitation programs. One of the first graduates of the program, Khalid Al Hubayshi, continues to be cited as the model of a successful graduate of the program. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown toured the facility on November 2, 2008, and spoke with several former Guantananmo captives. Brown is reported to have spoken with Ghanim Abdul Rahman Al Harbi and Juma al Dossari. The Saudis had claimed 100% success rate until 2009. Yusef Abdullah Saleh Al Rabiesh, a former Guantanamo captive who went through the rehabilitation program, went on record to express his gratitude to the prince, and to warn his countrymen against being influenced by extremists. On February 4, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Saudi authorities had listed eleven former Guantanamo captives who attended the Rehabilitation Center on a list of 85 most wanted terrorist suspects. In June 2010, the Saudi Ministry of Interior determined that 25 of the 120 former Guantanamo Bay detainees who graduated the rehabilitation program returned to terrorist activities. 11 of the 25 joined Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen. However, the overall recidivism rate of more than 3,000 program graduates as of 2010 remains about 10 percent. Al-Qaeda had previously announced plans to target a key component of the program, which allows fugitive extremists to voluntarily surrender and become eligible for the program. Al-Qaeda's announcement was intended to challenge Saudi Arabia's official interpretation of Islam by attempting to draw wavering extremists who desire to give up terrorism back into the embrace of Al-Qaeda.\\"Rehabilitation and Deradicalization: Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Counterterrorism Successes and Failures\\" by Rob L. Wagner, University for Peace: Peace and Conflict Monitor, July 31, 2010  Known issues  According to Peter Taylor, the BBC found that the cohort of Saudis repatriated in November 2007 problematic. Taylor called this cohort ¬´batch 10¬ª, and reported that many of these captives were not rehabilitated. Some of these captives arrived before the rehabilitation center was opened. In January 2009, two former Guantanamo captives released a threatening video online. Following the release of the video Saudi authorities took nine other former captives back into custody. The names of the nine re- apprehended men have not been made public. In late August Abdullah Hassan Tali' al-Asiri, a suspected jihadist, who had been named on the February 2009 Saudi most wanted list, said he wanted to meet the prince when he surrendered, turned out to be a suicide bomber. Some security officials were injured, but the prince escaped serious injury, and Al-Asiri was the only fatality. On November 29, 2016, citing the transcript from his Periodic Review Board, Fox News reported, Ghassan Abdullah Al-Sharbi asserted, staff members at the centre had a ‚Äúhidden radicalisation programme‚Äù. However, neither Fox or the other sites that repeated this report, explained why they thought Al-Sharbi could offer inside information about the operation of the rehabilitation program, when he was still in Guantanamo.

Richland had its own elementary and secondary school, which was constructed in the 1920s. In 1959, after much local controversy, Richland was incorporated into the Pekin Community School System. The high schools in Richland, Ollie, Packwood, and Farson were closed, although the buildings associated with them continued to be used for elementary and junior high school students. All the high school students from these four towns, along with all the rural areas which had been associated with these separate school systems, were then educated at a new building located near Pekin. In 1970, a further consolidation eliminated the local junior high schools and replaced them with a consolidated middle school in Packwood: all students in grades six through eight began to go to Packwood, and, thereafter, the Richland school building was used only for elementary students (kindergarten through fifth grade) from Richland and its associated rural areas, including Rubio. Elementary students from elsewhere in the district went to Ollie, and the Farson school was closed. In this consolidation, all middle school students went to Packwood. In 1978, after completion of a new structure adjacent to the Pekin High School building, all students in the district began to go to classes there. The Packwood and Richland school buildings were then closed. Richland's building is the only one of the four local schools to still stand although is in a state of dilapidation and has not been used since May 1978, when the final group of students finished their academic year.

The farm consists of a parcel with several farm buildings, farm fields, woodlands, and wetlands. The farmstead has been in the Hagel family for over 150 years. Its current owner, John Hagel, is a co- founder of the Friends of Minnesota Barns association. John Hagel worked to nominate the farm to the National Register of Historic Places to preserve it as a complete, original farmstead. Susan Roth of Minnesota's State Historic Preservation Office commented, \\"The Hagel farm has extremely high physical integrity. I'm feeling very confident that the board will look approvingly.\\" The farm was listed on the National Register in December 2006. All but one of the original buildings remain intact. The buildings include the farmhouse, a timber-framed mortise and tenon barn with an attached milk house, and a two- story saltbox style granary. The bricks for the farmhouse were believed to have been manufactured in nearby Dayton, Minnesota. The farm had no electricity until 1948; before that, they had kerosene lighting. There was also no refrigeration in the early days. Butter and milk were kept in a pit in the yard until they later acquired an icebox. The farm was originally settled by John Hagel's great-great-grandparents, Peter and Helena Hagel, who immigrated from Germany and settled on January 20, 1858. Around 1890, Peter and Helena divided the farm among their two sons, Fred and Paul. Fred and Gertrude Hagel, John's great-grandparents, built the 117-year-old farmhouse, and his grandfather Arnold and his father Leroy grew up on the farm. Arnold Hagel died in 1951, and his wife Anna Hagel stayed on the farm until she died in 1987. Anna Hagel rented the fields out to other farmers and sold the animals and farm implements. Without the wear and tear of daily farming operations and the need to modernize farming practices, the farm buildings were virtually unchanged since the 1950s. John Hagel could have sold the farmland for suburban development, but was more interested in preserving the farm as a historic site.

Some players participated in amateur senior leagues, eligible to compete for the Allan Cup, representative of the top amateur senior team in Canada. Other players participated in professional senior leagues, not eligible for the Allan Cup competition. The Alexander Cup competition was introduced in 1950, as a bridge between the numerous senior ice hockey leagues. The concept was to create a new \\"open\\" level of mixed competition - for both pros and amateurs - that would be known as \\"Major Senior.\\" The trophy was presented by Viscount Alexander, then Governor-General of Canada. In the first 1950-51 season, senior teams aligned themselves in five superleagues to compete for the Alexander Cup. By the fourth season, the field of competition had dwindled to only one league, the semi-professional Maritime Major Hockey League (MMHL). The MMHL folded after the 1953-54 season. With a diminishing number of senior hockey teams in operation, both amateur and professional, the concept of a \\"Major Senior\\" competition was no longer necessary, and the Alexander Cup was retired after being awarded only four times. In 2006, the Alexander Cup was awarded to the Saint John Scorpions as the 2005-06 champions of the Canadian Elite Hockey League.

The album, \\"Aheym,\\" features four of Dessner's compositions: Tenebre, Little Blue Something, Tour Eiffel, and Aheym. On March 4, 2014 Deutsche Grammophon/Universal Music Classics released \\"St Carolyn By the Sea; Suite from There Will Be Blood.\\" Performed by the Copenhagen Philharmonic and conducted by Andre de Ridder, the album features three of Bryce's orchestral works (St. Carolyn by the Sea, Lachrimae and Raphael) as well as the suite from There Will Be Blood by Jonny Greenwood. May 19, 2015 marked the release on Brassland of Music for Wood and Strings, an album-length work composed by Bryce and performed by S≈ç Percussion on a set of experimental musical instruments Dessner named \\"Chord Sticks\\" and built by Aron Sanchez from Buke and Gase. The instruments function on the 3rd bridge principle, with muting the string attack and let the string resonance swell afterwards. In April 2019 Deutsche Grammophon released the album El Chan featuring an all-Dessner programme performed by Katia and Marielle Lab√®que including Concerto for two pianos, El Chan, and Haven with Dessner on electric guitar. The album is dedicated to Dessner's friend and collaborator, Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, who also designed the album cover. Also in spring 2019 New York's Metropolitan Museum, for one of its first ever contemporary installations, is featuring the song Death is Elsewhere written by Dessner alongside Aaron Dessner, Ragnar Kjartansson, Gyda Valt√Ωsd√≥ttir and Krist√≠n Anna. In January 2012, Bryce signed to Chester Novello Publishing for his concert music. Dessner now resides in Paris and has been increasingly active composing for major European ensembles and soloists. In 2018 Steve Reich named Bryce \\"an important composer with a developed technique and an intense emotional voice. He continues today as a major voice of his generation.\\" =Film scores= Dessner has written the score for the major Netflix film The Two Popes directed by Fernando Meirelles, out in late 2019, recorded with London Contemporary Orchestra at London's Abbey Road Studios. In October 2015, Dessner was tapped along with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto, to compose the score for the Grammy Award-winning director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu film The Revenant (2015). They received a nomination for Best Original Score in the 2016 Golden Globes and a nomination in the 2017 Grammy Awards for Best Score Soundtrack For Visual Media category. Dessner's piece Tour Eiffel was featured in the 2015 Palme d'Or winner Dheepan, directed by Jacques Audiard. Tour Eiffel is performed by the Kronos Quartet and Brooklyn Youth Chorus. Bryce and his brother Aaron Dessner co- composed the score for Transpecos, which won the Audience Award at the 2016 South by Southwest. They also worked together on the score for 2013 film Big Sur, an adaptation of the 1962 novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac. The film debuted on January 23, 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received positive reviews. In 2007, Dessner and Padma Newsome's quartet, Clogs, had their music serve as the soundtrack to the film Turn the River. Collaborations Bryce is a frequent collaborator with many of the most creative and respected artists, such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Alejandro I√±arrit√∫, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, Caroline Shaw, Johnny Greenwood, Bon Iver, Justin Peck, Jennifer Koh, Kelley O'Connor, Ragnar Kjartansson and Nico Muhly. =The Most Incredible Thing= \\"The Most Incredible Thing\\" is a ballet created by Dessner, Justin Peck and Marcel Dzama. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's dark 1870 fairy tale of the same name, the ballet was written for the New York City Ballet and premiered at Lincoln Center in New York on February 2, 2016. The piece was performed throughout the New York City Ballet's 2016 season and was brought to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in March 2016. =Planetarium= \\"Planetarium\\" is a song cycle celebrating the solar system created by Dessner, Nico Muhly, Sufjan Stevens, and James McAlister. The piece was co-commissioned by Muziekegebouw Eindhoven, the Barbican Centre and the Sydney Opera House and had its first run of European shows in March 2012. Planetarium has been performed at the Barbican Centre in London, Muziektheater in Amsterdam, the Sydney Opera House in Australia, Salle Pleyel in Paris and the Brooklyn Academy of Music in April 2013, where it had a four-night run. =The Long Count= \\"The Long Count\\" was a large commission for the BAM Next Wave Festival created by Bryce, Aaron Dessner and visual artist Matthew Ritchie. Together they created a work loosely based on the Mayan creation story 'Popol Vuh' that includes a 12 piece orchestra and four guest singers: Kim Deal, Kelley Deal, Matt Berninger, and Shara Worden. The work had its world premiere on September 11, 2009 at The Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, as part of the Ellnora Festival, and its New York premiere in October 2009 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. It has since been performed at the Holland Festival and the Barbican. Tunde Adebimpe, a member of the band TV on the Radio joined Dessner, Aaron, and Ritchie for the Barbican Centre performance. =Forever Love= Forever Love, a work with renowned Icelandic performance artist Ragnar Kjartansson, is a blending of visual and performance art with live music. The piece is a collaborative song cycle written and performed with Aaron Dessner and Bryce Dessner alongside Icelandic artists Gy√∞a and Krist√≠n Anna Valt√Ωsd√≥ttir, formerly of the Icelandic band m√∫m. It was commissioned by Eaux Claires Festival and made its world premiere in 2015 where it served as the official starting point of the festival on both Friday and Saturday. Forever Love marked a live performance reunion for the Dessner twins and Kjartansson, as both artists had previously collaborated on a six-hour video work, A Lot of Sorrow, which documents The National performing their three and a half minute song, \\"Sorrow,\\" for six hours in front of a live audience at MoMA PS1. =Kronos Quartet= Bryce first crossed paths with Kronos Quartet in 2009 when the ensemble's founder David Harrington approached him about composing a piece for their performance at the Celebrate Brooklyn! festival in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. The piece that Bryce wrote, Aheym, (meaning \\"homeward\\" in Yiddish), was inspired by the stories of his Jewish immigrant grandparents who settled near the park when they arrived in Brooklyn. In 2011, Bryce was commissioned by Kronos Quartet to compose a piece for the Barbican Centre's \\"Reverberations: The Influence of Steve Reich\\" festival in London. That piece, Tenebre, is based on the traditional Holy Week service in which 15 candles are gradually extinguished. Bryce, in his own words, \\"inverts the service\\" drawing the listener from darkness into light. Tenebre premiered May 7, 2011 at LSO St. Luke's and featured the pre-recorded vocals of Sufjan Stevens. Bryce continues to work with Kronos, recently writing and dedicating Little Blue Something (2012) to them. The piece was inspired by the music of Irena and Vojtech Havel, who blend early music with Czech folk music. It was premiered by Kronos on May 31, 2012 at the Ensems Festival in Valencia, Spain. =Day of the Dead= On March 17, 2016 Bryce and Aaron Dessner announced Day of the Dead, a charity tribute album to the Grateful Dead released by 4AD on May 20, 2016. Day of the Dead was created, curated and produced by Bryce and Aaron. The compilation is a wide-ranging tribute to the songwriting and experimentalism of the Dead which took four years to record, features over 60 artists from varied musical backgrounds, 59 tracks and is almost 6 hours long. All profits are helping to fight for AIDS/ HIV and related health issues around the world through the Red Hot Organization. Day of the Dead is the follow up to 2009's Dark Was The Night (4AD), a 32-track, multi-artist compilation also produced by Aaron and Bryce for Red Hot. Day of the Dead features collaborations and recordings from a diverse group of artists including Wilco, Flaming Lips, Bruce Hornsby, Justin Vernon, The National, The War on Drugs, Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo, Jenny Lewis, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Perfume Genius, Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Senegalese collective Orchestra Baobob, composer Terry Riley and his son Gyan Riley, electronic artist Tim Hecker, jazz pianist Vijay Iyer and Bela Fleck. Of the 59 tracks on the compilation, many feature a house band made up of Bryce, Aaron, fellow The National bandmates and brothers Scott and Bryan Devendorf, Josh Kaufman (who co- produced the project), and Conrad Doucette along with Sam Cohen and Walter Martin. The National have a couple of tracks on the album, including \\"Peggy-O,\\" \\"Morning Dew\\" and \\"I Know You Rider.\\" A Day of the Dead live performance took place in August 2016 at the second annual Eaux Claires Festival (August 12‚Äì13) featuring Jenny Lewis, Matthew Houck, Lucius, Will Oldham, Sam Amidon, Richard Reed Parry, Justin Vernon, Bruce Hornsby, Ruban Nielson and The National. =Other collaborations and commissions= Bryce is a frequent collaborator with many of the most creative and renowned musicians working today, such as Philip Glass, Bang on a Can All-Stars, and Glenn Kotche. Dessner served as the musical director for Matthew Ritchie's 'The Morning Line' installation, collaborating with Ritchie and a number of contemporary composers, including Lee Ranaldo and Evan Ziporyn. In 2011, Bryce collaborated with Ritchie again, composing a song entitled \\"To The Sea,\\" which was used for Matthew Ritchie's performance art piece 'Monstrance.' 'Monstrance' was performed in November 2011 on Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California. The performance was accompanied by a multi-media exhibition at L&M; Arts, LA. On July 2, 2009, Bryce performed Steve Reich's \\"2√ó5\\" premiere alongside Reich at the Manchester International Festival. On Wednesday, January 25, 2012 at Stanford University and Friday, January 27, 2012 at Carnegie Hall, Bryce performed the world premiere of David Lang's new composition \\"death speaks\\" with Nico Muhly, Shara Worden, and Owen Pallett. Bryce is also featured on the \\"death speaks\\" record, which he produced. Bryce and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead performed \\"The Music Of Jonny Greenwood And Bryce Dessner\\" as part of the 2012 Holland Festival. For the performance, Bryce composed a piece entitled \\"Lachrimae\\" as well as performed two other pieces with his brother Aaron Dessner and the Amsterdam Sinfonietta. The program was performed at the Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in Amsterdam and the Muziekgebouw Frits Philips in Eindhoven. Bryce also recently collaborated with Richard Reed Parry of The Arcade Fire on Parry's album \\"Music for Heart and Breath.\\" In 2020, Bryce composed orchestrations for Taylor Swift's eighth studio album, Folklore, which was produced and co-written by his brother Aaron Dessner. Curator As well as creating and collaborating, Dessner is highly active as a curator. Dessner is the founder and curator of the annual Cincinnati-based MusicNOW Festival. He was recently tapped to curate 'Mountains and Waves,' a weekend celebration of his music at the Barbican in London, May 2015, with guests including Steve Reich, eighth blackbird, Brooklyn Youth Chorus, S≈ç Percussion, Caroline Shaw, and the Britten Sinfonia. In September 2015, Dessner curated a weekend of performances at the Cork Opera House, Ireland. He is also the co-founder and co-curator of Crossing Brooklyn Ferry. In March 2010, Dessner co-curated the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville Tennessee. =MusicNOW Festival= The MusicNOW Festival was founded by Dessner in April 2006. The festival is an annual showcase of the best in contemporary music, featuring musicians from around the world, and is held in Cincinnati, Ohio. The first festival was held at the small downstairs room at the Cincinnati CAC and featured performances from Wilco's Glenn Kotche, The Books, Erik Freidlander, Bell Orchestre, Burmese drummer Kyaw Kyaw Naing, and the Clogs. The following year the festival was moved to the Cincinnati Memorial Hall, which would become its home for the next several years. As the festival grew and established itself as an important annual cultural event, Dessner continued to curate line-ups that featured risk-taking artists who do not fit neatly into genre-defined categories. MusicNOW celebrated its ten-year anniversary of the festival in 2015. To mark this special occasion the festival expanded to include five nights of performances in three venues. The year's festival included performances from Lone Bellow, Mina Tindle, Perfume Genius, The National, S≈ç Percussion, Butt Nothings, Will Butler, and many others. Continuing the tradition from last year, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra was featured throughout the weekend. In honor of the ten-year anniversary the festival also released \\"MusicNOW ‚Äì 10 Years,\\" a compilation album collecting live recordings of some of the best performances the series has seen over the past decade. The festival returns to Cincinnati for its twelve season in January 2017. Past festivals have featured festival-only collaborations, such as one between David Cossin and Glenn Kotche; new music from Sufjan Stevens, Richard Reed Parry (of Arcade Fire); and performances by Tinariwen, Steve Reich, Owen Pallett, The National (band), Grizzly Bear (band), Joanna Newsom, Kronos Quartet and many, many more. =Sounds From a Safe Harbour= Dessner curated a brand new festival of music and art called Sounds From a Safe Harbour. The festival took place in Cork, Ireland from September 17‚Äì20, 2015 and featured new commissions, collaborations and performances in venues throughout the city. The inaugural weekend featured performances by Shara Worden's My Brightest Diamond, celebrated English organist James McVinnie, S≈ç Percussion, and Mina Tindle. It also featured a collaboration between Bryce, Aaron Dessner, Marcel Dzama, Lisa Hannigan, members of internationally renowned new music group Crash Ensemble and virtuosic Canadian violinist, Yuki Numata Resnick. After a year off in 2016, Sounds From A Safe Harbour returned to Cork from the 14th to the 17th of September, 2017. The National kicked off their world tour, in support of new album Sleep Well Beast, at the festival on September 16 at the Cork Opera House. Other marquee acts were Lisa Hannigan and Aaron Dessner with the RTE National Symphony Orchestra on September 14, and Bon Iver on September 15th, both also at the Cork Opera House. A myriad of other musicians played in venues around the city across the weekend, as well as the festival featuring Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson presenting his piece \\"Guilt Trip\\" at the Crawford Art Gallery from the 14 to the 16th of September. =Funkhaus= Funkhaus was a not-for-profit, one-off gathering of artists in Berlin for a weekend-long festival of music curated and produced by Bryce along with his brother Aaron Dessner, Bon Iver, Berlin's Michelberger Hotel and others. The festival took place October 1‚Äì2, 2016 in the historical radio recording studios of the former GDR. Prior to the festival, all the artists spent a week together in Berlin, rehearsing and working in the spaces where the shows took place. The festival featured 80 artists, including Bon Iver, Nils Frahm, Mouse on Mars' Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner, Erlend √òye, My Brightest Diamond's Shara Nova, Lisa Hannigan, Damien Rice, and many more. =Crossing Brooklyn Ferry= Crossing Brooklyn Ferry is a music festival curated by Aaron and Bryce Dessner. The festival showcases bands, composers, singer-songwriters and filmmakers from all corners of the New York music scene. The inaugural festival took place May 3‚Äì5, 2012 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and included performances by the Walkmen, St. Vincent, Beirut, The Antlers, yMusic and Jherek Bischoff, as well as newly commissioned films by Jonas Mekas, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tunde Adebimpe, among others. The second season took place April 25‚Äì27, 2013 at BAM and included performances by The Roots, Solange, TV on the Radio, Phosphorescent and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. The event also featured a curated program of film shorts and a visual art installation by Andrew Ondrejcak. =HAVEN= Dessner is also co-curator of HAVEN, Copenhagen's annual festival 'for the senses, merging experiments in art, music, beer and food'. The festival, which launched in 2017, explores the ways in which the art forms intersect, providing the opportunity to discover new tastes, sounds and sights. Its inaugural year saw performances from the likes of Arcade Fire, Ariel Pink, and Kamasi Washington. Producer Bryce has produced and orchestrated tracks on The National's three most recent albums, High Violet (2010)[24], Trouble Will Find Me (2013).[25], and Sleep Well Beast. Bryce has produced and orchestrated tracks on The National's two most recent albums, High Violet (2010) and Trouble Will Find Me (2013). Outside of his work with The National, Bryce produced eighth blackbird's \\"Filament\\" (2015), which won Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance in the 2016 Grammy's. He also produced Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang's album Death Speaks (2013), Pedro Soler and Gaspar Claus' album Barlande (2011) and Richard Reed Parry's album Music for Heart and Breath, which was released on classical label Deutsche Grammophon. Additionally, Bryce orchestrated tracks on Local Natives' Hummingbird (2013) and Sharon van Etten's Tramp (2012), both of which were produced by his brother Aaron Dessner. =Dark Was the Night and Day of the Dead= In 2009, Bryce and Aaron produced an extensive AIDS charity compilation, Dark Was the Night, for the Red Hot Organization. The record features exclusive recordings and collaborations from a long list of artists including David Byrne, Arcade Fire, Sufjan Stevens, Feist, Sharon Jones, Cat Power, Grizzly Bear, Antony Hegarty, My Morning Jacket, and Spoon. Dark Was the Night has raised over 1.6 million dollars for AIDS charities. On May 3, 2009 4AD and Red Hot produced Dark Was the Night - Live, a concert celebrating the newest Red Hot album. The show took place at Radio City Music Hall and featured several of the artists that contributed to the compilation. In 2016, Day of the Dead, the follow-up to Dark Was the Night was released. Bryce and Aaron also produced this album, and again, all profits will go to the Red Hot Organization's mission to fight HIV/AIDs around the world. Clogs Clogs is a mostly-instrumental improvising quartet led by Bryce and Padma Newsome. Since 2001, they have released five widely acclaimed albums on Brassland Records, and have toured with The Books in the UK and played at the Sydney Festival. Clogs' music served as the soundtrack to the Chris Eigeman film Turn the River. Clogs' musical style and approach is hard to categorize. Although the band members all play classical instruments (they met at the Yale School of Music), their writing process is more akin to that of a rock band or a jazz quartet. Drawing upon a vast variety of styles and influences, the group members bring basic ideas and riffs into rehearsals, which, through group improvisations they then develop into complex, larger-scale pieces. Their music is often influenced by minimalism, folk and rock music, Americana, modernism and Indian classical music. Brassland Alongside Alec Hanley Bemis and Aaron Dessner, Bryce founded Brassland Records, a label that has released early albums from The National, Clogs, Doveman and Nico Muhly. Personal life Dessner is married to French singer Mina Tindle, who has provided vocals to several of The National's albums.

It covers two local nature reserves: Rough Wood and Rough Wood Chase. It is one of only a few remaining ancient woodlands with a mix of tree varieties but comprising largely oak trees. Historically the woodland was privately owned up until the 1950s when it was given to the then Willenhall Council to protect it from clay extraction. The council promptly placed a preservation order on all the trees. First mentioned in the 12th Century as a royal hunting wood it stretched over a vast area taking in most of what is currently Walsall all the way to the woodland that is now known as Cannock Chase. The woodland resides on top of the Bentley Seam of coal which runs close to the surface of the ground. It was previously exploited for coal resources which is evident by large sections having undulating surfaces caused by the sinking of bell pits. The site is encircled by the Woodlands housing estate to the north and west, by the M6 motorway to the east and by the Wyrley and Essington canal to the south and east.

Life Worthington was born in 1703 and educated at Oswestry School before moving to Jesus College, Oxford. He matriculated in 1722 and obtained his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1726. He became usher of Oswestry School in 1726 and was ordained priest, becoming vicar of Llanyblodwell in Shropshire in 1729 through Francis Hare, Bishop of St Asaph. Worthington obtained a Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) degree from St John's College, Cambridge in 1730, and Bachelor of Divinity (BD) and Doctor of Divinity (DD) degrees from the University of Oxford in 1738. In 1748, Hare presented Worthington to the post of vicar of Llanrhaeadr in Denbighshire, Wales. He was appointed in 1768 as a canon of York Minster by Robert Hay Drummond, Archbishop of York, who had previously been Bishop of St Asaph and for whom Worthington had acted as chaplain. He held other honorary parish positions, in Darowen, Montgomeryshire and Hope, Flintshire. He died in Llanrhaeadr on 6 October 1778, leaving money to missionary societies in his will. Works Worthington wrote on the subject of the Book of Job in An Essay on ... Man's Redemption' (1743), which disagreed with the views of William Warburton (later Bishop of Gloucester). He delivered the Boyle Lectures in 1776 to 1778, with his lectures being published under the title The Evidence of Christianity (1769). He wrote on other theological topics, including two replies to a dissenting cleric's Essay on Demoniacks (1777 and 1779).

The Centenary Institute was founded in 1829 as Valley Creek Academy, a local school, but was turned over to the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1838. In celebration of the centennial of Methodism, the school was renamed the \\"Centenary Institute\\". A. H. Mitchell served as president of the Institute from 1843 until 1856. In 1845, the school was conferred the power to grant degrees, and graduated its first class that same year. For the next two decades, the school was the largest in central Alabama, enrolling approximately 500 students. J. N. Montgomery was president from 1856 until the Civil War; he was followed by Richard H. Rivers, William J. Vaughn, and R. K. Hargrove. The Institute saw its fortunes decline precipitously during the war; by 1865 buildings were in need of repair, and in 1867 the school saw but three graduates. The Panic of 1873 impacted the school further, driving enrollment to fifty by 1874-75. In 1880, the Methodists ceased supporting the school, and the Institute began to act solely as a local school. The Institute was abandoned by 1885, and its buildings were used as an orphan asylum.Isabella Margaret Elizabeth Blandin, History of Higher Education of Women in the South Prior to 1860, (New York: Washington, Neale Pub.

They are blood-feeding ectoparasites of primarily horses and other large mammals including cattle. It is a permanently fully winged fly, not shedding its wings on finding its host, as in some other Hippoboscidae. With its wings retained, it may thus fly away from its host to deposit its larvae. They are good fliers. Description 220x220px Wing length . Generally pale reddish brown with yellow spots on the indistinctly segmented abdomen. They have one pair of sub-triangular wings and the wing veins are crowded together towards the anterior border. The characteristic feature of these flies is that they move sidewards and they feed preferably between the hind legs and on the perineum region. Distribution The primary distribution is in Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. It has been introduced to other locations, though in some cases latter eradicated by modern husbandry practices. In the United Kingdom they are known primarily from the New Forest and increasingly from South Devon. There are occasionally recorded from other part of the UK, though some reports as far north as the Scottish borders are considered dubious. In the United Kingdom, their flight period is from May to October, but peaking August and early September.  Hosts  Their primary host are equines; they are often also frequently found on cattle on which they are able to maintain a population. They have been known to bite a number of other mammals, including sheep and goats. Though it is actively attracted to humans and will land, it does not often bite them. Other mammals it may also live on are red deer, camel and rabbit. Also on birds: the grey heron, and the northern goshawk. They have been fed and bred on guinea pigs in the laboratory.

History Education in Tully began as early as 1801 when Miss Ruth Thorpe established a school in the town. In 1898, Tully Union School received a charter from the Board of Regents to establish a high school in the district. The high school offered classes in the current elementary school building from 1930-1970 when the town constructed a new building.http://www.tullyschools.org/teacherpage3.cfm?teacher=489 Academics Students can earn a place on the High Honor Roll (94.5%+), the Honor Roll (89.5%+) or the Merit Roll (84.5%+). Teachers also select students to enter into National Honor Society. Initial eligibility requires a 90% average or higher. In addition, a faculty selection committee determines whether or not a student meets the leadership, service, and character components of the organization. Athletics Tully competes in the following interscholastic athletics: Baseball, Basketball, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Football, Golf, Indoor Track, Lacrosse, Soccer, Softball, Track and Field, Volleyball, and Wrestling.

The term has been used in various contexts, from portraying Russia as a corrupt and murderous regime where the line between the security forces and organised crime is blurred to an oil and gas powered state that is ready to swat away criticism at home, squash troublesome neighbours and sacrifice personal freedoms in the name of a strong centralised state. Definition Professor of International Affairs, Nina L. Khrushcheva defines Putin-land as, a Gogol- like, \\"country of illusions and imagination, in which perceptions are more important than facts, where officials are corrupt and people are oppressed because they all live in a dream of empire,\\" while, in fact, \\"individual needs are neglected, the state's needs are overstated, and everyone is condemned to a life of cheating and stealing, consoling themselves that, while there is no justice, they are at least part of a great country.\\" Usage of the term The term was used by Anna Politkovskaya in an interview held 18 months before her death, she said in relation to the murders of 15 investigative journalists: \\"It's the same old story, nobody who tells the truth in Putinland is safe.\\" A five part French documentary called Murder by Numbers in Putinland was made which probes the suppression of dissent in Russia and the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London, along with interviews of the prime suspect in the Litvinenko murder, Andre Lugovoi, who is considered a hero in Russia. Edward Lucas refers to Russia as \\"Putinland\\" when he claims that Russian publishers refused to publish the bestselling book Gulag by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anne Applebaum, according to Lucas as they feared Kremlin intervention if texts cast the Soviet Union in an unfavourable light. He also noted that a possible reason the book was not published in Russia is due to low demand, in what he describes as fatigue amongst Russians in hearing about the history of the gulags, and noted that if it were published in Russian it is likely it would sell worse than an Icelandic cookbook. Nina L. Khrushcheva, a Russian American professor of media and culture, wrote in the International Herald Tribune: \\"Uniforms are in and patriotic youth organizations such as Nashi (Ours), successor to the Soviet-era Pioneers, are on the march. The economy is great, Gazprom is great, the military is great, Putin is great: The empire remains ours. The Russians are eager to believe that they no longer live in a country defeated by the West. Instead they live in an oil and gas powered Putin-land.\\" British journalist and author Roger Boyes, who is the Berlin correspondent for British newspaper The Times covering Germany, noted that \\"even the Germans have come to realise that Holy Russia has become PutinLand, ready to swat away criticism at home, squash troublesome neighbours and sacrifice personal freedoms in the name of a strong centralised state\\", a view published in his column in German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.

It is a true fly, in the order Diptera. Although many other species of bat fly exist throughout the world, the New Zealand bat fly is endemic to the islands of New Zealand.Gibbs, George. (2008). Ghosts of Gondwana. Craig Potton Publishing: Auckland. p16 It appears to be the only insect, parasitic or otherwise, which lives with these bats (fleas, for example, which are common on many other species of bat, are unknown on the short-tailed bat). Description New Zealand bat flies are approximately 3 mm long,Ballance, A. and Morris R. (2008). Rare Wildlife of New Zealand. Random House. p39 wingless in both sexes, blind,Meads, Mike. (1990). Forgotten Fauna. DSIR Publishing. p92 and have long, bristly, spider-like legs which end in specially adapted claws which are thought to help them \\"swim\\" through bat fur. Males are larger than females and look quite different; one Japanese expert when sent some of the first specimens collected for scientific study suggested that they were different species. =Discovery= Mystacinobia was first discovered in 1958, and the first specimen was catalogued for analysis by zoologist P. D. Dwyer in 1962 after it dropped out of the fur of a short- tailed bat he was looking after. In 1973 a 56 metre high kauri tree in the Omahuta Kauri Sanctuary in Northland containing a large colony of short tailed bats collapsed. When inspected the following day a dead bat with three bat flies on it was found by a New Zealand Forest Service officer, who sent the insects to Auckland to be studied. The opportunity to study live bat flies and learn about their behaviour and ecology was lost when the bats deserted their felled roost before a team of scientists from the DSIR was assembled to investigate. Two years later, on 14 March 1975, the kauri tree the bats had moved into was blown over, as Cyclone Allison swept through Northland. This time entomologists were able to collect a large number of bat flies for anatomical studies and to keep in captivity so that their behaviour could be studied and scientifically described and named. =Ecology= Almost everything about this fly is unusual. Unlike other bat flies such as those in the Hippoboscidae, the New Zealand bat fly is not dependent on the blood of the bats with which it lives, instead feeding on guano. It lives in colonies and the females lay their eggs in large shared nurseries of eggs and larvae, which require temperatures of over 30¬∞ C to develop. The adult females will groom the larvae in the nurseries as well as each other and their other colony mates. There also seems to be the beginning of a caste system, as some of the males live past their normal reproductive age and act as a \\"soldier caste\\" of colony guards. These elderly males produce a high frequency buzz that seems to keep the bats from flying too close to the fly colony.Ross Piper (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. As this species of bat is also an insect-eater, the flies would appear to be under constant threat of being eaten by their \\"hosts.\\" The vibrations of these elderly males appears to be the mechanism by which the fly prevents itself from becoming prey. To travel to other colonies, bat flies need to ride on their hosts; up to 10 flies can be found on the fur of a single bat when it leaves its roost. Taxonomy and naming Entomologist Beverly Holloway named and described the bat fly as the sole member of its family (Mystacinobiidae) and genus (Mystacinobia), making both of these monotypic. Subsequent DNA analysis suggests that New Zealand bat flies represent a distinct and ancient lineage in the superfamily Oestroidea, which includes flesh flies and blow flies. The ancestors of their host species (Icarops, a Miocene bat which lived 20 million years ago) also lived in Australia, but it is not known whether the New Zealand bat fly evolved there or in New Zealand ‚Äì it could have been transported across the Tasman Sea with its host, or arrived via a forested Antarctica.

It lies in the comarca de Alcal√° in the autonomous community of the Community of Madrid. It had a population of 19,345 in 2008. Algete is northeast of the capital. Sights include the church of Asunci√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora.  History  There are no records of the first settlements in Algete. There are remains of human settlements in the Iron Age found in the fertile plain of Jarama. Remains of Roman villas and Visigoth settlements have also been found. It is known that it was inhabited in Arabic times due to the existence of qanat or underground waterways. From this period may come its name, derived from Al-Satt, which means the bank (by the River Jarama). In 1081, Alfonso VI began the reconquest of the Jarama basin, expelling the Muslims and repopulating the area with Christians from the South. In the 16th century, Algete became a town. The church was rebuilt, possibly on top of a Romanesque church. In 1579, Gregorio XIII disaffected Algete from the Archbishopric of Toledo and transferred it to the Crown. Philip II sold it for twenty thousand ducats to Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, Marqu√©s de Ca√±ete and Viceroy of Peru. In 1728, Philip V named Algete a Duchy in favor of Christopher of Moscoso and Montemayor. The cadastral data of this time speak of a population of \\"290 neighbors living in 282 houses\\", increasing the number of inhabitants to 1,263 in just a few years. Already in the 19th century, Alfonso XII visited the municipality in 1883, and in 1891 the first municipal school was built. In the 20th century, when the Spanish Civil War began, Algete remained on the Republican side. Several religious images were burnt and the organ of the church was destroyed. In the decade of the sixties, development arrives little by little to the municipality: the first industrial areas are born, water is channeled, highways are built and public lighting is reformed. In the eighties a bullring was built and the sports centre was built and in the nineties a new health center and some schools opened. During these decades, Algete experience important growth due to emigration from rural areas.  Geography  Algete is located just 20 km northeast of the urban developments of Sanchinarro and Las Tablas, in Madrid. It has an area of 38 km¬≤. The western area comprises a plain through which the Jarama River flows. Algete, as the main population centre, is located between hills. Algete is surrounded by crops fields, eucalyptus forests and scrubland. It borders the municipalities of Fuente el Saz del Jarama, San Sebasti√°n de los Reyes, Valdeolmos-Alalpardo, Cobe√±a, Daganzo de Arriba, El Molar, San Agust√≠n del Guadalix and Colmenar Viejo. The altitude of the municipality varies between 600 and 780 metres above sea level. It has average winter temperatures lower than those of the capital of Madrid. The inhabited areas can be divided into two categories: residential developments and the historic centre: = Residential areas = * Santo Domingo * Prado Norte * Ciudad Jard√≠n Valderrey = Historic Centre = The historic center is divided into different neighborhoods, such as: * Palomares * Retamar * El Cigarral * El Tesoro * Pryconsa * Los Pazos * Castillo * Las Letras Apart from these areas, there are isolated nuclei such as Dehesa Nueva and several industrial areas such as Rio de Janeiro, Los Nogales or La Garza.

From 1940 to 1980, he was an editorial board member of the Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol (which later became the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and finally the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs), based at the Center for Alcohol Studies.

Although more than half a century had passed since acetanilide was first used clinically, there was wide-ranging disagreement concerning its metabolism, and numerous theories had been postulated. The first of these three papers summarized these theories, and reexamined the proportion of various acetanilide metabolites in human urine. Finding that p-aminophenol conjugates were excreted, they refuted the earlier theories that the accumulation of this substance in the body was causing methemoglobinemia. Of far greater impact was the second paper in this series, showing that paracetamol was a metabolite of acetanilide in the blood. The third paper in the series reported that even large amounts of paracetamol (up to 4 grams per kg of body weight) did not produce methemoglobinemia in albino rats. This observation, together with later studies conducted by Bernard Brodie and Julius Axelrod led to the rediscovery of paracetamol as a drug.

Born in Chicago, Perry began his career in the mailroom of the Chicago Tribune. Some say that Frank King, to prove his teaching prowess, arbitrarily plucked Perry from that post and trained him in cartooning. Others say Perry took art classes in the evenings, and first served as Carl Ed's assistant on Harold Teen.Horn, Maurice. 100 Years of American Newspaper Comics: An Illustrated Encyclopedia. New York: Gramercy Books, 1996. In either case, Perry started assisting King on Gasoline Alley around 1925.

The last panel of the Sunday, April 22, 1951, installment of Gasoline Alley depicts Walt Wallet sitting in a chair, on the back of which is symbolism that signals a changing of the guard. Under a banner that reads \\"Sunday Gasoline Alley\\" is a stylized handshake; on one sleeve is \\"FK\\" and on the other is \\"WP\\". Thus did Frank King symbolically hand over the Sunday strip to William Perry. On April 29, 1951, Perry officially took the reins of the Gasoline Alley Sunday page. He held the job until 1975 or 1976. King still handled the dailies during the early third of that span, but for most of Perry's tenure, Dick Moores was the title's creator on weekdays. According to Scancarelli, who praised the work Perry did under King's name, \\"The sad thing was, Bill had gotten older by the time he was taking over the strip, and as he got older, he just couldn't put the same energy into it, so it didn't keep up with the times.\\" When Perry retired, Moores hired Bob Zschiesche (an assistant on the strip between 1950 and 1963) to take over the Sundays, then in 1979 added the Sundays to his own workload. From 1945 to 1973, Perry also drew Little Brother Hugo, a mostly \\"silent\\" comic strip with no talking balloons, concerning a boy who finds clever ways to avoid danger, get revenge on somebody, or defy authority to get what he wants, or who misreads signs and thinks a product is free or less costly than he realizes later.\\"Little Brother Hugo,\\" ComicStripFan.com, https://www.comicstripfan.com/newspaper/l/littlebrotherhugo.htm References= Notes  Sources = * Perry entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia * Scancarelli interview, Hogan's Alley * Markstein, Don.

History of the building The original school was founded by Royal charter by King Edward VI in 1552. This is a timber-frame building, now at the rear of the present building. Additional stone buildings were added from 1594 to 1630, including a chapel, dormitories, library and classrooms. The school continued in these, until it was relocated in 1882. Subsequently the premises were converted to a public \\"Free Library and Museum\\" by the Shrewsbury Borough Council, opening in their new role in 1885.Article by Beryl Copsey. In the twentieth century the library purpose gradually took over the building.

The projected cost was over ¬£3million, one of the most expensive such works ever undertaken by Shropshire County Council. The library opened in 1983. The work included sand-blasting the main stonework, which looks more modern than 1630 as a result. Work was also done on the original timber-framed building, including repairs to the roof gables. Carvings were done by a local craftsman in the original Tudor style. These include a self-portrait at the apex of the north-facing gable. Information supplied by library staff, 24 January 2009.

Some of these essays, developed through speeches and lectures she gave, have been quoted and reprinted often, and the book has been described as a \\"classic\\" of feminist theory.Ann Cudd, \\"Frye, Marilyn (1941- )\\", Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Thomson Gale, 2006) .United States: Marilyn Frye receives Phi Beta Kappa Romanell Award., off our backs, April 1, 2006 . Summary Frye outlines several key concepts and fundamental issues for feminist theory. In the first essay, \\"Oppression\\", she explains a structural vision of oppression: > Oppression is a system of interrelated barriers and forces which reduce, > immobilize and mold people who belong to a certain group, and effect their > subordination to another group (individually to individuals of the other > group, and as a group, to that group). She uses the analogy of a bird cage to explain why many people do not see oppression: > If you look very closely at just one wire in the cage, you cannot see the > other wires. If your conception of what is before you is determined by this > myopic focus, you could look at that one wire, up and down the length of it, > and be unable to see why a bird would not just fly around the wire any time > it wanted to go somewhere ... It is only when you step back, stop looking at > the wires one by one, microscopically, and take a macroscopic view of the > whole cage, that you can see why the bird does not go anywhere; and then you > will see it in a moment. The second essay, \\"Sexism\\", clearly illustrates sexism as a specific form of oppression. As a philosopher, Frye grounds her arguments in epistemological questions and moral inquiry. An example, from her introduction, is: > What feminist theory is about, to a great extent, is just identifying those > forces...and displaying the mechanics of their applications to women as a > group (or caste) and to individual women. The measure of the success of the > theory is just how much sense it makes of what did not make sense before. Her essay 'On Separation and Power' is a justification for separate space for oppressed groups. 'On Being White: Thinking Toward a Feminist Understanding of Race and Race Supremacy' is an example of a radical lesbian feminist philosopher talking through the process of analysing her own attitudes about racism and how that fits within feminism. Reception The book has been cited widely by other feminist theorists. For example, Sheila Jeffreys quotes from the introduction in Beauty and Misogyny. In Claudia Card's review of the essays, she praises Frye's clear writing style as well as the essay's progressive contributions to feminist theory.

History The group started out at the Brill Building in New York City, under the management of Ted Eddy, who also served as manager of Louis Prima. They recorded for Tender,Unart, United Artists, and Roulette. In 1959, the group released a song they had written, \\"Black and White Thunderbird\\", on the United Artists Unart label. The record was produced by Don Costa, and arranged by Billy Mure. It became a significant hit on the East Coast, which afforded them a guest spot on American Bandstand in Philadelphia.

Work = Enterprise Architecture Planning = Levels of Enterprise Architecture Planning.FAA (1998). Federal Information Architecture Initiatives Federal Aviation Administration, February 1998. In his 1992 book Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP), Spewak defined Enterprise Architecture Planning as \\"the process of defining architectures for the use of information in support of the business and the plan for implementing those architectures\\". Enterprise Architecture Planning is based on the Business Systems Planning (BSP) approach developed by John Zachman in the 1980. It takes a business- oriented approach to architecture planning to provide: * data quality, * access to data, * adaptability to changing requirements, * data interoperability and sharing, and * cost containment. The ultimate goal of an Enterprise Architecture is to define practical and implementable application and technology projects along with those projects required to prepare the organization for its future IT environment. This view counters the more traditional view that applications should be defined before data needs are determined or provided for. Spewak‚Äôs approach to Enterprise Architecture Planning is similar to that taken by DOE in that the business mission is the primary driver. That is followed by the data required to satisfy the mission, followed by the applications that are built using that data, and finally by the technology to implement the applications. This hierarchy of activity is represented in the figure on the right, in which the layers are implemented in order, from top to bottom. His approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture has helped organizations with modeling, business strategy planning, process improvement, data warehousing, and various support systems designs, data administration standards, object-oriented and information engineering methodologies, and project management. The Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) methodology is beneficial to understanding the further definition of the Federal Enterprise Architecture.The Chief Information Officers Council (1999). Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework Version 1.1 . September 1999 = Enterprise Architects, Inc. = Spewak was founding partner of Enterprise Architects, Inc. Along with two partners, Frank Digaetano and Stephan DeVocht he tutored several generations of Enterprise Architects, and performed many consulting assignments for Fortune 500 clients, US and Canadian Federal Government organizations, as well as State, Local and Tribal government bodies. Since the publication of his seminal book, he and his partners introduced enhancements to the EAP methodology such as updates for technology architecture, expansion of implementation requirements, and methods for calculating planning project duration and effort. They also developed a planning tool (EAP Toolset Templates), and the StratTac Group LLC Planning Templates, to assist organizations EAP efforts.

Early years Morgan Green was born in White Plains, Maryland to parents James and Denise Green. He attended Henry E. Lackey High School in Indian Head, Maryland where he was a three-year starter in football. As a sophomore in 2002, he amassed 1,131 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns, the most of any Washington, D.C. area player in his grade.

The naming conventions are similar to those of Russian names. The original Sakha names were used in unofficial settings, but eventually the official clerical names dominated. Nowadays, most of the Sakha people have names belonging to the tradition of the former Soviet Union. Present-day original Sakha names are usually derived from the names of mythological heroes, names of places, names of plants or animals etc. For example, the names Elley (–≠–ª–ª—ç–π), Manchaary (–ú–∞–Ω—á–∞–∞—Ä—ã), Tuyaara (–¢—É–π–∞–∞—Ä–∞), Nyurgun (–ù—å—É—Ä–≥—É–Ω), and K√ºnney (–ö“Ø–Ω–Ω—ç–π) are the names of mythological or historical heroes and are quite common among Sakha people. Present-day original Sakha names are derived from the names of \\"positive\\" objects. But in the past, children were often named after \\"bad\\", \\"disgusting\\" objects in order to hide the children from evil spirits.

It is located on a strategic mountain top, five km to the south of San Vicente de Tagua Tagua, near the dry lagoon (Laguna de Tagua Tagua). This is believed to be the southernmost fort of the Inca Empire.  History  The Inca invasion, having advanced beyond the Choapa river, came to Picunche territory. They established in the zone several storage facilities and the fortress of Cerro La Muralla. Pucara Cerro La Muralla Located on the strategic top of the hill, the fortress is near the lagoon that is now dry. It is located between the Cachapoal River and Tinguiririca River. It is presumed that the fort was used as point of observation, since from here, the north valley can be controlled. The lagoon was also useful for defence.Cerro La Muralla Map  Structure  Structure of walls of the Pucar√° and relation to the hill and the level of the lagoon before it dried up. In the top of the Hill, the walls tracing an eagle in flight like another Inca structures. It has three defensive walls and two sectors with housings.Map Abundant ceramics and stone cups have been found. To 100 m of the first wall they realized works of recognition in the strength, that alone them esplanade, that apparently served as field of cultures. Evidence is that this construction was effected by the Incas, due to the work of the stone in blocks, the dimension of the enclosures and the structural terrace shapes of some sectors. Integral forms a part with Laguna de Tagua Tagua, since it does not have south wall, which was covered by the lagoon.  Investigations  Claudio Gay described his ascent to Cerro La Muralla, which then was called an Inca fortress. In 1974, scientists of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History, decided that this Indian fortress was constructed before the arrival of the Spanish to this place.  Current importance  Nearby is an image of the Virgin of F√°tima, since habitual age in the Spanish Conquest. Any suspicious site of adoration to other deities was covered with icons of Catholic adoration. In this sector every year on the second Sunday of September celebrates a mass, to which he represents a parishioners' great quantity. This hurts the archaeological site.  Projects  At San Vicente of Tagua Tagua there are a project to have a museum and to recover the pieces extracted in the zone and that were extracted of the place by the investigators. In addition one tries to create museums in situ, and to medium term a route controlled to the pucar√° of The Wall.  Bibliography  * Rub√©n Stehberg, Fortaleza La Muralla, San Vicente de Tagua Tagua.

In 2010, Strabala founded 2DEFINE Architecture, an architectural firm, with three Chinese partners, though the partnership later soured. Before that, he had been employed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) and Gensler.  Education  Strabala received his bachelor of arts in design from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1988, Strabala graduated with a Master of Architecture from Harvard Graduate School of Design. Career=SOM= After graduating with his master's degree, Strabala worked at SOM in Chicago, Illinois, for 19 years. He ultimately was made an associate partner in charge of design. While at SOM, Strabala served as the studio head under lead architect Adrian Smith in working on the design of Burj Khalifa (Dubai, 2009), which is the tallest building in the world. Strabala also worked under Smith as one of the two studio heads over the course of the project in designing the 450 m. tall Nanjing Greenland Financial Center (Nanjing, China, 2010). Also while at SOM, Strabala participated in the design of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Hong Kong, 1997). Strabala left SOM in 2006. In a 2007 interview, Adrian Smith said that Strabala was one of several architects up for partner at SOM who did not make it, in what Smith described as \\"a power move by the New York office.\\" =Gensler= Houston Ballet Center for Dance After leaving SOM, Strabala joined the Houston, Texas, office of the architectural firm Gensler in 2006. While at Gensler, Strabala has been reported to have led the design of the 128-story Shanghai Tower and to have completed the \\"bulk of the design work\\". Gensler, however, claims that the tower is not Strabala's design. According to Gensler in a lawsuit it later dropped, \\"Gensler, not (Strabala), is the source of the architectural and design services rendered in designing the Shanghai Tower.\\" Art Gensler, founder of Gensler, credited Jun Xia as \\"designer of the building (Shanghai Tower)\\". Xia was also credited as having \\"helped the Ô¨Årm score the Shanghai Tower contract and led the team‚Äôs work on it\\", and as \\"the design principal for Gensler on the project.\\" Strabala also has been credited for leading Gensler's efforts in designing Hess Tower (Houston, 2010) and the Houston Ballet Center for Dance (2011). However, Gensler has claimed that \\"'Gensler, not (Strabala), is the source of the architectural and design services rendered in designing Hess Tower'\\", and that Strabala was but \\"'one of many members of that Gensler team'\\" that designed the Houston Ballet Center for Dance. \\"In March 2010, before the [Shanghai] Tower was completed, Strabala had a falling out with Gensler and his employment with that firm terminated.\\" =2DEFINE Architecture=Founding Shortly after leaving Gensler, \\"In June 2010, Strabala and three Chinese partners ([Qiao] Zhang, Zhou [Shimiao], and one other who has since left the partnership) founded 2DEFINE.\\" According to Strabala, as of December 2010, he \\"continues to be involved in the Shanghai Tower project at the behest of the client\\". Breakup and Lawsuits \\"For reasons that are very much in dispute, the [2DEFINE Architecture] partnership soured and litigation ensued, first in China where the partnership was centered, and then in Illinois.\\" In February 2015, Strabala sued Zhang and Zhou in Illinois alleging \\"Zhang and Zhou were secretly diverting money from 2DEFINE,\\" though Zhang and Zhou denied \\"any wrongdoing.\\" In November 2016, the Illinois court partially denied and partially granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. There were also three lawsuits in China. One was \\"a lawsuit brought by Zhou against Strabala.\\" Another of them was \\"a lawsuit brought by Strabala against Zhang and Zhou.\\" In 2014, Shanghai Huangpu District Court, in a case (case number:Ôºà2014ÔºâÈªÑÊµ¶Ê∞ë‰∫åÔºàÂïÜÔºâÂàùÂ≠óÁ¨¨980Âè∑), in which Strabala alleged that Zhang and Zhou were secretly diverting money from 2DEFINE, all of Strabala's charge was turned down, by both the District Court Judge and the Judges from the Court of Appeals(case numberÔºà2016ÔºâÊ≤™02Ê∞ëÁªà2258Âè∑). Finally, the third was \\"a lawsuit brought by Zhou‚Äôs Chinese architecture firm, Tufan Architects Design Firm, against Strabala.\\" According to Zhou in an affidavit in the Illinois lawsuit, \\"the first two lawsuits [in China] have been resolved, while the third was still pending at the time the affidavit was filed.\\" Previous Employers Sue Strabala=Gensler= In June 2011, Gensler, sued Strabala alleging in a complaint that after founding his own firm Strabala publicly misrepresented his role in several projects while \\"'intentionally minimizing or entirely omitting the nature of Gensler's contribution.'\\" Gensler claimed that Strabala's actions violated the Lanham Act and various state laws. In February 2012, Judge Ronald A. Guzman of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed Gensler's complaint on procedural grounds before trial, ruling that the allegations Gensler made against Strabala do not constitute a violation of the Lanham Act or related state law. Gensler appealed the dismissal. In August 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated the District Court's dismissal of the lawsuit and remanded the case back to the District Court therefore reviving the lawsuit. In April 2015, Gensler dropped the suit. =SOM= The day after Gensler sued Strabala, SOM sued Strabala in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that he was \\"falsely claiming credit for work that originated with the company, including the designs for three of the 10 tallest buildings in the world.\\" Among SOM's allegations was \\"that most of Strabala's work on Burj Khalifa, for example, 'occurred in the construction-document phase' following design completion.\\" The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in June 2012. In December 2012, SOM and Strabala reached a binding settlement agreement and the case was dismissed under its terms. Neither party may discuss the lawsuit per the agreement. Local involvement \\"[I]n or around 1999, he and his wife purchased a condominium in a well-known high-rise building in Chicago designed by the famed architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.\\" Also in 1999, Strabala, speaking as a private citizen as part of a community group, testified before the Chicago City Council Zoning Committee against a high-rise development at 840 Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, Illinois. Strabala lived nearby and was concerned that the high-rise would be \\"out of scale with the neighborhood\\". Despite opponents' efforts, and that the project would \\"flout existing law\\", the Zoning Committee amended the ordinance allowing the project to proceed.

Early life and career Julien-D√©sir√© Schmaltz was born in 1771 in Lorient; the son of Jean-Boniface Schmaltz and Louise Declos. He enlisted in the Dutch colonial army in 1799, serving as an officer of military engineers in Batavia. By 1814 he had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the French army, based in Guadeloupe. Governor of Senegal On 17 June 1816, Schmaltz departed for Saint-Louis, Senegal aboard the frigate M√©duse to take up his position as Governor of Senegal, which was by treaty to be returned to French rule by an occupying British force. The ship ran aground on sand banks 50 kilometres from the Senegalese shore, partly because of Schmaltz's impatience to reach Saint-Louis and partly because of the incompetence of the captain and navigator. The tragedy that ensued, after it was decided to set 146 of the 400 crew and passengers onto a hastily built raft, was immortalized in G√©ricault's painting The Raft of the Medusa. Schmaltz, his family and staff made it to shore in a longboat, subsequently reaching the capital of Senegal by land. He then formally resumed possession of the former French colony from the British garrison commanded by Colonel Thomas Brereton. Apparently escaping any direct blame for the loss of the M√©duse, Schmaltz remained in office as governor for four years. On 8 May 1819 he signed the Treaty of Ndiaw with the Brak of Waalo, which resulted in the creation of a series of commercial posts along the S√©n√©gal River(Bakel, 1820 ; Dagana, 1821 ; Merinaghen, 1822 ; Lampsar, 1843 ; S√©noud√©bou, 1845). This resulted in some conflict with local chieftains. Schmaltz initiated a far-reaching project of agricultural colonization in the region of Waalo, which gradually failed after he left office and was abandoned in 1831. Personal life Schmaltz was married to Reine Marais, also born in Lorient; daughter of Julien-Michel and Michelle- Reine Fauvel, with whom he had a daughter, Eliza Schmaltz. Eliza was born in Port Louis in Mauritius on April 3, 1798 and died 13 September 1868 in Paris. (death certificate No. 1333). She was single. Death Recalled from Senegal in 1820, Schmaltz was subsequently appointed French Consul-General in Smyrna, Turkey. He died there on 16 June 1827. Movie In the 1998 movie Le Radeau de la M√©duse, the Schmaltz family was played by Philippe Laudenbach (Julien Schmaltz), Claude Jade (Reine Schmaltz) and St√©phanie Lanoux (Eliza Schmaltz).

In 1866 he was an associate professor, later being appointed director and chief surgeon of the otology clinic at the University of Heidelberg.

History Spain attended the University of Chicago and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in Ancient Roman History in 1974. He worked for Gladstone Associates, now part of Accenture from 1974 to 1977. He subsequently attended law school at Boston University, and graduated in 1979.

Retrieved on April 7, 2014. Spain worked at Extel for ten years in various positions including General Counsel, VP of Administration, and VP, Mergers & Acquisitions. During this period, Spain provided some of the initial capital for the creation of Bookstop, a company founded by his friend Gary Hoover. In 1990 he moved to Austin, Texas where he and University of Chicago friends Gary Hoover and Alan Chai, along with Alta Campbell, founded Hoover's. The Company initially produced a printed directory, which profiled 540 of the most important companies in the world but soon emphasized electronic distribution, but at its inception, Hoover's began exploring the electronic distribution of its detailed company profiles. Hoover's subsequently concluded licensing deals with Lexis-Nexis, Bloomberg and in 1993 with America Online. In 1994, Hoover's launched its website, www.hoovers.com. The wide exposure provided by America Online and the Company website, led to Hoover's rapid growth, with a public stock offering in 1999. Spain was CEO from 1992 to 2001 and chairman from 2001 to 2002. Spain remained on Hoover's Board until the Company was sold to Dun & Bradstreet in 2003. In 2002, Spain started what would become HighBeam Research, an online subscription research service that provides users with access to tens of millions of articles from thousands of newspapers, magazines, and journals. In December 2008, HighBeam was sold to Cengage Learning. Spain launched Newser within HighBeam but separated the two entities prior to the sale of HighBeam. Newser is an advertising-based online news site that curates and summarizes news in a highly visual format. It has an audience of approximately 4 million readers. His partner at Newser is Michael Wolff. In the decade starting in 2004, Spain served as a Director of GuideStar, an innovator in transparency matters for the non-profit industry; SmartAnalyst, a company that provides sophisticated analyses for the life sciences industry; and Televerde, a socially progressive telemarketing automation company. In 2013, he became a Director at Owler, an innovator in company-related content started by Jigsaw founder Jim Fowler, where he continues to serve on the Board. He is also a Director of Community Health, the largest free health clinic in Chicago and a Governor of Opportunity International, the oldest and largest microlender in the world; and Chairman of the Library Council at the University of Chicago. In 2012, Spain, Dr. Mark Friedman, and Ken Anderson founded First Stop Health. Friedman, an Emergency Medicine physician, was a classmate of Spain's at the University of Chicago. Spain's interest in creating First Stop Health arose from his own unsatisfactory experience with the healthcare system, when a member of his family experienced a serious illness. This ignited his desire to make patient access to quality healthcare more convenient and affordable. His father, James W. Spain, was a career foreign service officer and a U.S. ambassador to Tanzania, Turkey, and Sri Lanka. Spain was born in Pakistan and grew up Turkey and Washington, DC.

Life He was born Bashkim Shehu to Osman Shehu, a sheikh, nationalist and outspoken anticommunist from Dib√´r County. Osman Shehu underwent persecutions and humiliations during communist rule. All of his family changed the family name into Gazidede. Gazidede himself was a lifelong Muslim devotee. Despite all the fact that \\"enemies of the people\\" were by law prohibited education past high school, he managed to enter the Luigj Gurakuqi University of Shkodra and graduated with a degree in Mathematics from the University of Tirana. Career Between 1984 and 1992 Gazidede was an algebra and mathematics lecturer at the University of Tirana. In 1991 he affiliated with the Association of Muslim Intellectuals. In the same year he ran in parliamentary elections from a list of the Democratic Party of Albania, but he was elected in the constituency of Dibra only in the next elections in 1992. In the period 1992-1997, during the rule of Sali Berisha, he directed the National Intelligence Service (), created after the disbanding of the communist intelligence service Sigurimi (\\"Security\\"). He had no previous experience in the management of the intelligence services. In one of his first interviews he announced the removal of 60% of the personnel coming from the former communist secret service. In June 1996 he was accused of arrest and torture of opposition activists, protesting against the government of the Democratic Party of Albania. During the riots in Albania in the spring of 1997 after the failure of the Albanian Ponzi schemes, Gazidede led an unsuccessful operation to restore public order. Speaking in a parliamentary questioning session, he blamed the authorities of Greece, the CIA and the U.S. embassy in Tirana for the creation of the military escalation in the south of the country. Gazidede called on all Albanians to take their share of responsibility for the events, and praised the Greek minority of Albania for non-involvement in the events. After 1997 In June 1997, after the election victory of the Socialist Party in Albania, Gazidede left the country to travel to Turkey and Syria. He probably spent time in both countries. On 21 August 1998, the then Attorney General of Albania, Aleksander Goga, issued nine arrest orders against high officials including Gazidede, accused of committing genocide and other crimes against humanity in 1997. Gazidede was also accused of abuse of power and abandonment of duty in face of threat. In July 2003 the investigation against Gazidede was terminated. In 2005 he returned to Albania after eight years in hiding and joined the administration of Sali Berisha as the vice-president of the Albanian National Real Estate Registration Office. A year later he went twice to Milan, where he was treated for cancer at the expense of the Albanian government, by special decree of Prime Minister Berisha. He died of lungs and brain cancer. He was married to Leta and had two children, a son and a daughter, Besart and Bora.

It has these three purposes: # Remove dissolved oxygen (‚Äúair‚Äù) from the condensate # Pre-heat the feedwater # Provide a storage/surge volume Based on the relevant theoretical Rankine cycle diagram, there are four main processes, or steps: : 1 to 2 Water pressure is raised from low to high (pump work in) (feedwater pump) : 2 to 3 Water is heated to boiling (heat input) (steam generator) : 3 to 4 Steam is expanded in the turbine (work out) (turbine) : 4 to 1 Wet vapor is condensed (condensing) (surface condenser) In the practical implementation of a Rankine cycle, it is common to break the single pump (process 1 to 2) into three pumps: (in water flow order: condensate pump, feed booster pump and then feedwater pump).  Details  # Dissolved oxygen is removed by injecting auxiliary exhaust steam into the upper portion of the tank (above the feed water level) at roughly the same location (elevation) that the condensate enters the tank. The two are put in close physical contact over a large surface area to maximize heat transfer. As the condensate is heated, the steam drives off any dissolved gasses. Since the steam is injected above the feed water level a steam blanket forms above the water to keep the non-condensable gasses from re-entering the feed water. There is a connection to the gland exhaust system on the upper portion of the DFT that withdraws the oxygen and other non-condensable gasses as they are driven from the condensate. Removing oxygen minimizes corrosion and improves the vacuum quality. # The steam heats the water in the tank # The water in the tank serves as a surge volume within the steam plant. A surge volume allows the plant to change bells (power output level) without running the feed pump dry or flooding the turbines. Consider the plant running in a steady state condition. The bell is increased, more power output demanded, the rate of feed is increased. This draws more water from the condenser, perhaps to the point of being dry and starving the boiler resulting in a loss of propulsion. This is until the water, converted to steam, provides its energy to the turbine and then is condensed in the condenser. The bell is decreased, less power output demanded, the rate of feed is decreased. Since less water is drawn from the condenser the condensate level rises, covering more condenser tubes, reducing the ability of the condenser to maintain vacuum and, if the level is allowed to go high enough, vacuum could be lost and/or water could impinge (and damage) the turbine blades as the turbine normally sits directly above the condenser.

It was the site of the ski jumping, Nordic combined (K90/15.0) and team events for the 1956 Winter Olympics. The Nordic combined event used a shorter in-run to allow average jumps between 60 and 70 meters while the upper starting points on the in-run were calculated to allow jumps of 70 to 80 meters. The 1956 profile had a safety limit of 14.5 m beyond the critical point of 72 m. (transition from the landing slope curve to the out-run begins at a distance of 86.5 m). Among many national and international competitions starting with the 1927 World Championships, was the inauguration of the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup in 1979. Since the venue lost its FIS-certification in 1990, the installation lies dormant. In its day, the Cortina Ski Jumping hill was regarded as one of the most innovative and still today as one of the most architecturally beautiful examples still in existence. The stadium holds a maximum of 40,000 spectators in the arena and an additional 10.000 in the stands on each side of the hill. It was featured in a scene in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. History 2.5 km (2 mi) from Cortina, near Zuel, the \\"Italia\\" ski jumping hill (Trampolino Olimpico Italia) began its life in 1923 as the \\"Franchetti\\" Jump. That year, the Dolomites Sports Club, with a grant from Baron Carlo Franchetti and funds from the hotel owners of Cortina, constructed the first ski jumping installation with a modest wooden in-run platform which allowed jumps up to 40 meters.

It was one of the first backup services to use cloud storage and Amazon S3. In 2009 after being acquired by Rackspace the service added Rackspace Cloud Files. The name is a word association as the Amazon rainforest is a Jungle and Disk is a common shorthand for a hard disk drive. Backup service overview Jungle Disk backup is a monthly subscription software service that supports laptops, desktops, and servers for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Data is backed up to an online disk using either a continuous backup (aka. sync) or scheduled to back up of selected files, folders, or a everything on a system. Data can be accessed from the software client, a web browser, or mobile devices running Android or iOS. It also provides a WebDAV server for integration with other applications. Customers can protect their data using AES-256 encryption with their own key so even Jungle Disk employees cannot access any records. Each subscription includes 10 gigabytes of storage with pay-as-you-go for additional data. History Jungle Disk was founded in Atlanta by Dave Wright in 2006. On October 22, 2008, Jungle Disk entered into an agreement to be acquired by Rackspace Hosting, Inc. Rackspace purchased Jungle Disk in order to expand their cloud hosting services. After the acquisition integration Dave left Rackspace to found SolidFire and then Jungle Disk was relocated to San Antonio in 2010. The pace of development slowed down as Rackspace focused on its Cloud infrastructure software platform which became OpenStack. In 2013, Rackspace revived Jungle Disk customer support going from ticket only service to include phone, chat and ticketing. On January 5, 2016, Jungle Disk spun out of Rackspace US, Inc. and is now a privately held company headquartered in San Antonio, TX.

The important distinguishing feature of endurance games is that the object is to outlast one's opponents, rather than outdo them in any test of skill. Endurance games are common in schoolyards, as they provide a way for children to establish a pecking-order based on toughness. They are also a feature of hazing rituals in institutions where hazing is common. One playing an endurance game grants consent to other players' eventual harm to oneself.

The route piggybacks on different roads with many turns throughout its length. Route description SR 103 begins in the west at an intersection with SR 236 (which is itself a former alignment of SR 103 there) west of Eliot, near its intersection with SR 101 just southwest of the border between South Berwick and Dover, New Hampshire. For its first mile SR 103 heads south-southwest, until crosses Sturgeon Creek, a tidal inlet of the Piscataqua River, the state border with New Hampshire. There it turns southeast to parallel the river, meandering slightly inland southeast through Eliot and into Kittery, which it enters on the causeway over Spinney Creek, which divides the two towns there. SR 103's first intersection is two-thirds of a mile later at Dennett Road, where it T's right and passes underneath U.S. Route 1 Bypass. SR 103 continues southeast, intersecting US 1 just north of the Memorial Bridge connecting Kittery with Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Continuing east, SR 103 meets SR 236 at its southern terminus.

He translated many philosophical works from Pali, Sanskrit and specially from Chinese into German. Based upon his extensive research in Indian Buddhism and Chinese religion, one of his main conclusions was that early Chinese Buddhism through Ch'an (Zen-) was not a Chinese version of Indian Buddhism, but rather, that it developed from Taoism, a Chinese religion. Indian concepts are present, but at the core it represents a Chinese perspective.Prof.Dr.Tilemann Grimm, \\"Prof.Dr.Walter Liebenthal on his 95th Birthday\\", Attempto 66/67, p.73, (1980), edited by University of T√ºbingen Walter Liebenthal, 1968  Biography  Walter Liebenthal was born in 1886 in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), as son of Robert Liebenthal, attorney-at-law, and Grete Becken. He married Charlotte Oenike in 1914 and they had 4 children: Frank, Ludwig, Johanna and Walter. He had a varied career path. He started to study law, but he soon followed his artistic inclination and became a sculptor in 1907. In 1914, with the outbreak of First World War, he volunteered for the Prussian Army. He was wounded twice and he was eventually made prisoner in France. He spent two years in captivity (1918‚Äì1920). Upon his return to Berlin in 1920, he started several ventures to make a living and sustain his family. Those were the difficult post-war years of the Weimar Republic. With friends he opened a movie theater, then tried to run a chocolate factory, a strawberry farm and eventually he also started to build movie decor. None of these ventures was profitable enough. But his wife was more successful with an embroidery factory for children clothes. She set up a workshop in their house and they could all live on its proceeds. During those years Walter Liebenthal met Dr.Paul Dahlke, who had founded the first German Buddhist monastery in Berlin-Frohnau in 1924 and he became deeply interested in Buddhism. He started a systematic study of Pali, Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese. Then in 1928, at the age of 42, he began Indological studies at the universities of Berlin, Marburg, Heidelberg, Halle and Breslau. Among his teachers and mentors were Dr.Johannes Nobel, Max Walleser and Otto Strauss. In 1933 he obtained his Ph.D. degree from the University of Breslau on the merits of a dissertation on ‚ÄúSatk√§rya as depicted by his opponents‚Äù. (see Publications). Upon his graduation, he was not able to get a university position in Germany due to the discriminatory laws of the Hitler regime at the time. In 1934 he obtained an appointment as a research fellow at the Sino-Indian Institute of Yenching University in Peking, China. Over the next two years he prepared a Chinese- Sanskrit Index to the Kasyapa-parivarta, but unfortunately it was lost during the 1937 occupation of Peking by Japanese forces. In 1937, he joined Peking University as lecturer in Sanskrit and German and followed it to its successive wartime seats in Changsha and Kunming. ‚ÄúOn returning to Peking in 1946 he published The Book of Chao which firmly established his reputation as a Sinologist ‚Äú.Liebenthal Festschrift, 1957, p.4 In 1952 he left Peking and moved to the Visva-Bharati University of Santiniketan in India, founded by Bengali writer, Rabindranath Tagore, first as a senior research fellow, and later as professor and director of the Department of Sino-Indian Studies until he became emeritus in 1959. On his seventieth birthday, the University of Santiniketan published a Festschrift, with articles from ‚Äúfellow scholars of Dr.Liebenthal the world over, who warmly responded to the idea of paying him their tribute‚Äù Liebenthal Festschrift, 1957, p.1 Preface Upon the death of his dear wife Charlotte in 1958, he decided to leave India.

Finally in 1962, at the age of 77, he settled in T√ºbingen (Germany), where he was invited to teach some courses and exercises by the directors of the Indological and East Asian Philological Seminars, Faculty of Philosophy, at the University of T√ºbingen.

Biography Barac graduated at the Faculty of philosophy at the University of Zagreb in 1917, and received his Ph.D. as a high school professor on Su≈°ak in 1918, with the thesis on Vladimir Nazor's poetry. Since 1930 he is a regular professor at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. He was accepted as a regular member of Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1947. He edited numerous scientific editions and anthologies, and has written high school handbooks together with Nazor. He served as a prorector of the University of Zagreb after his rectorship mandate expired (1950‚Äì1951). He was a significant contributor to modern Croatian literary theory, especially in the position of Croatian literature in the European context. He published numerous monographies on top Croatian artists such as Nazor, ≈†enoa, Vidriƒá or Ma≈æuraniƒá, a number of critic-essayist writings on lesser known writers, as well as great syntheses on Croatian literary criticism of the 19th century, and the unfinished history of Croatian literature from Croatian National Revival to the time of creation of Yugoslavia. A square in Novi Zagreb is named after him. Literary criticism Barac's valorisation of literature is based on the two tenets: the literature has to be an expression of a man in his totality, as an individual and social being, deeply covering the basic aspects of life. His other tenet is that the great art is born only out of the great pain. His studies were permeated by a specific national criterion, holding that every little literature to a more or less extent reflects the social life of its people, as opposed to the large national literature. This view is reflected in his well- known maxim on the greatness of the small.

The tests had proven that her controls were secondary personalities from her subconscious, organised around repressed material.Hornell Hart. (1959). The Enigma of Survival. Rider. p. 138 The psychical researcher Hereward Carrington with his colleagues also examined the trance controls in many s√©ance sittings.

One of the tests was organized by Joseph Rhine at Duke University in 1933 which involved Zener cards. Certain symbols that were placed on the cards and sealed in an envelope, and participants were asked to guess their contents.

Most of the experiments were carried out in the Psychological Laboratory at the University College London. A total of over 12,000 guesses were recorded but Garrett failed to produce above chance level. In his report Soal wrote: > In the case of Mrs. Eileen Garrett we fail to find the slightest > confirmation of Dr. J. B.

The experiments of Rhine and the Zener cards used in the 1930s were discovered to contain procedural errors and flaws, the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories.Charles M. Wynn, Arthur W. Wiggins. (2001). Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins. Joseph Henry Press. p. 156. \\"In 1940, Rhine coauthored a book, Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years in which he suggested that something more than mere guess work was involved in his experiments. He was right! It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester‚Äôs eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester‚Äôs facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections.\\"Terence Hines. (2003). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 122. \\"The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories.\\"James Alcock. (2011). Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair. Skeptical Inquirer. \\"Despite Rhine's confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine's work.\\" Science writer Terence Hines has written \\"the methods used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues as to the design on the cards were far from adequate.\\"Terence Hines. (2003). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 119‚Äì120. Leonard Zusne and Warren Jones wrote \\"the keeping of records in Rhine's experiments was inadequate. Sometimes, the subject would help with the checking of his or her calls against the order of cards. In some long-distance telepathy experiments, the order of the cards passed through the hands of the percipient before it got from Rhine to the agent.\\"Leonard Zusne, Warren Jones. (1989). Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking. Psychology Press. p. 158.  Controversy  On 7 October 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a s√©ance held with Harry Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident. The event \\"attracted worldwide attention\\", thanks to the presence of a reporter. Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further s√©ances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims. Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the s√©ances: > It is not my intention to discuss if the medium were really controlled by > the discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her > subconscious mind or those of the sitters. \\"Spirit\\" or \\"trance personality\\" > would be equally interesting explanations ‚Äì and equally remarkable. There is > no real evidence for either hypothesis. But it is not my intention to > discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a > remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment.Harry Price. (1933). > Leaves from a Psychist's Case-book. Gollancz. p. 132 In 1978, paranormal writer John G. Fuller wrote a book claiming that Irwin had spoken through Garrett.John G. Fuller. (1978). Airman Who Would Not Die. Putnam Publishing Group. This claim has been questioned. Magician John Booth analyzed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth, Garrett's notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints from a technician from the aerodrome. However, Melvin Harris, a researcher who studied the original scripts from the case, wrote that no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett's s√©ances were \\"either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobbledegook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist.\\" Harris discovered that the original scripts of the s√©ances did not contain any secret information and spiritualist writers such as Fuller had fabricated and misinterpreted content from these scripts. When experts and veteran pilots were shown the scripts they declared the information to be incorrect and technically empty. Archie Jarman, who had interviewed witnesses and wrote an 80,000-word report on the case, concluded that the information from the s√©ance was valueless, and that one should \\"best forget the psychic side of R-101; it's a dead duck‚Äî absolutely!\\"  Publications  * My Life as a Search for the Meaning of Mediumship (1938) * Telepathy in Search of a Lost Faculty (1941) * Adventures in the Supernormal: A Personal Memoir (1949) * The Sense and Nonsense of Prophecy (1950) * Does Man Survive Death (1951) * Many Voices: The Autobiography of a Medium (1968)  References  Further reading  * Whately Carington.

The bridge was designed by CCSHCC Second Highway Consultants Company, Limited. and built at a cost of 720 million yuan (approximately US$100 million).Wang 2009, p.65. \\"The bridge cost the Chinese government 720 million yuan (roughly U.S.$100 million). The design was engineered by CCSHCC, Second highway Consultants Company, Limited;which is based in Wuhan, China.\\" It opened to traffic on November 15, 2009. Geography The bridge is part of the new G50 Huyu Expressway that parallels China National Highway 318, an east-west route between Shanghai and Chongqing, crossing the wide belt of mountains that separate the Sichuan Basin from the lowlands of eastern Hubei. The Yangtze River pierces the same mountain belt to the north, forming the famous Three Gorges. The Yiwan Railway, completed in 2010 and running parallel to the highway, has been described as China's most difficult to build and most expensive (per km) rail line.Most expensive rail line in China becomes operational, 2010-12-22 The bridge spans a valley of the Sidu River (a left tributary of the Qingjiang River), and superseded the Royal Gorge Bridge and the Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge as the highest bridge in the world until it in turn was surpassed by the Duge Bridge in 2016. Design and construction Another view of the Siduhe River Bridge The bridge's design includes H-shaped towers, a truss-stiffened main span, and unsuspended side spans. The Warren-type trusses were constructed in 71 sections with the largest section weighing . The trusses are tall and wide.Wang 2009, p. 79. \\"A steel truss of the Warren type divided into 71 sections was used for the superstructure. The truss height is 6.5 m and the width is 26.0 m. The panel point spacing is 6.4 m, and the truss sections are connected at each panel point.\\" The height measurement from the bottom of the gorge has been reported as by Eric Sakowski, by Chongxu Wang, and by Yinbo Liu.It is not clear that these sources are measuring to the same point on the bridge. Some may be measuring from the bottom of the gorge to the top of the towers, explaining some of the discrepancies in the numbers reported. In addition to the numbers reported by Sakowski, Liu, and Wang, there are additional less-reliable sources on the internet that report the height at 560 m. The first part of the suspension cable installed, a rope known as the pilot cable, was the first-ever to be placed using a rocket. Conditions at the bridge's location would not allow the use of boats or helicopters, which have previously been used to string the first cable. The rockets carried the pilot cables across on October 6, 2006 and resulted in time and cost savings.Wang 2009, p. 80. \\"The installation of the main cables began with the placement of a pilot cable.\\" \\"Conventional methods for placing the pilot cable ... could not be used.\\" \\"An innovative cable placement method using a military rocket was developed.\\" \\"On October 9, 2006, two rockets were fired to take the two 1,300 m ropes made of chinlon, a highly elastic yarn, over the canyon, a distance of roughly 1,100 m.\\" \\"The entire process was completed in a short period‚Äîperhaps 10.00 seconds‚Äîand the cost savings were significant.\\" The main suspension cables are made of 127 parallel wire strands bundled into a hexagonal shape (127 is the sixth centred hexagonal number).

Most of the species are tropical, with terrestrial habitats, foraging in soil, leaf litter, most of the Southeast Asian species forage on the ground, and some on trees and hunting other ant species and termites. Most species of the genus are specialized predators of other ants, especially of immature stages.Gotwald WH (1995) Army ants: the Biology of Social Predation.

Zootaxa 3128: 1-46. Foraging raids undertaken by these ants occur both day and night, usually across the ground surface but occasionally also in trees. During raids, numerous workers attack ant nests in a small area, with several workers coordinating their efforts to carry large prey items back to the nest or bivouac. Species of Aenictus are generally small, monomorphic and yellow to dark brown.
