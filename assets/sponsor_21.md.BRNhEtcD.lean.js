The film stars Jeremy Sisto, Kate Ashfield, Ryan Simpkins, Ty Simpkins, Eric Michael Cole, and Amy Smart. The film had its world premiere at SXSW on 14 March 2015. The film was released on video on demand and home media formats on 9 February 2016 by Alchemy. Plot A woman calls 911 to report an intruder in her home. Having already hanged the man of the house with a noose, serial killer Hangman instructs the woman to say she loves him before violently stabbing her. Hangman secretly records Aaron Miller, his wife Beth, their daughter Marley, and young son Max as they embark on vacation at the Burbank airport. Once they leave, Hangman breaks into the Miller family‚Äôs minivan and uses the vehicle‚Äôs GPS to drive back to their house. There, Hangman watches their home movies, installs hidden cameras, establishes a surveillance suite in the attic, and begins secretly living inside the Miller home. The Millers return home to find their house ransacked. Aaron also discovers a hangman drawn in ketchup on the shower tiles as well as a mannequin torso hanging from a rope in the attic. As the Millers put the house back together and resume their regular lives, Hangman continues living there in secret while regularly stalking the family members as they sleep. Hangman also secretly follows Beth and Marley when they go out in public. Beth starts hearing noises and seeing clues around the house suggesting that someone might still be there as Hangman deliberately moves and manipulates items to keep the family suspicious and unsettled. While alone in the house to fix the toilet, handyman Miguel finds one of Hangman‚Äôs cameras embedded in the bathroom wall. Hangman surprises Miguel from behind and suffocates him with a plastic bag. Hangman scares Beth with a popped light bulb to stop her from investigating the attic after she hears another strange sound. Beth suggests purchasing a gun to feel safe and Aaron agrees. Marley notices Hangman recording her while she makes out with her boyfriend Miles at a Lovers‚Äô Lane. Miles confronts Hangman, but the teenage couple drives away when they become creeped out by his unresponsiveness. Aaron and Beth host dinner for Beth‚Äôs friend Melissa and Melissa‚Äôs husband. While the quartet dines, Hangman goes through Melissa‚Äôs purse. Max is woken by banging on the roof. Beth notices that someone urinated on the floor in the upstairs hallway and assumes it was Max. Hangman steals the report card Marley was hiding from her parents and puts it on Aaron and Beth‚Äôs bed. Marley blames Max for giving the report card to their parents. While cleaning Max‚Äôs bedroom, Beth finds a drawing of a faceless man dressed in black. Max explains that the figure is Jimmy, a man who sometimes visits him in his dreams. Max also claims that Jimmy told him Melissa is not the good person that she seems to be. Hangman masturbates and cries to himself while watching Aaron and Beth have sex. Hangman drugs a bottle of wine and does something unseen to Beth while she is unconscious. Hangman has an emotional breakdown while perusing a Miller family photo album. He later puts lipstick on one of Aaron‚Äôs shirts and also places a condom in the pocket to present an appearance of infidelity. Hangman follows Marley and Miles to the carousel at Griffith Park and murders Miles in the bathroom. He then sends Marley a text from Miles‚Äô phone to make it look like the boy stormed off in anger. Beth discovers that she is pregnant. After Beth finds the shirt Hangman tampered with, Max tells his mother that Jimmy saw Aaron kissing Melissa. Beth confronts Aaron over his presumed affair when Aaron comes home. Their argument is interrupted by noises upstairs. Aaron grabs the gun when he realizes that there is an intruder in their home. He investigates the attic, but Hangman kills Aaron and drops his body from a noose. Holding Beth at gunpoint, Hangman assumes Aaron‚Äôs identity and instructs Beth to say she loves him. After Beth says, ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù Hangman shoots her in the head. Hangman returns to the airport with his video camera and begins stalking another family as they leave for vacation.

Malay involvement in Philippine history goes back to the Classical Era with the establishment of Rajahnates as well as the Islamic era, in which various sultanates and Islamic states were formed in Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, and around Manila. Malays made large contribution to Philippine history, and influenced modern-day lifestyles of Filipinos. The Malay language was the lingua franca of the archipelago prior to Spanish rule. Due to the religious history of the Malay Archipelago. Although the modern Philippines does not have a huge majority or minority of Ethnic Malays today (Filipinos who identified as Ethnic Malay make up 2% of the total population), the descendants of Ethnic Malays have been assimilated into the wider related Austronesian Filipino culture, characterized by Chinese and Spanish influence, and Roman Catholicism. Malay cultural influence is still strong in the culturally conservative regions of Mindanao, southern Palawan, the Sulu Archipelago, and to some extent in rural of the Visayas and Luzon, where much Malay involvement and intermixing came during the classical era. In the modern-day, the closest cultural population to Malays are the Moro peoples, the native Islamized populations of the Philippines that inhabit Mindanao, Sulu Archipelago, parts of Visayas and Metro Manila and its environs. They follow a culture and lifestyle somewhat similar to Malays (predominantly in dress code and religion), although this culturally differs in the areas that these groups follow traditions native to or unique to the Philippines, such as cuisine, traditional music, and language (which belong to the Visayan, Danao, and Sangiric branches of Philippine languages, and Sama-Bajaw languages). There is an often a lot of confusion in the Philippines between \\"ethnic Malays\\" and \\"Malay race\\", a term coined for brown-skinned Austronesian natives of not only the Philippines, but also of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and southern Thailand. The country had its own Malay nationalism, un-associated with the anti-colonial struggle in the British and Dutch East Indies. The Philippine nationalism occurred albeit the end of Spanish occupation and spearheaded by Jos√© Rizal. Unlike the Malay nationalism and \\"Malayness\\" in Indonesia and Malaysia which was defined by Islam as well as being of the ethnic group, Rizal's movement was that of a secular vision to unify the natives of the Malay Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula, believing them to have falsely been divided by colonial powers. History Malays from Terangganu in the Philippines, c. 1590 Boxer Codex Interaction between the natives of the Philippines and the Malay Srivijaya Kingdom (as well as the Javanese kingdoms of Majapahit and Medang) are recorded by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, which dates approximately 900 A.D. This steel plate was written in a mix of Old Tagalog, Old Malay and Javanese. Among the Malays, the classical Philippine kingdoms also interacted with other native peoples of Indonesia, including the Minangkabau and Javanese. The first-recorded Malay in Philippine history was Sri Lumay, although accounts him are mostly in Visayan folklore. Sri Lumay was born in Sumatra, an island in Indonesia with a high Malay-population, and was of mixed Malay and Tamil descent.The Rajahnate of Cebu, The Bulwagan Foundation Trust. He settled in somewhere in modern-day Visayas. Sri Lumay established the Rajahnate of Cebu. His sons also ruled nearby regions and kingdoms. The name \\"Visayas\\" originates from the name \\"Srivijaya\\", the name of the aforementioned ancient Malay kingdom of the same that was centered in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Upon the Islamization of the southern Philippines, Sri Lumay was known to have resisted the Islamic expansion, and enacted a scorched-earth policy for the Moro raiders. In the 16th century, the Islamization of the Alam Melayu (literally \\"Malay realm\\") was near-complete and its influence had spilled into the Philippines. Sharif Kabungsuwan, a native of Johore migrated to Mindanao where he preached Islam to the inland natives - and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao.http://www.mnlf.net/History/The%20Maguindanao%20Sultanate.htm His descendants provided Mindanao with a fierce resistance to Spanish occupation, one of his descendants, Muhammad Dipaduan Kudarat is known as a national hero in the Philippines. The late 15th century and through 1521 is filled with preachers of Islam, particularly Malays, along with Arabs, Chinese Muslim and Indian Muslims spreading Islam in the southern Philippines. During the reign of Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei, the Bruneian armies attacked the Kingdom of Tondo and established the Kingdom of Selurong, or Seludong where modern-day Manila is located. This was a Bruneian satellite state, and was placed under the rule of Rajah Sulayman, a native Muslim from the Manila area. Rajah Sulayman came from a long line of rulers, of mixed Tagalog and Malay descent. His grandfather for example, Salila, was a descendant of the Bolkiah family from Brunei. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Visayas where he encountered Rajah Humabon, one of Sri Lumay's descendants. Humabon accepted Roman Catholicism, and urged his rival Lapu-Lapu to allow Europeans. Magellan used his Malay servant, Enrique of Malacca to converse with the natives. Magellan and Enrique both perished in the Battle of Mactan. Pan-Malayan movement Throughout the 300 years of Spanish colonization, any sort of Malay identity was lost in assimilation, even in the Muslim south where Arabic was the favored and promoted language over Malay. Jos√© Rizal, an avid pan-Malayan nationalist spearheaded a movement to \\"re-unite\\" the natives of the archipelago with that of its southern neighbors in what would today become the countries of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and Thailand. This type of \\"Malayan\\" movement was significantly different than the one that took place in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. While those movements were focused on the lone ethnic group originating from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, Rizal envisioned a larger pan-Austronesian nation, what would later become coined as the Malay race. Rizal's movement was known as the \\"Indios Bravos\\", (\\"Brave Indians\\"). Rizal had actually tried to learn Malay, but he was executed in 1896, therefore never getting a chance to fully revive the Malay language in the Philippines. Wenceslao Vinzons, a Filipino politician and guerrilla leader during World War II, was another noted pan-Malayan nationalist. He found the Perhimpoenan Orang Melayu (\\"Pan Malay Alliance\\") at the University of the Philippines. It is for this reason that definition of \\"Malay\\" in the Philippines differ from that of its southern neighbors, therefore making it difficult to get an accurate estimate of who contains descent from the actual ethnic group. As for \\"Malay race\\", this would cover approximately 90,000,000 natives in the Philippines. Religion Historically, the Malays in the Philippines followed the religious trend of Maritime Southeast Asia. They followed a mix of Animism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Paganism. They introduced cultural influence from the Indian Subcontinent. In the late 15th century through the 16th century, the Islamisation of the Malay realm also influenced the Philippines, and the Malays introduced Islam. Sharif Kabungsuwan, a Johor-born native of Malay and Arab descent introduced Islam. Rajah Sulayman, the ruler of Seludong, was a Muslim convert. During the Spanish occupation, the overwhelming majority were converted to Christianity, Roman Catholicism to be specific. Enrique of Malacca, a Malaccan Malay who accompanied the Portuguese conquistador Ferdinand Magellan to Cebu, was a convert to Roman Catholicism, though he wasn't converted in the Philippines and was already a Catholic convert upon arrival. Rajah Humabon, a descendant of Sri Lumay, as well as Lakan Dula of Tondo, both converted to Catholicism and were given the names \\"Carlos\\". Modern misconceptions It is understood in Malaysia and Indonesia that Malays, as in the ethnic group, are those who speak Malay as a native language. In Indonesia, Malay and Indonesian are regarded as two different languages. The Malay race, on the other hand, is not the same as the ethnic group, and simply refers to the Austronesian natives of Maritime Southeast Asia. Though the ethnic Malays are part of the bigger Malay Race. In the Philippines, there is misconception and often mixing between the two definitions. Filipinos consider Malays as being the natives of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Consequently, Filipinos consider themselves Malay when in reality, they are referring to the Malay Race. Filipinos in Singapore also prefer to be considered Malay, but their desire to be labeled as part of the ethnic group was rejected by the Singaporean government. This leads to misconceptions about the ancient rulers of the Philippines. Lapu-Lapu for example is sometimes thought to have been a Malay Muslim, though he was most probably ethnically Cebuano and his religious background most probably animist like his neighboring ruler Rajah Humabon. Though the Bangsamoro follows a Malay-influenced culture, they are also mistakenly called Malays by the majority of Christian Filipinos. Jos√© Rizal, the Philippines' most regarded national hero is often called the \\"Pride of the Malay Race\\". This gave rise to a political concept known as Maphilindo, a proposed confederation that would consist of Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. With the creation of ASEAN, this proposal never manifested.

The purpose of the Tramway was to link the historical city centre with the city's railway station, some 3 km away down the hill. The Mussolini government became very keen on trolleybuses, and in October 1943 Perugia's tramway was replaced with a Trolleybus service which would last till 1975. History Inspiration was drawn from the experience of Italy's first electrically powered tramcar introduced on the (originally horse-powered) Florence-Fiesole line earlier in the 1890s. A contract for the construction of the Perugia tramline was awarded on 10 April 1899 to the \\"Napoleone Pimpinelli\\" company, which executed the work under the supervision of Berlin based Siemens & Halske. The tramway construction was part of a larger project of urban modernisation which also included an aqueduct and an electricity supply network. Work progressed speedily and the tramway was formally opened less than six months later, on 20 September 1899, in the presence of the minister and future prime minister Antonio Salandra. At the time when the tramcars were delivered to the city's main station they had to be delivered to the storage location using ox carts, and until 1901 the service provided was intermittent because of constant interruptions to the electric power supply. The service was operated by Societ√† Anonima Elettricit√† Umbra (SAEU), a company operated by the German Siemens-Shukert group: SAEU was also the company that had taken care of the city's switch-over from gas lighting to electric lighting. The new tramway was not universally welcomed, since the city centre retains its Medieval street plan, which meant that even on the central Corso Vannucci (street) where tram rails were laid, they sometimes passed unnervingly close to peoples' shops and homes. On the other hand, the hill-top location of the city centre meant that children, periodically interrupted by a passing tram, could enjoy rolling and racing bowling balls down the tracks. The first timetables gave a journey time between the station and the city centre, and this proved sustainable not withstanding some vocal protests about the perceived danger the stability of the city's buildings from the vibrations of the trams rattling past. Relazione della Commissione nominata dal Municipio di Perugia per constatare, se il Movimento del tram nel Corso Vannucci abbia arrecato e possa arrecare danno ai dipinti delle Sale dell'antico collegio del cambio Perugia report by Giuseppe Bellucci, Perugia, 1905. There were also sometimes journeys involving good wagon from the national rail service being towed into the centre by the municipal trams. (It was not possible for standard Italian railway locomotives to operate on the tramway because the gauge of the tramway was narrower than the national railway system's standard gauge.) In 1929Marco Penchini, Nascita e sviluppo del servizio di elettricit√† a Perugia: la Societ√† Anonima Elettricit√† Umbra (1899-1929), in Uomini, economie, culture. Saggi in memoria di Giampaolo Gallo, a cura di Renato Covino, Alberto Grohmann, Luciano Tosi, Esi, Napoli, 1997, vol. II, pp. 217-241. Il responsibility for operating the tramway transferred from the SAEU to the Unione Esercizi Elettrici (UNES), a Rome based operation which by now was itself under the control of the IRI, the Italian state controlled holding company. In 1932 tram rails were removed from the northern end of the tramway, reducing its overall length by approximately 500 meters, clearing trams from the Corso Vannucci, and transferring the city centre terminus point from the Piazza Danti to the Piazza Italia. Ultimate ownership moved south in 1939 when the Unione Esercizi Elettrici (UNES) was sold to the Naples based Societ√† Meridionale di Elettricit√† (SME / Southern Electricity Company). It was not till 1943, however, that an urban transformation project that had been under discussion for some time came to fruition when, on 28 October, trolley buses replaced trams on the route of the former tramway. Characteristics The tramway's defining characteristics were imposed by the lay-out of the streets and by the city's topography. Over a total length of the route covered a change in altitude of , giving rise to an average gradient of 0.42%, which peaked at 0.72% where the line passed the Church of Sant'Ercolano. The street-plan called for some sharp changes of direction which made it necessary to employ a relatively narrow 1 Meter gauge, using Phoenix 42.8 kg/m rails with a tight minimum turn-radius of 20 meters. The tramway collected electricity from 550 volt overhead wires. Tramcars Eight twin axle electrically powered tramcars were acquired for the network from the , and fitted out appropriately. They were long and wide, with 24 seats. Six of the eight are described as incorporating a baggage trunk (Con bagagliaio laterale). Each tramcar was powered by two 26 kW Siemens motors. One of the eight tramcars was reserved for the exclusive use of the city's \\"Hotel Palace\\". There were four unpowered trailer-trams, each with two axles and 30 seats. Two of these had an open balcony at each end. There was also an open high sided wagon used to convey coal to the city's power station and there were two lighter trucks used for transporting mail. The route The original city centre tram terminus in the Pza. Danti Before the line was shortened in 1932 the city centre terminus of the tramline was at the Piazza Danti, in front of the cathedral. Until the tramline was installed the Piazza was known locally as the \\"Piazza del Papa\\" (\\"Pope Piazza\\"), which was a reference to the bronze statue of Pope Julius III by Vincenzo Danti that had to be repositioned to create space for the electric tram. From here the line followed the corso Vannucci to the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, which marked the start of a long descent along the viale Carlo Alberto (a street which has subsequently been renamed \\"viale Indipendenza\\"), passing the \\"Three Arches\\" and continuing to the Piazza d'Armi and passing close to the Porta Nuova. The route then followed the main road towards Cortona before turning south, ending up outside the main station. A branch line led to the city power plant in the via XIV Settembre, and was used for delivering coal.

Early life Kim Cheol-woong grew up in a prominent North Korean family. His father was the head of their provincial party, which is like a provincial governor, and his mother was a university professor. His grandmother was the founding president of the first and largest department store in Pyongyang until 1992. Kim‚Äôs musical skills were spotted at an early age. In 1981, at age eight, he was admitted into the Pyongyang University of music and dance. Over the next fourteen years, he suffered through rigorous training to perform tunes glorifying Kim Jong-Il. After his graduation, he was sent to Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow from 1995 to 1999 to study. Moscow was fascinating to the twenty-one year old who had not been exposed to music outside North Korea. He felt like he had discovered a new world. Upon his return home, he was named lead pianist in the State Symphony Orchestra. He also took a liking to Jang Song-thaek's niece, who had attended school with him since he was eight. Kim had only thought of her as a friend, until he returned home from Russia. Planning on proposing to her, Kim practiced \\"'A' Comme Amour,\\" a romantic number by pianist Richard Clayderman. A song commonly played in elevators, restaurants, and hotel lounges around the world and especially popular in east Asian countries. Defection In October 2001, as he was practicing the song, someone reported him to the State Security Department. Because of his parents status, all he had to write was a ten page self-criticism paper, but it still took a heavy toll on him. Unlike the Koreans who left due to famine, Kim, who had enjoyed a life of privilege, fled because of his unhappiness about his treatment as an artist. He took a leave from the symphony saying he had a relative pass away and he told his parents he was going to another city to perform. His mother had hid some American money, about 2000 dollars, which he took when he left. Kim was told if he crossed the Tumen River, he could get to the free world through China. He headed toward the river and had no trouble at ID inspection points because he was a Pyongyang citizenship card holder. Arriving at the river in the middle of the night with the 2000 dollars, he was found by the undercover army. He remembered the 2000 dollars and gave it to them. In turn, they helped him cross the river and directed him to a small village. There, he informed the people he could play piano, but they did not care, they needed someone to work. So he worked, cutting and harvesting rice and woodcutting at a lumber mill.  Life in China  In the spring of 2002, a fellow defector informed him of a church run by a Korean-Chinese pastor. The church had a piano. He joined the underground bible study group in an effort to play the piano. The church also provided food and shelter for the refugees. He couldn‚Äôt help from crying when he saw the piano. The pianist wouldn‚Äôt let him touch it at first, not believing he knew something about the instrument. Others petitioned on his behalf and he was allowed to play. While living in China, he learned South Korea would provide refuge for North Korean defectors. He had the missionaries from the church he attended make him a fake passport. However, he was caught by immigration authorities trying to get out at the Beijing airport, spent 3 months in Chinese prison, and put on a train to be sent back to North Korea. He miraculously escaped through the window after the police unbound him to let him use the restroom. Two months later, he was detained in China as he tried to cross into Mongolia. After spending another six months in prison, he was sent to a North Korean prison camp. The investigator who was in charge of him, knew who he was. The investigator said he knew his father. The investigator had attained his position only a month earlier because of Kim‚Äôs father. Thanks to the investigator, he was categorized as an ordinary person, not as Kim Cheol-woong. He was released three days later. Right after he was released, he went to the Tumen River. Kim bought another forged passport and this time the Chinese officials bought it.  Life after defection  In 2004, Kim began teaching at Hansei University. He later became known internationally as a concert pianist, and started his own orchestra in South Korea. April 17, 2009, he performed in a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall‚Äôs Zankel Hall in New York City fulfilling a dream he has had since defecting.

Players may attack their own race, however those who do so lose the support of their faction and become the so-called renegades for a period of time. The underlying principle of the game is quite common: each player is given a settlement, which needs to be developed, supplied with resources and defended against enemies. This MMORPG features establishing in-game unions ‚Äî the clans. The ¬´gold rush¬ª effect is encouraged by Black Gems, the game currency for purchasing various improvements. Races In the My Lands world, there are 4 races, each one with its own distinctive features, advantages and unique units. *Demons inhabit lifeless scorched volcanoes, have the highest stone mining speed, their special units include Demonesses, the unique mercenaries. Demons are allied with Drow. *Drow dwell in the caves of the Cursed Forrest, skilled in mining iron and wood, their special unit is Arachnid, the war mage. In cahoots with Demons. *Elves is a peace loving race residing in the Magic Forest; harvest the most wood, their special unit is Healer.

Allied with Elves. The game universe is divided into two big factions ‚Äì the Light Faction (Knights and Elves) and the Dark Faction (Demons and Drow). Cities and villages The very first city automatically becomes the capital of the player's kingdom. The city can be upgraded to 5th level which is the maximum level. Each city has 4 neighboring villages, in which buildings can be constructed. Cities cannot be seized, however players can capture Outer Domains belonging to other players. The capital has 51 cells for constructing buildings and cannot be removed as all rewards for quests are automatically placed in this exact city. However the capital status can be transferred to another city by means of studying the ¬´Capital transfer¬ª science. As the science studies continue, another 5 cities can be established. Each new city has 22 cells in the beginning. By means of upgrading the Main Building, the number of cells inside the city wall can be increased. However the city size cannot exceed the initial number of cells on the field this city was founded on. The player can remove any city, except for capital, at that all its buildings will be lost and troops leave for player's nearest city. Outer domains and Ruins In My Lands, Outer domains and Ruins cannot be seen on the map, unless discovered by player's Explorer units. The discovered objects are visible only to the player who discovered them and remain invisible to other players, unless they discover them too. Outer domains mine various types of resources: *Stone mine *Iron mine *Gold mine *Pit *Salt Lake *Grail Players can pillage Outer Estates (except for Salt Lakes and Grails), seizing half of their resources and population. To be able to seize an Outer domain, one needs to study the ¬´Outer domains¬ª science first. Other players can defend these domains and construct defensive buildings in there. In order to succeed in seizing such a domain, those buildings must be destroyed. Resources My Lands is an economic MMO RPG, therefore it players will need mine and control great amounts of resources. *Wood is harvested by the Main Building of the city and also by the Woodcutter cabin. *Crops are produced by Windmills. *Stone is mined in Stone Quarries, in the Main Buildings of Stone mines and sometimes in Pits. *Gold is produced in the following buildings: Trading Post, Gold Plant, Main Buildings of Gold mines and sometimes of Pits. *Iron is won in Iron mines, in the Main Buildings of Iron mines and sometimes of Pits. *Black Gems are a special resource in My Lands, which can be gained in the course of the game. The production speed for resources may vary depending on the parameters of the race chosen by player and on terrain mining bonuses. Black Gems Black Gems is the in-game My Lands currency which is bound to player's account, displayed in the upper right corner of the screen and acts as player's financial account. Black Gems can be earned in the course of the game and presented to other players. There are several ways to gain them in- game: *Capturing a Salt Lake. The main building in these Outer domains mine BG. *Black Gems can be robbed in Ruins by slaying all the monsters inside first. *Black Gems can be gained in the economical way by buying them for gold at the Auction (the Market building). Black Gems cannot be robbed from players. Black Gems can be bought for real money, in order to speed up army training, city upgrades and for accelerated science studying which allows to advance faster in the game and to reinforce one's own kingdom. Sciences Sciences play a very important role in the game. They mark player's progress in the game: army, economy and player bonuses. The science studies require resources and time. To start studying a science, one needs to build one or a couple of buildings Alchemist Labs and choose the science to be studied in the Science window. Science is a resource common for all player's domains. The more Alchemist Labs are constructed, the higher is the science studying speed. Heroes Heroes are a unique war unit comparable to heroes from Travian. These units can lead player's army, ensure some remarkable bonuses and enable player to cast Scrolls and use Artifacts. In order to hire a hero, one must study the Hero managing science, construct the Tavern building and achieve the Captain rank. Tournaments Tournaments have been part of the My Lands gameplay from the very beginning. As years passed by, the tournaments have only evolved further.

The Education for All Goals set by UNESCO have been achieved by some countries but many millions of children remain out of school or with poor teachers. According to UNESCO and the OECD, developed and developing countries across the world are grappling unsuccessfully with the problem of providing up to date teacher education both Initial Professional Development and continuing professional development to a diverse and large workforce (450,000 in England, 1.3M in Pakistan in 2006). Teacher training Teachers have varied backgrounds making the targeting of professional development programmes difficult. Some may have little or no teacher training, others may have doctorates in specialist subjects but no training in pedagogy ‚Äì the science of teaching and learning. In other cases, teachers may be much more deeply knowledgeable having studied for their qualifications over four or more years. As well as varied backgrounds, teachers often work in remote areas. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD research across 20 countries (2009) confirms that improving the quality of teachers‚Äô knowledge (see Lee Shulman‚Äôs definition) is the intervention most likely to bring about improvements in learning and educational outcomes. A call for knowledge management for the worldwide education sector To address this problem, the OECD calls for the: ‚Äúcreation of ‚Äòknowledge-rich‚Äô, evidence-based education systems...in many countries, education is still far from being a knowledge industry in the sense that its own practices are not yet being transformed by knowledge about the efficacy of those practices.‚Äù (OECD, 2009, p. 3) Translational research and examples from the medical sector By way of contrast, the medical sector has established structures and processes worldwide addressing knowledge mobilisation. The concept of Translational research i.e. how research findings might apply in practice is much more developed in medicine than in the education sector. Systematic reviews and rapid evidence assessments Systematic reviews and rapid evidence assessment methodology are also well developed and engage tens of thousands of medical practitioners worldwide via the Cochrane Collaboration and the associated Cochrane Library. The Campbell Collaboration is the educational equivalent. Clinical Pathway approach The Clinical Pathway approach which appears well established in medicine as demonstrated by the Map of Medicine HealthGuides and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) pathways is embryonic in education with the MESHGuides initiative. The medical sector sets a standard for knowledge sharing that the education sector could aspire to. Access to knowledge for teachers in remote areas The above examples from the medical sector use information technology to connect up experts across the world for the benefit of all. With respect to teachers having access to online resources, even those in areas with no electricity or internet can access the latest online knowledge with a simple set up using a compujector and generator backed up by central support uploading materials to the hard disk in the compujector. The challenge is how to ensure knowledge about effective teaching in every subject, for every concept, for every type of learner is available to teachers at the time they need it. Teacher attrition Teacher attrition rates are high in some locations e.g. 40% in the UK in 2015. In the UK, it was reported in 2015 that 40% of teachers leave in their first year. Lack of professional development is cited by teachers leaving the profession as a major contributing factor. As the OECD suggests, more efficient knowledge management is suggested as a way to reduce losses to national economies due to pupil underperformance, teacher attrition and lack of continuing professional development to keep teachers up to date.

He was killed in hatred of the faith in Papua New Guinea during his work there amongst the people. He was beatified in 1984 after it was determined that he was killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith). One miracle is required for his canonization. Life Giovanni Battista Mazzucconi was born on 1 March 1826 in Lecco as the ninth of twelve children. He commenced his studies for the priesthood in 1845 and with several seminarians he underwent a course of spiritual exercises. It was at one such retreat that he met the Father Superior who served in India. This encounter had a profound effect on Mazzucconi who started to cultivate a desire to become a member of a group of missionaries. His desire was intensified in 1850 when Pope Pius IX asked the Milanese bishops to establish a workshop for the preparation of people for the missions. Mazzucconi was ordained to the priesthood in May 1850 and he became a member of the new Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions and embarked with several of them to Australia in March 1852. There two groups were established: one for the Island of Rook and the other to Woodlark Island. It was there that Mazzucconi immersed himself in the culture of the natives but the weather cut his studies short and he became ill; he was sent to Sydney for treatment. He returned to Woodlark Island but the natives ambushed him there with an axe on 7 September 1855. Mazzucconi approached them but the native nearest him struck him on the head with an axe. The natives proceeded to kill him and his fellows and he died of his wounds. Beatification The beatification process commenced in Milan with the introduction of two independent processes. This happened despite the fact that the cause for the Servant of God did not open on a formal level until 28 October 1975. Theologians and the members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints discussed the cause and came to the belief that Mazzucconi was killed in hatred of the faith. Pope John Paul II approved these findings. John Paul II beatified him in 1984.

Born in Innishannon, County Cork, O'Sullivan first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team before later joining the under-21 and junior sides. He joined the senior panel during the 1989 championship. O'Sullivan subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All-Ireland medal and one Munster medal. At club level O'Sullivan won several championship medals in all grades with Valley Rovers. Throughout his career O'Sullivan made 9 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1992 championship. Playing career Club After claiming the divisional junior championship title in 1988, O'Sullivan lined out with Valley Rovers against Newcestown in the subsequent championship decider. A narrow 0-11 to 1-6 victory gave O'Sullivan a championship medal in that grade. Immediately after securing promotion to the intermediate grade, Valley Rovers qualified for the decider in 1989. After leaking two goals to Kilbrittain in a seven-minute, Rovers fought back to take an interval lead of 3-6 to 2-3. Three more goals following in the second half, with O'Sullivan winning another championship medal following a huge 6-12 to 3-5 victory. Inter-county O'Sullivan first played for Cork as a member of the minor team on 16 May 1981 in a 2-6 to 0-16 Munster semi-final defeat by Clare. After two unsuccessful seasons as a minor O'Sullivan subsequently joined the Cork under-21 team. His two-year tenure in this grade also ended without success. By this stage O'Sullivan had also joined the Cork junior team. In 1987 he won a Munster medal following a 2-16 to 1-9 defeat of Tipperary. On 25 July 1987 Cork faced Wexford in the All-Ireland decider. A 3-11 to 2-13 score line gave Cork the victory and secured an All-Ireland medal for O'Sullivan. After being included as a substitute on the Cork senior team in 1989, O'Sullivan made his senior championship debut on 20 May 1990 in a 3-17 to 3-7 Munster quarter-final defeat of Kerry. He later won a Munster medal that year following a 4-16 to 2-14 defeat of Tipperary. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1990 pitted Cork against Galway for the second time in four years. Galway were once again the red-hot favourites and justified this tag by going seven points ahead in the opening thirty-five minutes thanks to a masterful display by Joe Cooney. Cork fought back with an equally expert display by captain Tom√°s Mulcahy. The game was effectively decided on an incident which occurred midway through the second half when Cork goalkeeper Ger Cunningham blocked a point-blank shot from Martin Naughton with his nose. The umpires gave no 65-metre free, even though he clearly deflected it out wide. Cork went on to win a high-scoring and open game of hurling by 5‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì21 giving O'Sullivan an All-Ireland medal. Cork surrendered their titles in 1991 and, after lining out in Cork's opening championship game against Kerry in 1992, O'Sullivan was subsequently dropped from the starting fifteen. He was a non-playing substitute as Cork claimed the Munster title following a 1-22 to 3-11 defeat of Limerick. O'Sullivan remained on the bench for Cork's subsequent All-Ireland final defeat by Kilkenny. O'Sullivan ended his inter-county career as a member of the Cork junior team in 1995.

He exercised his functions as a priest in Naples as both a pastor and theologian who was later known as the \\"Apostle of Calabria\\" due to his tireless apostolate and efforts in evangelization. His beatification was celebrated on 24 June 2012. Life Mariano Arciero was born in Terme in 1707 to the poor Mattia Arciero and Autilia Marmora. In his childhood he fostered a strong devotion to the Mother of God whom he called \\"Mamma bella\\". The local priest - Emanuele Parisio - took him under his personal care for educational purposes. Parisio instructed him and requested that he teach catechism to his fellow children. He later moved from his home to Naples in 1729 where he attended a Eucharistic Congregation that the Jesuit priest Francesco Pavone established; he enrolled in the congregation on 21 December 1729. It was in a Jesuit college he enrolled in that he did his philosophical studies and also studied literature. It was also during this time that Parisio took charge of his theological studies which allowed for him to be ordained to the priesthood on 22 December 1731. He soon became a model for his fellow priests: he was active in all charitable acts and visited hospitals and other places to be with his people for his pastoral mission. Gennaro Fortunato - the Bishop of Cassano - desired that Arciero be in his diocese. Arciero devoted himself to the education of children and was known for astonishing conversions. He spent hours teaching catechism to children as well as preaching. To that end he was known as the \\"Apostle of Calabria\\" due to his tireless apostolate. The bishop also named him as the first parish priest for Altomonte and then for the Annunciation church (under construction at the time) in Maratea. The death of Fortunato in 1751 prompted him to return to Naples. In 1768 he was named as the spiritual director for a diocesan congregation for the supervision of priests. He was later named as the director at the direction of Cardinal Antonio Sersale. Arciero spent much time in contemplation of the Eucharist and was known for his frugal manner of living. His dressing habits were kept to a minimum and he slept and ate little. Arciero died in 1788 at 4:00pm after suffering from ill health. Following his death Mary Frances of the Five Wounds saw the angels guide his soul to Heaven. His remains were kept in state for just under a week in order to accommodate the long stream of Neapolitans who came to see him as a farewell. His remains were later moved on 15 October 1950 to his hometown to the Santa Maria degli Angeli church. His remains were exhumed in that church on 28 January 2012 for canonical inspection and for the collection of relics. The reconnaissance - lasting about six hours - found most of the skeleton with the skullcap. Hair was found in addition to 25 teeth with two of those teeth still attached to the jaw. Pieces of his cassock were found as was a single button. Beatification The beatification process opened on 24 April 1830 under Pope Pius VIII and the late priest became titled as a Servant of God. Two local processes in Naples in addition to Salerno were held and both were validated on 30 September 1842 so that the cause could continue under the direction of the Congregation for Rites. Pope Pius IX approved his life of heroic virtue and proclaimed him to be Venerable on 14 August 1854. The miracle required for his beatification (a healing medicine and science fail to explain) was investigated from 11 February 1953 until 17 November 1954 in Campagna and received validation decades later from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 31 March 2008. Medical experts issued unanimous approval (7 out of 7) the healing in question to be a legitimate miracle on 4 March 2010; theologians agreed with the verdict on 19 November 2010 (also unanimous) as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 5 April 2011. It received final approval of Pope Benedict XVI on 27 June 2011 who appointed Cardinal Angelo Amato - the prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints - to preside over the beatification. It was held in Terme on 24 June 2012. The current postulator for this cause (since 2007) is Fr. Francesco Rivieccio.

He is emeritus research director for the CNRS, member of EMBO, member of the academia Europaea and the Brazilian academy of sciences. He is Professor honoris causa of University of Brasilia.  Biography  Scherrer obtained his PhD in biochemistry from Swiss Institute of Technology, Zurich (ETH). He worked as a research assistant for James Darnell at MIT, where in 1962 he discovered the existence of giant pre-ribosomal and pre- messenger RNA in animal cells,Scherrer, Klaus; Darnell, James E (1962) ¬ªSedimentation characteristics of rapidly labelled RNA from HeLa cells ¬ª Biochem Biophys Res Commun 7, 486‚Äì489Scherrer, Klaus (2003) ¬´ Historical review: The discovery of ‚Äògiant‚Äô RNA and RNA processing: 40 years of enigma ¬ª, In Trends in Biochemical Sciences 28, 566-571 and observed for the first time the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) into functional rRNA.Scherrer, Klaus; Lathman,H, Darnell, James E (1962) ¬´ Demonstration of an Unstable RNA and of a Precursor to Ribosomal RNA in Hela Cells¬ª in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 49, 240‚Äì24,8 These discoveries made it possible to understand a fundamental process in nucleated cells, the synthesis of precursor RNA that is then metabolized in order to extract the information to be expressed. With Sheldon Penman, he demonstrated the existence of messenger RNA in polyribosomes. In 1963, he joined Fran√ßois Gros at the Institut Pasteur and, later, at the Institut de biologie physico-chimique (IBPC) in Paris, before founding in 1967, the molecular biology department at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in Lausanne. At the IBPC, he studied the structure of giant RNA of the messenger type in cell differentiation (avian erythroblasts) and formulated the hypothesis of the existence of pre-messenger pre-mRNA by analogy to pre-rRNA.Scherrer, Klaus, Marcaud, L, Zajdela F, London, I.M & Gros, F (1966) ) ¬´ Patterns of RNA Metabolism in a Differentiated Cell : A rapidly Labeled Unstable 60S RNA with messenger Properties in Duck Erythroblasts\\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 56, 1571‚Äì1578 At ISREC he pursued the study of pre-rRNA and pre-mRNA, and extended his research to RNA-protein complexes (RNPs) of the pre-mRNP type, and of cytoplasmic mRNPs in active and repressed forms. Associated to the latter, he discovered with Nicole Granboulan the prosomes,Scherrer, Klaus, Bey, Faycal, (1994) ¬´ The prosomes (multicatalytic proteinases; proteasomes) and their relationship to the untranslated messenger ribonucleoproteins, the cytoskeleton, and cell differentiation ¬ª Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology, 49, 1‚Äì64 a \\"20S\\"-complex (with Mr around 720,000) built of 28 protein sub-units in a variable mosaic, associated to repressed mRNP of the cytoplasm, as well as to the pre-mRNP and the chromatin. Later, the same 20S particles were also identified (by other researchers) as the core of \\"26S\\"-proteasomes, where they are associated with 19S modules that regulate the enzymatic activity in relation to the ubiquitin-system. Back to France, he was nominated directeur de recherche at the CNRS and worked at Institut Jacques Monod where he develops from 1973 to 2001 the analysis of primary transcripts (pre-mRNA) and of their metabolism into RNA, functional in polyribosomes. He also studied prosome as regulating modules associated to pre-mRNA and to mRNA at the level of chromatine and the cytoskeleton. Based on the compositional variation of the 20S-particle in relation to physiology and pathology of cells, he developed a system of clinic diagnostics within the start-up ProSoma, SARL. At the theoretical level, Klaus Scherrer formulated, from 1964 onwards, the Cascade Regulation Hypothesis (CRH), which represents an attempt to integrate within a single schematic frame the theoretical requirements and the experimental observations that concern the regulation of protein synthesis in the eukaryotic cellsScherrer, Klaus, (1980) ¬´ Cascade Regulation: A Model of Integrative Control of Gene Expression in Eukaryotic Cells and Organisms. ¬ª. in Kolodny ed. in \\"Eukaryotic Gene Regulation\\", CRC Press, 1980, 1, 57‚Äì129 ..

Based on biochemical and molecular-biological methods, pushed to the their technological limits, Scherrer's early results were obtained before the advent of modern DNA technology and were thus met, at the time, with apprehension. However, since around 2005, modern post-genomic methods (ENCODE, high-C 3D-DNA analysis) have confirmed the early results and interpretationsScherrer, Klaus (2018) \\"Primary transcripts: From the discovery of RNA processing to current concepts of gene expression\\" - Review, Exp.

The school retained this name until after the canonization of Pope John Paul II in 2014 when the Archbishop of Gulu Archdiocese instructed that the name of the college should be changed to reflect the status of our patron. Hence, in July 2017, the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) officially changed the name of the College to St John Paul II College Gulu. The humble beginning of SJPIIC started as a dream in 1993 when the funding family recognized the need for quality secondary school in our region. Initial construction works started at the present site in Laliya Sub County in 1997, culminating with the opening of the school in the year 2000. Back then, the school started as an 'O' Level day school catering for students from neighboring villages. Where We Are From the humble beginnings in the year 2000, St John Paul II College has grown dramatically. The student enrollment went up from the paltry five to over 1,000 students while the number of teaching staff has grown to over 50, plus some 30 support staff. Currently, our students and staff hail from all parts of the Uganda, including student populations from the Republic of South Sudan, and Ethiopia. The total number of classrooms has increased from four to nineteen, while the number of dormitories grew from one to seven. Three fully equipped science laboratories are now in place. In addition, two well-equipped computer laboratories, a library and a new staff room block were constructed, together with an examination hall that seats over 300 candidates. Among the latest infrastructure is a 40-kilowatt solar mini grid supplying power 24/7 on the college campus. We have also upgraded our sports facilities, including paving the basketball court, while a new dining hall, expected to seat the entire student population, is presently under construction. The campus land has expanded from the initial 20 acres to over 50 acres. Lush planting of trees and decorative plant species underscore our enthusiasm for environment protection. Curricular and Co-curricular Programs Currently, St John Paul II College has a strong tradition of academic excellence. Over 40% of our 'A' level students annually obtain the maximum 03 principal passes in the UACE examinations, while up to 80% qualify for university entrance. In 'O' level, our first-grade passes in the UCE examinations have steadily increased from under 10% to over 30%. At St John Paul II College Gulu, we have a great reputation for the many opportunities for personal development of our students who enjoy vibrant programs of clubs, sports, expeditions/field trips, and bench-marking programs, among others. An Appreciation In the course of our journey of 20 years, we are heavily indebted to all our stakeholders who have, and continue to support our progress. Notable among these are the Archdiocese of Gulu and all its parishes, the Church of Uganda Diocese of Northern Uganda and the community of Laliya Sub County. In a special way, we acknowledge the contribution of, the Board of Governors of the school and the Board of Trustees, our old students and the current student community. To all of you and others, we cannot innumerate here, we wish to say 'THANK YOU' for the momentous journey we continue to travel together. Once again, Thank you!

Zeritu began her career at the age of 21, in 2005, as the 2005 Ethiopian general election changed the country's condition, she released \\"Athidebegn\\" accompanied the election and her eponymous album Zeritu became the most successful album all of time.  Early life  Zeritu Kebede was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 19 February 1984. Her father Kebede Woldegiorgis was an architect and her mother Engida Mitiku was a housewife, who was thirty years younger than her husband. Zeritu grew up in Gulele Area in northern Addis Ababa. She was brought up in a strict manner and isolated from the other children of the neighborhood. However, Zeritu spent most of her summers at her maternal grandparents who were very liberal and very close to their neighbors. There, Zeritu got the opportunity to meet and play with kids from families with different social statuses. As a young girl in a quiet house in Gulele, Zeritu read books voraciously, listened to country stories suggested by the house helps, played and watched football with her brother and spent time on trees watching birds and the neighborhood beyond the fences, in pursuit of entertainment. But music was what entertained and resonated with her the most. She went through her parents‚Äô collection of records and cassettes and listened to anything she found interesting. From her parents collections were, her father‚Äôs favorites Nat King Cole, Kassa Tessema, Mahmud Ahmed and others; her mother's collections of artists like Tom Jones, Muluken Melesse, and Donna Summer. She also collected cassettes which introduced her to artists like Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Michael Bolton, Boyzone, Tracey Chapman and Bob Marley. Zeritu attended Lazarist Catholic elementary school.  Career  Zeritu became interested in music since she was a young. She went on stage for the first time while she was a fifth grader, singing a Michael Jackson's song, \\"Will You Be There?\\" Later, she started writing songs and short plays with her friends and performing them. That is the time she decided that it is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. While still in high school, Zeritu and her friends made their first money from \\"Yegeterua Emebet\\", a song they co-wrote and performed, which was to be made a sound track for a program on ETV on the issue of early and forced marriage, although the program never aired for unknown reasons. After high school, Zeritu decided to start singing professionally. Through her connection with Henok Mehari, a singer and keyboard player, she went on to join Sweet Band.

Cary married three times and had seven children, three with his first wife Sarah Sclater and four with his second wife, Ann Edwards. Construction Cary became visibly active in construction after his father's retirement in 1710 and in December 1720 he was authorized to work on the Governor's Palace, in Williamsburg, Virginia, a project that his father had begun but was unable to complete. This was one of several jobs that Cary performed at Williamsburg and in 1726 he was hired to construct new gates for the Capitol. He went on to oversee the construction of several buildings at the College of William & Mary (also in Williamsburg): a chapel wing (1729) and the President's House (1732), and Cary was also likely in charge of constructing the Brafferton building (1723). Around 1733, Cary moved to the bank of the James River, where he built Ampthill, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, which served as the Cary family home for many generations.

He ensured that the party leaders were loyal to Joseph Stalin and followed the instructions of Moscow. He was ruthless but discreet, and stayed out of the public eye. Life 1900‚Äì21: Early years Eugen (Jen≈ë) Fried was born on 13 March 1900 in Trnava, in what is now eastern Slovakia, to a family of Jewish small traders. He was a gifted student, and graduated from secondary school in 1917. He started to study chemistry at the University of Budapest but was unable to graduate due to the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918. He joined the Bolsheviks and from March to July 1919 participated in the revolution of B√©la Kun that established the Hungarian Soviet Republic. When the republic collapsed he took refuge in the new country of Czechoslovakia. 1921‚Äì29: Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Fried joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSƒå, Komunistick√° strana ƒåeskoslovenska) when it was founded in 1921. He was assigned to Ko≈°ice, capital of eastern Slovakia, where he was an activist until 1924. In 1924 he made an illegal visit to Moscow to attend the fifth Congress of the Communist International (Comintern). He was arrested some time after returning and sentenced to thirty months in prison. He was imprisoned from 1925 to 1927. In 1927 he married a young Slovak activist. Fried was a cultured and well-read man with wide interests who spoke several languages. He was elegant, well-dressed, courteous, soft-spoken and ruthless. After his release Fried was assigned to Liberec in Bohemia, in the west of the country, since he was too well known in Slovakia . He had become a professional revolutionary and an admirer of Stalin. Dmitry Manuilsky, one of Stalin's representatives in the Comintern, noticed Fried and gave him increasingly responsible tasks. By June 1928 Fried was responsible for purging the KSƒå of leaders who were not sufficiently obedient to Moscow. In December 1928 he was assigned to the KSƒå Secretariat and given the task of imposing a leadership loyal to Stalin. He left his wife in 1929 when Dmitry Manuilsky called him to join the Comintern in Moscow. He was accused of leftism by the Comintern in December 1929 but was restored to favor after writing a self- criticism. 1930‚Äì39: Pre-war French Communist Party Fried was appointed Comintern \\"referent\\", responsible for overseeing the French Communist Party (PCF, Parti communiste fran√ßais), at the end of 1930. He took the pseudonym of \\"Cl√©ment\\". From 1931 to 1942 Fried played a leading role in the PCF. At this time the PCF was in disarray. Fried's instructions were to eliminate the social-democratic and anarcho-syndicalist elements, and prevent the Trotskyists from gaining influence. He was to resolve rivalry, eliminate unsound elements and install men loyal to Moscow at the head of the party. Fried, a charming and persuasive man, achieved these goals within a few years. He removed Henri Barb√© and Pierre C√©lor and advanced Maurice Thorez, Jacques Duclos, Beno√Æt Frachon and Andr√© Marty. After making Thorez the official party leader, Fried stayed out of the limelight but was the true leader of the PCF. Thorez and Fried both attended the Anti-Fascist Workers' Congress and the 7th World Congress of the Comintern, but Thorez was the public face of the party. The Cadre Commission (commission des cadres) was set up to \\"verify\\" comrades and ensure \\"that a thing was what it was supposed to be\\" ‚Äì to root out informers and politically unreliable members. One technique was to require that all PCF members fill out an autobiographical questionnaire, which could then be analyzed. Early in 1933 Maurice Tr√©and was made secretary of the PCF's Cadre Commission. The Cadre Commission was somewhat secretive, and worked directly with Fried, Thorez and the Comintern's agencies. In 1934 Fried removed Jacques Doriot, whom the Soviet Union thought had been too hasty in denouncing the growing Nazi threat in Germany. However, within a year the PCF was supporting the Comintern's Popular front program. After the 1936 French elections Fried directed the PCF to support the government of L√©on Blum without participating in it. He downplayed the Stalinist purges of the late 1930s, and explained the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union to the party leaders. 1939‚Äì43: World War II World War II (1939‚Äì45) broke out at the start of September 1939. The Executive Committee of the Communist International communicated to the French and British communists parties through Fried explaining that the war was not one of democracy versus fascism, but was a war between imperialist powers, and \\"... the primary issue is the struggle against capitalism‚Äîthe source of all wars‚Äîagainst the regime of bourgeois dictatorship in all its forms, and above all in your own country...\\" On 26 September 1939 the government of √âdouard Daladier outlawed the PCF. Thirty five communist deputies and thousands of communist activists were arrested in the months that followed, and more than 3,000 communist refugees were interned as undesirable foreigners. Fried arranged for Thorez to escape to the Soviet Union via Belgium. He established himself in Brussels and continued to direct the PCF from there. In Brussels Fried created a clandestine Comintern base for all of Western Europe, in contact with Moscow through radio-telegraph and in control of the clandestine PCF. In May 1940 the Germans invaded France, which agreed to the armistice of 22 June 1940. That day Fried received a detailed directive from Comintern leader Georgi Dimitrov and Thorez on what could be done to resist the German occupying forces. Immediately after the occupation, some of the French communists tried to obtain permission from the Germans to legally publish their journal, l'Humanit√©. It was not until early August 1941 that Fried was directed to break off all contact with the German authorities. The leadership of the French Communist Party in the period between the occupation of France and the German invasion of Russia on 22 June 1941 was divided between three locations. Secretary-general Maurice Thorez was in Moscow with Andr√© Marty. In Paris the clandestine party was directed by Beno√Æt Frachon, aided by Arthur Dallidet. In hiding in Brussels were Jacques Duclos, who became the political leader of the party, and later the leader of the Communist Resistance, Maurice Tr√©and and Eugen Fried. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Fried received cipher communications in which communists in Western Europe were told to \\"use all ways and means to make the people rise up and fight the occupiers\\" including demonstrations, strikes and sabotage. The Red Orchestra was a major Soviet intelligence network that operated throughout Western Europe. In December 1941 Dimitrov gave Fried instructions to contact the Red Orchestra head, Leopold Trepper. The meeting fell through since the Gestapo had taken the radio station of the Red Orchestra in Brussels and Trepper had fled to Paris. Further arrests took place in July 1942, and several agents were betrayed. Eugen Fried was assassinated in Brussels by the Gestapo on 17 August 1943. His true identity was not known at the time. After his death the post-war French communist leaders largely ignored the role he had played.

Its 2,710 gendarmes protect people and property in rural areas, control roads and communications and contribute to provide assistance to the population in emergencies.  History  The Gendarmerie traces its origins to the establishment of the \\"garde indig√®ne\\" (native guards) on 2 February 1915. On 28 June 1925, it became the \\"compagnie de milice indig√®ne\\", later renamed the \\"garde togolaise\\". By 1933, it had become the \\"service de police urbaine et rurale\\". On 17 September 1942 Togolese troops were included in the foundation of the Gendarmerie de l‚ÄôAfrique Occidentale Fran√ßaise (AOF), the colonial gendarmerie. In 1963, the force was integrated into the armed forces and divided into two forces, the Gendarmerie territoriale, and the Gendarmerie mobile. In August 1965, the two were merged into the Gendarmerie nationale togolaise and remained in this form until 1995 when it was reorganized, and again in 2008.  Organisation  right The GNT is divided into central and regional bodies: * Central bodies (Organes centraux) are primarily located in Lom√©. They include:  The Direction g√©n√©rale (Director-General's staff)  Legions of the Gendarmerie Nationale (including 1 assigned to the capital).  The Garde R√©publicaine.  The Groupement des formations sp√©cialis√©es de la Gendarmerie (Specialist units)  The Ecole Nationale de Gendarmerie (National Gendarmerie School) * Regional bodies (Organes r√©gionaux) Since October 2014, the country is divided into two Gendarmerie regions, mirroring the military regions. The first region includes the Maritime and Plateaux regions. The second the Centrale, Kara and Savanes regions. Both Gendarmerie regions are in turn subdivided into five sectors.  The Togolese L√©gion de gendarmerie (LG)  In Togo, the L√©gion de Gendarmerie is a command structure. It includes all territorial and intervention units established in a collection of administrative regions. LGs are commanded by a senior officer, named by ministerial decree.  The Garde R√©publicaine togolaise (GRT)  The Garde R√©publicaine togolaise (Togolese Republican Guard) is a command unit of the GNT. Similar to the French Garde r√©publicaine, the GRT provides protection to the Togolese Head of state and members of the government.  Contribution to Electoral Security  The Force de S√©curit√© Elections Pr√©sidentielles (FOSEP) is a joint police-gendarmerie security force answerable to the electoral commission and under operational command of the ministry of defence. It was first established to provide security for the 2010 presidential elections. The Gendarmerie nationale contributed about 3000 of the first 6000 members of the FOSEP, as well as its commanding officer, a Gendarmerie lieutenant-colonel. For the 2015 elections the FOSEP was re-established, numbering about 8000 members. The UNDP has contributed to funding the training of the force. The Force s√©curit√© √©lection 2018 (FOSE) was stood up in August 2018 in preparation for the Togolese elections of December 2018. Headed by Mawuli T√™ko Koudouwovoh, Director-General of the Togolese National Police, the force numbered about 8000 gendarmes and police officers.  Armament  With the exception of the Manurhin MR 73 revolver issued exclusively to the Garde R√©publicaine and the Unit√© Sp√©ciale d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie, Togolese Gendarmes are issued the same sidearms as the Togolese Land Forces.

Releasing in both CD and digital editions, it is the first single recorded in 2015 as well as her second single release after Mondai Girl and contains songs tied into several commercials.http://tokyogirlsupdate.com/kyary-pamyu-pamyu-11th- info-20150750351.html \\"Crazy Party Night (Pumpkin no Gyakush≈´)\\" is the trademark song used for Kyary's live nationwide tour, Crazy Party Night Tour. In 2017, she embarked a world tour titled \\"The Spooky Obakeyashiki: Pumpkins Strike Back\\". It is possible that the Crazy Party Night Tour acted as a precursor for the latter. Background, production and release \\"Crazy Party Night (Pumpkin no Gyakush≈´)\\" is Kyary's second release in 2015 following her previous single \\"Mondai Girl\\". With the song being Halloween themed, composer Yasutaka Nakata stated the song was inspired by Kyary‚Äôs love for fashion and dressing up and the title being a reference to the Japanese club culture of the '90s. Kyary‚Äôs new tour reimagines a crazy night experience, and offers fans a chance to enjoy Kyary‚Äôs music like dance music played at clubs. The song was later used as a promotional song for Coca-Cola Japan for their 2015 Halloween campaign.http://okmusic.jp/news/91387 Alongside the main song, it also includes other 3 songs composed by Nakata himself. These songs are used in several commercials: \\"No No No\\" for Ezaki Glico's Ice no Mi commercial, \\"Oshiete Dance Floor\\" for the Sharp Corporation's Aquos 4k LCD TV commercial in Japan and \\"Kimama\\" for the new Japanese commercial of Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Music video Synopsis 'Crazy Party Night (~Pumpkin no Gyakush≈´~)' starts off with a figure sitting in a rocking chair who turns on the TV. The channel is showing \\"news reporter Kyary\\" who is outside a house preparing herself for broadcast. She then introduces herself and then leads the crew inside. As reporter Kyary enters the house, she encounters many weird \\"cute ghosts,\\" such as the Red Dog (he looks like a bear), the TV, the Robot, and the Cake-head ghosts, as well as a rainbow-colored zombie. The zombie notices her and lunges at news reporter Kyary and scares her, making her eyes pop out in a cartoonish manner. The zombie then tries to tackle her but she evades. Two zombies then chase her, so reporter Kyary tries escaping through a door as the chorus starts. As she enters the main room, reporter Kyary finds \\"ghost Kyary\\" is leading a dance of the cute ghosts, singing the chorus. There are additional ghosts there, such as the Candy-head and Pumpkin-head ghosts. Reporter Kyary is dancing to the song as the chorus finishes. Returning to news reporter Kyary, she leaves the main room and encounters the robot in the hallway, and attempts to interview him, but the zombies attack the TV crew, bringing the soundman to the ground. Reporter Kyary screams and runs back to the main room where ghost Kyary begins the chorus again. Reporter Kyary is mobbed by the cute ghosts, and when they draw back, ghost Kyary is there (did she transform?), and continues the chorus, but then news reporter Kyary bursts into the room again. As the song builds, the figure watching TV constantly changes the channel rapidly, showing scenes from the video so far. During a refrain we then see \\"apron Kyary\\" in a kitchen cooking with a big red pot. She proceeds to put odd things in the pot, such as a puppy with baby human's head and a chicken with a dinosaur head into the pot. She then pours water from a kettle in, and puts the lid on the pot. She removes the lid, and a green ghost hand pops out of the pot. The figure changes the channel back to the main room, where ghost Kyary is singing the chorus, with the zombies lurching around the room. Several different shots of ghost Kyary, the cute ghosts, and the zombies are shown, as they all party together. As the song ends, the video crossfades to the soundman who was attacked by zombies, slowly zooming into his face. His eyes pop open, revealing he has become a zombie. it then cuts to the seated figure smiling at the camera, showing his eyes to reveal he is also a zombie, or perhaps is the soundman in the story, the music video being the story of how he became a zombie, though the ending is ambiguous.  Making  In the music video, news reporter Kyary sneaks in to investigate a party in an unspecified city location, and ends up getting lost in a world of horror and pop music. To quote Kyary herself \\"It is not only a scary video, but also reflects my own style of pop and straight forward humour\\". For this music video, Kyary welcomes a new collaboration with director Y≈´suke Tanaka. Kyary was dead set on having \\"a Halloween-like horror feeling\\", to go with the subtitle \\"„Å±„Çì„Å∑„Åç„Çì„ÅÆÈÄÜË•≤\\" (Pumpkin's counter-attack). Paying particular attention to the project schedule, the music video was shot in two days in the city. While orange and purple are the usual colours for Halloween costumes, Kyary wanted an outfit that reflected the fact that she's an adult, and had a costume designed in daring red and black. The zombie character who appears shows a unique \\"pop and kawaii zombie style\\", and along with the 6 other monster dancers (dog, robot, super hero, cake girl, candy man and pumpkin) emphasize the strange and extraneous world of Halloween. The choreography was specifically created to be danceable by adults and children, following the Halloween theme and giving the image of zombies and skeletons dancing, as well as tap dance per Kyary's special request. The staff for the music video is as follows: * Director - Y≈´suke Tanaka * Fashion designer - Iijima Kumiko * Hair and make-up artist - Shinji Konishi (Â∞èË•øÁ¥≥Â£´) * Choreographer - I COULD NEVER BE A DANCERÔºàa choreographer duo based in ParisÔºâ * Set construction - magma Track listing CD Artwork Personnel Steve Nakamura ‚Äì Art Director, Designer.

Life  Relatively little is known about Suchten's life.Humberg, p. 31. His parents were Georg von Suchten and Euphemia Schultz. The Suchten family (in Polish \\"Suchta\\") came originally from the Lower Rhine region. In 1400 the family moved to Danzig, where they became quite influential; some members of the family became city councilors and mayors.Strehlau, p. 326. Christoph Suchten, a paternal uncle, was secretary to the Polish king Sigismund I the Old; a maternal uncle, Alexander Schultze (Scultetus) was a canon in Frombork and one of the few friends of Nicolaus Copernicus.Entry in Robert A. Hatch's database The Scientific Revolution From 1535 Suchten attended the Gymnasium in ElblƒÖg.Wilhelm Gnapheus, Prima Aelbingensis scholae foetura ‚Ä¶, Danzig 1541; also Molitor, p. 484 f. In December 1538 he received a position as a canon in Frombork, through his uncle Alexander Schultze.Humberg, p. 31. Not long after, this position was barred to uneducated men, so Suchten matriculated in the University of Leuven on 19 January 1541, where he studied philosophy and medicine.The idea that Alexander von Suchten had received a master's degree in philosophy at the University of Cracow by 1521, as some Polish authors claim ‚Äì see, for example, Hubicki, p. 54 ‚Äì is therefore false. Around 1545 he spent a lot of time at the court of Albert of Prussia in K√∂nigsberg, where he published his poem Vandalus (based on a Polish legend about Princess Wanda).For a more detailed discussion of Alexander von Suchten's poetry, see Molitor. Between 1549 and 1552 Suchten was employed as an alchemist by Otto Henry, Elector Palatine. From about 1554 to 1557 he was at the Polish royal court in Krak√≥w. Some time after, he is supposed to have earned a medical doctorate at an Italian university (perhaps the University of Ferrara).Humberg, p. 32; Hubicki, p. 55, on the other hand, argues that Suchten's Italian studies took place between 1543 and 1545. In 1563 he attempted unsuccessfully to gain a position as the personal physician in K√∂nigsberg. From 1567 he worked with the Strasbourg doctor Michael Toxites in Alsace and in the Upper Rhine. In the fall of 1574 Suchten began to practise as a country doctor in Linz in Upper Austria. He died there on 7 November 1575.For more on his daily life, his death, and his estate, see Humberg.  Works (Auswahl) Alexander von Suchten's works relied heavily on Paracelsus. He spoke out in print against charlatanism, rejecting the possibility of transmuting other metals into gold. * De Secretis Antimonij liber vnus (Strasbourg, 1570) * Zween Tractat, Vom Antimonio (M√∂mpelgard, 1604) * Antimonii Mysteria Gemina (Leipzig, 1604) * Chymische Schrifften Alle (Hamburg, 1680; this also contains some texts of disputed authenticity)  References  Bibliography * Hubicki, W≈Çodzimierz. \\"Alexander von Suchten.\\" Sudhoffs Archiv f√ºr Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften 44 (1960): 54‚Äì63. * Humberg, Oliver. \\"Die Verlassenschaft des ober√∂sterreichischen Landschaftsarztes Alexander von Suchten (‚Ä†1575).\\" Wolfenb√ºtteler Renaissance-Mitteilungen 31 (2007): 31‚Äì51. * Molitor, Carl. \\"Alexander von Suchten, ein Arzt und Dichter aus der zeit des Herzogs Albrecht.\\" Altpreu√üische Monatsschrift 19 (1882): 480‚Äì88. * Strehlau, Helmut. \\"Die Danziger Patrizierfamilie von Suchten.\\" Ostdeutsche Familienkunde 6 (1971/73): 326‚Äì29.

It normally has blue to yellow beards on all the petals. Description It has a rhizome, that in the spring, sends out thin, and long, (up to long,British Iris Society (1997) ) secondary roots (or stolons), which have a red skin. At the end of each stolon, it forms a new rhizome, creating widespread colonies of plants. Other 'Regelia section' irises also have stolons. Also Iris japonica, Iris prismatica and Iris henryi produce stolons. It has dark blue-green,James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) or glaucous leaves. They are sword-shaped, and long, and 0.8 cm to 2 cm wide. They are prominently veined, and semi-evergreen, disappearing after summer, after the blooming period is over.

Range It is found in the mountain ranges of the Pamir Alai (or Alay), (including the Gissar Range, and Saravschan Range,). which passes through the former Russian (or Soviet), country of Turkestan. (including near Bokhara,) It is also found in Tajikistan, (from the city of Dushanbe, to Uzbekistan, (including near the city of Samarkand near the Baysun ridge, and in the 'Kitab Zapovednik' (Geoological) reserve in the Kashkadarya Province,Gustave Gintzburge ) and in Afghanistan. Habitat It grows on dry rock slopes, along dry creeks, and upland meadows. One reference (Flora of S.S.S.R.) mentions wet meadows and stream sides, also mentioned by the British Iris Society Guide, but herbarium specimens do not support this habitat, also the other irises in the Regelia section are also mountainside irises. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Cultivation It is very cold hardy, to USDA Zone 5, or between Zone 5 to Zone 8. It is also hardy in Europe to Zone H3. In very cold areas, such as Russia, the plant may die out after 2 or 3 years. It prefers to grow in well-drained soils, which are rich in humus. It can tolerate soils with a ph level of 6.8. It prefers positions in full sun. It needs a dormant dry period (or drought) during the summer. The plants are not tolerant of winds. In non-hardy places, it is best grown in a bulb frame. It can be also grown in rock garden. The plants should be planted at a depth of 2 inches, in October. It is thought to be one of the easiest 'Regelia' section irises to cultivate, as it is more adaptable and vigorous than others. Hybrids and cultivars Iris stolonifera has been crossed with Iris korolkowii to create different coloured hybrids that have dark brown or deep blue beards. It has been crossed with other irises but did not produce very suitable crosses. There are several different cultivars, including 'Chocolate', 'Decorated Blue Beard', 'Decorated Delight', 'Decorated Giant', 'George Barr', 'Here I Am', 'Leichtlini', 'Merlin's Magic', 'Network', 'Real Harmony', 'Red, White, And Blue', 'Conical', 'Turkish Dancer', 'Turkish Delight', 'Vaga', and 'Zwanenburg Beauty'. 'Zwanenburg Beauty' has blue (or blue white ) flowers that are edged in bronze and have bronze veins. It grows to a height of between tall. It has lilac shading on the falls. The beard is bronze-red or cream-white. References Sources * Ald√©n, B., S. Ryman & M. Hjertson. 2009. V√•ra kulturv√§xters namn ‚Äì ursprung och anv√§ndning.

(1985) Controlling facial expressions and body movements in the computer-generated animated short \\"Tony de Peltrie\\".  Production  The four co-directors were young programmers and started the computer animation on their own. Daniel Langlois had trained as a designer and computer animator for movies and was an artist and programmer in the team. The face and body were sculpted by Langlois in clay and re-modeled according to the desired feeling of the expressions. Every time a new network of black lines with control points was drawn on the faces, which were required for the animation. For the software development and interactive creation, the team worked with the 3-D interactive graphics program Taarna and the mainframe computers CDC CYBER 835, 855.http://bitsavers.trailing- edge.com/pdf/cdc/cyber/cyber_180/60459960A_Cyber_170_Model_825_835_855_General_Description_Jul82.pdf Control Data Corporation, Juli 1982 (PDF 20, 71 MB) To calculate an image with the mainframe computers then, took five minutes. The computer monitor was a GRID TECHNOLOGIES ONE / 25S screen with a 24er card that had a range of 16 million colors. The image resolution of the monitor was 512 x 512 pixels. The images were calculated with four times the resolution so that no staircase effect emerged. For conversion of the face and body from analog to digital, a GRADICON digitizer was used, and for the rehearsal and filming a Bolex 16 mm and an Animation Oxberry 35 mm camera.  Publication  On the 12th SIGGRAPH Film & Video Show in San Francisco in July 1985, Philippe Bergeron and Pierre Lachapelle presented the film Tony de Peltrie for the first time. Bergeron gave at the conference the lecture: \\"Controlling Facial Expressions and Body Movements in the Computer Generated Animated Short Tony De Peltrie\\".David Sturman: The State of Computer Animation. In: ACM SIGGRAPH. Band 32, Nr. 1 (February 1998).  Reception  Critics and audiences were enthusiastic about Tony de Peltrie. It received more than 20 awards worldwide and garnered coverage in hundreds of magazines. In the week after the show in San Francisco, Time magazine concluded a two-page article about the Festival with the words: John Lasseter, one of the festival‚Äôs judges commented:  Economic success  Typically, the success of a film is calculated in US dollars, which are paid by the visitors at the box office. The short film, produced not for profit at the box office, showed its success a few years later. The film is one of the reasons why Montreal has become one of the global centers of the computer game industry. Tony de Peltrie was created with mainframe computers. This was complicated because every change had to be reprogrammed. Philippe Bergeron told 2012 in a video how tedious and frustrating this work was. He talked about the fact that Daniel Langlois also saw it and had spoken of wanting to change that.Philippe Bergeron on animating \\"Tony de Peltrie\\", YouTube 21 May 2012. After the completion of the film, therefore, Langlois worked with two programmers to create a new program, and founded the company Softimage in Montreal. The program Softimage 3D and its further developments advanced in the 1990s to become an industry standard. George Borshukov, responsible for the special effects of the movie The Matrix, said: \\"Without Softimage 3D and mental ray, specifically, those phenomenal bullet time backgrounds just wouldn't have been possible.\\" Special effects for blockbusters such as Jurassic Park or The Matrix and many other films were produced with it. Many companies in the computer game industry also used programs by Softimage. The presence of Softimage in Montreal was one of the reasons why Ubisoft established their North American headquarters in the city, where French and English are spoken.Mathew Kumar: The French-Canadian Connection.

In the 19th century, both fur seals and Australian sea lions were hunted for their hides. During the 20th century, seals were sometimes culled on the assumption that they were competing with fishermen. As of 2018 seal culling is illegal, but remains a topic of public debate. All pinnipeds in South Australia remain fully protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 as listed Marine Mammals. As of 2016, there were an estimated 100,000 long-nosed fur seals in South Australian waters.  History  Despite confusion stemming from its common name, the New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) is a pinniped native to South Australia. Efforts to overcome this confusion have led to increasing use of the common name, long-nosed fur seal.  1800-1899  The species was heavily hunted by sealers in the early 1800s. Seals were clubbed to death by men who raided seal colonies and rookeries by boat, sometimes swimming ashore armed with clubs and knives. The sealers typically bludgeoned the animals to death and used knives to skin the carcasses. Pups were often killed along with their mothers or sometimes kept as pets. The hides of the slain seals were then pickled in brine and exported. Seal hunting continued to occur in Gulf St. Vincent in the 1880s. The colony of South Australia was only officially established in 1836, and as such, no baseline data exists for the South Australian seal population prior to the impact of hunting. Their population's gradual recovery, spanning the past century, has brought them into increasing conflict with the state's fishing industry.  1900-1949  The killing of seals in South Australian waters continued into the 20th century, on the assumption that they were in competition with fishermen. 7,000 to 8,000 were estimated to have been killed in the six months prior to August 1918. One man alone, Mr S. H. Sheridan of Glenelg admitted to having killed 1,430 seals during this period on the islands of Spencer Gulf. Captain S. A. White, an \\"ardent nature lover\\", said of calls that seals should be killed for allegedly competing with fishermen: > \\"It is not the seals, poor creatures, but that ever destructive being, man, > who has created the dearth [of fish]. It is high time the Governments of > this country let a glimmer of natural science into their deliberations, and > not go for advice to those who are fighting against nature and bringing dire > consequences upon their heads.\\" White estimated that prior to the European colonisation of South Australia, hundreds of thousands of seals likely inhabited its waters. In 1929, The Advertiser reported that men had been landing on islands in Spencer Gulf and \\"molesting seals.\\" At this time the animals were protected under the Animals and Bird Protection Act. It was prohibited \\"for any person to land on Dangerous Reef with a gun or a dog, or to take seals on any of the islands or reefs within St. Vincent or Spencer Gulf north of a line from Cape Catastrophe to Cape Borda, continued to Cape Hart at the south-eastern corner of Kangaroo Island, thence to the mouth of the River Murray.\\" Seals were known to enter inland river systems and were seen as far up the Murray-Darling system as Deniliquin, 1,000 miles from the mouth of the Murray. A hotel at Conargo once displayed the skin of a seal shot in the river nearby. Other accounts of inland seal sightings prior to 1933 include at Tyntynder, Pental Island, Echuca and near Swan Hill. Other sighting locations include Loxton and Mildura. Seen in this inland context, seals were often referred to as bunyips or otherwise misidentified. In 1940 some fishermen claimed to have suffered damage to their nets which they attributed to seals. The Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game at the time suspected that some of the damage had not been done by seals, but rather by sharks. At this time, fishermen in the neighboring state of Victoria were allowed to shoot seals which interfered with their fishing efforts or equipment.  1950-1999  In 1954, W. W. Jenkins suggested in Parliament that an open season should be called to keep seal numbers in check. Fisherman A. W. Lundstrom wrote that before the barrages were built across the River Murray, seals were often seen near the town of Goolwa. Construction of the barrages began in 1935 and they were completed in 1940. Lundstrom, acting as President of the Southern Fishermen's Association wrote of the seals: > \\"We as fishermen still maintain that the seal is a menace to the fishing > industry in the same way as the rabbits, dingoes or kangaroos are to the > landholder.\\" At the time, three fishermen in the Victor Harbor area had permission to shoot seals which interfered with their fishing nets. One of them, Mr A. J. Jenkins called for an \\"open season\\" on seals, stating: > \\"We want the seals' sanctuary on the islands abolished and a continuous open > season declared so these pests may be destroyed at their breeding grounds.\\" The article in which Jenkins is quoted also claimed that seals consumed up to of fish each day. In a written reply, A. Keith Minchin, Director of Adelaide's Koala Farm, called the claim \\"a colossal exaggeration\\" and wrote that even a large seal would consume less than of fish daily. In 1967 it was alleged that fishermen were harpooning seals and dolphins in South Australian waters and using the meat as crayfish bait. The claim was refuted by Mr. Thompson, a government fisheries inspector. Thompson stated that permits to cull seals could be made available, and had been previously when net damage caused by seals had been demonstrated. At the time such permits were to be issued \\"only when deemed absolutely necessary.\\" In 1984, Australian sea lions were reportedly responsible for damaging the nets of fishermen near Victor Harbor. Fishermen's applications for permits to kill the animals were rejected due to the species' low population. As of 2015, the Australian sea lion remains an endangered species.  2000-present  The southern bluefin tuna ranching industry was established in the early 1990s and reported increasing interactions with fur seals in the 2010s. This led the industry to seek permission to kill seals that they claim they can recognise. Marcus Stehr, son of Hagen Stehr and executive of the Stehr Group told The Advertiser in 2012 that fur seal interactions were costing their southern bluefin tuna ranching aquaculture business \\"at least $1 million\\" annually. He stated: > \\"Seals cost the entire industry millions of dollars every year and we do > need support from the State Government to look at how we manage them. In SA > we have failed to develop any strategies to manage growing seal numbers and > it's vital that this begins.\\" In 2013 Brian Jeffriess told The Advertiser: > \\"Attacks by seals are a major problem for tuna ranching. They are the > largest cause of tuna deaths in the pontoons and frighten the other tuna so > they do not eat for days.\\" In 2013 The Advertiser reported that New Zealand fur seals ate an average of 4.5 kilograms of marine species each per day. At that time the state population was estimated at over 85,000 animals. In 2015, Dr Brad Page told the ABC that the population had reached 100,000 animals. He also stated that most of the fur seals' diet consists of red bait and arrow squid, and not species which are typically caught and sold for human consumption. In August 2014, two decapitated New Zealand fur seals were found in Louth Bay, southern Spencer Gulf. The circumstances of their death were regarded as suspicious. In June 2015, the prospect of seal culling in South Australia became a subject of increasing public debate and controversy. Mounting frustration among fishermen has led some to admit that they will consider taking action themselves in order to protect their livelihoods. A seal was also killed at Murray Bridge after being hit by a boat during a ski-racing event. Approximately five seals were seen in the area, and the event was cancelled after the animal was hit. Its injuries were assessed by a local vet who then euthanized the seal. In July 2015, fishermen from the Lower Lakes and Coorong region reported that fur seals had damaged their fishing nets. In August 2015, Narrinjeri elder and fisherman Darrell Sumner admitted to having killed at least four seals and injuring another. He threatened to kill more animals in the future, and believes that the seals are killing pelicans- his people's totem animal. The Narrinjeri believe that pelicans embody the spirits of their dead ancestors, and has said that he doesn't care that killing or hurting the animals is an illegal act under \\"white man's law\\". Fishermen believe that seals are competing with wild catch fisheries, and have reported net damage that they claim was caused by fur seals. Southern bluefin tuna ranchers have reported stock losses at their seacage aquaculture operations. Regions in which claims have been made that fur seals are impacting fisheries and aquaculture businesses include: Kangaroo Island, the Lower lakes and Coorong, and southern Spencer Gulf.  Status  A spokesperson for the Environment Department of the Government of South Australia told The Advertiser in 2012: > \\"The Government does not support culling, sterilisation or relocation of NZ > fur seals in SA. Attempts interstate and overseas to manage seal populations > through culling, sterilisation or relocation have proven resource-hungry and > largely ineffectual and any benefit received from relocating a small number > of seals would likely be lost due to the influx of new seals.\\" In April 2016, South Australia's environment minister Ian Hunter reaffirmed the Government's position stating \\"the best available science\\" showed a cull \\"would not work\\". He told The Advertiser that the Government was instead \\"focusing our resources on measures to reduce the impact of long nosed fur seal populations, including trialing different nets and underwater cracker deterrents.‚Äù All seals and sealions are protected in South Australian waters as listed marine mammals under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. They are also protected as a marine species under the EPBC Act 1999. This increases the area in which they are protected to include Commonwealth waters and lands controlled by the Commonwealth government.  Advocates for culling  Jamie Briggs Culling seals in South Australian waters has been advocated for most strongly by fishermen and aquaculture operators who claim that their businesses have suffered as a result of the population's recovery. Other advocates include Liberal Party politicians, conservative newspaper columnist and Liberal member Nicolle Flint, a penguin tour operator in Kangaroo Island and their supporters. The owner of the Kangaroo Island Penguin Centre, John Ayliffe has advocated for the culling of fur seals on Kangaroo Island, which he believes have impacted little penguin colonies, and therefore his business. Politicians advocating for the commencement of a cull have included Liberal Party MPs Adrian Pederick, Michael Pengilly and Jamie Briggs.  Opposition to culling  Robert Brokenshire Dr Peter Shaughnessy of the South Australian Museum advised that the culling of seals in South Australia would be a bad idea. Political opposition to the culling of seals in South Australia has been demonstrated by animal rights activists, including Animals Australia and the Seals of Nam. Both organisations have created petitions encouraging people to sign and express their opposition to any future cull. Australian Greens MLC Tammy Franks has spoken out against culling, along with the Humane Society International. While Family First politician Robert Brokenshire has been critical of the Government's \\"do nothing\\" approach, he has also expressed concern over the impact that seal culling could have on the State's reputation and tourism industry. He told the ABC: > \\"Some people have called for culling, now the reality is that we can't do > that. It would just damage our economy, it would ruin our tourism.\\"  Culling in other Australian states  SA Shark Industry spokesman Kyri Toumazos suggested that a permitting scheme for seal culling operates in Tasmania. According to the Tasmanian government, all seals in Tasmanian waters are protected. In response to the question \\"Do seals threaten fisheries?\\" the Tasmanian government has stated: > \\"Some fishermen complain about seals, accusing them of taking all their > fish. Occasionally fishermen suggest that seals should be culled and that > this will increase fish stocks and there will then be more available for > human consumption. However, closer examination of seal-fishery interactions > at the ecosystem level suggests that removing or culling seals may in fact > be detrimental to fish stocks rather than beneficial. Remove a top predator > and the whole system runs the risk of collapse.\\"  References  Mammals of South Australia Animal rights Cruelty to animals Environment of South Australia Animal culling Pinnipeds ","title":"Seal culling in South Australia"},{"id":"47186350","text":"Half Nelson is an American detective comedy-drama series that aired on NBC from March 24 until May 10, 1985.\\"Half Nelson\\" Television Obscurities.

For nearly a century beginning in 1869, a lumber mill, powered first by water and then steam, was operated at this location. The property, much of whose equipment is still in situ following its closure in 1963, is a rare surviving 19th-century industrial facility in the rural community. Now owned by the local historical society (which hopes to transform it into a museum property), it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The Johnson Mill is located on the north side of Maine State Route 5, just south of North Waterboro village. The mill pond is located on the south side of the highway, which crosses over Johnson Stream on a concrete bridge built by mill owner Dennis Johnson in 1920. The mill dam, now breached, lies nearly underneath the bridge. The main mill building, dating to 1902, is a three-part structure, whose largest section is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gabled roof, with a shed-roofed extension along its western side. Attached to the southeastern corner, and extending over the streambed, is a single-story wing with a gable roof oriented parallel to the highway. The main building is set on a concrete foundation, as is most of the wing; the part over the stream is supported by concrete pylons. The building has no obvious main entrance. Its south (street-facing) facade has a pedestrian door and a cargo bay with loading ramp, while the west side has a large sliding door at the southern end, and hinged sections to the north that provide additional illumination and ventilation to the interior. The north side also has two utility entrances. The buildings interior has exposed wall framing and wood plank flooring. A large bandsaw, built by the Berlin Machine Works, is located in the eastern part of the building, and there is also a crosscut saw for trimming ends, an edger/jointer, and planer. A winch provides additional power for moving large pieces of lumber around. The southeast wing houses the \\"file room\\", where saw blades were stored and sharpened. The basement of the building houses the remains of a large steam boiler. The mill was established in 1869 by Dennis Johnson, then 23, and was documented to produce 40,000 pine shingles in 1870, operating for four months. The mill was one of six mills operating in Waterboro, typically processing locally harvested lumber. Its output increased around the turn of the 20th century with the introduction of steam power, and employed as many as twelve workers. Johnson built the present structure to replace the earlier mill, which was depicted in 1890 as being somewhat dilapidated. The mill was the only one in town to survive a devastating fire in 1947, which swept through the community and its forests. Dennis Johnson's grandson Donald closed the mill in 1963. It was acquired by the Waterboro Historic Society in 1974.

He has also helped found branches of these NGOs in several Iranian cities, such as Bam, Karaj, Isfahan, Tabriz, Mashhad, Shiraz and others. Mansourian is a social worker by training.  Early life  Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani gave Mansourian authority to collect religious alms on his behalf and spend it on social programs for the most disadvantaged in the society. Since then, Mansourian has been expanding his professional services to those most in need of social services in Tehran and other parts of the country. His political activism dates back to his youth, influenced heavily by his encounter and later friendship with Ali Shariati, an Iranian sociologist and revolutionary (1933-1977). Mansourian fought against repression during the Pahlavi regime. He became a member of the Freedom Movement of Iran soon after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. He assumed the position of Deputy for Social Affairs under Tehran's mayor in Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan's government‚Äîthe interim government formed in February 1979. Mansourian resigned as Deputy Social Affairs of Tehran municipality, along with the Bazargan cabinet, soon after the Iran hostage crisis in late 1979. The Bazargan government did not agree with hostage taking and believed that the hostages should have been released immediately, a view that was not tolerated by hard-line revolutionaries. Since then, he has remained an active part of the Freedom Movement of Iran. Mansourian has been imprisoned four times for his activism for governmental reform, spending close to four year in prison since the 1979 Revolution. In June 1987, a month prior to the acceptance of the UN Resolution 598 by Iran, Mansourian and a few of his like- minded colleagues were arrested and kept in solitary confinement for nine months for their opposition to the continuation of the war. In 1989, he and other opposition members were arrested upon signing a letter critical of government policies. He remained incarcerated for 18 months, mostly in solitary confinement. In 2001/2002 Mansourian was again held in prison for 11-months and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for allegedly \\"endangering national security.\\" He was released on a heavy bail while awaiting the appeals process. In 2002, his sentence was confirmed by the appeals court but the Revolutionary Court never officially served him with the sentence. He has also been banned from leaving the country for most of the years since his release in 2002. In February 2015, 13 years after his sentencing, while attempting to release the 2001/2002 bail held by the government, Mansourian was jailed and the bail was released. He was released in March 2017 on bail.

It is the only world producer with the capacity to manufacture the four main technologies available on the casings or artificial casings market (cellulose, collagen, fibrous and plastic). Its complex production process is based on the physical and chemical treatment of the raw materials, which, through mechanical or physical-chemical rupture and later homogenizations and mixes, become a mass that can be extruded in the production process. The extrusion operation is performed by pressing the mass, either through a ring (to produce a tubular casing) or through a slot (for example to produce a plastic film or collagen sheet). This way, smooth casing is produced that can later be rolled onto spools or rolls and that can undergo a series of transformation processes (this process is also called \\"converting\\"), among which particularly noteworthy is the tripe pleating (i.e. its folds) and occasionally its printing and closure; all to facilitate its storage and later distribution in the form of sticks, so that clients can use them easily in their cold meat production machinery. The company has been trading in the Madrid Stock Exchange General Index since December 1986 and currently forms part of the IBEX 35.  History  Viscofan was founded in 1975, the year in which the production and commercialisation of its products began. The company's solid growth led it to taking the next natural step into starting its share trading in the Madrid Stock Exchange General Index in December 1986. As part of its growth strategy, in 1988 Viscofan acquired the food group IAN (Industrias Alimentarias de Navarra), which enabled it to gain momentum in the industry on a national level. Following this, the company designed an international expansion strategy which began with the acquisition of the German company Naturin GmbH&Co; in 1990 and with the opening of new commercial offices in other countries. In 1995 it acquired Gamex in the Czech Republic and Trificiel in Sao Paulo (Brazil). Its expansion continued, and in 2005 it acquired Koteksprodukt AD in Serbia and the assets of AB Tripasin of Sweden. A year later, in 2006, Viscofan strengthened its presence in the American market with the purchase of the American assets of Teepak (US and Mexico). In 2008 the company executed the expansion of its co-generation plant in Spain. In the same year, Viscofan Bioengineering (VBE) was constituted as a business unit that combines biosciences and engineering to supply collagen- based products which can be applied to repair damaged tissues in patients. The Viscofan Group's Bioengineering unit is located in Weinheim (Germany), a benchmark centre for the company's collagen casings, where it has an additional cleanroom to produce collagen products for medical use. In 2009 a new milestone was reached within the company's international expansion strategy, with the creation of Viscofan Technology (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. in China. Viscofan already distributed its products in the Asian country prior to this but it did not have its own production centre. A year later, in 2010, the first converting plant in the country was inaugurated. Particularly outstanding in 2012 was the creation of Viscofan Uruguay S.A., converting collagen for the first time in Latin America. In 2013, in its drive into the Asian market, the collagen extrusion plant was opened in China. A year later, in 2014, the Company opened the extrusion plant in Uruguay. In 2015, coinciding with the celebration of its 40th anniversary, Viscofan sold the IAN Group to focus all of its efforts on the casing business, with the acquisition of Nanopack Technology & Packaging in order to give a new boost to the plastics business line. Also in 2015, the company inaugurated its new plastics plant in Mexico. In 2016 Viscofan strengthened its positioning and improved its product offer with the acquisition of Vector USA and Vector Europe.  Production lines  Viscofan produces the four kinds of artificial casing available on the market: * Cellulose casings: this variety uses natural cellulose as its raw material. It is mainly used to produce traditionally cooked Sausages. In most cases, the casing acts merely as a cooking mould, and is generally peeled off by the manufacturer before sale to end consumers. Viscofan holds around 50% of the global market share of this product. * Collagen casings: these casings use collagen as their raw material, a protein that is extracted from cattle and pig hides. This is an alternative to natural casings for the production of fresh and processed sausages. Collagen offers high resistance because it can be used for quick stuffing, hanging and oven cooking. Viscofan holds around a third of the global market share of this variety. * Fibrous casings: these are made with a mix of cellulose and Manila hemp, a plant-based paper that gives the casing high strength and a uniform calibre. It is mainly used for high-calibre and sliced meats such as mortadella or Pepperonis. Viscofan is among the 3 top producers in the world of this technology. * Plastic casings: this kind of casing uses different plastic polymers as its raw material, which are mainly used for cooked products such as Hams, mortadella and Cheeses. Viscofan also has plastic products for packaging, such as the shrink bags for fresh or frozen meats and plastic films to separate sliced foods. Viscofan is among the 5 top world producers in this technology.  International presence  Viscofan exports a large part of its products to other markets and is currently present in over 100 countries. Thanks to its internationalization strategy, it has production centres in 10 countries ‚Äì Spain, Germany, Belgium, Czech Republic, Serbia, China, United States, Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay ‚Äì and has commercial offices in 15 countries.

From 1947 he lived in Gerresheim and received his first camera in 1951. At the age of 14 he began an apprenticeship as a high voltage electrician at the Mannesmann tube rolling mills in D√ºsseldorf. In addition to his work as a high voltage electrician, he took photos with a Voigtl√§nder camera, which he had received from his mother. He completed a course for photo lab work at the community college and bought some simple laboratory equipment.

In the second year of voluntary service, he worked at the Neuss city desk. From 1965 onwards Kempkens traveled regularly to Prague where he mixed with Czech climber friends he had met in 1964 in the Tatra Mountains. On1 May 1967 he was back in Prague and photographed the 1 May Parade as a reporter. Instead of photos of tanks and marching soldiers his photos showed young soldiers as Blues players as they walked with their girlfriends together in the parade. It was spring in Prague and the young soldiers showed that to them the Prague Spring already lived.

The introduction to the article read, It's the classic side of computer graphics: they are typical computer images, these examples ‚Äì or the fun of the artist with the computer.Filewrite! >>Pixles-Spiele<< ‚Äì mit digitaler Fotografie.

In: Novum, September 1985, S. 46‚Äì51. Klaus von Gaffron visited the solo exhibition and spoke to Kempkens and advised him to apply to become a member for the Professional Association of Visual Artists Munich and Upper Bavaria (BBK).BBK Kempkens followed the advice and was accepted. In December 1985 his digital photo portraits appeared at the group exhibition Photography Portrait in the Gallery of the Artist of the BBK.Jutta Tezmen-Siegel, Alex Kempkens: Fotografie ‚Äì Portr√§t, BBK ‚Äì Berufsverband Bildender K√ºnstler M√ºnchen u.

His concept was accepted in the fall of 1985 and the exhibition Bilder Images Digital took place in October 1986 in the Gallery of the Artist.Helga Biesel: Berufsverband Bildender K√ºnstler entdeckt Computer als Handwerkszeug. Ausstellung: Digital belebte Kunstwelt. In: Computerwoche, 14. November 1986. He organized, curated the exhibition and showed his own works.Copper Giloth, Lynn Pocock-Willians: A Selected Chronology of Computer Arts: Exhibitions, Publications, and Technology. In: Art Journal, Nr. 3 (1990), , S. 292. At the exhibition, he produced the catalog \\"Bilder Images Digital, computer artist in Germany '86\\".Alex Kempkens, Barbara Kempkens (Hrsg): Bilder Images Digital: ‚ÄûComputerk√ºnstler in Deutschland 1986‚Äú, Barke Verlag, 1986, Seiten 255, , ; (). The slogan on the exhibition poster was The focus of the exhibition is the statement of the picture. Kempkens also explicitly emphasized this in the preface to the catalog when he wrote, We exhibit pictures. It was planned by him as a clear distinction between computer images and computer graphic thereby anticipating the coming dominance of digital imagery. Parallel to the exhibition, he organized a symposium and a workshop in the gallery of the artist. To the symposium he had the first computer art pioneers among other Frieder Nake and Georg Nees invited. The moderator of the conference was Richard Kriesche. The critic of the Munich evening newspaper, Peter M. Bode, wrote about the symposium: The computer artists thus argue that the sparks fly [...] something like the passionate discussions that there must have been when photography first appeared. The pioneer of this art, Georg Nees, wrote in a letter to the newspaper \\"Bilder Digital\\",Georg Nees: Die Situation der Computerkunst in der BRD. In: BilderDigital, Nr. 1 (1988), S. 27. , . > I may with the greatest satisfaction to say that I have never experienced in > the short history of computer art so haunting event, such as the Munich > Symposium. For the exhibition Nees created a game world in a new series of architectural drawings.Georg Nees: K√ºnstliche Kunst und K√ºnstliche Intelligenz.

Nees wrote in his letter also that he liked very much the talks with the young generation of computer artists at the symposium. At the workshop and for the first time in Germany, an art exhibition showed six Amiga 1000s with a connected video station and color printer for young and old visitors to experiment with. Visitors could paint images in 4096 colors and print them in color. About the video station analog images been converted to digital images. The visitors used then this data to create new digital images with the Amiga 1000. The results could also be printed in color and put at the wall of the workshop.Alex Kempkens: Bilder Images Digital. In: BilderDigital ‚Äì Zeitung f√ºr Art und Advertising mit dem Computer, Nr. 1 (1988), S. 17, . For the exhibition Bilder Images Digital Kempkens scrapped an IBM computer system, calling the actions and performance Computer Burger. This computer system had cost more than a decade ago with the purchase by a company for about one million German marks. The event took place in September 1986 at a recycling plant for cars and others in Munich. The computer was transformed into a pile of junk. The scrap was packed in a metal barrel and as Computer Burger placed in the entrance hall of the Gallery of the Artist. A video of the event was produced and on show beside the Computer Burger.Johannes Gl√∂tzner: Schrott Verse. In: BilderDigital, Nr. 1 (1988), S. 19, , . Alex Kempkens: Computer- Burger. In: BilderDigital, Nr. 2 (1986) vom 24. Oktober 1986, S. 6‚Äì9. Starting in 1987, following other exhibitions of his works, Ferdinand Ullrich commissioned Kempens to develop and produce the computer game Zeche Recklinghausen II. The adventure of a miner in 1903 ‚Äì 1913 for the exhibition \\"Work and Rhythm\\" at the 41st Ruhr Festival in Recklinghausen. This came from an idea of Ullrich.Ferdinand Ulrich: Arbeit und Rhythmus, Katalog der 41. Ruhrfestspiele, Recklinghausen 1987. In 1987, he was invited by Richard Kriesche to the group exhibition \\"Blurring boundaries 1\\" in the K√ºnstlerhaus Graz. The symposium for the exhibition was held in Venice.Richard Kriesche: Entgrenzte Grenzen, Graz/Venedig, Edition Arge Alpen Adria, 1987.  Montreal  In February 1986, Kempkens was contacted by Herv√© Fischer from Montreal. With his partner Ginette Mayor, Fischer had founded the company Cit√© des arts et des nouvelles technologies de Montr√©al to stage the exhibition Images du Futur in Montreal.Cit√© des arts et des nouvelles technologies de Montr√©al Herv√© Fischer: Images du futur past, on the Website of the Daniel Langlois Foundation . Fischer invited Kempkens to show his Digital Images at the exhibition, which ran for several months from May 1986 in the Old Port of Montreal. Kempkens sent his work to Montreal. In 1987, 1990, 1991 and 1994 his digital images were also shown at the Images du Futur exhibition. For the catalog title and the exhibition poster of Image du Futur '90, a picture of him was selected.Alex Kempkens: Sondras Herz. In: Images du Futur ‚Äô90, Catalog Cover, Poster and S. 42. The whole archive of the exhibition Images du Futur is now in the possession of the Daniel Langlois Foundation and can be used online for research.Homepage der Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology. For the exhibition Images du Futur in 1991 he was invited by Fischer and Major to come to Montreal.Jocelyne Lepage: Images du futur. In: La Presse, 8. Juni 1991, S. D14. He traveled to Montreal and stayed after the show continued in the city. Fischer knew the architectural photos by Kempkens from Munich and therefore urged him to make nice pictures from Old Montreal (Vieux-Montr√©al).Dorota Kozinska: Old city is captured by German artist. In: The Gazette, 12. September 1997, Section C. Kempkens took over this task, which posed a particular challenge. Every house in Old Montreal was already described in all the architecture details, and photographed. Phyllis Lambert, founder of the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal, herself lived in the area and had one of the first documentaries created.CCA homepage. She was responsible for the contract to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to build the Seagram Building in New York City. Old Port of Montreal, Photo circa 1899 Kempkens' Photos of Old Montreal have been exhibited in the gallery Le Compagnonnage, which he founded in 1992. He published the book Pierres de chants de Montr√©al for this exhibition.Alex Kempkens: Pierres des chants de Montr√©al : Vieux Montr√©al = Old Montreal, Galerie Le Compagnonnage, Montreal 1992, , (Text in English und French). The text in the book by Monique Brunet- Weinmann Dialectic of the Wall and the Way, La dialectique du Mur et de la Voie describes the result as > En cette ann√©e du trois cent cinquanti√®me anniversaire de sa fondation, il > est admirable qu'un citoyen nouveau venu, nous rappelle le plan fondateur de > Ville-Marie, dessin√© par les solides fondations de ses b√¢timents. Puisse-t- > on entendre ces pierres des Chants (...). In this year of the three hundred > and fiftieth anniversary of its founding, it is admirable that a newly > arrived citizens can help us recall the old plans of Ville-Marie, skechet by > the solid base of its buildings. May we hear these singing stones .... Brunet-Weinmann compares the photos to the etching of Paris, Charles Meryon at the time of Baudelaire drew. The buildings in Old Montreal had not been photographed individually and isolated, as is usual in architectural photography, but Kempkens has photographed the buildings incorporated into the growing environment of the urban landscape. The architecture of the Old Montreal photos were on show in 1997 parallel with the Le Mois de la Photo in Montreal again in a solo exhibition in Bonsecours Market. In autumn 1992 Kempkens was invited by Jacques Charbonneau, founder of the \\"Centre Copie-Art\\" in Montreal, to be an artist in residence at the \\"Gallery Arts Technologiques du Centre Copie Art\\".Charbonneau, Jacques (1943). In: Dictionary of Quebec Sculpture in the 20th Century. In January 1993, he had his first solo exhibition there entitled What is the prince looking for in the forest?, Que cherche le prince dans la for√™t?Alex Kempkens: Was sucht der Prinz im Wald?, eine Frage in der real existierenden virtuellen Realit√§t = Que cherche le prince dans la for√™t?, une question dans la r√©alit√© existentielle de l‚Äôexistence virtuelle. Centre Copie art Galerie Arts Technologiques Montr√©al, Visual Art Team, M√ºnchen 1993, , . He was an active member of the \\"Centre Copie-Art\\". There were other solo and group exhibitions in the Gallery Arts Technologiques and in other galleries in Montreal.  Lower Rhine  In 1999, Kempkens came back to Germany and settled in 2000 on the Lower Rhine. He took off in 2000 to several exhibitions with both analog and / or digital photos in Germany in part, such as at the cultural festival Duisburger Akzente.Akzente Geschichte , auf der Website der Duisburger Akzente. He met new artists at exhibitions and readings, especially Oskar Fahr, poet, journalist and philosopher. Oskar Fahr convinced Michael Arenz, publisher of The Mongol Waiting (Der Mongole wartet) to publish an article about Kempkens. Fahr wrote for the 2002 edition a critic on Kempkens. He used the digital photos to illustrate the critic and also to illustrat his own poems in the same issue of The Mongol waiting. Fahr wrote to the images of Kempkens: > These fairies and water virgins, usually in the foreground, not wearing a > swimsuit, but they play with each other when they are in pairs. It is the > computer artist not unlike Arnold B√∂cklin. The Rhine maidens of Kempkens own > presence, and they produce the present. Fahr refers in his text to the images of the exhibition Provider in an Other Time at the 23rd Duisburg Akzente. Kempkens had in Duisburg, as well as in Montreal, the images of young women of the town merged with the current architecture of the urban landscape and the Rhine landscape. The correspondence on the subject and the images of the exhibition \\"What is the prince looking for in the forest?\\" Where he can look for the princess in the modern city of the prince and not in the woods of fairy tales. Arenz published, under his chosen title \\"Satori in Montreal\\" in the 2004 edition the poems in English and French with the pictures by Kempkens.Alex Kempkens: Satori in Montreal. Gedichte in franz√∂sischer und englischer Sprache & Bilder von Alex Kempkens. In: Der Mongole wartet, Nr. 14 (Oktober 2004), S. 298‚Äì319. In November 2014 architectural photos by Kempkens from 1975 were published in the book \\"Helmut von Werz ‚Äì An architect Life 1912‚Äì1990\\" and shown at the exhibition \\"Helmut von Werz\\" at the Munich Architecture Gallery.Website der Architekturgalerie M√ºnchen.

Biography Origins and early career He was born in Slatina to Nicolae Caracostea, a magistrate of Aromanian descent, and his wife Eufrosina (n√©e Bichan), a French teacher. His father's family had become wealthy through engaging in commerce, which opened the possibility of higher education for its members.NastasƒÉ, pp. 92-3, 188, 321 He attended primary school and one year of high school in his native town, completing his secondary education at Saint Sava High School in Bucharest in 1900. That year, he enrolled in the literature and philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest, which he attended intermittently: in 1902, he was working as a clerk at the court of auditors, abandoning his studies for a time; in 1905, he married Lucia Walter of Ia»ôi, which likely further detained him from educational pursuits. She came from an eminently respectable family and was a university graduate in literature; she was some three years his junior, and the couple were classmates. The marriage would result in two children. Only in 1906 did he return to university, and graduated first in his class in 1908.Dumitru Caracostea, Mircea Anghelescu (ed.), Scrieri alese, p. ix. Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986. His professors included Titu Maiorescu, Ioan Bianu and Ovid Densusianu; their influence on his intellectual development was decisive. In 1909, he obtained a scholarship for Vienna University, where he studied under the direct supervision of Wilhelm Meyer-L√ºbke. He successfully defended two doctoral theses in 1913: one on philosophy, the other on Romance philology. He returned home upon the outbreak of World War I. From 1914 to 1925, he was a high school teacher. In 1920, he began offering courses at Bucharest University, first as associate professor in Bianu's department and, from 1930, as full professor at the department of modern Romanian literature and folklore. Thanks to his efforts, the Institute of Literary History and Folklore was founded in 1933; among other publications, a series of \\"literary confessions\\" by contemporary Romanian writers appeared under its aegis. Wartime activity and downfall Caracostea was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1938, Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site and presided over the forum's literary section for a time. During the summer of 1940, he served as Minister of National Education in two successive cabinets: under Ion Gigurtu from July 4 to September 4,Neagoe, p. 135 and under Ion Antonescu from September 4 to 14, until the establishment of the National Legionary State.Neagoe, p. 137 That autumn, the new regime appointed him head of Revista Funda»õiilor Regale; as such, he suspended contributions from critics whom he deemed sympathetic toward Jewish literature. Nicoleta SƒÉlcudeanu, \\"Genera»õie prin lustra»õie\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 12/2008 From April 1941 to May 1944. three months before the King Michael Coup, he headed the amalgamated Royal Foundations.NastasƒÉ, p. 372 His ascendancy under Romania's wartime regimes was not due to politics: he had participated neither in the main parties nor in pro-fascist groups, but remained loyal to the ideas of Nicolae Iorga. Instead, it stemmed from the Germanophilia that had begun during his Vienna days. Caracostea's activity at the magazine was curtailed by the fact that he had to issue a monthly report both to the Anglophile Royal House and to the pro-German Antonescu. Its situation was precarious: circulation had dropped to 800, issues appeared at delayed intervals and mobilization made contributors difficult to find.Mioara Apolzan, Aspecte de istorie literarƒÉ: destinul unei publica»õii, R.F.R., p. 100.

His literary and scientific activity had two main directions: studies of folklore (Miori»õa √Æn Moldova, Muntenia »ôi Oltenia, 1924) and exegeses of Mihai Eminescu's work (Arta cuv√¢ntului la Eminescu, 1938; Creativitatea eminescianƒÉ, 1943). His writings on folk ballads (Balada poporanƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ, 1932-1933) laid the groundwork for geographic-based folklore studies, then a new concept. His commentary on Eminescu was marked by a binary perspective: dynamic (the poems' genesis) and static (the poet's artistic use of language).Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol.

It was based at Clerkenwell House, Clerkenwell Green. It ceased trading on 1 December 2015 and its imprints were sold to The Crowood Press. Robert Hale Robert Hale was born in 1887/8, and worked in publishing from leaving school.Obituary in The Times (London, England), Friday, 24 August 1956; page 11; Issue 53618. He was at John Long Ltd., a London firm taken over by Hutchinson & Co. in 1926, when he had become manager there. After the takeover he was managing director of the subsidiary. He moved to Jarrolds Publishing, working with the accountant S. Fowler Wright, another imprint of Hutchinson & Co. In the later 1920s he was a friend of Margery Allingham, a Jarrolds author, and her husband Philip Carter. Hale left Hutchinson & Co. in 1935, founding a company of his own. It was noted for its prolific list, and tight management. His choice of telegraphic address, \\"Barabbas\\", reflected publishing industry cynicism. The partners stated in 1939 were: H. Robert Hale, James Eric Heriot, Theodore MacDonald, and Desmond I. Vesey. Robert Hale died on 20 August 1956, aged 68. His son, John Hale then took over the company. Early books Robert Hale and Company early published authors including Wyndham Lewis. The Vulgar Streak (1941) contained an explanation by Lewis of fascism, as he explained in a letter to Hale; it was a commission from 1937, working title Men at Bay. In the meantime The Mysterious Mr Bull (Robert Hale, 1938), a satire against the political left, had appeared. Berthold Brecht's Threepenny Novel appeared in English translation (by Desmond Vesey) in 1937, published by Robert Hale as A Penny for the Poor. Vesey denied to Brecht, on behalf of the publisher, that its political content had been toned down. The Spanish Arena (1938) by William Foss and Cecil Gerahty had a preface by Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba, then representative in London of Francisco Franco. Its claims of a \\"Jewish conspiracy\\" among journalists opposed to Franco led to legal action by Reuters. Hale withdrew the book, and an edited edition was published by the Right Book Club. Farewell Leicester Square by Betty Miller was published in 1941. The company went on to publish her three final novels.

Operations  It conducts early phase clinical trials on behalf of companies developing drugs, as well as carrying out clinical research of its own design and funding. As of 2015, it was one of fourteen UK MHRA accredited Phase I units, conducted approximately 10% of all Phase I trials conducted in the UK, and had about 100 employees. It conducts research at a single site in London Bridge formally known as Guy's Drug Research Unit.  History  It was founded in 2001 by Jorg Taubel, Radivoj Arezina, and Ulrike Lorch.  Legal cases  In May 2015 it prompted a judicial review to prevent new rules from the UK Health Research Authority (HRA) from being implemented in April 2015. The new rules mandated that all drug companies and CROs in the UK register all clinical trials before the first participant is recruited, declare who sponsored the study, and publish the outcome of studies, not only for future trials, but for trials already approved and underway; these rules were supported by advocates for more transparency in clinical research, notably AllTrials. After Richmond filed suit the HRA amended the rules to remove the requirement to register trials that were already underway. Richmond's suit was narrowed several times as it proceeded and eventually was focused on the question of whether the retrospective application of transparency regulations to trials registered and approved before September 2013 was based in law, as the HRA had stated in its April 2015 revision of its documentation. The court ruled that while the HRA had the right to impose such rules, they were not based on law, and HRA did state that they were; the HRA paid ¬£75,000 to cover part of Richmond's legal costs. Richmond was involved in a UK employment law case that established a precedent that there are two kinds of liability under UK workplace harassment law ‚Äì \\"purpose\\" and \\"effect\\". In Richmond Pharmacology v. Dhaliwal Richmond appealed an employment tribunal ruling concerning remarks made by a manager to an employee in 2007; the tribunal ruled that the remarks had the effect of harassment - that the remarks were seen as derogatory and were based on the employee's ethnicity and gender - although harassment was not intended. In 2009, the appeal tribunal upheld the original tribunal decision.

Jack Tripper Jack E. Tripper, Jr. is portrayed by John Ritter. The character is based on the character Robin Tripp of the British sitcom Man About the House and Robin's Nest. Jack is the main character on Three's Company and its spinoff Three's a Crowd. Jack E. Tripper is a San Diego native who is a veteran of the United States Navy, where he was a member of a boxing team. He is discovered in the bathroom of Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow's apartment in Santa Monica on the morning after a going-away party they threw for their departing roommate Eleanor, explaining, \\"I came with a friend who knew one of the gatecrashers.\\" He previously lived at the YMCA and needed a place to stay, and the girls needed a new roommate to replace Eleanor. Janet reasoned with their landlord, Stanley Roper, who lived straight downstairs from the girls' apartment, and he agreed that Jack could stay because Janet told Mr. Roper that Jack is gay, without Jack's knowledge. Jack was, of course, straight (the comedy stemming from having to \\"play gay\\" provided much of the story for the sitcom), but to bypass Mr. Roper's policy against single men sharing an apartment with single women, Jack had to pose as a homosexual to Mr. Roper (and later to Mr. Furley, as well). Jack attended LA Tech on the G.I. Bill to follow his dreams of running a small French restaurant one day. He pursues a degree in culinary arts and works odd jobs from time to time. After completion of his schooling, he finds full-time employment as a chef, working for a popular restaurant owner named Frank Angelino (Jordan Charney). He worked his way up to head chef, and, around season seven, finally opened his own French restaurant called Jack's Bistro. Jack has an older brother named Lee, who once came to town for a visit (in the episode \\"Lee Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\"), and Jack displays his feelings of inferiority when compared to Lee (Jack felt perpetually in Lee's shadow since they were children, because Lee was always more successful). Jack and Lee's father, Jack Tripper, Sr. (played by comedian Dick Shawn), appeared in the episode \\"Like Father, Like Son\\". In the Season 7 episode \\"Extra, Extra\\", Jack's mother was played by actress Georgann Johnson. Jack is known for being a klutz. Much of the character's humor is derived from slapstick comedy. He is extremely clumsy and accident-prone, and is well known for his comic pratfalls. Jack is somewhat of a ladies' man and a playboy, but is also kind, loyal - and protective of his roommates, family, and friends. Despite having been a boxer in the Navy, he often cowered and allowed other men to bully him (mainly because of their larger size). Also, Jack is plagued by a fear of flying, as revealed in the episodes \\"Up in the Air\\" and \\"Cupid Works Overtime.\\" Jack has his own bedroom, while Janet and Chrissy share a second bedroom. A poster of The Beatles as they appeared late in their career can be seen hanging on the wall above Jack's bed. (The Beatles poster actually belonged to Ritter, an avid Beatles fan, and he lent it to the producers to hang on Jack's bedroom wall.) After Three's Company When Janet marries Phillip Dawson in the series finale \\"Friends and Lovers\\", Jack proposes to flight attendant Vicky Bradford. Though she loves him, Vicky turns Jack down since she does not want to marry and prefers that they live together instead. Jack refuses at first, but then he changes his mind and they move into the apartment above his bistro. Three's Company then ends its series run and the spin-off series Three's a Crowd begins, with Vicky and Jack living above the bistro and Vicky's father having purchased the restaurant from Mr. Angelino. Janet Wood Janet Wood was portrayed by Joyce DeWitt. Janet and her roommate Chrissy Snow (and later roommates Cindy Snow and Terri Alden) share an apartment in Santa Monica, California, and need a third roommate to help pay the rent after their old roommate, Eleanor, just had her baby, married, and moved out. On the morning after a going-away party they threw for Eleanor, Janet and Chrissy find Jack Tripper sleeping in their bathtub. Upon getting to know Jack, who at the time is staying at the local YMCA, Janet and Chrissy suggest that he move in as their new roommate (primarily because he is skilled in cooking, a skill that both girls lack). Their old-fashioned and curmudgeonly landlord, Stanley Roper, is opposed to the idea of a young man sharing an apartment with two young attractive women. However, Janet convinces Roper that Jack is gay to alleviate the landlord's concern about the living arrangement. Thus, Jack is allowed to move in under this guise. Janet worked in and ultimately manages the Arcade Flower Shop. She is very fond of plants, which are seen throughout the apartment. Janet is from Speedway, Indiana. She has a sister named Jenny (who came for a visit in the episode \\"My Sister's Keeper\\"), and a brother whose name is never mentioned. She graduated from college, but her major is never revealed. She is the daughter of Ruth and Roland Wood. In the episode \\"Chrissy Come Home\\", Janet states that her father is of Italian descent. She speaks Italian, although not fluently (as displayed in the episode \\"Loan Shark\\"). (Like her character, DeWitt is from Speedway and her father is of Italian descent.) Janet was portrayed as the intelligent, responsible, and \\"reliable\\" roommate as opposed to her more ditzy blonde counterparts Chrissy, Cindy, and Terri, with early episodes focusing on her self-consciousness over being less endowed than her female roommates, or at being perceived as less spontaneous. Perhaps because of her above-mentioned responsibility, Janet is the one who often reprimands Jack over his mischief. In the episode leading to the series finale of Three's Company, she meets Phillip Dawson at a reading of a will. In the series finale \\"Friends and Lovers\\", Janet and Phillip marry in the apartment with the rest of the gang in attendance. After Janet returns from her honeymoon, Phillip and she settle in their newly married life in another part of town. Chrissy Snow Christmas Noelle \\"Chrissy\\" Snow was portrayed by Suzanne Somers. In the original unaired pilot of Three's Company, Samantha, the character who would become Chrissy, was portrayed by Susanne Zenor. Zenor was not picked for the second filming of the pilot, so actress Susan Lanier took over the role of Chrissy. Somers ultimately won the permanent role in the third and final pilot. Chrissy was born in Fresno, the eldest child of Reverend Luther Snow (Peter Mark Richman) and his wife (Priscilla Morrill). In one episode, she explains that she was named \\"Christmas\\" because her father was a big fan of Bing Crosby (whose song \\"White Christmas\\" became a signature song of his). In another episode, she states that her name is Christmas due to having been born in December. However, in the episode \\"Roper's Niece\\", Janet states that Chrissy's birth was \\"not until January.\\" Yet, in the season-four episode \\"Chrissy's Hospitality\\", Chrissy falls and hits her head, ending up in the hospital as a result. She explains to the nurse that her father named her Christmas because \\"she was the best present he ever got.\\" Chrissy was born into a religious family and always loved her family traditions, such as Christmas with the family. Every Sunday, the Snow family would go to church to hear her father preach. She always loved her family and friends, and upon moving to Santa Monica, she assured them that she would eventually return home to Fresno. In her early 20s, Chrissy moved to Santa Monica, where she found a job as a typist. She found an apartment, owned and operated by Stanley and Helen Roper, which she shared with two other women, Janet Wood and Eleanor Garvey. In the pilot, a pregnant Eleanor got married in a reception in the apartment, but went into labor just as she was cutting the cake. After Eleanor had her baby and moved away, Janet and Chrissy were left needing a new roommate to help with living expenses. On the morning after a going-away party the girls threw for Eleanor, they find a man in their bathtub who had passed out and, after waking up, claimed that he was a friend of one of the party crashers. The girls suggested that the man, Jack Tripper, move in as their new roommate instead of other, less desirable candidates (one of them being a pompous, nasal-voiced woman named Patricia, nicknamed \\"Pattikins\\"). Concept and creation Chrissy's personality was an exaggerated characterization of the \\"dumb blonde\\" stereotype, as evidenced by her repeated confusion and misunderstandings, malapropisms, and girlish behavior. Chrissy is depicted as being quick to laugh at her own jokes, and quick to cry in an exaggerated, whining fashion (as a young child would do). Chrissy's behavior was reflected somewhat by her cousin, and eventual replacement, Cindy Snow, although Cindy was more klutzy, and less dim. Chrissy is modeled as an ingenue, a minister's daughter who seeks her fortune in the big city. As the naif, she frequently and unknowingly makes suggestive double entendres and is often oblivious to the attention she receives from ill- intentioned men. Her roommate Janet remarked that Chrissy totally fell apart at the littlest hint of \\"sweet talk.\\" In one episode, Chrissy was picked up by a police officer who assumed she was a prostitute, despite her innocence and good intentions. Regarding the character's look, for season three the makeup artist said that Chrissy should have snow-white hair, pink cheeks and dark eyes, and Somers suggested the hairstyle of an Afghan hound, and her signature side ponytail was created to hide an over-bleaching mishap. Departure Somers had emerged as a breakout character in the show. In 1978, she appeared on 50 magazine covers. Also, best-selling Chrissy Snow posters were produced and ABC even launched a doll which portrayed Somers as Chrissy. Somers was promoted as a rival to Farrah Fawcett by her manager, Jay Bernstein, who also managed Fawcett and other actresses of the day, such as Cheryl Ladd. After marrying former game show host Alan Hamel (whom Somers met for the first time while modeling prizes on a game show he hosted), Somers made him her manager. Somers was eventually axed from the series in the fifth season after a bitter and highly publicized salary dispute with the producers. On the series, her character of Chrissy was written out as having moved back home to Fresno to care for her ill mother. However, for a brief time (and to finish Somers' contract), Chrissy continued to appear briefly on the show in the episode's closing tag wherein she would call Janet or Jack from home and speak to one of them over the telephone, and more often than not Jack or Janet would fill Chrissy in on what happened on that episode. A couple episodes after Chrissy left, her cousin Cindy moved into the apartment with Jack and Janet for the remainder of the season. Upon the arrival of Terri Alden in season six; references to Chrissy vanished, only to be referred to once when the trio was being interviewed and Chrissy was mentioned as \\"the other girl\\" with whom Janet was living when she met Jack. From what is implied, especially by the time of Terri's arrival, Chrissy simply decided to stay home in Fresno and never kept in contact with her old roommates again. Cindy Snow Cindy Snow was portrayed by Jenilee Harrison during the show's fifth and sixth seasons (1980‚Äì82). The cousin of the character Chrissy Snow, Cindy was phased out to make way for Chrissy's permanent replacement Terri Alden. Ironically, Priscilla Barnes, who landed the role of Terri, had auditioned for the role of Cindy, but was turned down. Cindy hails from Fresno, the daughter of Mr. Snow (Alan Manson), niece of Reverend Luther Snow and first cousin of Chrissy Snow. Raised on a farm, she grew to have a great love of animals, and enjoyed helping her father and mother out on the farm. Although Cindy is a very pretty girl, she claims she always \\"played second fiddle to Chrissy, because she was so beautiful.\\" She was raised to enjoy the Snows' many wonderful traditions, such as going to church on Sundays to hear Reverend Snow preach, and being together for lavish, old-fashioned Christmas celebrations. One day when Cindy was a young woman, Mrs. Snow found her daughter's diary and read it from start to finish, and subsequently fell asleep. She said it was the most boring thing she had ever read and told Cindy that it would be a good idea if she did more with her life and got out of Fresno. When Chrissy went back to Fresno to care for her mother, Cindy took the opportunity to move out and into the apartment, taking Chrissy's place as the third member of the trio. Cindy debuted on the show in 1980 after producers needed a replacement for Chrissy after Suzanne Somers was fired over her salary dispute. At first, Jack Tripper and Janet Wood, Chrissy's roommates, worried about what it would be like to live with the klutzy farm girl, but they soon adjusted and became close friends with Cindy. When Chrissy declines to return (and Somers' contract expired), Cindy's temporary stay became permanent. She also takes Chrissy's old office job, working for Mr. Charles Hadley. Although she shares some of her cousin Chrissy's dim-witted and naive attitude, Cindy's trademark was that she was highly clumsy and accident-prone, often bumping into things or spilling things (with Jack more often than not bearing the brunt). Departure In the season-six premiere, \\"Jack Bares All\\", Cindy announced that she was moving out of the apartment to attend UCLA. Her replacement would be Terri Alden, a nurse. Producers of the show were seeking a permanent third roommate and were not confident with Jenilee Harrison in that role. Cindy did, however, continue to make appearances on the show during the sixth season, and was retained as a supporting character (and given cast billing credit). She has many pivotal appearances through midseason, and becomes the trio's part-time housekeeper in the episode \\"Maid to Order\\", but still hung out with the trio. Her last appearance is in the episode \\"Janet Wigs Out\\" near the end of season six. Cindy and Janet have a falling out when Janet buys a blonde wig and develops a condescending attitude toward her friends. When Janet wants to keep her wig a secret from her date, Cindy tries to prevent herself from revealing the truth. Terri Alden Terri Alden was portrayed by Priscilla Barnes. Terri was born in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, works as a registered nurse, and is portrayed as far less \\"ditzy\\" than her predecessors. She is written into the story as being Janet and Jack's new (and final) roommate. Although Jack originally disliked Terri, owing to a disastrous first meeting at the hospital when she administered a tetanus injection for a stubbed finger into his behind, he forgave her and warmed up to her eventually. It was Terri, in fact, who convinced Jack to move in with Victoria Bradford three seasons later, thus paving the way for the spinoff series Three's a Crowd. In response to complaints about the characterization of blondes on the show, the writers portrayed Terri as a \\"smart blonde\\", and a \\"woman with brains\\", electing to steer away from the ditziness of Chrissy Snow and the clumsiness of Cindy Snow, Terri's blonde roommate predecessors. A dedicated professional at work, Terri is more relaxed when off duty and out of uniform. In the series finale \\"Friends and Lovers\\", Terri quits her job at Wilshire Memorial Hospital and moves to Hawaii to continue her career as a nurse, caring for sick natives. Stanley Roper Stanley Roper was portrayed by Norman Fell. Stanley owns and manages the apartment building in Santa Monica that is home to Jack Tripper, Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow. He has a love-hate relationship with his wife, Helen. Although they care deeply for each other, Helen and Stanley regularly bicker and engage in one-upmanship, with Helen usually the intellectual victor. A significant amount of their tension is due to Helen's ongoing desire for romance with Stanley, while Stanley is either clueless or uninterested. During the character's time on the series, he was known for breaking the fourth wall by smiling and snickering at the camera after telling a one-liner joke, often at his wife's expense. One of his catchphrases is \\"Not tonight, Helen; I got a headache.\\" Although seemingly impotent, Stanley is sometimes known for spying on young women in bathing suits on the beach through his binoculars. Stanley is generally friendly toward the trio, but can be very angry if the rent is late. He is also not above exploiting his tenants' fear of raised rents to get chores and favors done. He is told that Jack is homosexual to bypass any objections he might have to a man living with two women. He does not appear to dislike Jack or homosexuals in general, but he does keep his distance whenever Jack gets \\"too close\\" to him and sees Jack's supposed homosexuality as a source of amusement and makes several jokes at his expense, often calling Jack \\"Tinkerbell\\". Stanley is extremely cheap (as revealed in the episode \\"Stanley's Hotline\\", in which the trio calls him \\"the cheapest man alive\\" and very much penny wise, pound foolish). Stanley drives a run-down 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air, which he attempted to sell to the trio, but reneged when he learned he could get a lot more money for it from another buyer (who thought it was the classic and far more valuable 1957 model). After the intended buyer learned it was actually a 1958 model, he added insult to injury by offering to tow it away if Stanley paid him $25. After Stanley sold the building to Bart Furley, Bart's brother Ralph took over as landlord. The Ropers In the Three's Company spinoff series The Ropers, Stanley and Helen move to Cheviot Hills, California and live next door to snobby real estate agent Jeffrey P. Brookes III (who eventually sells them their house). Stanley intensely disliked Jeffrey, and the feeling is mutual. When Stanley and Helen were investigating buying the house, Jeffrey's son David explained to Stanley that if his father did not like Stanley and Helen, he would never let them move in. When Jeffrey arrived for the showing, Stanley began telling a false story that the house was perfect for his \\"drums\\" and \\"wild parties.\\" Very quickly, Stanley and Helen were thrown out of the building by Jeffrey, but with much prompting from Helen, soon came back to get another look at it. Jeffrey then posted a phony \\"sold\\" sign in front of the house to deter them. Stanley concealed his joy, but for Helen's sake he feigned sadness, saying, \\"I would buy it in an instant if it wasn't sold!\\" David reveals that the house was not sold and Stanley is stuck with buying it. Helen Roper Helen Roper was portrayed by Audra Lindley and appeared on both Three's Company and The Ropers. The character was based on the character Mildred Roper on the series Man About the House and its spinoff George & Mildred (the British shows on which Three's Company and The Ropers were respectively based), which was played by Yootha Joyce. Helen always yearns for romance and sex with her uninterested husband, Stanley, and he almost never delivers, which frustrates her. Helen had a signature look featuring colorful flowing caftans and muumuus and oversize chunky necklaces. Helen enjoys a friendship with the three tenants who live above her, to whom she affectionately refers as \\"the kids\\". Helen, unlike her husband, knows that Jack is not gay, but out of fondness for the trio, plays along with the charade. Contrary to her tightfisted and very suspicious husband, Helen does not mind that Jack lives with Janet and Chrissy, and is very understanding of their situation. She frequently tries to defuse tense situations between her husband and the trio. Eventually, Stanley and she move to Cheviot Hills, an affluent neighborhood of Los Angeles, where her natural snobbishness asserts itself, often aided and abetted by her sister, Ethel Armbruster, who clearly despises Stanley. Despite her attempts at adopting the behavior of her more affluent neighbors, she still retains her kindness. She befriends Anne Brookes, the wife of Jeffrey Brookes III, a real estate agent who lives next door, and enjoys the company of their son, David. Return appearance on Three's Company Helen and Stanley returned to the trio's apartment in a special guest appearance. Helen was frustrated with Stanley because he forgot their anniversary. She went downstairs to Ralph Furley's apartment to get some sleep (Mr. Furley was out of town at the time). A very tired Mr. Furley returned home early and went straight to bed, unaware that he was not alone. Soon, Mr. Roper came in the bedroom, finding Helen and Ralph in bed together, and said, \\"Helen, if this (a supposed affair with Mr. Furley) is what you want, so be it.\\" Helen was upset and still angry. \\"Aren't you gonna fight for me?\\" she asked Stanley. Later, Stanley came back and started fighting for Helen against Mr. Furley, which made Helen happy. Soon, the two went to sleep in Mr. Furley's bed, which could have been the answer to Helen's wishes. Ralph Furley Ralph Furley was portrayed by Don Knotts. The character was introduced in the season four episode \\"The New Landlord\\", which aired September 25, 1979.https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/threes- company/episode-3-season-4/the-new-landlord/100544/ Ralph Furley is the landlord and manager of a Santa Monica apartment building that is now owned by his brother, Bart, who acquired it from Stanley Roper. It is the home to Jack Tripper, Larry Dallas, Janet Wood, and Chrissy Snow (later to Cindy Snow, then Terri Alden). Mr. Furley fancies himself a playboy, a \\"ladies' man\\" and a \\"macho man\\", despite the fact he has not had a date in years and is not appealing to women at all. Mr. Furley is very subservient and seems to fear his brother Bart. Like Stanley Roper before him, he was also tricked into believing that Jack was gay for him to continue living with Janet and Chrissy (in fact, Mr. Roper was the one who told Mr. Furley about this when he sold the building). Because of his own playboy lifestyle, Mr. Furley probably would have approved of the situation himself, but he knew his brother Bart would never tolerate a straight man living with two women. Also, like Mr. Roper before him, Mr. Furley liked to occasionally crack gay jokes about Jack at his expense (calling Jack \\"Tippy Toes\\" as opposed to Mr. Roper's \\"Tinkerbell\\"). Mr. Furley often wears outlandish leisure suits in very loud colors with ascots, and has his apartment decorated like a playboy's pad. Usually, his shirts are very brightly colored. For his role of Mr. Furley, Knotts donned a toupee. Although Mr. Furley's brother Bart is frequently mentioned by him, the character only appears in one episode, played by Hamilton Camp. Mr. Furley defends his decisions as apartment manager by stating that his brother Bart, being the owner of the building, would (or would not) also approve of a decision. Many of the characteristics and mannerisms of Mr. Furley are comparable to Knotts' most famous character, Barney Fife from The Andy Griffith Show. Larry Dallas Larry Dallas was portrayed by Richard Kline. The character is based on Larry Simmonds from Man About the House. He lives upstairs from the trio, and is Jack's best friend. He is also a womanizing playboy who often lies about his occupation to impress girls, claiming to be \\"Playboys best photographer,\\" a doctor, an airline pilot, etc.; his actual profession is a used car salesman. He habitually uses false names, including Jack's, when picking up women for one-night stands so that he might better forestall any attempts by such women to pursue a relationship, although the tactic backfired in \\"Will the Real Jack Tripper...\\" when a woman whom Larry impregnated was able to locate him because Jack's address and phone number were in the phone book (Larry's initial reaction was disgust at Jack for being \\"dumb\\" enough to allow such information to be available to the public). Larry is also constantly in debt, often owing Jack money. In one episode, when being questioned by his landlord Mr. Roper, Larry claimed to have served four years in the United States Marine Corps. Larry is of Greek descent, though this fact and his original last name are mentioned only in the episode where Jack opens Jack's Bistro, in which Larry explains that he shortened it to \\"Dallas\\" because he \\"could never spell 'Dalliapoulos' \\". Larry has the distinction of being the only other character besides Jack Tripper to appear on Three's Company and both of its spin-offs, The Ropers and Three's a Crowd. When appearing on Three's a Crowd near the end of its single season, he states that he had moved to Bakersfield due to downturns in the used car business. Lana Shields Lana Shields was portrayed by Ann Wedgeworth. Lana Shields is a bosomy, amorous, three-time older divorcee who had an unrequited crush on Jack. She is constantly flirting with Jack and tries to seduce him every time she is in his presence, while Jack, though, tries his best to avoid Lana at all costs, especially around new landlord Ralph Furley, who, like Mr. Roper before him, is deceived into believing Jack is a homosexual in order to allow Jack to continue living with Chrissy and Janet. Unlike Jack, though, Mr. Furley is attracted to Lana and regularly tries to \\"put the moves on her,\\" but she dislikes him, which he never comes to realize. Lana's first appearance was in the episode \\"Love Thy Neighbor\\" from season four, in which Jack takes a job as a male escort, which is how he first meets Lana, to make some quick cash. He soon learns that Lana wants to do much more with him than just have a casual dinner out on the town. In the next episode \\"The New Landlord\\" (which introduces Mr. Furley), the trio accidentally sells all of Mr. Furley's furniture to a junk dealer, thinking it was furniture Mr. Roper left behind and not realizing it belongs to their new landlord (who has not met anyone in the building yet). Mr. Furley becomes angry and gives the trio an eviction notice, but upon meeting Lana, he immediately becomes smitten. Mr. Furley and the trio then make a deal: Mr. Furley gets a date with Lana, and the trio will not have to move. Though she does not like Mr. Furley, Lana does seduce him on several occasions, to use him to get what she wants. For example, in one episode, she uses this tactic to convince Mr. Furley to accept the trio's rent money a few days late. In the episode \\"A-Camping We Will Go\\", Lana tricks Mr. Furley into going on a camping trip so she can be near Jack, who was talked into going by Larry Dallas, for the weekend. However, not long after this now- legendary episode, Lana disappears from the show without any explanation. Her final appearance was in the episode \\"A Black Letter Day\\". In the episode, Lana reads a newspaper advice column about a man living with two female roommates and the man is having an affair with one of them, and she assumes the column was about the trio. Character disappearance According to the book Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company, the addition of Lana to the cast caused tension between John Ritter and the show's writers. Ritter believed it would be out of character for the sex-crazed Jack to inexplicably turn down the advances of a sexually voracious, attractive older woman. The writers reasoned that because Lana was older than Jack, he would be turned off. Ritter did not believe that the middle-aged Lana, only meant to be in her 40s (whereas Jack was in his late 20s/early 30s), would repel Jack. Ann Wedgeworth, in the same book, claimed that she asked to be released from her contract because of Lana's dwindling role in the show. Frank Angelino Frank Angelino was played by Jordan Charney. A restaurateur, he is Jack's short-tempered boss at Angelino's Restaurant and landlord/partner at Jack's Bistro. This character appeared in 13 episodes.

Career   The PA and The PA's Story  In June 2014, Knowles self-published an e-book titled The PA, an autobiographical account of her time working as a personal assistant to various high profile personalities in the City of London. The PA reached No1 in both the Apple iTunes and Amazon chart for paid books and received widespread media attention. Subsequent to the success of the ebook, The PA, Knowles was offered a publishing deal to release the book as a paperback with John Blake Publishing, retitled as The PA's Story, it went on sale in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2015. In July 2019, Knowles completed the screenplay for the film adaptation of The PA. Subsequently, in February 2020, a UK film production company optioned the rights to make the film, which is in the development stage.  Friday Night Sucks  In 2009, Knowles founded the social networking site, Friday Night Sucks, which was aimed at people that were new to London. The inspiration for the site came when Knowles first moved to London and struggled to make new friends and fill her free time. An alternative to the dating website model, Friday Night Sucks offered new visitors to the capital a more authentic night out.

After 9/11, Aufhauser was a key player in disrupting and freezing further terrorist activity against the United States. He is best known for running the federal government's programs to go after terrorist financing, a major strategy in the war on terror. He ran the National Security Council Committee on Terrorist Financing; oversaw the legal departments of important agencies and divisions within the U.S. Treasury Department including International Banking, Domestic Banking, the U.S. Customs Service, IRS criminal and civil divisions, ATF, Financial Crimes and Money Laundering, and United States Secret Service; and supervised the federal government's multi-agency antiterrorism task force. In his numerous briefings before the House and Senate, he emphasized the importance of teaching tolerance and respect, often making clear distinctions between the vast majority of peaceful people in the Middle East and the practitioners of ‚Äúcounterfeit religion‚Äù who prayed on hopelessness to recruit terrorists. He began his career in 1977 at the law firm of Williams & Connolly. After completing his government service, he worked in investment banking and returned to Williams & Connolly in 2008. In 2010 and 2011, he was named as one of Washington's best attorneys.  Career overview  Aufhauser practiced law at the Williams & Connolly law firm from 1977 to 2001. In 2001, he was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as general counsel in the United States Department of the Treasury. After September 11, 2001, Aufhauser ran the National Security Council Committee on Terrorist Financing. He supervised the federal government's multi-agency antiterrorism task force. Between 2004 and 2008, he worked at UBS investment bank. Currently, Aufhauser is a partner at William & Connolly LLP, a Washington, D.C. law firm. He specializes in litigation, arbitration, and government investigations.  General Counsel, U.S. Treasury Department  During his tenure as the Treasury Department's general counsel, Aufhauser oversaw the legal departments of the IRS, U.S. Bureau of Customs, Secret Service, ATF, U.S. Mint, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Asset Controls, and several of the department's divisions including International Affairs, Domestic Banking and Finance, and Enforcement. He led the team that implemented the sections of the Patriot Act run by the Treasury Department. He also led the team that implemented economic sanctions. Additionally, he ran other programs related to the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq, money laundering, China currency issues, tax reform, and sovereign debt restructuring. Following the Enron crisis, President Bush appointed a Department of Justice task force on corporate fraud and abuse. Aufhauser served on the panel as Treasury's representative.  Work against terrorist financing  In Ron Suskind's book, The One Percent Doctrine, Suskind describes the acute difference between the public perception and the reality behind the use of the White House Situation Room: > ‚ÄúThe Situation Room ‚Äì that rectangle of wood paneling and dropdown screens > in the White House basement ‚Äì has recently matched the Oval Office as most > storied chamber of the US government. In an odd turn of the media age, this > tiny square of carpeted real estate has seized the public‚Äôs imagination. ‚Ä¶ > On balance though, little actually get done there‚Ä¶.For problem solving and > action plans, anxious public servants will, time and again, by pass the > Situation Room for its small adjacent conference room ‚Äì a place where real > work gets done.\\" Beginning in October 2001, a half dozen or so key officials met each Wednesday morning in the Situation Room's conference room. Aufhauser managed the group. Suskind writes, ‚ÄúDavid Aufhauser, an elegant Washington lawyer . . . coordinated the government‚Äôs overall ‚Äòfinancial war.‚Äô‚Äù Officials from the National Security Council, Central Intelligence Agency, and National Security Agency (NSA) met under Aufhauser‚Äôs command. The group‚Äôs mission was to figure out how money flowed around the globe to Al-Qaeda, and how to stop that flow. On June 15, 2004, Aufhauser testified before a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, ‚ÄúAn Assessment of Current Efforts to Combat Terrorism Financing.‚Äù In his testimony, he didn't mince words when describing Osama bin Laden, who he called a ‚Äúhapless businessman‚Äù whose ‚Äúventures failed and were not the principal source of al Qaeda‚Äôs wealth.‚Äù In explaining bin Laden's rise to leadership, Aufhauser testified, ‚ÄúIn doing so, bin Laden managed to leverage the tactic of terror into a malevolent dogma embraced by an army of madmen.‚Äù In his testimony, Aufhauser pushed hard for what he believed was the best strategy to fight terrorism: stop the funding of terrorism in order to ‚Äúscale back the violence [and] to deplete the resources made available to kill innocent people.‚Äù During the hearing (which was held in 2004), he declared that Al Qaeda was more lethal than it was on 9/11. Shortly after U.S. military forces removed Saddam Hussein from power at the start of the Iraq War, Aufhauser testified before the U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. In his testimony, Aufhauser advocated a policy to give back Iraq's wealth to the Iraqi people: Iraqi oil, $1.7 billion in Iraqi assets invested in the U.S., $2.3 billion in frozen assets held in other foreign countries, assets that had been stolen from the Iraq Central Bank, and a donor fund from the international community. He told the committee, ‚ÄúWhatever unfound money there is, ought to be returned to feed people.‚Äù  Terrorism‚Äôs three currencies  As an official at the Treasury Department, Aufhauser coined a phrase that represented the root causes of terrorism ‚Äì terrorism's ‚Äúthree currencies.‚Äù The three currencies are hate, counterfeit religion, and money. He believed that a hopeless environment in many areas within the Middle East created hate and counterfeit religion that fueled terrorist zealousness. However, one of the primary purposes of his role in the War on Terrorism was to go after terror financing. Aufhauser believed that a cash-rich terrorist cell would be difficult to stop. However, if forces could prevent the cell from obtaining finances in the first place, it would greatly diminish the threat.  Reverse money laundering  In the book Targeting Terrorist Financing: International Cooperation and New Regimes, author Arabinda Acharya offers a contrast between terrorist financing and traditional money laundering. While traditional money laundering is the act of turning criminally-obtained currency into clean-looking money, the reverse is true in terrorist financing; terrorists obtain legitimate-looking funding and then use it to conduct criminal acts. Acharya referred to this as ‚Äúreverse money laundering.‚Äù Aufhauser agreed; using traditional money laundering law enforcement tools to go after terrorist financing was a losing battle. Acharya writes, ‚ÄúThus as David Aufhauser, former General Counsel of the US Treasury puts it, using anti-money laundering tools to target terrorist financing is like ‚Äúlooking at the world of [terrorist financing] from the wrong end of the telescope.‚Äô‚Äù  Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had a little more than one hundred employees after 9/11. The office was not well understood by the public, but was powerful. One of OFAC's responsibilities was to administer the United States' economic sanctions programs. In 1986, OFAC issued its first list of \\"Specially Designated Nationals.\\" People on the list were generally barred from participating in America's banking system. After 9/11, OFAC used its legal sanctions powers to freeze and seize Al Qaeda's finances. However, before OFAC could do so, it needed authority from the President of the United States. Aufhauser and a small group of attorneys from Treasury and OFAC drafted the executive order they needed to go after Al Qaeda. Prior to 9/11, OFAC was legally restricted to pursue terrorist financing; it had to go after very specifically-designated terrorist organizations. Aufhauser and his colleagues drafted the executive order to give OFAC broad authority to go after terrorism at large. People and organizations subject to the new authority included financial supporters of terrorist organizations, the businesses owned by them, and anyone associated with them.  Elections law  In the November 2000 Florida presidential election legal battles, Aufhauser supervised the Republican Party's effort to have overseas military ballots counted. The ballots were cast on time, but received from theaters of conflict, such as Bosnia, too late for the November 4 count. Aufhauser prevailed on the legal arguments, the votes were opened, and the overwhelming majority elected Bush as president.  Education  Aufhauser earned his AB from Wesleyan Universityhttps://www.wc.com/Attorneys/David-D-Aufhauser, MBA from Harvard University, and JD from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He was a guest lecturer at Harvard Law School, the University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania and Georgetown University, MIT, and Johns Hopkins University.  Awards  The Treasury Department awarded Aufhauser the Alexander Hamilton Award. The award is the highest award that the Treasury Department gives. The FBI, CIA, Secret Service, and State Department also gave awards to Aufhauser for his service.  Boards  Aufhauser was a senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). In his role, he helped CSIS develop policy plans to curb terrorist financing. He is a trustee, advisor and board member to a number of organizations including the Atlantic Council, the Council on Foreign Relations, St. Albans School of Public Service, and the National Intelligence Council‚Äôs Global Markets Advisory Board.  Personal  Aufhauser was raised in Stony Brook, New York. He was born in New York City. Aufhauser has three children. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance, Aufhauser made the room laugh when he joked that his daughter had recently been elected president of her seventh grade class, only to learn that they have term limits.

The process often serves as a plot device and is used in innumerable science fiction stories as a means to transport a character from the past into the future or to aid interstellar space travel. Often, in addition to accomplishing whatever the character's primary task is in the future, he or she must cope with the strangeness of a new world, which may contain only traces of his or her previous surroundings. In some instances, a character is depicted as having skills or abilities that have been lost to society during their period of suspension, allowing them to function as a heroic figure in their new time. Mechanisms The mechanisms for the suspension and revival can vary widely. Early stories tend to use magical enchantment that induces a long sleep. Many modern stories attempt to portray it as scientific suspended animation or cryonics, while glossing over and ignoring most of the complexities. In the fictional versions, all the cells are usually viable and the revival process is simple or even spontaneous. Many stories feature accidental freezing and use technobabble to explain how the characters survived the process. Literature A depiction of Sleeping Beauty where the kingdom undergoes magical suspended animation for 100 years (by Viktor Mikhailovich Vasnetsov). A 1965 press photo of actors portraying the Robinson Family being placed in suspended animation for their space voyage in Lost in Space. Some form of suspended animation often occurs as an element in many King asleep in mountain stories, a genre in which folk heroes from past eras are believed to be sleeping or otherwise kept alive for extended periods until they are needed to return to deal with some great peril, for example, Holger Danske. In the classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty, a princess is cursed to sleep for 100 years by an evil fairy, where she would be awakened by a king's son. When the good fairy hears this, she knew that the princess would be frightened if she found herself alone when she wakes up. So the fairy uses her wand to put every living person and animal in the palace to sleep until the princess awakes. In Shakespeare, several tales (Romeo and Juliet, Cymbeline) employ plot devices of a drug which induces a suspended animation state which is indistinguishable from death. In American fiction, the first story to deal with suspended animation is the tale of Rip Van Winkle, a short story by American author Washington Irving published in 1819 as well as the name of the story's fictional protagonist. In the story, a British subject in the American colonies wanders into the Catskill Mountains in the years before the American Revolutionary War, and finds a group of fairies, whose moonshine he drinks. He then falls asleep for 20 years, and returns to his village in what is now the United States, finding his home town and country utterly changed. The story has become a prototype for social dislocation tales of the type.  Sci-fi literature mentions  Notable later science fiction short stories of the 19th century featuring suspended animation, deliberate or accidental, include Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"Some Words with a Mummy\\" (1845), and Lydia Maria Child's short story \\"Hilda Silfverling, A Fantasy\\" (1845), Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward and Jack London's first published work \\"A Thousand Deaths\\" (1899). In the 20th century science fiction featuring suspended animation include the notable V. Mayakovsky's Klop (1928),http://briefly.ru/majakovskij/klop/ H.P. Lovecraft's \\"Cool Air\\" (1928), and Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"The Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw\\" (1937). The character of Buck Rogers was introduced in the August 1928 issue of the pulp magazine Amazing Stories,.Garyn G. Roberts, \\"Buck Rogers\\", in Ray B. Browne and Pat Browne (.ed) The Guide To United States Popular Culture. Bowling Green, OH : Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 2001. (p.120) In the novella, Armageddon 2419 A.D., he is described as a World War I veteran who became trapped in a mine and was preserved for 500 years by mine gasses, a mythology that continued in the 1930s radio show, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.Vincent Terrace, Radio Program Openings and Closings, 1931-1972 (2003), p. 36: \\"Science fiction adventure about Buck Rogers, a 20th Century man held in suspended animation (by leaking gas in a mine) who awakens 500 years later\\". Many of the subjects in these early stories are unwilling ones, although a 1931 short story by Neil R. Jones called \\"The Jameson Satellite\\", in which the subject has himself deliberately preserved in space after death, has been credited with giving Robert Ettinger the seed of the idea of cryonics, when he was a teenager. Ettinger would later write a science fiction story called The Penultimate Trump, published in 1948, in which the explicit idea of cryopreservation of legally dead persons for future repair of medical causes of death is promulgated. Fictional application of suspended animation as rescue after freezing in space has continued since The Jameson Satellite in 1931. Arthur C. Clarke's 3001: The Final Odyssey reveals that Frank Poole, murdered by HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey was cryopreserved by his exposure to space, and found and revived 1,000 years later. In 1964, the comic book super-hero Captain America, popular in the 1940s and discontinued in the 1950s, returned to publication with the explanation that he had been accidentally frozen in the Arctic ice. The Age of the Pussyfoot, a work of science fiction by Frederik Pohl, concerns a man who is revived from cryopreservation in the year 2527, having been killed in a fire 500 years earlier. This story was first published as a serial in Galaxy Science Fiction in three parts, starting in October 1966, and was later published as a novel in 1969. Relatively few stories have been published concerning using cryonics for medical time travel. In the Edgar Allan Poe story mentioned above (1845), the electrically-revived mummy mentions that his Egyptian civilization uses mummification for time travel. The most in-depth novel based on contemporary cryonics is the national best-seller The First Immortal by James L. Halperin (1998). Giles Milton's 2014 thriller The Perfect Corpse is set in a fictional cryonics laboratory in Nevada; the narrative revolves around the resurrection of a perfectly frozen body discovered in the Greenland ice sheet. Film Movies featuring suspended animation include Late for Dinner (1991), Forever Young (1992), Demolition Man (1993), Idiocracy (2006), Realive (2016), Sexmission (1984), and the Woody Allen comedy Sleeper (1973) and Open Your Eyes (Abre los Ojos 1997, remade as Vanilla Sky, 2001). The 1984 film Iceman centered on a prehistoric man who was found and revived after being frozen for 40,000 years. Played dramatically in that film, the same concept was used for comedic effect in the 1992 film Encino Man. In both films, the prehistoric individual was depicted as having been flash-frozen naturally, with no special preparation to permit survival of the freezing experience, and thawing with no apparent lasting damage to their physical or mental abilities. In Iceman, the scientists examining the caveman before his thaw speculate that something in his diet acted as a natural antifreeze to prevent cell crystallization. Suspended animation is used during space travel in the James Cameron films Aliens (1986) and Avatar (2009). Cryosleep was also used in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014). It was also used in Morten Tyldum's Passengers (2016). The Empire Strikes Back (1980) involves the test freezing of Han Solo as proof of concept for suspension, which caused temporary blindness upon his successful revival. Austin Powers (1997) and its sequels (1999, 2002) use suspended animation as a plot device to insert a 1960s spy character and arch villain into a world decades later in which their behavior and expectations are often jarringly out of place. Television On television, suspended animation has appeared occasionally since the 1960s. It was prominently featured in the opening episode of the space adventure series Lost in Space (1965), in which a family of space travelers was placed in suspension for a five and a half year interstellar journey to a planet of the star Alpha Centauri. In the original series of Star Trek episode \\"Space Seed\\" (1967), 72 humans are found adrift in space in a state of suspended animation. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh, is played by Ricardo Montalb√°n who reprised the role in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982). Many elements of the \\"Space Seed\\" plot, including the cryogenic preservation of Khan and his followers, were used in the updated Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) with Khan played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The 1970s revival of Buck Rogers as a television series changed the origin story of its main character from that of a soldier preserved in a mine for 500 years to that of an astronaut on a deep space mission who became frozen for that length of time due to the failure of his life support systems.Tim Brooks, Earle Marsh, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows (1995), p. 143. Producer David E. Kelley wrote well-researched portrayals of cryonics for the TV show L.A. Law (1990), Picket Fences (1994), and Boston Legal (2005). In each case, there is a dying plaintiff petitioning a court for the right to elective cryopreservation. Cryonics also features as a plot element in the Castle episode \\"Head Case\\", where the episode's murder victim is recovered by a cryonics company before the team can discover the body, with the subsequent investigation being complicated by the legal battle to claim and analyse the body without jeopardizing the client's potential for future reanimation. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"The Neutral Zone\\" (1988), the 24th-century protagonists criticize cryonics despite its in-universe success, regarding it as \\"a fad\\" of primitive 20th-century people who were \\"afraid of death\\". In two separate comedy series, Red Dwarf (1988) and Futurama (1999), accidental long- term suspended animation is used as an initial plot device to permanently thrust a hapless contemporary protagonist into the far future. In the 2004 Australian Broadcasting Corporation's series Silversun, 550 people are cryonically suspended for 90 years as they travel to the new planet Silversun, 45 light years away from Earth. The series is set in the year 2050. In 2010, a Spanish soap opera titled Aurora premiered on the television network Telemundo. The theme of this soap is suspended animation and everything centers around it. It tells the story of Aurora Ponce de Leon, a 20-year-old who is frozen by her father after her death from a rare and mysterious disease. She comes back to life 20 years later and finds out how everything changed after her death. She has to adjust to life 20 years later; to being chronologically 40 years old, but looking like her 20-year-old self. The 1999 South Park episode \\"Prehistoric Ice Man\\" mocked conventions about people being having difficulty adjusting to life in the future by depicting a man who was thawed after having been frozen for only 32 months, but who was unable to accept the changes in fashion and music in that period. The dilemma is resolved by the man being taken to live in Iowa, which is shown to be three years behind the rest of the country in such areas. In another episode, Cartman froze himself so he could unfreeze when the Nintendo Wii came out, but ended up far into the future. In the series Doctor Who, Time Lords can enter a suspended state at will, though they have to learn how. This can allow brief survival without oxygen, and may be mistaken for death by those unfamiliar with the ability. In the serial Destiny of the Daleks, the Doctor's companion Romana entered such a state after being captured by the titular cyborgs. They had her 'corpse' dumped outside, and she got up and walked away once they left. In the TV sitcom Mr. Meaty episode Original Sin, Edward R. Carney, the founder of the Mr. Meaty food chain with his renowned pork rib recipe, cryogenically froze himself in 1904 in order to carry on the Mr. Meaty world domination in the future. 100 years later, Josh and Parker thaw him out (thinking that he might give them a raise if they did). In The 100, during season 5, a group of prisoners awakes from cryopreservation after a little more than 100 years. They were on penal labor on a ship mining asteroids, but had to go under cryopreservation for this period given that the Earth had become temporarily uninhabitable. Manga and anime Faye Valentine, one of the main characters in Cowboy Bebop is actually around 77 years old, though only appears to be no more than 23 years old due to having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident, wherein she spent 54 years in cryogenic suspension and who, upon awakening from her cryogenic suspension, has to contend with her massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her, but were only there to take advantage of her naivet√©, to the point that even her surname \\"Valentine\\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor, leaving the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. It is eventually hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous Merlion statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and an old video tape from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion and it is implied that the accident that lead to her cryogenic suspension was due to an accident with an orbital gate.  Video games  Suspended animation is found in numerous video games, including games such as Halo that use it as a means of preventing aging during lengthy interstellar travel. *In Fallout 4, the main protagonist, the Sole Survivor, is in suspended animation through cryosleep as an experiment conducted by Vault-Tec in Vault 111. *In Mass Effect: Andromeda, the main protagonist, Pathfinder Ryder, along with entire arks full of passengers, are kept in cryosleep, while on a 600-year long journey to colonize the Andromeda Galaxy. *In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the main protagonist, Link, has been in a prolonged sleep for 100 years in the Shrine of Resurrection as a result of Princess Zelda‚Äôs request to defeat the game's main antagonist, Calamity Ganon. *In the seventh future Dead or Alive game, the fighters from books are in frozen, sleep and suspended animated for many years until they are revived in the present day. *In The Outer Worlds, the main protagonist is a space colonist that was put into suspended animation during transport to the Halcyon Colony. Due to unforeseen circumstances the ship was forced to finish its journey at sub-light speeds, turning what should have been a 10-year trip to a 70-year trip. The scientists in the colony are unable to unfreeze the colonists due to the extended time they have spent in suspended animation, and research to fix the problem would impact the bottom-line of the Halcyon Holdings Company that administers the system, so the ship is dumped at the edge of the colony until a rogue scientist resuscitates the protagonist in an effort to disrupt the Halcyon Holding Company's grip over the system and save the rest of the colonists trapped in suspended animation.

This illustrious institution was founded in 1896 under the munificent patronage of the Raja of Paralakhemundi \\"Shri Shri Shri Goura Chandra Gajapati Narayana Deo\\". In the same year it obtained affiliation as a second grade college from the Madras University. Due to the initiative and continued efforts by our foster father, Maharaja Sri Krushna Chandra Gajapati Narayana Deo the college was upgraded to the status of a first grade college in 1936. Originally affiliated to the Madras University and then to the Andhra University. The college had the honour of being one of the first five affiliated colleges with which Utkal University started functioning in November 1943. On 2 January 1967 Berhampur University came into existence and since then the college is affiliated to it. On 11 July 1947 the management was taken over by the Government of Orissa and the college was named after its foster father and patron Sri Krushna Chandra Gajapati. Towards the end of 1948, the college was shifted from its old building to the Morrison Extension (named after Mr .Cameran Morrison, Tutor of the Maharaja) in which it is housed today. The college has celebrated its centenary from 10 to 12 January 2001.  Notability  Conferment of Autonomy to this second oldest college of the state fulfills the long cherished demand of the students and the public of the region.

J.\\" Goodwin (born February 4, 1990) is an American football cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent following the 2014 NFL Draft. He played college football at California University of Pennsylvania. Early years Goodwin attended The Linsly School in Wheeling, West Virginia and began playing football until his senior year. He was a starter at wide receiver. In addition to football, he also competed in track and basketball. College career Bethany College After graduating from high school, Goodwin attended Bethany College. He would play basketball for Bethany for two seasons and transferred after his sophomore year. Fairmont State University Following his departure from Bethany, Goodwin would enroll in Fairmont State University for his junior year. After his arrival, he played in an intramural basketball game against the school's football staff. At the urging of his father, the late Perry Galloway, Jr., and his college roommate, future NFL player Dewey McDonald he eventually joined the Fighting Falcons football team. In his first game against Clarion he would make 6 catches for 56 yards. On September 22, Goodwin would amass 3 catches, 104 yards, and make an 83-yard touchdown catch in a game against West Liberty University (during a game against his first cousin Daree' Goodwin). While matching up against West Virginia Wesleyan, he would reel in three receptions, 55 receiving yards, and a career-high two touchdowns. In the next game against Seton Hill, Goodwin would score on a 31-yard reception. On November 10, he made a career-high seven catches for 141 receiving yards in a win against Shepherd. After walking on his first year and having a successful season he was offered a scholarship to continue playing for Fairmont. Head coach Mike Lopez would be fired after Goodwin's first year playing for Fairmont and accepted a defensive coordinator position with California University of Pennsylvania. Goodwin finished the 2012 season third on the team with 24 receptions and 440 receiving yards. He also led the team with 18.3 yards per a catch and finished the season with 4 touchdown receptions. California University of Pennsylvania After the departure of Fairmont's head coach, Goodwin would transfer to California University of Pennsylvania to continue playing wide receiver for his former head coach Mike Lopez. Since he already graduated from Fairmont, he was able to begin playing immediately, instead of sitting out a year due to NCAA student transfer guidelines. He would make his first touchdown reception of the 2013 season against Kutztown. In a game against IUP, he made two receptions for 16 yards. While playing Gannon, he made three receptions for 40 receiving yards. Against Millersville, Goodwin ended with a season-high four catches and 49 yards. Since he mainly saw action on special teams, he only finished his senior season at Cal-Pennsylvania with a total of 11 receptions, 126 receiving yards, and one touchdown in 11 games and one start. Professional career Pittsburgh Steelers After finishing his collegiate career, Goodwin would enter the 2014 NFL Draft. He was a virtually unknown prospect due to him playing at two NCAA Division II schools and he was thought to be a raw player, but also had good size and measurables to play wide receiver. Although he wasn't invited to the official NFL Combine held annually in Indianapolis, he still had good showing at a pre-draft combine held by the Detroit Lions. After going undrafted and not receiving any interest as an undrafted free agent immediately after the draft, Goodwin finally received a tryout with the Pittsburgh Steelers after Mel Blount urged them to give him an opportunity. On June 4, 2014, he signed an undrafted rookie free agent contract with the Steelers, for three-years and $1.53 million. He was released on August 26. He was added to the practice squad five days later. He signed a reserve/futures contract on January 5, 2015. On August 31, 2015, Goodwin was waived by the Steelers. Atlanta Falcons On November 3, 2015, Goodwin was signed to the Atlanta Falcons practice squad. Goodwin signed a reserve/futures contract with the Atlanta Falcons on January 5, 2016. During the Falcons training camp in 2016, he converted from a wide receiver to a cornerback. In 2016, he played in 14 games with one start, recording 17 tackles, 2 passes defensed and 10 special teams tackles. Goodwin and the Falcons reached Super Bowl LI on February 5, 2017. Against the New England Patriots, the Falcons fell in a 34‚Äì28 overtime defeat. He recorded two total tackles in the game.

He was placed on injured reserve on October 26, after undergoing surgery for a broken forearm. On December 24, he was activated off injured reserve, to play gunner on special teams and improve the coverage units. He played in two games, before being sidelined for 8 contests with a broken arm, returning for the season Ô¨Ånale and the playoffs. He finished the season with one special teams tackle.

The one-room school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The listing includes three structures: the former school building and two outhouses. History The first known school in Clinton County dates to around 1847 in the town of Lyons, which is now the north side of the city of Clinton. Bloomfield Township was established in 1855. The township's first school was a log structure built in 1859 in the town of Bloomfield, which became Delmar in 1871. The town established its own school district in 1874 and built its first school the following year. The township outside of Delmar was served by the Wilson District. It had nine country schools, and each was built to serve the educational needs of four sections of the township. Wilson #7 was built in the early 1880s on land owned by James and Ellen O'Meara, and is the only school building that remains of the original nine. It also has its original outhouses, eight of its original school desks, the original teachers' desk and chair, and some of the school books that date from the late 1800s. Electricity and an oil stove were installed in the building in the 1930s. Consolidation of rural schools began during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt who established the National Commission on Country Life in 1908 to find solutions to rural problems, including education. The process of rural school consolidation continued into the 1960s. Wilson #7 closed in 1956 and ended its nearly 75 years of service as a school. The Wilson District itself merged with the Elwood and Delmar school districts in 1962. The building now sits in a dilapidated state, although there are plans to rehabilitate it. Architecture The vernacular- style building is a frame structure with a vestibule. The side elevations feature three windows each. A brick chimney rises from the center of the west elevation. The school room itself has hardwood wooden floors and plaster walls. On both sides of the vestibule door are eight cupboards with metal latches. A raised platform of on the west side extends about into the room. The oil-burning stove is still extant. The vestibule extends from the main facade on the east. Its interior also has wooden floors and plaster walls. A window is located on the east wall, and hooks with a shelf above them are located on the north wall. The door on the south wall opened unto a porch that is no longer extant. The two outhouses, no longer extant, were built at the same time as the school building. The frame structures were located on the west side of the property, approximately from the school. The outhouse to the north was a three-hole privy, with one hole built for an adult. The one to the south was a two-hole privy built for children. The gender of the teacher determined which outhouse was used by which gender.

Written by Jeannine Renshaw and directed by Stephen Cragg, the episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on November 8, 2012. The initial airing was viewed by 9.26 million people and garnered a 3.3/8 Nielsen rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, registering the show as the week's highest rated television drama. Grey's Anatomy centers around a group of physicians struggling to balance their professional lives with their personal lives. In the episode Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) relives the memories of her half-sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) who died in the season eight finale plane crash when a patient with similar crush injuries comes into the hospital. The episode also focuses on Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) who deals with the death of her Minnesota mentor Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) in the middle of surgery. Meredith in spite of opposition from Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) tries to treat the crash victim while dealing with her personal feelings relating Lexie. She also juggles her daughter Zola at the hospital with the absence of her husband, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), with Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) helping her. Plot Meredith is forced to juggle parenting with work when Derek has a lecture in Boston. Cristina is on the phone with Meredith again, bragging to her about the aneurysm. Meredith is in her car, and she passes an accident. It looks bad, so she parks her car and gets out to help. The driver is fine, but when Meredith runs to the other side of the car, she sees woman trapped under the car. This reminds her of Lexie, who was trapped under a part of the crashed plane. Meredith and Cristina lean on each other and maintain their long- distance friendship. The two friends continue to cope with life after the plane crash and their ever-growing responsibilities at their respective hospitals. Cristina and Dr. Thomas are explaining to a patient with the aneurysm that she needs to have two surgeries: one to repair the current aneurysm, and another surgery to fix the defect that formed the aneurysm. The patient and her husband turn out to be doomsday preppers, ready for the apocalypse. Cristina and Dr. Thomas leave the room when they've finished their story. Meredith is adamant about saving the life of her patient, Melissa, and while operating there's a lot of bleeding when Callie enters the OR. Callie looks at the scan of Melissa's break and she says there must be a lot of bleeding. Richard comes into the OR to tell Meredith that Melissa's parents have been found and that they're coming to the hospital. Meredith asks for more blood transfusion, but Richard and Callie think that it might be time to pack up Melissa and let her body rest. She keeps operating a little longer, until Richard calls her name. She then agrees to pack up the patient. He is worried that the case is hitting a little too close to home for her after what happened to Lexie. He's worried that her emotions are clouding her judgement, but she tells him that that's not the case. She leaves to go check on Melissa. Meredith and Cristina are on the phone, Meredith is leaving the hospital, and Cristina is in a liquor store. Cristina says that she fears that the patient will die, and that Dr. Thomas will be fired. Meredith is worried about her patient too, as she needs to go home with Zola because Derek is out of town. Cristina is on the phone with Meredith again, telling her that Dr. Thomas will do the surgery. She says that he'll get fired if he does it. Meredith says that she needs to find the perfect window to open her patient back up. Meredith is writing her surgery on the O.R. board, as it's the perfect window to go in. Richard stands next to her, and Meredith assures him that it's nothing like in the woods, as they're in a hospital with a lot of medical resources. He wishes her good luck, and says that it's a right call to go back in. Ultimately Meredith has found the source of the bleeding and clamps it. She then makes time for a 30-second dance party, and makes everyone, including Bokhee, dance with her. Meredith comes into the attendings lounge, but Zola isn't there. She runs down a hallway, and then she sees Owen carrying Zola. He explains that he took her as April had a surgery and that Zola's fever is down. Cristina assists Dr. Thomas with a cardiac case, when he suddenly suffers a heart attack during the operation, he collapses. This forces Cristina to keep operating on her own. Meanwhile, several nurses get to Dr. Thomas and try to revive him. Dr. Parker comes in, and starts CPR. Cristina has her back turned towards them, so she asks what's going on. Dr. Parker tells her to focus on her patient. Cristina informs the patient's family that the patient is okay. The patient's husband hugs her. Melissa is asking for Meredith. She leaves Zola with Owen, as he doesn't have to go anywhere, and she runs off. Melissa meets Meredith, saying she remembers how Meredith was there when she was trapped. Meredith just put down Zola for the night when someone rings the doorbell. She opens the door and sees Cristina. They hug and Cristina says that she drank all the tequila that she bought earlier. \\"Lexie is dead,\\" Meredith says. \\"Yeah... Everyone's dead,\\" Cristina says, and they hug again. Production William Daniels made his last appearance as his character Dr. Craig Thomas died in the episode. \\"Beautiful Doom\\" was written by Jeannine Renshaw and directed by Stephen Cragg. The episode features many cross-overs between Seattle (with Meredith at Seattle Grace) and Minnesota (where Cristina was practicing at Mayo Clinic). The cross-overs were depicted via split-screen sequences which later on release garnered positive reviews. TVLine in April reported that Emmy winner William Daniels will guest star on an episode of Grey's Anatomy at the end of season 8, playing a proctor for Cristina Yang during her medical boards. This marked the first acting role for Daniels since playing a judge on a 2008 episode of Boston Legal. Daniels has had several iconic roles before that, including Dr. Mark Craig on St. Elsewhere for which he won two Emmy Award in the 1980s.

Wetpaint wrote, \\"Beautiful Doom was all about our favorite friendship. That's right, it was the Meredith Grey (Pompeo) and Cristina Yang (Oh) show, and it was nice to spend some quality time with the twisted sisters. Overall, we enjoyed the episode. The split screen was used well, and we loved seeing Cristina and Mer talk to each other about their lives. Dr. Thomas continued to be a delight, and his death really struck home.\\"http://www.wetpaint.com/2012-11-09-greys- anatomy-season-9-episode-5-review-what-did-you-think-of-beautiful-doom/ TVLine gave the episode a positive review as well stating, \\"After months of hype, Grey‚Äôs Anatomy at long last pulled the curtain back on its big Mer/Cristina- centric episode Thursday night. The memorable hour divided its time between Seattle Grace, where Mer was tending to a super-critical patient, and the Mayo Clinic, where Cristina was also tending to a super-critical patient. Before the end credits rolled, there was a pivotal death, a long-awaited comeback, and more split-screen action than an episode of 24.\\"http://tvline.com/2012/11/08/greys-anatomy-season-9-recap-cristina- meredith/ TwoCents also gave a positive review to the episode mainly for directing the praise to Oh and Pompeo as well saying, \\"After the first episodes of the seasons stuffed to the gills with new interns, new doctors, all cast members, and new locales, I found this hour to be refreshing in its simplicity and directness. Because regardless of the distance, I don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôve ever been closer or more mature with one another. And Cristina Yang is finally home where she belongs. Meredith and Cristina are each other‚Äôs person, and tonight they were our people and focus. right now I‚Äôm just so happy to see our twisted sisters reunited in person, that I can‚Äôt find much else to complain about!\\" The site also praised Sara Ramirez and Chandra Wilson adding, \\"Callie and Bailey fantastic in their limited appearances, reminding Meredith that they are both working mothers, trying to find the home-work balance.\\"http://twocentstv.com/greys-anatomy-recap-review-beautiful-doom/ Entertainment Weekly called it a \\"wrenching episode\\" adding, \\"It was undoubtedly by exactly perfect design, but Cristina uttered the most poignant line of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy‚Äôs ninth season so far in the last few seconds of last night‚Äôs episode ‚Äì a line that sums up everything that‚Äôs happened so far: \\"Everyone‚Äôs dead,\\" she said to Meredith without much fanfare, as the two best friends ‚Äì separated by half a country for five episodes ‚Äì embraced for the first time this fall.\\" Writing about the death of Dr. Craig Thomas the site wrote, \\"Grey‚Äôs decided to pull his plug much more dramatically, with him literally keeling over mid-surgery. Also thankfully, considering everything, Yang was successful in her surgery. If it hadn‚Äôt gone well, it might have sent me over the edge to have Feeny and the patient die minutes from each other.\\" The site also praised the closing scene of the episode, \\"I guess the moment ‚Äì a good one, with Cristina liquored up on tequila ‚Äì was a good one regardless, just seeing these good, old friends cross paths once again, as they should.\\"http://www.ew.com/recap/greys-anatomy-season-9-episode-5/2 E! Online praised the Pompeo and Oh's characters saying, \\"Tonight's episode was all about Meredith and Cristina. Even half a country apart, these two are still each other's people. A lot of the episode featured a split screen between Meredith in Seattle and Cristina in Minnesota, while each leaned on each other to get through some emotional times.\\" Wrirtng about Dr. Thomas' death the site added, \\"If he's going down, he wants to go down fighting. Unfortunately during surgery, Thomas goes down‚Ä¶literally. Why does Shonda Rhimes do this to us?! Maybe because this is what sends Cristina back to Seattle.\\"http://www.eonline.com/news/361654/grey-s-anatomy-recap-meredith- finally-copes-with-lexie-s-death SpoilerTV praised Pompeo, saying, The ensemble format of Grey's Anatomy works well for me. I love the inter-twining of the characters and the ongoing multiple stories. It's a hospital and hospitals bustle with constant activity so a large cast works well. But Meredith centered episodes always work too not just because she is the original key protagonist in the show but because her character has been so well developed over the show's long life. This episode was no exception. I thoroughly enjoyed Golden Hour in season 7 and Ellen Pompeo does an equally good job here sharing the screen, literally and metaphorically with Sandra Oh.\\"http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/11/greys-anatomy- episode-905-beautiful_14.html References 2012 American television episodes Grey's Anatomy (season 9) episodes ","title":"Beautiful Doom"},{"id":"47187795","text":"Voyvozh (; ) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) under the administrative jurisdiction of the town of republic significance of Sosnogorsk in the Komi Republic, Russia.

Education  Norman Kleeblatt received his A.B. in Art History from Rutgers University in 1971, and was awarded an M.A. and Diploma in Conservation in 1975 from the New York University Institute of Fine Arts.  Exhibitions  In 1987, Kleeblatt curated \\"The Dreyfus Affair: Art, Truth and Justice\\" (1987), which explored the relationship between art and politics by examining visual responses to the Dreyfus Affair in France. For this exhibition, Kleeblatt received the Pr√©sidence d'honneur, Comit√© scientifique, Soci√©t√© internationale d'histoire. The accompanying catalogue received an Honorable Mention from Henry Allen Moe Prize for catalogues of distinction in the arts. \\"Painting a Place in America: Jewish Artists in New York, 1900‚Äì1945\\" (1991, co-curator) focused on the choice faced by first generation Jewish- American artists to assimilate into the American cultural mainstream or to preserve their Jewish identities. The corresponding catalogue won the Henry Allen Moe Prize (second place) for catalogues of distinction in the arts and as co-recipient also won the National Jewish Book Award in the Visual Arts Category. Kleeblatt‚Äôs 1996 exhibition \\"Too Jewish? Challenging Traditional Identities‚Äù confronted issues surrounding stereotypes, questions of assimilation, and the issue of Jewish identity in the multicultural art world. In 1998, Kleeblatt co-curated with Kenneth Silver \\"An Expressionist in Paris: The Paintings of Chaim Soutine\\"‚Äîthe first major presentation of Chaim Soutine's work in New York in nearly 50years. The exhibit focused on Soutine‚Äôs reception by his patrons, supporters, and critics.

Barr, Jr. Award, College Art Association of America. \\"John Singer Sargent: Portraits of the Wertheimer Family\\" (2000) reunited for the first time in more than sixty years the twelve formal portraits of the Wertheimer family painted by John Singer Sargent. This exhibition told the story of a friendship between artist and patron and offered a unique glimpse into the world of a privileged family of English Jews. In 2001 the exhibit \\"Mirroring Evil: Nazi Imagery/Recent Art\\" contextualized controversial works by contemporary artists who employed images of Nazi villains rather than Holocaust victims. In 2008 ‚ÄúTheaters of Memory: Art and the Holocaust‚Äù presented eight artists‚Äô works that related history surrounding World War II, the atrocities of genocide and mass destruction, and their attendant moral devastation. \\"Action/Abstraction: Pollock, De Kooning, and American Art, 1940-1976\\" (2008‚Äì2009) reinterpreted Abstract Expressionism from the perspectives of influential, rival art critics Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg. Kleeblatt won the Best Thematic Museum Show in New York City in 2008 from The International Art Critics Association, and the Outstanding Exhibition award from the Association of Art Museum Curators. The catalogue received a Banister Fletcher Award honorable mention and a National Jewish Book Award in the Visual Arts category. ‚ÄúMel Bochner: Strong Language‚Äù (2014) explored Mel Bochner's career-long fascination with the cerebral and visual associations of words.

Following nearly two months of a stalled earlier offensive, YPG-led fighters renewed offensive operations on Sarrin on 18 June 2015, followed by a full- fledged operation on 1 July, after ISIL's Koban√Æ massacre. On 4 July, the town of Sarrin was fully besieged by YPG and FSA forces, as well as the village of Khirbat al-Burj and the Sarrin Grain Silos, both located north of Sarrin. On 12 July, ISIL forces managed to break the sieges and reestablish a supply line to Sarrin, after receiving reinforcements. However, on July 24, YPG and Free Syrian Army forces reestablished the siege of Sarrin, with the sieges of the Sarrin Grain Silos and Khirbat al-Burj being fully re-established by the next day. On 27 July, YPG-led forces fully captured Sarrin and the surrounding region, including 25 surrounding villages and 20+ farmlands, and the YPG declared the end of their offensive. Background In mid-March 2015, the YPG and the allied Euphrates Volcano (BurkƒÅn al-FurƒÅt) forces, backed by Coalition air support, launched an assault towards Sarrin, which was considered the last major ISIL stronghold in the Koban√Æ countryside. On 25 April 2015,YPG/FSA Joint Forces Have Breached ISIL Defensive Line North of Sarrin, Combat in City Kurdish forces and their allies surrounded the town on three sides and pushed into its suburbs,Battle of Sarrin: 26 April 2015 after breaching ISIL's defense lines. The YPG claimed that ISIL forces had retreated into the urban areas of the town. However, due to the continued arrival of ISIL reinforcements from the south, the YPG-led offensive in Sarrin stalled two days later. On 25 May, ISIL launched an assault to the north of Sarrin, breaking through Kurdish lines, capturing the villages of Mitras and Jabiriyah, and temporarily relieving the sieges of the Sarrin Grain Silos and Khirbat al-Burj. ISIL fighters also reduced Kurdish control of Sarrin to the western outskirts of the town.Kobani Canton conflict map: 25 May 2015 By 31 May, clashes erupted in the area that ISIL had recently captured, as YPG-led fighters attempted to retake the area.Kobani Canton conflict map: 31 May 2015 On 5 June, YPG-led fighters recaptured the village of Jabiriyah, to the east of Mitras, while clashes continued in the area stretching from Sarrin to the Sarrin Grain Silos. ISIL retook the western part of the Sarrin, while YPG-led fighters pushed towards the eastern outskirts of the town.Kobani Canton conflict map: 5 June 2015 The battle Renewed offensive On 18 June 2015, it was reported that the FSA and YPG had launched a new offensive on the town of Sarrin, with YPG forces attacking from the north, supported by an FSA push from the east. YPG-led fighters also recaptured the village of Mitras. On 25 June 2015, it was reported that around 175‚Äì400 ISIL militants were present in the Sarrin area. On 30 June, YPG-led fighters launched an operation to capture the town of Sarrin, in retaliation for the Koban√Æ massacre. On 1 July, YPG-led forces had re-established the sieges of the Sarrin Grain Silos and Khirbat al-Burj, and pushed towards Sarrin from the north. The YPG also captured the remaining hills and villages to the west of Sarrin.ISIL Driven From Key Hill Tops And Villages Near Sarrin. Offensive Begins. On 2 July, YPG and FSA forces to the southeast of Sarrin advanced westward, towards the village of Magharatayn, threatening the last ISIL supply route to the south of Sarrin. On 3 July, YPG-led forces captured Magharatayn and advanced towards the village of Malhah, located just west of Magharatayn, nearly severing the last road leading into Sarrin. Meanwhile, ISIL continued to send reinforcements from the south, as well as from the west bank of the Euphrates River, via covert boat crossings. Besieging Sarrin On 4 July, the YPG, backed by Coalition airstrikes, was reportedly making further advances. On the same day, it was reported that YPG-led forces captured the villages of Magharatayn and Malhah, to the south of Sarrin, severing the last supply route to Sarrin, and fully besieging the town. In response, ISIL carried out multiple vehicle bomb attacks in the area.Sarrin Urban Area Now Surrounded By Joint Forces. Daesh Line of Retreat Cut. On 7 July, ISIL was reportedly sending reinforcements to the south of Sarrin, in an attempt to break the siege of the town. At the same time, ISIL forces in Sarrin advanced southward towards Malhah, in an attempt to reopen the cut supply route. ISIL also detonated more vehicle bombs in the area, including a vehicle bomb at the village of Nur Ali, in an attempt to slow down the Kurdish-led offensive. Two of the vehicle bomb attacks were said to have been carried out by 16-year- olds. On 9 July, US-led Coalition airstrikes were reported to have dispersed ISIL forces in Sarrin into parts of the outskirts, whom were trying to avoid further airstrikes. On the same day, YPG led-forces tightened the siege of the town, and pushed into the eastern neighborhood of Sarrin. On 12 July, ISIL broke the siege in a counterattack, recapturing the village of Malhah, and reopening the supply route to the south of Sarrin. ISIL also relieved its besieged forces in Khirbat al-Burj and the Sarrin Grain Silos, and recaptured the villages of Mitras, Qasiq al Qibli (to the east of the Sarrin Grain Silos), with ISIL forces cutting across the M4 Highway at the Sarrin Grain Silos. ISIL forces also captured several villages around Sarrin; however, the YPG and FSA continued to control the high ground to the east and the west of Sarrin, still besieging the town from two sides.ISIL Advances Out Of Sarrin, Khirbat al-Burj Relieved. Mitras Taken, and M4 Highway Cut Later on the same day, YPG and FSA counterattacks halted the ISIL advance in the area, with YPG- led forces recapturing some of the lost villages. On 18 July, YPG-led forces recaptured the village of Qasiq al Qibli, to the east of the Sarrin Grain Silos, with ISIL forces reportedly fleeing from the battle towards Sarrin. Although ISIL continued to reinforce its forces in Sarrin from the south, including cross-river operations, it was reported that ISIL was unable to make any further gains since its counterattack on 12 July. Later on 18 July, YPG- led forces recaptured the village of Mitras, with the village of Qal at Hadid being fully secured by YPG-led forces on the next day. By 19 July, YPG and FSA fighters had recaptured the segment of the M4 Highway in the region, fully besieging ISIL fighters in the Sarrin Grain Silos once again, and capturing multiple villages to the east and the west of Sarrin. On 21 July, YPG and FSA forces had advanced to the eastern and western outskirts of Sarrin again, with ISIL reportedly reinforcing houses and preparing the roads in Sarrin for a YPG-led push into the town. ISIL fighters were also continuing to resupply their fighters from the south of Sarrin. On 22 July, ISIL attempted to recapture Mitras and to cross the M4 Highway again; however, this attack was repelled by multiple US-led Coalition airstrikes and a YPG-led counterattack. Around the same time, it was reported that heavy clashes had broken out around the urban areas of Khirbat al-Burj and Sarrin. Meanwhile, the ISIL fighters left in the Sarrin Grain Silos remained besieged by YPG-led forces. On 23 July, multiple US-led Coalition airstrikes struck ISIL fortifications and troop concentrations inside of Sarrin and to the south of the town. On 24 July, YPG-led forces advanced again, crossing the highway and capturing the village of Malhah, once again cutting off ISIL's last supply route to Sarrin. Heavy fighting continued around the urban areas of Sarrin. It was reported that the Euphrates Volcano (Burkan Al-Firat) forces had been pounding Sarrin with artillery for the past week, and that ISIL shot at civilians who tried to leave the town. On the next day, YPG and FSA forces advanced further southward, capturing the village of Milhah, located to the south of Malhah, further securing the siege of Sarrin. Later on the same day, in response to the YPG and FSA advances, ISIL attacked YPG fighters on the road between Magharatayn and Malhah, which ran into the southern part of Sarrin, before firing mortar bombs on the area after their initial attack failed. Battle for Sarrin On 25 July, YPG-led forces captured most of the villages around Sarrin, re-establishing the siege of Khirbat al-Burj, to the north of Sarrin, as well as fully securing the northern approaches to Sarrin. Meanwhile, ISIL forces in the besieged Sarrin Grain Silos continued to hold out. YPG-led forces were also reported to have stormed the town of Sarrin, entering the eastern neighborhoods of the town. On the same day, ISIL attempted to launch another wave of vehicle bomb attacks to stop the YPG and FSA advance; however, the YPG-led forces reportedly destroyed the vehicles before ISIL was ready, killing 7 ISIL militants. ISIL also attacked the villages of Shuikh and Qara Qozak, but YPG-led fighters repelled these attacks as well, killing at least one ISIL fighter. On 26 July, ISIL militants holed up inside of the Sarrin Grain Silos blew up part of the structure, with the main tower collapsing from the detonation. YPG-led forces captured the grain silos shortly afterwards. Later on the same day, YPG and FSA forces were reported to have secured most of the southern portion of Sarrin, after heavy US-led Coalition airstrikes. YPG fighters also attacked suspected ISIL militants between the villages of Geydade and Sina, to the northwest of Sarrin, killing five ISIL militants. On the night of 26 July, YPG-led forces captured the security center at the center of Sarrin, while ISIL militants were said to have run out of ammunition. Around the same time, a convoy of ISIL fighters from Sarrin attempted to escape across the Euphrates River; however, the YPG destroyed the convoy, killing 17 ISIL militants. On 27 July, YPG and FSA forces captured the besieged village of Khirbat al-Burj, the last village outside of Sarrin that was still held by ISIL. On the same day, YPG-led forces fully captured the town of Sarrin from ISIL. In the following events, it was reported that YPG forces had swept the village and arrested 150 men accused of being members or collaborators of ISIL. Aftermath On 29 July, the SOHR reported that violent clashes had erupted between the YPG and ISIL at the banks of the Euphrates River, near Sarrin, which resulted in casualties on both sides. On 30 July, an ISIL sleeper in Sarrin, as well as some ISIL fighters from the village of Serekaniye, in the northeastern Aleppo Province, managed to infiltrate the eastern part of Sarrin, dressed up as civilians. The ISIL militants launched a suicide attack and a gun battle. The attack was eventually repelled by Euphrates Volcano forces, and resulted in the deaths of 9 ISIL militants and 13 YPG fighters. On the night of 4 August, YPG-led fighters conducted an operation near the village of Milha, to the south of Sarrin, killing a number of ISIL fighters. On the night of 7 August, ISIL fighters on the western bank of the Euphrates River targeted Kurdish positions on the hilltops west of Sarrin with mortar fire. YPG-led forces responded by opening fire on ISIL positions across the river. Strategic analysis Sarrin has been deemed as strategically important, because the town was the last stronghold that ISIL controlled in the countryside of Koban√Æ, and because ISIL had used Sarrin as a launchpad to attack Koban√Æ and other villages in the region. After the capture of Sarrin and the surrounding region, it was expected that ISIL attacks against villages in the Koban√Æ Canton would be curbed significantly. The capture of Sarrin was also deemed to be a major defeat for ISIL, with the town's capture severing ISIL's main access route to parts of the Aleppo Governorate.

It occurs in shallow water in the Indo- Pacific region. This is an uncommon species of coral and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being \\"near threatened\\". Description Goniastrea favulus Colonies of Goniastrea favulus usually form greenish or brownish massive boulder-like structures. The polyps are either arranged in groups within a common corallite wall, or are in meandroid valleys. The walls of the corallites are thin, the septa bear large paliform lobes and there is a small central collumella. Distribution and habitat Goniastrea favulus is native to theIndo-Pacific region. Its range extends from northern Madagascar and the eastern coast of Africa to the Maldive Islands, southeastern Asia, Japan, Australia and island groups in the Pacific Ocean. It is found in the intertidal and subtidal zones on fore and hind reef slopes, and in lagoons. It is generally uncommon and is seldom found deeper than . Ecology Goniastrea favulus is a zooxanthellate species of coral, containing in its tissues many microscopic symbiotic dinoflagellates which during the day provide the coral with the products of photosynthesis. During the night, the polyps expand and extend their tentacles to catch zooplankton. Colonies of Goniastrea favulus are simultaneous hermaphrodites and spawn once a year. Spawning is a synchronised event with all the colonies in a locality releasing their gametes into the sea at much the same time. The sperm is released in a jet while the eggs are negatively buoyant and surrounded by mucous and adhere to the colony. Although a majority of the eggs are cross-fertilised, a large number are self-fertilised. This is in contrast to the closely related Goniastrea aspera, in which species both eggs and sperm are released in discrete buoyant packets which float to the surface. The clusters soon break apart and fertilisation then occurs, resulting in a much higher percentage of cross-fertilised eggs.

Head of the country's fatwa department, Menk has been identified as a Salafi.Sam Westrop, \\"Hidden in Plain Sight: Deobandis, Islamism and British Multiculturalism Policy\\" in Faith-Based Violence and Deobandi Militancy in Pakistan, Springer, 2016, p. 461 He has been named one of The 500 Most Influential Muslims in the world by the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought in Jordan in 2013, 2014 and 2017.  Biography  Menk was born in Harare, where he undertook his initial studies with his father, memorizing the Quran and learning Arabic, Urdu and Hanafi fiqh. He went to St. John's College (Harare) for senior school. He later specialised in Hanbali fiqh at the Islamic University of Madinah. Menk is known especially in eastern Africa and teaches internationally.  Views and Controversies  Menk opposes terrorism and has pledged his aid in curbing religious extremism in the Maldives. On 31 March 2018, he urged Liberian Muslims to avoid Muslim- Christian violence, arguing that Muslims and Christians are brothers and sisters from one father, the prophet Adam. He blames western media for misleading the world that Muslims are generally terrorists. According to Gulf News, Menk said that everyone on this earth is a part of a family and has one maker, therefore, no one has the right to force any belief or faith on another. The Huffington Post has described Menk as an \\"openly homophobic Islamic preacher\\" who has denounced the act of homosexuality as \\"filthy\\". In 2013, he was due to visit six British universities ‚Äì Oxford, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Glasgow ‚Äì but the speaking tour was cancelled after student unions and university officials expressed concern about his views. Menk's controversial statement included these words: \\"How can you engage in acts of immorality with the same sex?... The Qur'an clearly says it is wrong what you are doing... Allah speaks about how filthy this is... With all due respect to the animals, [homosexuals] are worse than animals.\\"  Bans from Traveling  On 31 October 2017, Singapore banned Menk from its borders because it believes he expresses views incompatible with its multicultural laws and policies. According to the Straits Times, he has asserted that \\"it is blasphemous for Muslims to greet believers of other faiths during festivals such as Christmas or Deepavali\\". Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement that its decision to reject Menk's application for a short-term work pass stemmed from his \\"segregationist and divisive teachings\\". The Majlisul Ulama Zimbabwe, Menk's own institution, released a statement to express \\"regret and dismay\\" regarding the ban. It said that Menk was an \\"asset to multi‚Äêcultural, multi‚Äêreligious Zimbabwe\\" and that viewers should \\"listen to his sermons in full\\" and not \\"edited clips of a few minutes\\" to see the moderate path he has chosen. In November 2018, the Danish government banned Menk from entering its borders.  Works  In 2018 he published a collection of his sayings as a book titled Motivational Moments and in 2019 published the second edition, titled Motivational Moments 2.

It was designed to be shown in a double-bill with another short play, Under Plain Cover. The Blood of the Bambergs is a satirical commentary on royal weddings, in a variation on the story of The Prisoner of Zenda. Background The play was inspired by the popular celebrations surrounding the marriage of Princess Margaret to Anthony Armstrong-Jones. Osborne's wife, the journalist Penelope Gilliatt, provided him with 'backstage gossip' about the arrangement of the events, which Osborne found absurd.Heilpern, John, John Osborne: A Patriot for Us, 2007, Random House, pp.287. Satire of the monarchy was still not acceptable on the English stage. Nevertheless, the Lord Chamberlain's office, which could effectively censor plays by denying them a license to perform, felt unable to reject the play. The \\"devilish cleverness of this horrid play\\", wrote the author of the office's report, is that \\"If a licence is refused, this can at once be presented as a ridiculous banning of the old Prisoner of Zenda story sixty years later\\". Plot British Princess Melanie of Bamberg is to be married to Prince Willy, heir to the throne of another kingdom. On his way to the wedding, Willy is killed in a road accident. State officials do not know what to do. The marriage is crucial for the future of the nation - especially as the next in line for the throne, the prince's brother, is a flagrant homosexual, unlikely to produce an heir. They discover that Russell, a brash Australian photographer, looks exactly like the deceased Willy. Russell is none too keen to take the job, but is enticed when he is told of all the advantages he will have as Prince Consort, not the least of which is the highly desirable Princess Melanie herself. However, Melanie, though beautiful, is a bully. She is appalled by the idea that she should marry a vulgar Australian. All is resolved when it is discovered that Russell is of royal blood, related to Willy through a royal affair with a commoner. Reception The play has typically been regarded as a clumsy work, showing Osborne's \\"lack of talent for satire\\", as Colin Wilson said.Colin Wilson, The Angry Years: The Rise and Fall of the Angry Young Men, Pavilion Books, 2014.

The single living Apystomyiidae species, Apystomyia elinguis, is native to California. Species of Hilarimorphites have been described from Mid to late Cretaceous Burmese and New Jersey ambers, while the single Apystomima species is from the Late Jurassic of Kazakhstan. Taxonomy The genus Apystomyia was first collected in the 1940s, described in 1950 and long placed into the bee-fly family Bombyliidae. The first specimens of the species were collected in 2005 after avoiding any collecting since the 1950 type specimens were collected. A study in 1993 suggested the genus was a sister-group to Eremoneura, while placement of the genus into Hilarimorphidae or allied to Therevidae was suggested in 1994. Conversely a new family, Apystomyiidae, was erected for the genus by Nagatomi and Liu based on the distinct structure of the male and female terminalia. They suggested a closer relationship with Cyclorrhapha. This placement was solidified and refined via molecular phylogenetic studies in 2010 which placed the genus as a sister of the Cyclorrhapha within the clade Eremoneura. Hilarimorphites was originally placed into the family Hilarimorphidae, but the wing morphology is closer to that of Apystomyia. Similarly Apystomimus was first placed as incertae sedis in the fly infraorder Asilomorpha, though noted as being near Apystomyia in relationship. both extinct genera have very similar wing strucuture, and are distinguished by the notably large cerci of Apystomimus zaitzevi, combined with the smaller wing- to-body ratio compared to that seen in Hilarimorphites. The group existed as a clade or stem grade on Laurasia from the Late Jurassic Karatau Lagerst√§tte of Kazakhstan through the middle Cretaceous Burmese amber forest. The Late Cretaceous New Jersey amber forest species are the oldest members of the clade in North America and the family is now reduced to a relic modern range scattered in California.

Life Charles Plumet was born in 1861. He became an architect and designed buildings in medieval and early French Renaissance styles. He collaborated with Tony Selmersheim (1871‚Äì1971) on interiors and furniture design in Art Nouveau forms. Charles Plumet became a member of l‚ÄôArt dans Tout (Art in Everything), an association of architects, painters and sculptors that was actively trying to renew decorative art between 1896 and 1901, following styles from adapted medieval to Art Nouveau. Other members were Tony Selmersheim, Henri Sauvage, Henri Nocq, Alexandre Charpentier, F√©lix Aubert, Jean Dampt and then √âtienne Moreau-N√©laton. Plumet was committed to functionalism and against the academic approach of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1902 he expressed the principle that \\"forms derive from needs\\". In 1907 he published two articles on regional architecture in L'Art et les artistes in which he said architecture should be united with the landscape. He wrote an article that praised Louis Bonnier (1856-1946), who he thought had carefully adapted forms to contexts and needs, but he rejected architecture that imitated the landscape. He said architecture should \\"develop in its setting like a flower or plant.\\" However, he gave the functionalist view that designers should add elements such as balconies, terraces, porches or gables \\"as context suggested\\" to express \\"the dweller's needs with regard to the climate, the orientation and the view.\\" By the start of the 20th century the partnership of Selmersheim and Plumet had become the leading Art Nouveau company in Paris. They tried to combine British and Belgian design innovations with French taste. The results could be graceful. Plumet's fa√ßades often included polychrome materials, bay windows and galleries open on one side. However, the buildings were not particularly innovative apart from the addition of curvilinear ornamentation, which was unusual at the time. Gustave Soulier considered Plumet and Selmersheim were truly innovative in their furniture designs, which combined workmanship, elegance and functionality. In 1908 Frantz Jourdain was president of the Salon d'automne, Plumet was vice- president and Henri Sauvage was sectional president for architecture. These three were visited in turn by Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, later known as Le Corbusier, who was looking for work. None of them could offer anything significant. Plumet was chief architect of the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris (1925). Charles Plumet died in 1928. Sample buildings Plumet was the architect of many apartment blocks and h√¥tels particuliers in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Examples of his expensive residential buildings in Paris are 67 Avenue de Malakoff (1895), 50 Avenue Victor Hugo (1900‚Äì1), and 15 and 21 Boulevard Lannes (1906). The house on Avenue de Malakoff, completed in 1898, was the first major work by Plumet and Selmersheim. It had a simple rectilinear form with very restrained use of Belgian-style decoration, and seems to be derived from Renaissance revival. A contemporary praised the building on Boulevard Lannes for \\"the play of solids and voids, the undulations of the facades in agreement with the layout of the apartments. Other buildings include the Ch√¢teau de Ch√™nemoireau, Loire-et-Cher (1901), and an office block at 33 Rue du Louvre, Paris (1913‚Äì14). Plumet was charged with designing the outside entrances to the Pelleport, Saint-Fargeau, and Porte des Lilas stations on the Paris M√©tro Line 3bis, which was finally completed in December 1920. Plumet designed the stations so the elevators are accessible directly from the surface. The three stations are made of reinforced concrete and ciment de Grenoble; they are decorated with ceramics made by Gentil & Bourdet. The stations are accessible only by the elevators. Plumet designed four towers for the 1925 exhibition, each with a regional restaurant from which the diners could look out over the city. He also designed the crafts palace.

The overarching goal of Rhodes University Library is to develop and maintain efficient, reliable and responsive library and scholarly communication services that promote, support and enhance the research, teaching and learning endeavours of Rhodes University.  Early historical development  Background and research acknowledgement: the following historic detail is largely based on the historic account drafted by Sue van der Riet in November 2010. At the stage of drafting the history, Sue was working as a librarian at Rhodes University Library. Within a couple of years after the founding of Rhodes University in 1904, a library collection was begun. The bulk of the initial library collection consisted of a gift, in 1907, from H.M. Stationery Office of ‚Äúsome hundreds of massive quarto volumes of The Anglo Saxon Chronicle, et hoe genus omne ‚Äì the famous ‚ÄòRolls Series‚Äù. This was followed by a substantial donation from Gill College, in Somerset East, of the material it had collected to prepare students for the examinations of the old University of the Cape of Good Hope. Initially housed in the Drostdy, in 1917 the library moved to a rudimentary building vacated by the Department of Botany. Although the environment was not considered a conducive area to house a library, the library continued to occupy the premises for the next 20 years. The end of the Great Depression enabled the university to build the centre portion of the main block, whose upper floor (under the clock tower) was allocated to the library, into which it moved in 1937. The foundation-stone was laid by Jan Hofmeyer, then Minister of Education, and it dutifully records in elegant Latin that once more the Rhodes Trust had contributed generously to the cost of the building‚Äù. By 1955, the library again found itself facing a critical shortage of space. Not only was the book collection growing at the rate of over 4,000 volumes per year, but ‚Äúaccommodation for readers was also proving insufficient and the student enrolment seemed set for a steady increase\\". The University Council afforded this predicament high priority, and due to the sound stewardship of its incumbent Vice-Chancellor, Dr Thomas Alty, the university's excellent financial status enabled it to call for tenders for an entirely new library building \\"on a plan designed to meet the most exacting requirements\\". This decision was almost certainly influenced by the prospect of the valuable space the library would release once it moved out of the main building as there was a \\"great shortage of classroom and study accommodation throughout the university\\". By the end of March 1958, a site had been identified and purchased. Situated in the heart of the campus, surrounded by residences and academic buildings, it had been \\"formerly occupied by the Grahamstown Tennis Club, a site agreed by all concerned in planning and building the library as being the ideal one for its new purpose\\". Able to accommodate its existing collection of 100,000 books, but with shelving capable of taking double that number, the building would, if filled to capacity, be able to house \\"perhaps over half a million books\\". There was seating for 360 readers, with sufficient room to increase this to 500. Declared officially opened on the afternoon of Saturday 8 April 1961 by Lady Schonland, wife of the Chancellor of the University, it was considered one of the finest of its kind in Africa. Together with furniture and equipment, it cost over R200,000.  Affiliated research libraries   The National English Literary Museum  Rhodes University Library housed the Thomas Pringle Collection, which later formed the National English Literary Museum, colloquially known as NELM. Launched in 1972 at the instigation of Professor Guy Butler, Karin de Jager recalls that the \\"fledgling Thomas Pringle Collection was housed in the only available open space in the Rhodes Library ‚Äì for unknown reasons dubbed The Priest‚Äôs Hole. This was a tiny room, always locked, safeguarding the sorry little Rhodes collection of ‚Äúbanned books\\". \\"All too rapidly\\" wrote Malcolm Hacksley, \\"the Collection had outgrown its first home and ... it moved from Rhodes University into its present premises in the ‚ÄúPriest‚Äôs House‚Äù in Beaufort Street.\\" So, in April 1980, rather charmingly, NELM, went from the Priest's Hole to the Priest's House, but retained its links to Rhodes University by becoming an Associated Research Institute of the University.  The Cory Library for Historical Research  Sir George Cory, in 1931, donated an extensive personal library to the Rhodes University Council, opening the collection for use by the Rhodes community. This collection was, at that time, considered to be the most valuable collection of Africana materials relating to the Eastern Cape. Additional donations received, coupled with physical building challenges, led to Council approving a decision to house the Cory collections in the Eden Grove complex as a separate research facility. The move was completed in 2000.  Post-2000 Developments  Various developments in the 1990s led to the realisation that the current library building was insufficient to address the needs of the campus community and the ever- increasing collections. After two-and-a-half years of research, consultation and planning, the Rhodes University Council approved plans the expand the library building. Estimated to cost R90 million, Rhodes University was able to allocate R50 million of an R80-million re-capitalisation grant made to the University by the Department of Education. The development team was tasked with raising the remaining R40 million and a major fundraising programme was initiated. On 22 September 2008, the ceremony marking the turning of the first sod took place and building was underway. On Thursday 4 November 2010, the new and expanded Rhodes University Library was officially opened by the Minister of Higher Education, Dr Blade Nzimande.

In 1918 Cohen published her autobiography, Out of the Shadow: A Russian Jewish Girlhood on the Lower East Side, which was well- received and appeared in French and Russian as well as English.

Biography  Born in Bucharest, his parents were CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne worker Gheorghe Dima, a relative of composer Gheorghe Dima; and his wife Virgilia (n√©e Maiorescu), descended from the family of Petru Maior. After attending primary school in Murfatlar and B√¢rlad, he enrolled in the classics section of his native city's Saint Sava National College, thanks to the help of his uncle, poet George Tutoveanu. In 1925, he entered the literature and philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest. He made his published debut in Rampa in 1926, with opinion pieces. His first book appeared in 1929; co-written with Sergiu Dan, it was a fictionalized biography titled Via»õa minunatƒÉ a lui Anton Pann. Dan was his best friend, and he was also very close to Ion Vinea and Pamfil »òeicaru. He wrote the novels Adorata (1930) and Nop»õi la Ada-Kaleh (1931) in the prevailing serialized style of the day. Dianu then entered the diplomatic field, working as Nicolae Titulescu's secretary for a decade and receiving accreditation from the League of Nations. During World War II, he wrote regularly for the official press. Following the war and the onset of a Romanian Communist Party-led government, he was sent to prison for his journalistic activity. After being released, he worked as a day laborer, woodcutter and book peddler. Found by Ion Caraion selling books in a passageway, he was able to retire and secure a pension from the Romanian Writers' Union upon the latter's proposal. He wrote three novels during the last five years of his life.

In 1963, he and his teammates qualified for the inaugural season of the German Bundesliga. One year later, the team he led as the captain became runner-up at the end of the first Bundesliga season.  Youth and Oberliga West (1948‚àí1963)  Preu√ü grew up in Meiderich which is a quarter of Duisburg and began playing football shortly after the end of the Second World War. He started playing on the street and football soon became his most important occupation.G√ºnter Preu√ü: Der Kapit√§n der Zebras. Books on Demand, Norderstedt 2014, p. 21 In 1948, he entered the youth team of Meidericher SV (in 1967 renamed as MSV Duisburg). The defender passed through the different age brackets and finally joined the U-19 where he took the role of the team captain. As he showed a certain talent, he was regularly nominated for the city selection of Duisburg.G√ºnter Preu√ü: Der Kapit√§n der Zebras. Books on Demand, Norderstedt 2014, p. 24f. During the season 1955-56, Meiderich only played in the second division after having been member of the Oberliga for six years in a row. As West Germany did not have a national league during this time the Oberliga West was the highest level. Preu√ü was 19 years old and considered as a candidate to join the second division team. When the defender Hans Sehlhoff was injured, the young player took his position for a match against STV Horst-Emscher in March 1956. At the start of the match, he made an important save on the goal line and his team finally won the match by 6-1. As a result, Preu√ü received the offer to sign a contract and became a part of the squad by accepting this offer.G√ºnter Preu√ü: Der Kapit√§n der Zebras. Books on Demand, Norderstedt 2014, p. 27f. He personally did not play again until the end of the season, but his teammates were able to qualify for the Oberliga. In the Oberliga, Meiderich did not have to fight against a possible relegation but usually made part of the top half of the table during the following years. Preu√ü was increasingly called up and broke into the first team during the season 1957-58.Dagmar Dahmen, Hermann Kewitz, Bernd Bemmann: MSV Duisburg - die Chronik: wo Meiderich siegt .... Mercator-Verlag, Duisburg 2005, p. 214 His team had successful years and even reached the fourth rank in 1958. By the time, the defender became one of the leaders and then received the role of the captain in 1961. One year later, the foundation of the Bundesliga scheduled for 1963 was enacted and Meidericher SV officially applied for a membership. The conditions for a qualification were not completely transparent which meant that the club had to be as good as possible during the season 1962-63. Preu√ü missed the initial phase due to an injury but then returned. During the final matchdays he even had to replace certain functions of manager Willi Multhaup who had announced to join SV Werder Bremen and thereby lost the recognition of his team. The MSV ended on the third position and received the message to be qualified for the Bundesliga.G√ºnter Preu√ü: Der Kapit√§n der Zebras. Books on Demand, Norderstedt 2014, p. 40/42f.  Player in the Bundesliga (1963‚àí1969)  In summer 1963, the team was supplemented by Helmut Rahn and the new manager Rudi Gutendorf but was still mainly composed by players who were born in Meiderich and developed in the youth teams of the club. They were considered as outsiders who probably would not be able to maintain their place in the new league. Preu√ü and his teammates started on 24 August 1963 with a 4-1 win against Karlsruher SC and surprisingly stayed part of the top group during the next time. A main reason for the success was a modern formation who integrated the full backs into the offensive actions of the team.G√ºnter Preu√ü: Der Kapit√§n der Zebras. Books on Demand, Norderstedt 2014, p. 47f. Meiderich finally ended on the second rank behind 1. FC K√∂ln. The MSV stayed in the top half of the table during the next years although they could not replicate the great success of the first year. By the time, Preu√ü lost some of his dominance within the team and in 1966, Werner Kr√§mer was determined to be the new captain. The former captain played his last match in the Bundesliga in June 1967. Afterwards, he officially stayed part of the squad for two more years but focused on his new role as assistant coach. He totally participated in 77 Bundesliga matches,G√ºnter Preu√ü, fussballdaten.de 150 Oberliga matches and one second division match without ever scoring a goal.  National team  During his years in the Oberliga, he was nominated for the West German national under-23 team. He debuted on the 21 December 1957 during a match against Hungary. Afterwards, he participated in a second match against Belgium in February 1958 but had to be replaced at the half time because he suffered from an ulcer. This meant the end of his career in national selection teams. Sepp Herberger later announced that he could possibly join the senior national team but this finally did not happen.G√ºnter Preu√ü: Der Kapit√§n der Zebras. Books on Demand, Norderstedt 2014, p. 29f.  Managerial career  Between 1967 and 1969, he stayed part of his old club which existed under the new name MSV Duisburg and worked as an assistant coach. In 1970, he joined Eintracht Duisburg and attended the first steps of Rudolf Seliger who later became a member of the national team. He continued his managerial career at the amateur clubs SV Neukirchen, VfB 03 Kleve and VfB Lohberg before signing at Hamborn 07 in 1979. One year later, he reached the promotion of his team but later declared his demission because of severe problems with the club's supporters.G√ºnter Preu√ü: Der Kapit√§n der Zebras. Books on Demand, Norderstedt 2014, p. 125/129f. This is explainable by the fact that Hamborn was once the main rival of his former club MSV. In 1981, he returned to this club where he had different roles during the following years. He was directeur sportif, assistant coach and even the first coach during some weeks. In 1986, he left the club which meant his retirement from football.

It was built between 1884 and 1899, and is a two-story, side- gable, building of post and beam construction. Associated with the mill is the one and a half - story, side-gable single-pile, miller's house (c. 1912), dam (c. 1884 - 1899), molasses cooking shed (c. 1920), and two-story frame gambrel-roof bank barn (c. 1912). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The original dam for the mill, on Dog Creek, was wholly constructed of dry-stacked stone with a single sluice and single gate. Several attempts were made over the years to remove or demolish the dam, but it proved very sturdy, even to dynamite. The center of the dam top was dislodged by dynamite in the mid 1900s and in the late 80s was concreted over to allow large debris flows over the dam and lessen possible damage. The mill was one of the first homes in the area to have electricity, powered by the dam itself and provided milling services for much of the valley. The mill has undergone several attempts to maintain the structure after several, very destructive storm seasons. The original corner column of dry-stacked river rocks was cement encased in 1984 to prevent further damage from debris impacts from floods. Later, additional support beams were added under the main structure in 2004 to prevent collapse of the mill.

It is mainly known for having one of the largest altarpieces in Spain and the only one carved in limestone. Since the Church of San Esteban was turned into a museum, it has served as the seat of the parish of San Esteban.329x329px  Description  The church was built in 1408, replacing another Romanesque temple. Inside the temple presides one of the most monumental altarpieces of the Castilian Renaissance art, designed and produced in the fifteenth century by Sim√≥n de Colonia and his son Francisco de Colonia The altarpiece dedicated to St. Nicholas is an imposing retable that is unique among its contemporaries in terms of its size and its materials. It is both the largest lay commissioned carved retable from late medieval Burgos and the only altarpiece made from stone that survives from the city's late medieval period This main altarpiece was financed by the Burgos merchant Don Gonzalo Lopez de Polanco prior to his death in 1505. The work measures 15.55 by 9.04 meters and is made of a porous limestone from Hontoria de Cantera, a small town in the province of Burgos. This type of stone was often used in the construction of buildings, including the Cathedral of Burgos and the Monasteries of San Pablo but was seldom used for altarpieces. The high altarpieces from the Cathedral of Toledo (c. 1498-1504), the Cathedral of Seville (c. 1482-1492), the Carthusian Monastery of El Paular (c. 1490-1500), and the Cathedral of Oviedo (c. 1500-1505), are all of similar in scale to the San Nicolas de Bari's altarpiece but the majority of these works were carved from wood and then polychromed. In addition to its Gothic tombs, the Renaissance arch of Mar√≠a S√°ez de O√±a and Fernando de Mena and the tables of the Burgos School of the Master of San Nicol√°s are also of great interest. Many of the works of art were also paid for by the Polanco family. The Church of San Nicolas de Bari in Burgos was declared a National Monument in Spain on January 26, 1917.

Located on 93.7 MHz, XEJP-FM is owned by Grupo Radio Centro and broadcasts contemporary music in Spanish from the 1980s to the present as \\"Joya 93.7\\". History XEJP traces its lineage to the first FM radio station in Mexico. In April 1947, the Diario Oficial de la Federaci√≥n ran an advisory asking for comments on the proposed award of a station on 94.1 MHz to Federico Obreg√≥n Cruces, and while said authorization was given on November 28, 1948, it was not until December 30, 1952 that the concession was awarded and the first FM station in Mexico came to air. \\"XHFM\\" broadcast with 3,000 watts and would be alone on the band until the sign-on of XEOY-FM in 1955.CIRT Historia The story of Radio Joya, as XHFM was known, was cut short on July 28, 1957, when an earthquake led to the total destruction of its studio facilities. However, the concession lived on. In 1958, as Obreg√≥n Cruces began to focus on building a new AM radio station, XHFM's concession passed to Francisco Aguirre Jim√©nez, the founder of Radio Centro. Owing to the low penetration of FM receivers and the preference of advertisers for AM, the station remained off the air until 1974, but during this period, significant changes were occurring. A realignment of Mexico City FM frequencies shifted the first few stations 400 kHz and led to a move to 93.7. Additionally, as was already the case with Radio Centro's other FM stations, the callsign was changed to match one of the company's existing AM outlets and XHFM became \\"XEJP-FM\\". The XHFM callsign would not return to Mexican radio until 2010, when an unrelated XHFM signed on in Veracruz. XEJP, now on 93.7 MHz, took to the air once more in 1974 as \\"Radio Joya\\", with a format of music in Spanish from the 1950s, 60s and 70s. By the end of the decade, it had already undergone two more changes in concessionaire, with Radio Am√©rica, S.A., and then Radio Impulsora de la Provincia, S.A. de C.V., becoming the concessionaires. In 1991 the station became known as \\"Stereo Joya\\" as part of a general refresh of Radio Centro's FM stations; it now had a format of contemporary and romantic music in Spanish. In 1993, Mariano Osorio, who had hosted news on XEEST-AM 1440 \\"Radio √âxitos\\", moved to XEJP-FM. He would become the station's signature personality, beginning with a morning show that on November 22, 1999 expanded to a seven-hour time slot (from 6:00 am until 1:00 pm), known as Hoy con Mariano. This was the first radio program of such a length in Mexico, and the format would later be used by other GRC stations. XEJP also picked up the En Concierto series of interviews with musical artists, which had previously aired on Radio Centro 1030. In 1996, a nightly program named Esencia de Mujer, hosted by Rocio Brauer, was added. Both programs ended their runs in November 2015. A nightly program known as Nocturno 93-7, hosted by voice actors Mario Arvizu and Sonia Casillas as well as Osorio's assistant Carlos Valle, replaced the latter on May 2, 2016. In 2012, the station's name was changed to just \\"Joya 93.7\\". With only these slight variations, the station has used \\"Joya\\" in its name throughout its entire history.

The pile is tended by a charcoal burner. It is similar to a charcoal kiln, but the latter is usually a permanent structure made of materials such as stone.  History  Since antiquity, charcoal piles have been used to make charcoal. Charcoal is much lighter than natural timber and therefore easier to transport. In addition, charcoal generates much more heat. Charcoal production was therefore an important part of the economy in early modern times. At that time, charcoal was the only fuel that could generate the heat necessary for iron smelting. In the late 18th century, it is recorded that the duties of a master coalman at an ironworks were not only to ensure the supply of charcoal and to supervise charcoal burners and their assistants, but also to visit frequently the charcoal clearings (Kohlh√§ue) i.e. those parts of the forest used to produce charcoal. In 1713, a process was invented for producing coke suitable for blast furnaces from hard coal (stone coal). From then on, the consumption of the more expensive charcoal decreased steadily despite increasing iron production. From the 17th century onwards, pitch furnaces were increasingly used and in the 19th century retorts were also employed. As a result, fewer and fewer charcoal piles were used. The gradual decline of charcoal began in the 19th century, when hard coal practically replaced charcoal and later also town gas and electricity became more important. The Second World War triggered a strong demand for charcoal again. At that time, motor vehicles were also powered by wood or charcoal. Today it is of no particular economic importance, in particular due to the loss of wood gases during charcoal production, the calorific value yield from wood is extremely low. Charcoal burning is still used only for traditional reasons and for some special applications of charcoal.  Operation  Video, part 1: construction of a charcoal pile (commentary in German) Video, part 2: burning and clearing of a charcoal pile (commentary in German) In order to produce charcoal, water and the volatile components of the wood have to evaporate. At the charcoal burning site, which is located where possible near a body of water so that it can be extinguished later, the wood pile is built in approximately hemispherical or conical piles, using short logs, mostly one-metre long, in even fashion (standing or lying down), all around, around the central chimney (Quandel). A bank of ash and earth (St√ºbbewall) can be built all around the pile. On top of this an airtight roof is constructed of dry fir branches, leaves, hay or straw, or alternatively of grass, vegetation and moss. Finally the pile is sealed airtight with a mix of ash and charcoal pieces (possibly known as 'culm' or 'brusque'; German: L√∂sche, St√ºbbe, Stibbe or Gest√ºbe) and earth, with the exception of the central chimney. A support made of logs and planks is then built around the base of the pile. Then the pile is ignited via the chimney which is then also sealed. A sure sign that the charring has started is the so-called 'knocking' of the pile. The strong heating leads to wood gas deflagration which, if the covering of the pile is too strong, to an explosion. At the top as well as at the foot of the pile, individual holes are made in the surface, by means of which the fire in the pile is regulated. Under this blanket, incineration is conducted with carefully regulated air access in such a way that, if possible, no more wood burns than is absolutely necessary to heat the entire wood mass to the charring temperature. The wood must char, not burn, inside the pile; air being let in through the small holes so that no fire can start. But it creates a lot of heat and the water evaporates, tar condenses on the green roof, the smoke is yellowish-white and odourless. The heat of the smouldering wood inside the pile drives all liquid and organic components out of the wood as smoke. The job of the charcoal burner at this stage is to neither let the pile go out nor to let it burn down as a result of too much air over the following days or weeks (depending on the size of the pile and the weather). To do this, he drills and closes the air holes. Essentially, only the gases and vapours that develop from the heated wood should burn. By observing the smoke and its colour, the charcoal burner knows whether there is too much or too little air. The colour of the smoke that escapes indicates whether charring is complete. If the smoke is white and dense, the wood is not yet charred. If it is light, almost transparent and slightly bluish, the wood is charred. The air holes are now moved further down in order to also draw the fire into the lower areas of the kiln. Each time the draft holes are moved, the smoke colour changes, the kiln charred from top to bottom. As the charring progresses, the kiln slowly sinks in. Once charring is complete, the fire in the pile is quickly extinguished by the clogging of the air holes. (PDF; 1.25 MB), at 750jahrewolfwil.ch, retrieved 14 August 2016. and the pile slowly begins to cool down. For better sealing the pile is often sprinkled with water and compacted with a wooden hammer. The pile has now shrunk to about half its original volume. Now the cover is opened and then the coal is pulled out with a rake, fork or shovel and spread out to cool down. Embers are extinguished with water or smothered with ash. If this is not done properly, the charcoal that has been produced burns within a very short time under great heat (exothermic reaction). The heat generated in this process is so great that it is impossible to approach the pile. The coal must now cool down for at least 12 hours. If the charcoal is too small it remains in the pile and is mixed with the ash. Only the carbon skeleton of the wood cells remains but this is still 98% of the wood. From 100 kg of hardwood, approximately 30 kg of charcoal can be obtained. During charcoal production, by-products are generated such as wood tar, wood vinegar, wood spirit and wood gas. These cannot be fully utilised in the pile. If tar extraction was to be combined with the charring of the pile, small pits were made in the ground or the ground was lined with clay and the tar led out of the pile by means of a channel, and the wood vinegar was treated with iron or copper.

It stars Ali Larter as a single mother who battles evil forces in her house. It premiered at SXSW in March 2015 and, after being released internationally, received a limited release in the US in October 2015.  Plot  Madison, a single mother, lives with her two children, Jacob and Hayleigh, in a suburban home. Madison's financial difficulties prompt her to consider declaring bankruptcy. Jacob was involved in a fight six months prior and now sees a counselor to evaluate his state of mind. Madison is dating her son's science tutor, Nikolai. The family experiences paranormal occurrences that manifest as a bloody and bound apparition and a bald man. Although Madison hires parapsychologists and psychics to investigate the haunting, none can help her. A man representing a research lab called CamSET makes an offer on their house in the hopes of developing the area. One night while the bald apparition attempts to harm the children, they attempt to flee the house, but the children become deathly ill whenever they leave. Madison decides that they all have to stay in the house until a solution can be found. Nikolai arrives and witnesses one of the apparitions. They set up scientific monitoring equipment to find a solution to the paranormal phenomenon. The bald man materializes and attacks the family, causing them to run upstairs, where the bald man's fingers are severed in a doorway. While analyzing the footage captured of the bald man, Madison discovers that he is wearing a shirt from CamSET. After searching online she finds a reference to Project ECHO and that Nikolai was previously employed by CamSET. Nikolai explains that they were working on teleportation with human subjects, but he left over ethical concerns. The project was at least forty years until completion, so Nikolai deduces that the bald man must be coming from the future. Madison and Nikolai set traps and make improvised weapons in hopes of killing the bald man when he rematerializes. They beat the bald man into submission. The police arrive but are quickly killed when the bald man reawakens, and Nikolai is rendered unconscious. Madison attempts to protect her children in the basement but is seriously wounded. Her son receives a cut on his right cheek that instantly appears on the bald man's face, and Madison realizes that the bald man is her son Jacob from the future. Nikolai regains consciousness and shoots the bald man in the back with one of the dead police officers' guns. Madison lies next to the bald man and is transported to the future. There it is explained that her son was captured trying to burn the lab down because of something CamSET did to his mother. He was subsequently lobotomized and used as a test subject in Project ECHO forty years in the future. Madison is healed and sent back to her own time, where she stares straight ahead while her son embraces her.

Legrand said he wanted to make a film that blends science fiction and horror elements together. He was influenced by David Cronenberg for the reality-based monsters, Steven Spielberg's emphasis on likable characters, and John Carpenter's long takes. He also cited how Alien hid its monster, which he said heightened the tension. Legrand did not want to distract audiences with ostentatious homage, so he borrowed only small amounts from each filmmaker. The special effects were practical, a decision that Legrand said aided actors in believably reacting to the threats in the film. Filming took place in February 2014.  Release  The Diabolical premiered at SXSW on March 17, 2015. It was released in Thailand on August 12 and in Malaysia on October 1, 2015. The total international gross was $84,259.

Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 40% of 10 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.42/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 25 out of 100 based on four reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

Biography Shraga Moshe Kalmanowitz was born in Rakov, Poland, to Avraham Kalmanowitz (1891‚Äì1964), the Rav of the town. His mother (Rochel) was the daughter of Betzalel Hakohen, a dayan (rabbinical court judge) in Vilna and author of the Talmudic commentary Mareh Kohen,Harav Betzalel was also the author of Reishis Bikkurim which appears in all printed editions of the Talmud. He was the eldest of three brothers; he also had two sisters. At the age of 10, Kalmanowitz began studying at the Mir yeshiva in Mir, Belarus, and later studied at the Kaminetz Yeshiva led by Baruch Ber Leibowitz. He came to the United States with his mother and siblings in 1941 (his father had immigrated a year earlier) and studied at both Yeshiva Torah Vodaas and Beth Medrash Elyon. After his marriage, Kalmanowitz became a maggid shiur in the Mir Yeshiva in Brooklyn.

It was designed to be shown in a double-bill with another short play, The Blood of the Bambergs. The play is a satirical commentary on sexual hypocrisy. It was the first play directed by Jonathan Miller.Heilpern, John, John Osborne: A Patriot for Us, 2007, Random House, pp.287. Background Sexually explicit content was still not acceptable on the English stage. The Lord Chamberlain's office, which could effectively censor plays by denying them a license to perform, called it \\"effluent\\". The report's author, Norman Gwatkin, stated that \\"I'm sure some people will swoon with delight at this latest Osborne effluent\\". Osborne's biographer John Heilpern says that it's a \\"miracle that the play passed the censor\\", but quotes Gwatkin saying that \\"the morals of anyone who pretends to understand what the play is all about will already be beyond contamination; and the remainder will ride the storm unsullied.\\" Plot A journalist shows an interest in a couple called Tim and Jenny, who appear to be normal suburban dwellers, with two young children. But it seems that they enjoy fetishistic dressing-up games, in which the couple plays a doctor and nurse; a mail-order bride and her husband-to-be; and other characters. Later the journalist discovers that, unknown to themselves, the couple are in fact a brother and sister. Once the story reaches the press it creates a sensation. The couple separate, and the woman remarries, but her marriage is unhappy. Eventually they get back together, all of their personal dramas being followed and partly created by the tabloid press. Disgusted with himself for nearly destroying the lives of a harmless happy couple, the journalist drinks himself insensible. Reception The play was much better received than The Blood of the Bambergs. It was taken seriously by Kenneth Tynan, as an exploration of privacy, public morality and the intrusion of the press. Harold Hobson considered that it brought Jean Genet's theatre of sexual radicalism of to England.Luc Gilleman, John Osborne: Vituperative Artist, Routledge, 2014, p.43. Heilpern says that the sexual politics is far less radical than plays such as Genet's The Balcony: \\"it's basically a prolonged panegyric to women's underwear.

They get work at the Lockheed aircraft factory. Although the United States is still neutral, the country is frantically gearing up for war, and Lockheed is producing fighters and bombers. As he has little money before his first paycheck, Corky stays with his friend Brad Maple (Jack Carson) and his wife Roma (Ann Sheridan) (whom he tried to pick up earlier before he knew who she was). Brad is unemployed, even though factory jobs are plentiful, because he thinks they are beneath him. This strains the marriage. At work, Corky befriends Jake Hanso (George Tobias) and his son Pete (Russell Arms). Pete is studying to become a military pilot. Corky rents a room from Jake after Brad becomes jealous of him. Later, Jake is let go because he is not an American citizen, enraging Pete. However, Jake and Corky calm him down, and Pete is accepted into the United States Army Air Corps as originally planned. Jake opens a diner. Later, he becomes a citizen and goes back to work building aircraft. Meanwhile, Roma leaves Brad. Corky, through sheer persistence, manages to get her to go out with him. Brad finally swallows his pride and gets a job at the Lockheed factory. This pleases Roma, who also now works at the factory, but not enough to take him back. This leads to an uneasy romantic triangle. In the end, Corky arranges for Roma and Brad to get back together. When the Japanese launch a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, Pete reports back to base and is shipped out. For the 2000th aircraft produced, a Lockheed Hudson bomber, the factory holds a ceremony. The company president singles out Jake, who played a major part in speeding up production tremendously. However, Jake has just received a telegram informing him that Pete was killed in action in the Philippines. He asks Corky, who has himself enlisted, to shoot down a couple of Japanese aircraft for Pete. Corky promises to do so. While Corky is flying a Hudson, his turret gunner shoots down two attacking Japanese fighters. Cast Production Wings for the Eagle, originally titled Shadow of Their Wings was partly set in Burbank, California near the Lockheed Corporation which had built a production facility where 45 buildings spread out over 550 acres. Warner Bros. received permission to shoot at the Lockheed plant, but, for security reasons, the film crew and actors were instructed to keep a birth certificate on them at all times. The original casting had Ronald Reagan co-starring with Dennis Morgan but he was replaced by Morgan and Jack Carson became the \\"sidekick\\". Warner Bros. advertised the connection with Lockheed in a full-page ad in Life magazine, dedicating the film, \\"to the workers who actually build Wings for the Eagle. To the workers of America's Fighting aircraft industry ... men and women devoted to the new gospel \\"We can! We must! We Will!\\" Wings for the Eagle was churned out quickly between January 12‚ÄìFebruary 1942 at both the Lockheed plant and the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company in Buffalo, New York, using a near-documentary film style. At the conclusion of the production, Sheridan, Morgan and Carson go on war bond tours together. Later, best friends Morgan and Carson would visit hospitals and camps throughout the South Pacific during the war.LaBianco, Lorraine. \\"Articles: 'Wings for the Eagle' (1942).\\" TCM, 2019.

Wings for the Eagle, now at the Strand, doesn't have the tight construction of its planes and it lacks some of the flaring excitement of films devoted mainly to scenes of air combat. But in the less spectacular job of making the war birds, emphasized by the urgent tempo of stamp presses and drills and cranes as the ribbed crates become sleek and perfect, it has taken some of the drama of battling planes out of the air and onto the ground. And because Warners' writers have the knack of taking dialogue out of a dinner jacket and putting it to work in overalls their smudged assembly line fighters act and talk like the ordinary folk they are supposed to be.\\"Strauss, Theodore (T.S.). \\"The screen in review: 'Wings for the Eagle,' Warner's film drama of the men who build the giant Bombers, is arrival at Strand Theatre.\\" NYTimes.com, August 1, 1942.

Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo in Aviation in the Cinema (1985) described how Wings for the Eagle benefitted from its association with Lockheed, especially being able to photograph the ceremony highlighting the rollout of the 2,000th aircraft produced for the war effort.

Puppy cat (or puppy-like cat, canine-like cat, dog- like cat, etc.) is a term used to refer to specific breeds of domestic cats that have unusual behavioral tendencies that are reminiscent of young domestic dogs. These are within the scope of feline behavior, and may be enhanced through selective breeding. These behaviors, not specific to any breed, include following people around from room to room, the desire to receive frequent moments of physical affection such as being held and petted, a lack of aggression toward some fellow animals, and a placid nature. While these attributes are found desirable for owners interacting with their cats, problems can occur when the felines are exposed to dogs and strange people, with the cats possibly being too trusting and too friendly for their own good. Breeds known for these canine behaviors include the Abyssinian, Burmese, Maine Coon, Manx, and Ragdoll, though dog behavior traits can appear regardless of breed. Breeds The cultural assumption that cats are distant from people and lack affection compared to dogs has complications. Animals have individual characteristics based on their environment, particularly their past interactions with people. The nature of selective breeding for both canines and felines varies dramatically across different human cultures as well, with highly distinctive traits (fertility, lifespan, speed, etc) receiving emphasis depending on the historical context. The feline temperament is particularly malleable to a wide set of environmental factors, especially sudden stresses. For example, after dangerous floods in Canvey Island, cats showed behaviors of psychological shock akin to human struggles. Well-raised kittens frequently demonstrate affection towards humans and a pleasant, docile nature regardless of pedigree. These broad traits are not specific to any particular breed, as the upbringing of the animal is an important factor. Positive interaction with humans in the first few months of life is particularly vital. Most feline pets in the United States are considered to be domestic short-haired cats, a catch- all term for those with mixed or otherwise unclear ancestries but having related appearances. Several of those cats, or those of the standardized American Shorthair breed, will respond differently to others despite looking very similar, displaying dog-like or otherwise unexpected tendencies. Besides breed-based generalizations, a particular cat's behavior can be assessed by its restraint in using claws during play, its tendency to follow people, and its appreciation of close, frequent human contact. Abyssinian Abyssinians often like dogs and water while also craving attention frequently. Abyssinian cats are known for demanding attention and showing depression if left alone too often. The closeness to their owners causes some of them to respond positively to feline leash-training. Unlike most cats, Abyssinians often show interest in water rather than a fear of it. A frequently active breed, Abyssinians will often climb upon their owners and perch upon their bodies to see. They also tend to welcome the company of friendly-minded dogs. Veterinarian Joan O. Joshua has said the \\"dog-like attachment to the owners\\" of Abyssinians causes \\"greater dependence on human contacts\\". This stands in contrast to the mere \\"tolerant acceptance of human company\\" based on \\"comforts\\" that multiple other breeds display. With their interest in playing with their owners combined with their curious intelligence, Abyssinians are nicknamed the \\"Clowns of the Cat Kingdom.\\" Burmese The Burmese breed typically displays the dog-like attachment seen in Abyssinians. They both also share the combination of high intelligence and tendency to stay close that makes training them to be on a leash practical. The Burmese are persistently more vocal than other breeds, this leading VCA Animal Hospitals to state that the typical one \\"[e]njoys engaging in conversation.\\" Their energetic nature also encourages play to an extent far more commonly associated with dogs. American and British breeders have developed distinctly different standards for the Burmese, a situation that's unusual among pedigreed cats, and the British type has attracted the colloquial title of 'European Burmese'. Many modern cat registries, however, don't recognize the difference between subtypes given the high degree of similarity between the cats' behaviors. However, their physical appearance can vary widely between those groups. Maine Coon Maine Coons tag along with their owners while also being trainable. Maine Coons are, according to Academy of Veterinary Nutrition Technicians President Kara Burns and Dr. Lori Renda-Francis, \\"often referred to as 'dog like'.\\" This description is not only due to their large size and stature but also because of the cats' usually pleasant mannerisms plus their tendency to closely follow their owners and obey them. Maine Coon cats additionally are often trainable given their intelligence and affectionate nature. The felines have large and silky coats yet grooming is made easier given their desire to be frequently handled. According to the Cat Fanciers' Association, Maine Coons offer \\"hours of enjoyment with their antics\\", though they are \\"intrusive\\" since \\"[w]ithout question\\" the cats \\"want to be [a] part of everything\\". Manx The Manx breed displays behaviors akin to puppies, such as coming when their owners whistle or call their names. They are known for jumping and climbing about obstacles as well as burying things, even collecting and burying toys at times. Manx felines will also display strong affection generally. Dr. David Taylor, writer and founder of the International Zoo Veterinary Group, has said they are \\"positively dog-like\\". Ragdoll Ragdolls can play fetch Ragdolls are named for an earlier tendency of the breed to go limp when picked up, and their tendencies to rest in a doll-like, bent position. They usually display a calm, relaxed temperament, with the animals often seeking physical affection from owners and following owners around. They sometime play games such as fetch.

The carvings, in fossil sand dunes (\\"jebels\\"), include geometric shapes, animals and ship shapes. It is Qatar's most extensive rock art site with more than 900 carvings scattered over 580 numbered sites. They are similar to those found at the temple of Karnak in Luxor, Egypt. The area also has ruined dwellings and remains of pottery from the 15th century. A large percentage of its coastal area is dotted with rocky hills, as hinted by its name. It is promoted as an important tourist attraction by the Qatar Tourism Authority. Etymology In Arabic, \\"jebel\\" translates to \\"hill\\". The second constituent is derived from the Arabic word \\"jassa\\", which means \\"to search\\". It received its name because its high elevation allows bystanders to spot oncoming ships. Area overview Jebel Jassassiyeh is in the northeast section of Qatar, around 3 miles south of Fuwayrit. Nearby settlements include Safiyaa Fuwairit, Al Marrawnah, and Al Huwailah. It consists of many prominent limestone jebels (sand dune) situated near the coastline. On average, the jebels are no more than 7 metres tall with a central ridge approximately 600 metres in length, rendering the assemblage of jebels one of the largest in the northeast peninsula. Carvings The carvings were first discovered by a Danish archaeological team led by Holger Kapel in 1961.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 221 Holger's son, Hans Kapel, surveyed and recorded the carvings in the 1974. He concluded that there were approximately 900 carvings of various types. Cup and ring marks are the most common forms of art among the carvings.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 220 Different animals are also depicted, including ostriches, turtles and fish. Jebel Jassassiyeh is the only rock art site in Qatar where boat depictions have been recorded.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 234 Boat carvings Two main categories, based on carving method and rendition, are used to classify the boat carvings. The first category, which accounts for 124 of the carvings, are drawn in plan. The second category accounts for only 17 of the boat carvings and consists of elevation drawings. Plan drawings are mainly found along the central ridge, whereas the elevation drawings are primarily found on the outcrops closer to the sea. The boats are of different sizes and types, and some contain oars while others do not.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 233 Two main types of dhows are included in elevation drawings: battils and baqarahs. Archaeologist William Facey has inferred that some of the elevation drawings are meant to represent pearling crafts due to the prominence of the boats' oars. Because the battils and baqarahs contained rudders, he concludes that the elevation drawings could not have been carved earlier than 1000‚Äì1200 AD. In later carvings, the boats appeared with sails. In some of the rock carvings, sails appear without boats. Some of the ancient carvings were modified at later periods, with devices such as ropes and anchors being added. The earliest date of origin for the carvings is inconclusive.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 243 Archaeologist Muhammad Abdul Nayeem (1998) tentatively dated the earliest of the carvings to the third century BC,Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 244 whereas William Facey (1987) dated the earliest plan and elevation drawings to the tenth century AD. A study conducted in 2012 which tested nine samples of carvings, including boat carvings, concluded that the oldest of the samples had a minimum age of less than 300 years. The study found no evidence to support the view of the carvings dating back millenniums. Settlement Jebel Jassassiyeh is thought to have been inhabited prior to the 18th century. The area's close proximity to the sea would have allowed for easy access for boats. The area contains clean groundwater which is close to the surface and there are several wells in the vicinity. Beatrice De Cardi's archaeological team reported in 1974 the presence of two habitation mounds and several potsherds dating to various periods, with the earliest recorded potsherds dating to the 10th or 11th century AD. William Facey notes the close proximity (4 miles) of Jebel Jassassiyeh to Al Huwaila, Qatar's largest town before the ascendance of Zubarah in the 18th century. He has speculated that the area could have functioned as a lookout post and restocking station for incoming pearling boats.

The New York Times called it \\"an absorbing documentary.\\" The film, which had its world premiere at IFFBoston on April 27, 2014, won six film festival awards and was broadcast on the PBS World Channel series America ReFramed on May 5, 2015 and January 24, 2017. The film, which follows the all-male sport of 9-man, was produced by a largely female crew, led by first-time director Ursula Liang and editor Michelle Chang. Featured in the film are U.S. volleyball Olympian and NBC commentator Kevin Wong and Chinatown historian John Kuo Wei Tchen. 9-Man also features the now deceased \\"mayor\\" of Boston's Chinatown, Reggie Wong, who was a leader in the 9-man community. 9-Man was part of the SkyFest series on Virgin America airlines in the summer of 2015. The music for the film was written by Adam Rubenstein and Scott CHOPS Jung, the pioneering Chinese-American hip-hop producer and member of Mountain Brothers. Synopsis The documentary follows several modern-day 9-man teams throughout one season framed by a historical portrait of Chinatown history and the game of 9-man. The first act of the film introduces the Boston Knights, Washington CYC (Chinese Youth Club), Toronto Connex and the Boston Freemasons as they begin the season preparing for competition with other teams. As the first act closes you are introduced to a character from New York Haiyan Townsmen, and east coast regional teams compete in the New York Mini tournament crowning an early season favorite. The second act of the film introduces the history of the game‚Äîtraveling to Toisan (Taishan), China‚Äîand its modern day rules, which include limiting participation by players who are not \\"100% Chinese.\\" The sport and isolation of the game are revealed as direct descendant of the Chinese Exclusion Act and racism faced by the community. The final act of the film unites the characters, teams and conflicts at the NACIVT championship tournament in Boston's Chinatown, setting up Olympian Kevin Wong as the player to beat. As teams fight for the title, they also bring to light the cultural belonging and loss of the modern Chinatown and 9-man community.

History Founded during the last quarter of 2011 (but operational as from 2012) by Dzekashu MacViban, Bakwa rose out of the need to fill the lacuna created by the absence of literary and cultural magazines in Cameroon, notably the defunct Pala Pala magazine, and it highlights a new dynamic Africa, often ignored by Western traditional media. Over the years, Bakwa has been able to establish alliances with important publications such as The Guardian (Guardian Africa Network), Chimurenga magazine, Kwani?, Saraba Magazine and The Ofi Press, which have led to collaborations on various projects.  Notable projects For its third issue, in 2012, Bakwa collaborated with The Ofi Press, an online literary magazine based in Mexico and edited by Jack Little. The Ofi Press published a special West African edition, with content in English and Spanish, which focused on West Africa, while Bakwa, in turn, published a special Mexican issue, focusing on Mexican art, culture and society, with most of the content in English and some Spanish translations. The project was lauded by several journals and outlets, especially the online website Heritage 1960 In 2015, Bakwa was part of #100DaysofAfricanReads, a social media project curated by Angela Wachuka, Executive Director of Kwani?, which entailed \\"a series of portraits on books, writers and readers, over a 100 day period ... highlighting the work of an African author in print and online\\". With the exception of an excerpt from Awes Osman‚Äôs novel, Skinless Goat in Somalia, Bakwa‚Äôs contribution to the project was made up of excerpts and stories from female Cameroonian writers. In the same year, in response to The Simpsons‚Äô episode \\"The Princess Guide\\", Bakwa did a two-part series on The Simpsons, wherein, bloggers, writers, cultural thinkers and academics were asked to comment on \\"The Princess Guide\\" episode. Most of the reactions highlighted poor research, one-dimensional characters, the challenge of portraying believable Nigerians, and the episode‚Äôs relatable character, Princess Kemi. This project on The Simpsons was later chosen by Dead Homer Society, for the \\"weekend reading\\" section.

The original concession was held by Radio Popular de M√©xico, S.A. but was sold to Radio Central de la Provincia in 1975. In August 1988, it changed its format and name to \\"Stereo 97.7\\" and now featured mostly Spanish- language pop, becoming a more general CHR station with music both in Spanish and English during the following years. The station's primary innovation in terms of format was the \\"three-by-three\\" (de tres por tres) song arrangement, in a time where usually only a song was aired before and after a commercial break. This arrangement was rapidly copied by other stations and even expanded (for example, airing blocks of five or six consecutive songs), and is practically commonplace in all musical stations nowadays. From 1989 until 1993, it was Mexico City's most popular radio station, being surpassed by the grupera \\"Sonido Z\\" (now \\"La Z\\") at XEQR-FM.

On June 1, 2018, Esquinca was replaced with Gabriel Roa, former director of XEQR-FM, who also replaced him in the morning show slot and added more variety to the station, bringing back English-language hits as well as pop hits from the 1980s to the 2000s. Talk era On October 17, 2018, the station began airing a morning newscast hosted by Carmen Aristegui (which is produced solely by her), and on December 3, GRC announced that XERC-FM would flip to a talk format beginning on January 14, 2019, retaining the Radio Centro name. Sergio Sarmiento, Guadalupe Ju√°rez, and sport hosts Carlos Albert and Enrique Beas made the move over from Radio Red, Julio Astillero, columnist from the La Jornada newspaper, joined Radio Centro to do an afternoon show, and Aristegui's newscast was expanded by an hour. Carlos Loret de Mola's Sin Anestesia newscast did not carry over, as the host opted not to accept the move of his program from its morning timeslot; he would return to W Radio. At launch, the station featured English classic hits musical programming on mid- morning, overnight and weekend slots, but they were dropped on February 1 to make room for the return of the newswheel format previously known as \\"Formato 21\\", now renamed \\"Radio Centro Noticias\\". Fernanda Tapia joined the station on February 6 in the mid-morning slot. In June 2019, Sarmiento and Ju√°rez left GRC to join the new Heraldo Radio, at the same time a new newscast hosted by Alejandro Paez Varela (director of website SinEmbargo.mx) and √Ålvaro Delgado (journalist from Proceso) made its debut. In August, Ricardo Raphael, who had earlier that year resigned from IMER, joined the lineup. Universal 97.7 On October 31, 2019, coinciding with the launch of Radio Centro's TV station XHFAMX-TDT, XERC-FM and XHRED-FM swapped formats, bringing the Universal English classic hits format to 97.7 and moving the talk programming to 88.1. As a transition, XERC simulcasted Universal from 8pm to 5am for two weeks prior to the switch. From April to mid-May 2020, the Universal format was simulcasted on XEQR-AM. Sale to MVS Radio On May 15, 2020, Grupo Radio Centro announced that it would sell XERC-FM to MVS Radio for a reported 500 million pesos (US$20 million). The deal will give Radio Centro additional capital as it seeks to negotiate a deal with its noteholders. MVS took over on June 1 and flipped the station to its La Mejor grupera format, which had previously aired on XHMVS-FM (from 2006 to 2008) and XEOC-AM (between 2010 and 2012). GRC also announced that the Universal format would return to XHRED-FM, sharing it with the news/talk format.

It broadcasts on 1130 kHz from studios on the university campus. History The first radio station associated with the university broadcast unofficially in the 1930s, when it was the National School of Agriculture (ENA); another, \\"Radio 6.6 Chapinguito\\", broadcast from the university in the 1950s under the auspices of professor Hebert del Valle. More broadcasting efforts were discussed in the late 1970s and 1980s, but it would not be until 1989 that a group acquired a 30-watt transmitter and started the modern Radio Chapingo. The station, known then unofficially as \\"XEUACH\\", was followed next year by the first proposal for a regional radio station with coverage beyond the university campus, but lack of space posed difficulties for the project. In August 1994, a tower was put into service, and the station went on the air again. With an official permit issued for XEUACH-AM in February 1997, the station on 1610 kHz became Mexico's first AM expanded band station. In 2000, it raised its power to 250 watts, changing to 5,000 watts in 2007. In 2014, Radio Chapingo filed for its permit renewal two days late, prompting the loss of the station's permit; however, radio service continued. On January 25, 2017, the Federal Telecommunications Institute approved the award of a new public concession to the university for XECHAP-AM 1130. The new dial position was made available in the area when XETOL-AM in Toluca migrated to FM. On September 7, 2018, XEUACH at 1610 went silent in order to begin the move to 1130. The new station broadcasts with 2,000 watts, less than before, but with increased population coverage compared to 1610.

He published the Shakers‚Äô first printed bound book and is considered by historians as the father of Shaker literature. He started the Shaker colonies of Union Village Shaker settlement in Ohio and Shaker village of Pleasant Hill in Kentucky. He is the most prolific composer of Shaker hymns and anthems.  Early life  McNemar was born 20 November 1770 at Tuscarora, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of the McNemar children and had several brothers and sisters. According to family records and an existing poem by McNemar his family name means \\"Nobody's Son.\\" There are several variations on the name, but the two prominent ones are \\"McNemar\\" and \\"McNamer\\". He is of Scotch-Irish descent that populated Pennsylvania. The McNemar family moved when he was five years old to Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. They lived there for four years and then moved east about ten miles to a settlement on Shaner's Creek where they stayed for three years. The family moved again in the fall of 1783 south to the Kishacoqueller Valley. This was at the end of the Revolutionary War. McNemar worked on the family farm in the summers from 1783 and in the winters went to school. He was the last to leave the family, at the age of fifteen, since he was the youngest.  Mid life  In 1786 he became a schoolteacher and was in charge of a school in Stone Valley, Pennsylvania. In 1787 during the summer he worked at odd jobs for an income. In the fall of 1787 he taught school at Redstone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. In the fall of 1788 he taught school in Stone Valley and in the spring of 1789 he returned to Redstone to continue teaching. In the summer of 1789 McNemar went to Kentucky. He returned from there on the first day of January 1790 and began teaching at Ligonier, Pennsylvania in Westmoreland County, where he continued until April 1791. McNemar began teaching at New Salem, Pennsylvania, in May 1791. In October he traveled down the Ohio River and arrived in the beginning of November at Maysville, Kentucky.  Adulthood  McNemar entered school and began to study Latin and theology in December 1791. He went to Cincinnati, Ohio, on 1 April 1792. He stayed in this city for three months and preached for the Presbyterian church. He delivered fifteen sermons in Cincinnati, Columbia, Round Bottom and Covalt's Station. Around the first of July in 1792 he returned to Elk Horn, Kentucky, where he continued his classical studies. McNemar moved to Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in December 1792 and lived with Robert Finley until May 1793. McNemar moved then and lived with John Luckes and stayed until the spring of 1795. He then moved to Madison County, Kentucky. He taught school there in the fall of 1796. Later in the year he returned to Cane Ridge and in January 1797 was licensed as a Presbyterian minister to preach. McNemar moved to Cabin Creek in the fall of 1797 and preached there at their church.  Kentucky Revival  The Kentucky Revival was a religious revival. It happened in Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and parts of Vermont. It was a series of events of psychological phenomena that started around 1800. The spread of the revival in Kentucky began in Christian County and Logan County and in the Spring of 1801 had reached Mason County. The revival developed into the Cane Ridge Revival in August 1801 which drew several thousand people. McNemar was preaching \\"free will\\" spirit and encouraged unrestrained physical activity in his church congregation around this same time. There were charges brought against him as this was not the normal custom of the Presbyterian church. McNemar officially dissolved his pastoral relation with the Presbyterian church at Cabin Creek in Lewis County, Kentucky, formally in the middle of April 1801. He went to a church in 1802 in Turtle Creek, that was near Lebanon, Ohio, where he preached part-time. A petition was signed by sixty members of the Turtle Creek Church that asked for McNemar to preach full-time. The Turtle Creek Church was near Lebanon, Ohio. Jonathan Tichenor and others disapproved of McNemar being made full-time pastor of the church. McNemar and four other Presbyterian ministers, Robert Marshall, John Dunlevy, Barton W. Stone and John Thompson withdrew and formed an independent church ‚Äì the New Light Church. This was the beginning in the \\"West\\" of the \\"free will\\" movement. McNemar was a leader of the religious movement. McNemar's New Light members split from the traditional Presbyterian customs and Calvinist theology. In time another separate faction called the schismatics broke away from the New Light members. They became even more physically expressive in their worship. McNemar's church sessions became exhortations on the order of the Holy Rollers. Church members had such shaking that their whole body vibrated. McNemar embraced this open excitement and claimed to his church members that it was spiritual inspiration. He interpreted New Light as an \\"inward light\\" that was above that of the Christian scriptures that the Presbyterians taught. Members of his new church could do unrestricted dancing by those that wished to do so, as it was fully tolerated and encouraged.  Shakerism  The Kentucky Revival book cover There was so much excitement generated in the McNemar church congregation that it was anticipated Jesus was about to come. Actually what happen instead was that three Shaker missionaries came from the New Lebanon Shaker community in New York for a visit in 1805 traveling by foot for over a thousand miles. They were Issachar Bates, Benjamin S. Youngs and John Meacham. They were bringing Shakerism to the \\"West.\\" The Shaker missionaries persuaded McNemar into their belief. McNemar, who embraced Shakerism, influenced this belief more than any other person to the local congregations and is the reason for the existence of the Shaker societies in the \\"West\\" ‚Äì Ohio and Kentucky. Eventually the New Light congregations that went for a little over a year and led by McNemar started the earliest Shaker colonies in the \\"West\\", Union Village Shaker settlement in Ohio and Shaker village of Pleasant Hill, Kentucky. McNemar wrote at the Union Village Shaker settlement The Kentucky Revival, a Short History, the Shakers first printed bound book. It gave details on this history of the Kentucky Revival that developed into Shakerism. It was printed in Cincinnati in 1807.  Personality  McNemar was tall and thin and had an outgoing personality. He read Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He was known as a classical scholar. He is considered by historians as the father of Shaker literature. McNemar became known as the \\"Father of Shaker music\\" and is the most prolific composer of Shaker hymns and anthems.Rycenga, Jennifer, Denise A. Seachrist and Elaine Keillor, \\"Snapshot: Three Views of Music and Religion\\", pgs. 129‚Äì139, in the .Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. \\"Richard McNemar, formerly a Presbyterian preacher who had been a leader of the Kentucky revival and is called the 'Father of Shaker Music,' composed more hymns, anthems, and exercise songs than any other Shaker of his day.\\"  Family  McNemar was married to Jane \\"Jennie\\" Luckey on 8 April 1793 in Bourbon County, Kentucky. Their children were: Levi, Benjamin, James, Vincy, Elisha, and Nancy McNemar.  Death  McNemar died 15 September 1839.

In September 2004, Pawlenty officially assigned him as the Coordinator staff liaison between a 12-member panel and the Governor's office where Lipman pressed for reform on the sentencing, supervision and treatment of predatory offenders in Minnesota. In January 2005, Pawlenty drew upon the panel's work when he proposed sex offender reforms. A number of these reforms were enacted by the Minnesota Legislature that year.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. History Peter Dierks, Sr. immigrated from Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) to the United States in 1848. He made the ocean voyage with other members of his family and landed in New York City. He went to stay with his brother John in Lyons, Iowa, now the north side of the city of Clinton. He rented a farm until he could afford to buy of his own land. He lived in a frame dwelling until he built this house in 1865 where he raised his family. He was engaged in general farming until he cleared more land and started a livestock operation. Dierks' became prosperous as he sold off some of his property to other settlers. He died in 1897 and his son, Peter Dierks, Jr., took over the farm and raised his ten children in the house. He added the wood-frame kitchen, with a Queen Anne style porch and pantry wing in 1899. Peter Jr. lost the house during the Great Depression in 1931 to Preston Creveling and his family. A bathroom was added into the house only in 1970. The Creveling family owned the house for almost 60 years when they sold it to Leif and Barbara Solheim in 1990. They sold it to Arlene Rose Considine in March 1996.

Its only species was previously attributed to Eudimorphodon, and its closest relatives may have been Eudimorphodon or Austriadraco. History of discovery In 1989, William Amaral on the McKnight Bjerg in the east of Greenland discovered a rich fossil site. It was excavated in 1991 and 1992. Part of the material was a small skeleton of a pterosaur. In 2001, Farish Jenkins, Neil Shubin, Stephen Gatesy and Kevin Padian named and described it as a new species of Eudimorphodon: Eudimorphodon cromptonellus. The specific name honours Professor Alfred Walter Crompton. The suffix ~ellus, in Latin indicating a diminutive, alluded to the small size of the specimen. The holotype, MGUH VP 3393, was found in the Carlsberg Fjord Beds of the √òrsted Dal Member of the Fleming Fjord Formation dating from the Norian ‚Äì Rhaetian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It is largely disarticulated. The reference to Eudimorphodon had been essentially based on the similarity in tooth form, especially the distinctive multi-cuspid build with three, four or five points on the crown. In 2003, Alexander Kellner pointed out that other basal pterosaurs also possess such teeth.Kellner, A.W.A., 2003, \\"Pterosaur phylogeny and comments on the evolutionary history of the group\\". In: Buffetaut E. and Mazin J-M. (Eds), Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs. Geological Society of London, Special Publications 217, pp. 105-137 In 2014, Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia noted that E. cromptonellus shared not a single trait with Eudimorphodon ranzii not present in other pterosaurs but lacked the distinguishing fang-like teeth, pterygoid teeth and striated tooth enamel.Dalla Vecchia F.M., 2014, Gli pterosauri triassici, Memorie del Museo Friulano di Storia Naturale, pubblicazione numero 54, 319 p., 266 figs, Museo Friulano di Storia Naturale, Udine In 2015, Kellner named a separate genus Arcticodactylus. The generic name is derived from the Arctic, and Greek Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ, daktylos, \\"finger\\", a usual suffix in pterosaur names since Pterodactylus. The Life Science Identifier is 72AE012A-018A-4B4B-950F-3CCB4C1D2471. The type species is Eudimorphodon cromptonellus, the combinatio nova is Arcticodactylus cromptonellus. Description The holotype individual of Arcticodactylus is the smallest pterosaur known, with an estimated wingspan of just twenty-four centimetres. It was in 2001, on the basis of histological research of its bone structure, considered not to have been full-grown yet, though not newly born. In 2015, Kellner established some distinguishing traits, correcting and adding to the 2001 diagnosis. The jaws have eleven or twelve multi-cusped teeth per side. The articulation surface of the fourth metacarpal with the fourth finger shows two true condyles. The thighbone is only a little shorter than the shinbone, with 96% of its length. The scapula is much longer, 93%, than the coracoid. The humerus is only slightly shorter than the thighbone, with 92% of its length, or the ulna with 91% of ulnar length. The thighbone is somewhat longer than the first phalanx of the wing finger that has 91% of femoral length. The third metatarsal of the foot is elongated with 56% of shinbone length. These proportions imply that Arcticodactylus had relatively short wings and large feet. Arcticodactylus can furthermore be distinguished from Eudimorphodon in the lack of long fang-like teeth in the middle of the tooth row and from Eudimorphodon ranzii, Carniadactylus and Bergamodactylus by a triangular instead of rectangular deltopectoral crest on the humerus. Articodactylus has fewer teeth than any other known Triassic pterosaur. Jenkins e.a. claimed that the unique articulation in Arcticodactylus between the main wing metacarpal and the wing finger, with two rounded condyles, was a transitional shape between the ancestral form that featured a single rounded articulation surface on the metacarpal allowing a considerable amount of lateral movement, and the condition in later pterosaurs that showed a gentle depression or trochlea. The two condyles, the upper one the largest, would have forced the finger into the most optimal plane of movement during the upstroke of the wing. Classification In 2001, E. cromptonellus was placed in the Eudimorphodontidae. Kellner in 2015 indicated a basal position in the Pterosauria, the short coracoid suggesting a close affinity to Austriadraco within an Austriadraconidae. According to Kellner, the original describers had incorrectly identified a coracoid as a quadrate bone. The following phylogenetic analysis follows the topology of Upchurch et al. (2015).

Jacob was primarily a lace designer, supplying numerous linen firms with designs during her career, becoming very established in this field by 1900. Much of this work drew on her botanical studies, with elements incorporated into designs for lace, floral damask, embroidery, crochet, and painted silk. She was a frequent prizewinner in London, and was part of the movement to elevate the position of crafts in the art world. Botanical illustration In 1908 she succeeded Lydia Shackleton as artist- in-residence and botanical illustrator at the National Botanic Gardens of Ireland. In particular, she produced illustrations of Sir Frederick Moore's collection of orchids, painting more than 150 such illustrations from 1908 to 1919. Her work was demonstrably different from Shackleton's. Her illustrations were quite scientifically rigorous, depicting the specimen from numerous angles, as well as dissections and enlargements. She studied the Irish language was a member of the Gaelic League, she signed and dated her paintings using Gaelic script.

He played two seasons of college basketball for the University of Memphis after playing for two community colleges. Early life and high school career Johnson's father is not in his life and his mother, Duana Hancock, raised him and his brother as a single parent. He attended Dunbar High School in Dayton, Ohio. After his sophomore season, Johnson's mother asked former NBA player Sedric Toney to mentor him. As a junior in 2008‚Äì09, he averaged 18.1 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 2.9 steals per game as he earned Dayton City League Player of the Year honors. As a senior in 2009‚Äì10, he averaged 16.8 points, 4.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds and 2.5 steals per game in helping lead Dunbar to a 25-3 overall record. He subsequently earned Dayton Daily News Division 2 Player of the Year honors. A top 100 recruit in the class of 2010, Johnson led Dunbar to a state title as a senior. However, poor grades and disciplinary issues, including an attempted burglary arrest as a junior, derailed his basketball career and forced him to pay in junior college instead of immediately enrolling in an NCAA Division 1 school. College career As a freshman at Chipola College in 2010‚Äì11, Johnson averaged 10.6 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game, as he helped lead the Indians to a 25-6 overall record and the Panhandle Conference championship. He was dismissed from the team due to possessing marijuana. As a sophomore at Garden City Community College in 2011‚Äì12, Johnson averaged 19.6 points and 5.6 rebounds in 25 games, as he led the Broncbusters to a 17-12 overall record. On February 22, 2012, he was expelled from the college after being arrested for theft and criminal trespassing. ‚ÄúAfter Garden City, I thought I wasn‚Äôt going to have an opportunity to bounce another basketball collegiately,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúThat frustrated me mentally and I‚Äôm glad God has given me the opportunity to make a way and keep striving at my goals, my dreams, and my aspirations.‚Äù On April 14, 2012, Johnson signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of Memphis. Coach Josh Pastner recruited Johnson as a replacement for Will Barton after it became clear that Barton would leave early for the professional ranks. Johnson was considered to be one of the best junior college players in the nation but a risky recruit due to his criminal record. As a result, Pastner set a unique midnight curfew and routine academic monitoring. Coming into his junior season, Johnson was suspended for three games by the NCAA for receiving impermissible benefits. As a junior at Memphis in 2012‚Äì13, Johnson saw action in 33 games and made 26 starts while averaging 10.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game. He subsequently earned third-team All-Conference USA and NABC Division I All-District 11 second team honors. He had a career-high 21 points in an 84-58 victory over Ohio. In the team's season-ending loss to Michigan State in the third round of the NCAA Tournament, Johnson had a team-high 16 points. Off the court, Johnson volunteered in the community by reading to small children and was honored for his academic achievement. He was one of the 19 players invited to the Kevin Durant Skills Academy over the summer after his junior year. As a senior in 2013‚Äì14, Johnson started 33 of 34 games and averaged 8.9 points, 4.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.3 steals per game. In doing so, he helped Memphis to a 24-10 overall record and a 12-6 conference mark in the program's first season in the American Athletic Conference in 2013‚Äì14. In May 2014, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft, Johnson joined the Houston Rockets for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On October 23, 2014, he signed with the Rockets, only to be waived two days later prior to the start of the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season. On November 2, 2014, he was acquired by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player. In 33 games for the Vipers in 2014‚Äì15, he averaged 5.2 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. In July 2015, Johnson joined the Los Angeles Clippers for the 2015 NBA Summer League. On May 26, 2018, Johnson signed with Halcones de Ciudad Obreg√≥n of the Mexican CIBACOPA. He averaged 15.8 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game in 25 games as Halcones made it to the CIBACOPA final.

He later went on to invent and patent an anti-periodic mixture prescribed to patients suffering from malarial fever. He was among the earliest Vaidyas trained in the science of western medicine. He founded Messrs. D. Gooptu and Co. at the age of twenty-two and turned it into one of the most successful business enterprises in British IndiaSomerset Playne, Bengal and Assam, Behar and Orissa: Their History, People, Commerce and Industrial Resources, 1917 Early life Dr. D Gooptu was the son of Brindaban Chandra Gupta who had considerable landed property in and around Calcutta. Dr. D Gooptu was one of the favourite students of David Hare and educated under his care at the Hare School in Calcutta. Mahashri Debendranath Tagore was his contemporary at the school. When the Medical College of Bengal was established in June 1835, he was admitted as one of the first four foundation students. He assisted Madhusudan Gupta in carrying out the first human dissection in modern India and Asia. Having passed his final examination on 2 February 1839 he was appointed by the Honourable East India Company as medical officer in one of the north-western towns but as he was inclined towards independent practice, he refused the post. Prince Dwarkanath Tagore had a dispensary of traditional Ayurvedic medicine at 13, Esplanade Road and entrusted Dr Gooptu to practice from there. He soon became family physician to Prince Dwarka Nath Tagore who introduced him to other well-to-do families in Calcutta, and thus at the age of twenty-two he began his career as a medical practitioner, becoming the family physician to all the Tagore households. Messrs. D. Gooptu & Co In 1840 the first indent of Messrs. D. Gooptu & Co. was written by Sir William Brook O'Shaughnessy the then professor of chemistry at the Medical College. The firm owned the first known dispensary of English drugs in India which was started by a Bengalee doctor. The business grew rapidly in succeeding years and in 1871 D. Gooptu became the sole proprietor of the company carrying it on till 1882, when he died, leaving the business in the hands of his three sons who continued the business until 1913, when the second son Mr R C Gooptu died. The flagship product of the company was the patented anti-periodic mixture, commonly known as \\" D. Gooptu Tonic,\\" which was the specific medicine prescribed for all kinds of fever and malarial fever and it had perhaps one of the largest sales among patented medicines in British India. There is a mention of the patented 'D.Gooptu' medicine in 'Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamritha' where he describes Dr Gooptu work as something which brings quick relief compared to traditional medicine; He uses the analogy to highlight the importance of path of devotion i.e. Bhakti yoga in times of Kali Yuga or 'age of vice' compared to the path of ritualistic action i.e. Karma yoga. It is also mentioned that when Ramakrishna was suffering from malarial fever in 1879-80, he got relief from the fever after having the medicine as traditional ayurvedic medicines were not effective. Dr D. Gooptu's proximity to the British also helped him to export his products to Africa and the business was transacted at 369, Upper Chitpore Road and 13, Esplanade Row East, Calcutta. Gopal Chandra Gooptu residence The Label used on the medicine bottle. Replica of the medicine bottle 'D.Gooptu' Apart from the anti-periodic mixture, there were several other proprietary medicines of the firm, the names of which are:- # Anti-periodic mixture \\"Falena Parichiyata\\" # Spleen and liver ointment # Special liver mixture for all kinds of ailment of that organ # Diarrhoea and dysentery pills # liver-purging pills. # Essence of Jamaica Sarsaparilla Family Deity The Family Deity The first ancestor of the 'Gooptu's' who came and settled down in Calcutta was Ramaram Goswami and became the one in charge of the temple of Madan Mohan. His son, Laksminarayan, who was also learned, continued to be in charge of the temple after his father's demise. Laxminarayan had two son's Jaganath and Kriparam. One night, Jagganath, who became a sanyas had a dream about a deity-Goddess Durga and following his dream, he wanted to create an idol out of the image which he dreamt, and thus set forth to create the Astadhatu (eight metals) figure of the deity through a particular ritual known as the pranpratishtha puja. This four and a half inch figure of Singhabahini, forged out of eight metals 'astadhatu' is the Kuladevata (family deity) and still remains with the clan and each branch of the family take turns to perform pujas throughout the year. This ritual has been carried on for over three hundred years.

A third of the value of A-shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange was lost within one month of the event. Major aftershocks occurred around 27 July and 24 August's \\"Black Monday\\". By 8‚Äì9 July 2015, the Shanghai stock market had fallen 30 percent over three weeks as 1,400 companies, or more than half listed, filed for a trading halt in an attempt to prevent further losses. Values of Chinese stock markets continued to drop despite efforts by the government to reduce the fall. After three stable weeks the Shanghai index fell again on 24 August by 8.48 percent, marking the largest fall since 2007. At the October 2015 International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meeting of \\"finance ministers and central bankers from the Washington-based lender‚Äôs 188 member-countries\\" held in Peru, China's slump dominated discussions with participants asking if \\"China‚Äôs economic downturn [would] trigger a new financial crisis\\". By the end of December 2015 China's stock market had recovered from the shocks and had outperformed S&P; for 2015, though still well below the 12 June highs. By the end of 2015 the Shanghai Composite Index was up 12.6 percent. In January 2016 the Chinese stock market experienced a steep sell-off and trading was halted on 4 and 7 January 2016 after the market fell 7%, the latter within 30 minutes of open. The market meltdown set off a global rout in early 2016. According to 19 January 2016 articles in the Xinhua News Agency, the official press agency of the People's Republic of China, China reported a 6.9 percent GDP growth rate for 2015 and an \\"economic volume of over ten trillion U.S. dollars\\". Forbes journalist argues that the \\"stock market crash does not indicate a blowout of the Chinese physical economy.\\" China is shifting from a focus on manufacturing to service industries and while it has slowed, it is still growing by 5%. After this last turbulence, as of January 2017 the Shanghai Composite Index has been stable around 3,000 points, 50% less than before the bubble popped.https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SHCOMP:IND Background Following a period of closure during the early history of the People's Republic of China, the modern stock market in China reemerged in the early 1990s with the re-opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and founding of the Shenzhen Security Exchange. By 2000, the Chinese stock market had over 1,000 listed companies, worth a market capitalization of nearly a third of China‚Äôs overall gross domestic product (GDP), and by the end of 1998, investors had opened nearly 40 million investment accounts. As more companies went public, investors rushed to the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. The Chinese stock market and economy grew quickly, and by 2012, the number of listed companies between the Shanghai and Shenzhen Securities Exchanges had risen to over 2,400, worth a market capitalization of nearly 50% of China‚Äôs real GDP, and included over 200 million active stock and mutual fund accounts. China's economic growth, however, was stunted by the 2008 global recession and its aftershocks. The Chinese government responded to 2008 recession with a stimulus package that would draw resources from both the public and private sectors in order to fund an unprecedented infrastructure build. Growth following the stimulus package was rapid - from 2009 to 2011, real GDP growth in China grew at approximately 9.6%, though in the two years that followed, real GDP growth fell to 7.7%. Seeing the opportunity for a nationwide reinvestment into the economy through the stock market, the government developed a campaign that would entice everyday citizens to trade ‚Äì it was referred to as \\"Zhongguomeng\\", which translates to the \\"China Dream\\". First conceived and pushed by China‚Äôs paramount leader and general secretary, Xi Jinping, the ‚Äòdream‚Äô was one of overall economic prosperity and an elevated international status. The trading population that developed in China differed in important ways from those elsewhere in the world. In China, the stock market trading activity is dominated by individual investors (close to 85%) ‚Äì also known as ‚Äòretail investors.‚Äô Indicative of the sheer size of investor inflow into the markets, after several months of a bull market developing in China, more than 30 million new accounts were opened by retail investors in the first 5 months of 2015, according to data from the China‚Äôs Securities Depository and Clearing Corp. And while a larger, more active investing population generally means greater market capitalization, many of these new traders were inexperienced and easily manipulated by the buying frenzy, with nearly two thirds having never entered or graduated high school, according to a survey by China‚Äôs Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. As a result, momentum and rumors among the traders carried more weight than reason when it came to investing decisions, creating a trend of impulsive buying and overvaluation in the market. Leading up to the crash, in an attempt to free up additional money for trading, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), responsible for proposing and enforcing securities laws, had loosened several related financial regulations. Prior to significant policy reform in 2010, the act of selling short ‚Äì essentially, borrowing and selling stock with the belief that its price will fall ‚Äì and trading on margin ‚Äì trading with debt ‚Äì were strictly prohibited in China. However, in March 2010, China implemented a testing phase for their stock exchange in which 90 selected companies were authorized to be sold short and traded on margin. This list was expanded over time, with over 280 companies being given the same authorization in late 2011. Shortly thereafter, the CSRC implemented a total policy shift which legalized both practices across the entire stock market. These regulation changes led to significant increases in borrowing for the purpose of trading, and short selling became the most popular investing strategy among traders. From 2010, when the changes were implemented, to 2012, average daily short turnover increased from 0.01% to 0.73%, and average daily margin purchase turnover increased from 0.78% to 5.15%. As a result, the Chinese market was being flooded with debt-funded trades and risky short selling plays. To make matters worse, the CSRC also became a regulatory bystander, refusing to take action that would upset the political and social stability of the time. Instead of de-listing public companies that failed to perform for three consecutive quarters ‚Äì a well-known regulation in China ‚Äì the CSRC would regularly let those companies slide for fear of upsetting the shareholders. This added to the flames of bad investing, allowing investors to continue pouring their money into companies that were underperforming and overvaluing shares that were essentially worthless on the books. 2015 Chinese RMB According to SWIFT data, by November 2014 China's renminbi (RMB) ‚Äì also known as the yuan ‚Äì \\"became one of the world's top five payment currencies...overtaking the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar\\". On 11 August, two months after the turbulence, the People's Bank of China devalued the RMB - by 1.86 percent to CN¬•6.2298 per US dollar. A lower renminbi (RMB) \\"makes China‚Äôs exports more competitive in foreign markets, offsetting part of the surge in the country‚Äôs blue-collar wages over the last decade; and it makes foreign companies, houses and other overseas investments seem more expensive.\\" On 14 August, the central bank devalued it again to CN¬•6.3975 per US dollar. In August there was speculation about the causes of the devaluation of the yuan and the changes in the Chinese economy in 2015, including the \\"growth in its services sector rather than heavy industry\\". By mid-January 2016, an article in The Economist argued that the strains on the yuan indicated a problem with China's politics. However, a spokesperson for the International Energy Agency (IEA) argued that the risk was \\"overplayed\\". During the drastic sell-off on 7 January 2016 China's central bank, the People‚Äôs Bank of China set the official midpoint rate on RMB to its lowest level since March 2011‚Äîat CN¬•6.5646 per US dollar. On 8 October 2015 China launched a new clearing system developed by the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) - Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS) - to settle cross-border RMB transactions and intended to \\"increase global usage of the Chinese currency\\", by \\"cutting transaction costs and processing times\\" and removing \\"one of the biggest hurdles to internationalizing the yuan\\". Because of the stock market turbulence, the launch had been delayed and CIPS was '\\"watered down\\" offering, a \\"complementary network for settling trade-related deals in the Chinese currency to a current patchwork of Chinese clearing banks around the world\\". By December 2015, the RMB was still the \\"fifth most used global payments currency and the second most used currency for trade finance\\" with 27 per cent of China's goods invoiced in RMB compared to 19 per cent in 2014. In December China was the world's largest exporter. By October 2016, the Renminbi will be added to the special drawing rights currency basket, the foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the International Monetary Fund, which includes the U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and pound sterling. The IMF's decision to add the RMB to the SDR, was \\"crucial to global financial stability\\" as it would encourage China to \\"continue to be a responsible global citizen and liberalise its exchange rate, while intervening to ensure a gradual decline\\". China's PMI In August 2015, Caixin Media - a closely watched gauge of nationwide manufacturing activity  announced that the China Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) had declined to 51.5. This was the beginning of a decline that continued into December 2015 with the PMI falling below 50 - anything below 50 indicates deceleration. PMIs are economic indicators derived from monthly surveys of companies' purchasing managers and is produced by the financial information firm, Markit Group, which compiles the survey and conducts PMIs for over 30 countries worldwide. From 2010 to 2015 HSBC had sponsored Markit's China PMI, but that relationship ended in June and Caixin stepped in. By 2016 the PMI was down for the fifth month indicating a cooling in manufacturing in China. Manufacturing activity is a key sign of economic performance. December was the tenth month in a row that manufacturing in China had contracted raising concerns that China's economy was not on steadier footing. It was seen as the most recent indication of slowing global economic growth. Since China is the world's largest metal consumer and producer, and \\"the world‚Äôs second largest economy\\", the China PMI is closely watched. This 2016 selling frenzy was fueled by the most recent private survey of factory activity, the December 2015 report by Caixin on China's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reading which showed that China's manufacturing activity had slowed again in December 2015 to a PMI reading of 48.2 - with anything below 50 indicating deceleration. Stock market bubble In the year leading up to the turbulence, encouraged by state-owned media, enthusiastic individual investors inflated the stock market bubble through mass amounts of investments in stocks often using borrowed money, exceeding the rate of economic growth and profits of the companies they were investing in. Investors faced margin calls on their stocks and many were forced to sell off shares in droves, precipitating the turbulence. 2015 Government response  The Chinese government enacted many measures to stem the tide of the turbulence. Regulators limited short selling under threat of arrest. Large mutual funds and pension funds pledged to buy more stocks. The government stopped initial public offerings. The government also provided cash to brokers to buy shares, backed by central-bank cash. Because the Chinese markets mostly comprise individuals and not institutional funds (80 percent of investors in China are individuals), state-run media continued to persuade its citizens to purchase more stocks. In addition, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) imposed a six-month ban on stockholders owning more than 5 percent of a company's stock from selling those stocks, resulting in a 6 percent rise in stock markets. Further, around 1,300 total firms, representing 45 percent of the stock market, suspended the trading of stocks starting on 8 July. Forbes contributor Jesse Colombo contended that the measures undertaken by the Chinese government, along with cutting the interest rate, \\"allowing the use of property as collateral for margin loans, and encouraging brokerage firms to buy stocks with cash from the People's Bank of China\\" caused Chinese stocks to begin surging in mid-July. He argued that in general, however, the outcomes of government intervention as it relates to the turbulence will, by its nature, be difficult to predict, but saying that in the longer term, the effect may be the development of an even larger bubble through creation of a moral hazard. As of 30 August, the Chinese government arrested 197 people, including a Wang Xiaolu, a journalist at the \\"influential financial magazine Caijing\\", and stock market officials, for \\"spreading rumours\\" about the market crash and 2015 Tianjin explosions. The crime of spreading rumours carries a three-year jail sentence after its introduction in 2013. The government officials accused \\"foreign forces\\" of \\"intentionally [unsettling] the market\\" and planned crackdown on them. On 1 November billionaire hedge fund manager, Xu Xiang - known as China's Warren Buffett, or China's Carl Icahn  was arrested for allegedly manipulating the stock market during the 2015 Chinese stock market turbulence. According to Caixin media, \\"Calls for China to adopt a circuit breaker mechanism gained momentum after a stock market rout in the summer that saw the Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the stock prices of all companies listed in the city, plunge from more than 5,000 points in mid-June to less than 3,000 in late August.\\" Black Monday and Tuesday On 24 August, Shanghai main share index lost 8.49% of its value. As a result, billions of pounds were lost on international stock markets with some international commentators labeling the day Black Monday.China‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlack Monday‚Äô spreads stock market fears worldwide, Denyer, Simon., The Washington Post, 24 August 2015 There were similar losses of over 7% on 25 August causing some commentators to call it Black Tuesday.  World finance response In the week prior to Black Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen over concerns about the yuan, low gas prices, and uncertainty over the U.S. Federal Reserve's moves to raise interest rates. On Black Monday, the Dow dropped 1000 points at opening, the largest drop ever. Money magazine estimated that the potential negative impact on the United States stock market may come about when Chinese investors begin to seek out relatively stable U.S. investments in treasuries, stocks, and cash, and further strengthen an already-strong U.S. dollar, thereby raising the prices on U.S. goods and diminishing export profits. Global companies that relied on the Chinese market suffered from the turbulence. Stocks that they own were devalued . For example, French alcoholic beverage company, R√©my Cointreau, and British luxury-goods company, Burberry, saw their shares devalued and declining demand of their imports from Chinese distributors. Second-quarter sales of American fast food company, Yum! Brands, in China dropped 10 percent, resulting in revenue going under the company's estimate. South African ore mining company, Kumba Iron Ore, eliminated its dividends on 21 July as the 61 percent loss of profit in the first half of the year was announced. On 19 January 2016 the Bank of England (BoE) Governor Mark Carney cited \\"Chinese growth hitting a 25-year low\\" as one of the reasons the BoE will likely not \\"raise rates until the second half of this year at the earliest\\" during his talk at Queen Mary University in London. An article in the Guardian argued that \\"American commentators relentlessly push a ‚ÄúChina-led slowdown‚Äù narrative, but the reality is that the US is a relatively insulated economy. Yes ‚Äì Chinese equities have fallen sharply in recent months, yet the Shanghai Composite Index of leading stocks remains 40pc up on its level just 18 months ago. This is a home-grown US slowdown, much as it pains America to admit it.\\"  Commentator response  Some mass media outlets had alarmist headlines in August 2015, with The Guardian comparing the pattern of losses during China's Black Monday to the Wall Street Crash of 1929,Elliot, Larry., China's Black Monday is worryingly similar to Wall Street's 1929 crash, The Guardian, 26 August 2015 and an article in The Mirror about Damian McBride, a former adviser to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, calling on people to stock up on canned food because the coming crash would be twenty times worse than the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. Others such as The Economist questioned its severity. George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom, said that the Chinese stock market turbulence will not have a big impact on European economies. The Globe and Mail journalist Nathan Vanderklippe argued that \\"To understand the devaluation of the yuan and the changes in the Chinese economy today, look to the growth in its services sector rather than heavy industry.\\" Vanderklippe described the new economy as \\"the investment banks, restaurant chains and airlines that make up the services sector\\". In 2014 the service industry in China increased to represent 44.6 per cent of the economy. (In the United States the service industry represents 80%, in Canada, roughly 70 per cent and in India, 57 per cent of the economy.) By 17 August 2015 the services sector in China which includes \\"hotels, banks, cellphone providers and spas\\" was thriving. \\"In the first half of 2015, the GDP among services rose 8.4 per cent, some 2 1/2 times the growth rate in the primary, or extractive, sector.\\" As China experienced a period of stock market turbulence in the summer of 2015 worsened by \\"economic weakness, financial panic, and the policy response to these problems\\", Anatole Kaletsky disagreed with those who claimed that China was the \\"global economy‚Äôs weakest link\\". He claimed that \\"weak economic data leads to financial turmoil, which induces policy blunders that in turn fuel more financial panic, economic weakness, and policy mistakes.\\" According to The Economist, China had a \\"record trade surplus of $595 billion in 2015\\". However, in the \\"last six months of 2015 capital left China at an annualised rate of about $1 trillion\\". According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, Neil Atkinson of the International Energy Agency (IEA), was cited in The Economist in January 2016 arguing that although the sell-off in oil in January \\"occurred concurrently with a slide in the Chinese stock market and the yuan which some investors think reflects weakness in China's economy and hence in demand for oil\\", the risk is \\"overplayed\\". \\"[F]igures on January 13th showed China imported a record 6.7m barrels a day (b/d) of oil in 2015.\\"Gale number:8972 According to Nicholas Lardy, \\"an author of Markets Over Mao: The Rise of Private Business in China and fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has written extensively on the development of the Chinese economy\\", the \\"popular narrative\\" that China is in \\"a financial and economic meltdown\\" \\"is not well supported by the facts\\". \\"[S]ervices, not industry, are driving China‚Äôs growth.\\" Lardy explained the rout in August as an overdue correction in China's equity market. January 2016 global meltdown On both 4 January and 7 January 2016 the Chinese stock market experienced a sharp sell-off of about 8% that quickly sent stocks tumbling globally. From 4 January to 15 January, China‚Äôs stock market fell 18% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.2%. During the first fifteen minutes of the first day of trading in the Chinese stock exchange, the \\"stock market fell by 5% before leading regulators halted trading. It was reopened for another fifteen minutes and stocks fell until trading was again halted.\\" \\"The blue-chip CSI 300 Index dropped 8% while the benchmark Shanghai Composite index fell 6.9%. The technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite was the worst performer and fell by more than 8%.\\" 2016 China Securities Regulatory Commission response  On 4 January 2016 stock markets in China fell to the point of triggering its new trading curb rule, a market mechanism that halts trading when losses reach a threshold which is intended to help stabilize stocks, for the first time. In comparison, in the United States the trading curb rule or circuit breaker was first applied in the 1997 Mini-Crash during the Asian Financial Crisis. During that mini-crash, many exchanges fell and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 7.18% in value but recovered quickly. A spokesperson for the CSRC argued that the rules for the trading curb differed from those in the United States; in the U.S. the emphasis is on preventing systemic risk. \\"We had to consider there is more speculation and irrational investment behavior\\" because China has more individual investors than the United States.\\" According to an article in The Economist‚Äîunlike most major markets‚Äîmillions of individual investors dominate the Chinese stock market, driving \\"more than 80 percent of trading on bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen, versus about 15 percent in the U.S.\\" An article in Forbes claims that these \\"unsophisticated\\" Mom and Pop retail investors tend to \\"over-react\\", \\"mis-read signals\\", and buy and sell on speculative instincts. The trading curb ruled was put in operation after the first 27 minutes of trading on the Chinese stock exchange on Thursday, 7 January, as Chinese stocks plunged 7 percent. In a surprise move on 7 January 2016, China's central bank, the People‚Äôs Bank of China set the official midpoint rate on the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), to its lowest level since March 2011‚Äîat CN¬•6.5646 per US dollar. A lower renminbi (RMB) \\"makes China‚Äôs exports more competitive in foreign markets, offsetting part of the surge in the country‚Äôs blue-collar wages over the last decade; and it makes foreign companies, houses and other overseas investments seem more expensive\\". On 7 January, Chinese authorities suspended the circuit breaker out of concern that the trade curb may \\"have intensified investors‚Äô concerns\\". On 16 January 2016 Xiao Gang the head of China Securities Regulatory Commission defended the CSRC's crisis management of the \\"abnormal volatility in the stock market\\". Xiao \\"promised to crack down on illegal activities, increase market transparency and better educate investors\\" in a period with \\"rising uncertainty in external markets, including the global equity-market slump, plummeting commodities prices and currency devaluations in emerging markets\\". 2016 Commentators Data from surveys compiled by the financial information firm, Markit Group showed that China's PMI was 48.2 in December, 2015 down from 48.6 in November, 48.3 in October, September is 50.5 and 51.5 in August. The October report was encouraging but the December report dampened hopes for recovery and triggered fears for China's overall economy. and markets around the world responded. On Friday, 1 January 2016 The Guardian reported that China's factory activity continued to decline, overseas demand for goods fell and export orders for Chinese manufacturers fell. Stock markets which had already responded by mid-December with \\"metals [experiencing] a broad-based drop on the weakness of manufacturing activity in China, According to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), a group of purchasing managers which conducts PMIs, the US also had a PMI of 48.2 in December down from 48.6 in November. The October PMI was 50.1 in October. Whereas China has experienced a gradual decline since late 2014, the United States last decline was in November 2012. But the December 2015 US PMI was \\"the lowest since the end of the recession and marks the first time since 2009 for consecutive months in contraction territory\\". The slower manufacturing activity in the United States was blamed on the strong US dollar, a weak global economy, low oil prices and excessive inventories. In October 2015 Caixin China General Services PMI reported that \\"Chinese business activity [had declined] at its quickest rate since start of 2009\\". January 2016 global rout The sell- off on the Chinese stock market \\"set off a global rout, with stocks in Europe and the United States getting hit\\", with many stocks down 2% to 3%. The German stock index, the DAX its blue-chip shares index slumped to 9979 points on 7 January \\"falling below the psychologically important 10,000-point threshold\\" which represents 2.29 percent fall from 6 January.

Background The exact origins of \\"Pictures from Life's Other Side\\" are disputed. Some researchers date the song back to around 1880 and cite a singing-school teacher from Athens, Georgia named John B. Vaughan as its composer, while others credit Charles E. Baer. Regardless, the song was well known; early country singers Vernon Dalhart and Bradley Kincaid had already recorded it and Woody Guthrie cut a version of it in 1944. The song, an appeal for compassion and understanding for the downtrodden, recounts three \\"scenes,\\" the second of which is sometimes excluded: the first that of a degenerate gambler who dies right after staking his dead mother's wedding ring during a card game, his \\"last earthy treasure,\\"; the second that of \\"two brothers, whose pathway so diff'rent had led\\": one becomes wealthy, while the other one \\"begged for his bread\\" and unwittingly kills his brother (the rich man) in a robbery; and the last that of a \\"heartbroken mother\\" who drowns herself and her baby by jumping into a river. The song is primarily associated with country singer Hank Williams, who recorded it under the name Luke the Drifter, an alter ego created by Williams and producer Fred Rose to let jukebox operators know that these heavily moralistic recitations that Williams wanted to release were not typical Hank Williams honky tonk singles; the pseudonym made it clear that the operators should not stock up on the releases like they usually did. Williams's version was recorded in Nashville on June 1, 1952. He was backed by Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), Ernire Newton or \\"Cedric Rainwater,\\" aka Howard Watts (bass), and possibly Owen Bradley (organ). The song was the lead track on the 1954 LP Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter.

He was convicted for three murders, and was slated to be tried for two more before charges were dropped due to the wishes of victims' families. Rhoades is additionally suspected of torturing, raping, and killing more than fifty women between 1975 and 1990, based on data about his truck routes and women who went missing during those years and who met the profile of his preferred victims. At the time he was caught, Rhoades claimed to have engaged in these activities for fifteen years.  Early life  Robert Ben Rhoades was born and raised in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He was raised by his mother in the early years of his life, as his father was a soldier in the United States Army and was stationed in West Germany. Rhoades was attending elementary school when his father returned from duty overseas. After his father was discharged from the military, he found work as a firefighter. By all reliable accounts, Rhoades's early life was relatively normal, aside from unspecified social problems in his formative years. He was an active participant in the extracurricular activities of his attended schools, and involved himself with various sports and other programs, including gridiron football, wrestling, choir and French club. Rhoades' criminal involvement during his high school years were only notable for an arrest in 1961, at age 16, for tampering with a vehicle, along with an arrest for public fighting in 1962 at age 17. After graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School in Council Bluffs in 1964, he joined the Marine Corps. During the same year, his father was arrested for molesting a 12-year-old girl, and subsequently committed suicide while awaiting trial. A few years later, in 1967 or 1968, Rhoades was dishonorably discharged from the military for his involvement in a robbery. After his dishonorable discharge from the Marines sometime in the late 1960s, he attended college but dropped out. He later attempted to join a law enforcement agency, but was likely rejected for his past dishonorable discharge from the Marine Corps. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Rhoades married three times, having a son with his first wife. Subsequently, he found work in stores, supermarkets, warehouses and restaurants. Eventually, he became a long haul trucker. During the 1980s, Rhoades developed interests and hobbies, amongst which included involving himself in the BDSM scene. It was also during this time he allegedly verbally, physically and sexually abused his third wife, Deborah Rhoades.  Murders  Rhoades preyed on hitchhikers and truckstop sex workers, starting in the 1970s. His first confirmed victims were Patricia Candace Walsh (later known posthumously as a former girlfriend of metal vocalist Warrel Dane from bands Sanctuary and Nevermore) and her husband, Douglas Zyskowski, in January 1990. The couple were hitchhiking when Rhoades picked them up in his truck while on a long-haul journey. He immediately killed Zyskowski and dumped his body in Sutton County, Texas, where it was later found. He was not identified until 1992. He kept Walsh for over a week. During this time, he tortured and raped her multiple times before dumping her body in Millard County, Utah. Almost a month after Walsh's death, he grabbed an 18-year-old victim, a drifter, who escaped and informed police. When Rhoades was detained, the victim declined to press charges, feeling that she would not be believed despite extensive evidence. In her statement to police she says that \\"I don't see any good in filing charges. It's just going to be my word against his. If there was any evidence, I would file. I would file charges and sue him.\\" It was later asserted that she was fearful of Rhoades after enduring two weeks in his truck. Rhoades had converted the sleeper cab of his truck into his own personal torture chamber where he kept women, sometimes for weeks, torturing and raping them. Days later, 14-year old Regina Kay Walters and her boyfriend, Ricky Lee Jones, both runaway teenagers from the Houston suburb of Pasadena, Texas, disappeared. Like with Zyskowski, it is believed that after being picked up by Rhoades, Jones was killed and disposed of while Walters was kept. Photos seized during a search of Rhoades' home confirmed that he held Walters for a long time, based on the degree of hair growth and bruising. Jones' body was found on March 3, 1991, in Lamar County, Mississippi. He was not identified until July 2008. In Bond County, Illinois, Jones had been charged in absentia with Walters' murder. In the early morning of April 1, 1990, Trooper Mike Miller of the Arizona Highway Patrol found a truck at the side of I-10 with its hazard lights on. When he investigated inside the cab, he discovered a nude woman, later identified as Kathleen Vine, handcuffed and screaming. There was also a male present who identified himself as the driver of the truck. After failing to talk his way out of the situation, Rhoades turned over a gun which had been on his person. He was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, sexual assault, and unlawful imprisonment. He was left handcuffed in Miller's patrol car, but nearly escaped. After further investigation, the arresting detective, Rick Barnhart, was able to make a connection to the Houston case and noticed a pattern stretching over the course of at least five months. In executing a search warrant for Rhoades' home, police found photos of a nude teenager who was later identified as Walters, whose body was found in September 1990. Also present were photos of Walsh, whose body was discovered that October.  Conviction  In 1994, Rhoades was convicted of the first degree murder of Regina Kay Walters and sentenced to life without parole at Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Illinois. He was extradited to Utah in 2005 to be tried for the deaths of Candace Walsh and Douglas Zyskowski; however, in accordance with the victims' families' requests, the charges were dropped in 2006 and he was returned to prison. Rhoades later was extradited to Texas for the murder of Walters and Jones where Rhoades, in exchange for dropping the death penalty, pleaded guilty to their deaths and received a second life sentence. Despite his other convictions in Texas, he continues serving his life without parole sentence at the Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Illinois.

Lane was a self-taught musician and a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1993). His songs were recorded by many prominent country artists, including Merle Haggard and The Strangers, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, Eddy Arnold, Dottie West, B.J. Thomas, George Strait, Roger Miller and Alan Jackson. The most successful songs written or co-written by Lane included, \\"'Til I Get It Right\\" (recorded by Tammy Wynette, 1973), \\"Country Girl\\" (Dottie West), \\"Miss Emily's Picture\\" (John Conlee), \\"The Eagle\\" (Waylon Jennings, George Strait), \\"My Own Kind of Hat\\" (Merle Haggard, Alan Jackson), \\"Blackjack County Chain\\" (Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings), \\"Tell Me Something Bad About Tulsa\\" (George Strait), and \\"New Looks From An Old Lover\\" (B.J. Thomas). He has credits as composer or instrumentalist on at least 386 albums. Over his career he has written or co-written 60 songs that reached the U.S. top 100 country charts. In 2010 he was recognized by the Country Music Hall of Fame in a program series called \\"Poets and Prophets\\", which included a two-hour interview session with Lane, and live performance by him enhanced with photos, videos and recordings from the Museum's Frist Library and Archive. The program was streamed live by the Hall of Fame. Early life He was born in Zona, Louisiana which was later incorporated into the town of Bogalusa, along the Pearl River which forms the lower part of the boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi. His father was a sharecropper and heavy equipment operator. The family moved often to go wherever there was work. He began playing guitar about age nine, taught by his father. The family moved to northern Indiana, where he completed high school. He then joined the Air Force and was stationed in Hawaii as an aircraft mechanic. His color blindness prevented him though from being a pilot. His guitar playing served him well in the Air Force, where he won a talent contest and performed on a popular live radio show called Hawaii Calls out of Waikiki Beach. In 1958 he was transferred to another base in Omaha, Nebraska where he played guitar in nightclubs six nights a week. His nickname was \\"Red\\". He began using the name \\"Red Lane\\" at this time to avoid problems with his superiors at the Air Force base, and the name stuck. After military discharge, he played guitar across the U.S. in several states but had to do farm labor to make ends meet. At one time, he lived under a bridge in Phoenix, Arizona when he couldn't afford rent. In the early 60s, he took up songwriting, being inspired by the writing of Willie Nelson. He became acquainted with Justin Tubb, son of country star Ernest Tubb, who hired Lane to play in his band and arranged getting some of Lane's songs to Nashville's Buddy Killen, of Tree Publishing Company. Killen facilitated Lane's move to Nashville and signed him as a staff writer in April 1964. Just over a week after moving to Nashville, Lane appeared on the Grand Ole Opry with Tubb. Lane said, \\"What do you do after you've reached all your dreams in 8 days?\\" A year later, Lane won a BMI songwriting award with the hit song \\"My Friend on the Right\\" recorded by Faron Young. Today, at the Sony/ATV building writers' quarters where young songwriters sketch out songs, Red Lane's portrait now hangs. Career Lane's career as a solo singer was mediocre. He was offered a recording contract by Chet Atkins and had a No. 32 country hit with \\"The World Needs a Melody\\" which was released on RCA in the 1970s. He appeared on ABC's The Johnny Cash Show and had some other successes, but decided that a songwriter's lifestyle was preferred over that of a performer. His career thus launched, he has gone on to much success writing and playing on many country hits and his music has been recorded by many non- country artists, such as Elvis Costello, Ray Charles, Engelbert Humperdinck, Solomon Burke and Bob Dylan. In Nashville, he was hired by Dottie West as a guitarist and frontman (master of ceremonies) in her band, called \\"The Heartaches\\". Lane developed a productive association with West, who recorded dozens of his songs. He was a guitarist for Merle Haggard and The Strangers, who recorded about 25 of Lane's songs. Unique character Lane had been interested in airplanes since his early career as an aircraft mechanic. He eventually got his pilot's license, and also became a skydiver. He used this experience in a song \\"The Day I Jumped from Uncle Harvey's Plane\\" recorded by Roger Miller. He found a 1958 DC-8 passenger jetliner at the Smyrna, Tennessee airport, one of the few places where this particular type of plane could be repaired. He purchased the plane and had it cut into five pieces, which were shipped on flat bed trucks to his home in Ashland City, Tennessee (near Nashville). Its 177 seats were removed, and it was converted into Lane's permanent home. It was well insulated and comfortable, and had a bar and a music room in the cockpit. It served as a place where songwriters and musicians would frequently gather to share songs and ideas. Lane's directions on how to find him went something like: \\"...go down the country road past the bicycle and the windsock, and it's the first large airliner on the right.\\" Lane was active in charitable efforts with the local police department with a camp for disadvantaged youth. He once took the boys out for a boat ride on Nashville's Old Hickory Lake and surprised them by pulling the boat up to Johnny Cash's house. Cash came out personally and gave the boys record albums. Lane was a veteran guest of the \\"red light pickin' parties\\" hosted by Texas football coach Darrell Royal, who was an aficionado of country music and especially songwriters. Lane died of cancer in Nashville on July 1, 2015. He was 76.

Authorities pursued numerous leads of investigation into discovering the child's identity until their efforts proved successful in September 2015. This publicity generated many tips with possible leads, one of which led to the girl's identity. Bella Bond was identified on September 18, 2015. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children facially reconstructed the child's face to provide the public with an estimation of the victim's appearance during life. They aimed to generate tips to a potential identity and to locate the individual or individuals responsible for the disposal of her body. After the reconstruction was released and news coverage began nationwide, a large amount of public attention emerged; an estimated 56 million people viewed reports on the case. Half of these occurred within the first week after the body was found. Bond's mother, Rachelle Bond, and her boyfriend, Michael McCarthy, were arrested, and authorities confirmed that Bella had been murdered, despite the fact that an initial autopsy performed on the body did not uncover the exact cause of death. Rachelle Bond was charged with being an \\"accessory after the fact\\" in regards to her daughter's murder; she later pleaded guilty as the result of a plea deal. McCarthy was charged with murder in the case and was later convicted of murder in the second degree. On June 28, 2017, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with future parole. Discovery The body of Bella Bond was found inside a plastic garbage bag on the shoreline of Deer Island near Boston, Massachusetts. A woman walking her dog discovered Bond's remains on the afternoon of June 25, 2015, when the dog stopped at the plastic bag. After the body was found, the public placed flowers near the scene. She wore only a pair of white leggings designed with a black polka-dot pattern. A zebra-print blanket was also inside the bag. Initially, police were unsure if additional bodies would be at the scene, so they attempted unsuccessfully to use cadaver dogs to locate any other possible remains. Deer Island. The body of Bella Bond was discovered at this location on June 25, 2015 Authorities originally estimated that the girl had died within days of her discovery. Later developments in the case have suggested that Bella's body had been \\"hidden in a fridge\\" for as long as one month before it was deposited on Deer Island. Despite the fact that she appeared to have been deceased only a short time, she had already begun to decompose and become bloated, so was impossible to identify visually. Decomposition had also made it impossible to collect fingerprints, due to exposure to the water. Investigators were able to conclude that she was a young child, but were initially unsure of her race and ethnicity. Just how the remains had settled at the location was unknown; the body might either have been placed at the beach or may have drifted in the water from another location, some presuming from as far away as Canada. The United States Coast Guard entered the investigation and analyzed the currents of the water in the area to estimate where the bag containing the remains could have originated. Dive teams were also used around the time the body was discovered. As of mid-July and August, authorities believed the victim had been placed at the scene, rather than washing onto Deer Island from another location, because the body was not in an advanced enough stage of decomposition. The beach is near a wastewater treatment plant. One of the investigators thought a possibility existed that the disposal had been performed by an employee of the nearby water-treatment plant. Since the area has been regarded as a \\"busy\\" area for both workers and the public, the person who placed the bag at the scene possibly did so at night, to avoid being seen. Examination An autopsy was conducted on July 3, but did not conclude what had caused the girl's death. While authorities suspected foul play as a factor in the case, no signs of obvious injury had been found on the remains. Tests were later conducted to find any toxins, drugs, or alcohol present in the body as a possible explanation for the death. Examiners were unable to find any trace of cleaners such as bleach in the remains, but continued with more testing in hopes of finding another toxin as a possible cause of death. After the identification of the victim, a conclusive cause of death had yet to be announced, despite all forms of \\"natural death [having] been excluded\\". Suffocation had not been ruled out as the cause. The clothing found on the toddler, believed to be \\"size 4T\\" was determined to have been manufactured by the Circo company and was likely sold at a Target store. The blanket was possibly made by the Cannon Mills company and sold at K-Mart. A hair band made from elastic material was also found. The child was eventually determined to be between the ages of three and five and appeared to be white, with possible Hispanic ancestry. Her hair was described as being \\"brown, wavy and fourteen inches in length\\". Presumably, the child's hair was left untrimmed for about two years, judging by its length. She was also estimated to be between three feet, one and three feet, six inches tall and weighed around 30 pounds. No distinct birthmarks or scars were on the body. The girl was later discovered to have had pierced ears, so the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an updated image of the child wearing earrings. The girl appeared to have been \\"well-cared for\\" during her life; no signs of malnutrition or abuse were noted, and investigators stated the clothing also reinforced the theory. A forensic facial reconstruction created of Bella Bond by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children: This forensic reconstruction generated a large amount of publicity. Investigation The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children digitally reconstructed the face of the child after preceding attempts to identify the body failed. The reconstruction was created in four hours using Adobe Photoshop with the influence of mortuary and \\"stock\\" photographs to give an estimation of the child's appearance while alive. The reconstruction, created by forensic artist Christi Andrews, was released on July 2, 2015. Because of the end result of the composite created with Adobe Photoshop, many viewers mistook it for an actual photograph. The organization also digitally enhanced images of the leggings and the blanket found with the remains and created a poster featuring them on their website. Flyers containing images of the Jane Doe and her belongings were eventually dispersed in hopes of obtaining more information. After the child's identification, some individuals who were familiar with the Bonds claimed they did not see a resemblance between the composite and Bella. The child was entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System on July 4, 2015, including details of the discovery of the subject and physical estimations. Many missing persons were excluded as possible identities; authorities checked Shoshana Black, Paula Ramerez-Figuroa, Ofir Ben‚ÄìHaim, Cassidy Gibbs, and Ayla Reynolds. Other leads were pursued involving children who were reported missing, some of whom were foreign to the United States. Some of the potential matches were later located alive. The disappearance case of Sarah Hoggle had been analyzed to have a possible link to the case, yet investigators stated it was \\"unlikely\\" to have been related to this case. In all, over 200 missing people were ruled out from the case. A press conference displaying the reconstruction and the enhanced images of the clothing and blanket was later held at the location where the body was found. It was televised to ask the public for assistance identifying the victim and to request of those who may have known her, especially her parents, to identify the girl. During the press conference, officials urged viewers to be aware of children who may have disappeared or gone unaccounted for in the days leading up to the celebration of Independence Day. Despite their hopes, no one came forward to claim responsibility for the crime or to confirm who the victim was. Hundreds of tips were submitted over the phone and online and were investigated. When searching missing-persons databases produced few cases matching her profile, authorities began to believe that the child may never have been reported missing. They explored the guess that the family of the child could be unaware of her death. Another explanation for why no matches were achieved was that she could have belonged to an undocumented family. Police were focused on investigating in the local community, yet they believed the girl possibly was not from the area and continued to search through various cases of missing children. Among other theories about the case, early speculation was that the girl could have been murdered by a member of her family. A criminologist stated that her having been \\"murdered by a stranger\\" did not seem likely, according to statistics of similar cases. The fact that no tips from relatives with information about the child had been reported supported the idea that family members were involved with the disposal of the body, and possibly with her death. Investigators feared for other children who may have been in the care of those who disposed of the body, as they could be in danger. A different theory held that the child's family members might also be deceased, having faced a similar demise. Forensic testing Forensics teams analyzed the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and in hopes of matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas to create a more specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from the bones of the child was later developed to compare to possible relatives. Besides DNA testing, authorities conducted efforts into forensic palynology as well as isotope examination of water found at the scene. Results of the testing indicated that the child had spent time in the local, urban area, most likely in Boston, as traces of both pine and soot were found throughout the tests. Eventually, she was also determined to have possibly spent time in any of the six New England states and possibly others. The hair and enamel tests also indicated she could have \\"moved across the country.\\" Public interaction Because the reconstruction and the story had been so widely publicized, an unexpectedly large amount of public interest in the case developed internationally. Many people have since shared and viewed reports detailing the case on social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. Several individuals offered to pay for the child's funeral and burial if she could not be identified. One funeral home stated that it would donate the means to bury the child under a headstone, so she would not be buried in a pauper's grave. Local businesses in the area began placing posters of the child in their buildings, hoping to create awareness for the case and to generate potential leads. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority reported plans to donate a bench in memory of the girl. The digital reconstruction had been viewed an estimated 50 million times by the public, which officials have stated was significantly efficient in assisting with the case. John Walsh was interviewed on the subject of the unidentified child and gave contact information for potential tips. On July 10, CNN News host Anderson Cooper interviewed the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's co-founder and former host of America's Most Wanted, John Walsh about the case. Walsh stated, \\"absolutely someone knows\\" the identity of the Jane Doe and that in similar cases, often, the \\"live-in boyfriend\\" or the mother of the child had abused or neglected one of several children in a family, citing that the victim could have been \\"accidentally killed or starved to death.\\" When explaining a probable reason why the girl had remained unidentified, Walsh stated, \\"people do not want to talk to cops,\\" possibly due to the fear of authorities investigating their own lives  for instance, the family of Anjelica Castillo, who were undocumented immigrants and never reported the victim as missing due to fear of deportation. Walsh encouraged viewers to contact him, instead, giving the number for the show he hosts, The Hunt With John Walsh and the URL for his profile on the CNN website. He confirmed that those submitting tips could remain anonymous. Tips Many leads were followed that appeared to match the circumstances of the case. A woman who had been seen throwing a garbage bag over a bridge was later questioned by police, but the contents of the bag were found to be simply spoiled fruit. Other individuals stated they had seen toddlers resembling the Jane Doe, one at a store and another at a playground, with a woman clothed in a burqa. Investigators were unable to find any trace of the girl at the store through information gathered by security cameras, and the subject at the playground has yet to be located. A man stated he believed he had seen the toddler in November 2014 at a laundromat with a \\"heavyset\\" and \\"dirty blond\\" woman pushing the child in a stroller. The local police department reported that they had received many tips suggesting possible identities for the child, those of missing girls throughout the country. Many readers online told police that the girl could be Aliayah Lunsford of West Virginia, who had disappeared on September 24, 2011. Lunsford would have been six at the time of the discovery and did bear a resemblance to the reconstruction of the Jane Doe, but she was later excluded from the case. The Massachusetts State Police later released statements on their Facebook pages regarding the exclusions of Lunsford, as well as Ayla Reynolds. Police were made aware of a possible link between the Jane Doe and Katherine Phillips, nicknamed \\"Baby Kate\\", who went missing in 2011. Phillips' body has never been recovered, despite the fact that her father has since been charged with her murder and convicted of kidnapping. Authorities expressed their doubts that the body was Katherine Phillips, but said they would investigate the lead. DNA between the pair was eventually compared. Phillips was later ruled out as \\"Baby Doe\\" and an announcement to the public was released on July 10. Investigators set up a 24-hour hotline for those with information on the case to call. A text hotline was also created. Many submitted information about potential matches, later revealed to be missing children in over half of the United States, as well as in European and South and Central American countries. A total of 84 billboards, including digital signs donated by Clear Channel, was also placed across the state of Massachusetts, encouraging individuals to report tips to the anonymous hotlines created for the child. Identification The child was identified as Bella Neveah Amoroso Bond on September 18, 2015. The identification was made after the sister of one of Rachelle Bond's neighbors reported to police a link between Bond and the Jane Doe. Apparently, the neighbor had noticed Bella was absent from the household and had confronted Rachelle Dee Bond and her boyfriend Michael P. McCarthy. They stated that the girl had been \\"taken away by the Department of Children and Families\\" (this was later disproved). Subsequently, the neighbor told his sister that he believed that \\"Baby Doe\\" was Bella Bond, and she contacted authorities. One witness told authorities she grew concerned when she stopped seeing the child at her mother's apartment and when the girl's toys were disposed of. On September 17, 2015, a search warrant was executed at the home of Rachelle Bond, 40, the child's mother, in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Bella's biological father, Joe Amoroso, had allegedly never met his daughter, but had spoken over a telephone with her. Amoroso had stated he had learned of Bella's death when Rachelle told him during a visit, within a week before the identification was made. He states that he believed that Bond would not ever have hurt her daughter. Amoroso elaborated in another interview that he believed Rachelle had been \\"sedated\\" with an injection of heroin by her boyfriend quickly after Bella's death, as a \\"track mark\\" visible on her neck could not be the result of her own action. Unlike her son, Bella's paternal grandmother stated that she believed Rachelle Bond was heavily involved in Bella's death and openly questioned the truthfulness of her allegations toward Michael McCarthy. Amoroso announced plans to bury Bella in Winthrop, Massachusetts, among family members, stating he had decided to allow the \\"funeral and wake services to be public.\\" Bella Bond was buried on November 28, 2015, at the Winthrop Cemetery during a private funeral, after her parents later came to a consensus not to have the service open to the public. She was buried under a headstone reading \\"Bella N. Bond Amoroso\\" with the date of death listed as the day she was discovered. Images of the toddler from her mother's Facebook page were later released to the public. Suspects Rachelle Bond, known as a habitual drug user, had two other children who had been removed from her custody. She had also been arrested multiple times in the past, for other crimes, including prostitution. Police commented that they had dealt with complaints that she was neglecting her daughter and had had four separate encounters with Bond. Bella's family was interviewed after the identification was announced. Her aunt stated that she had never suspected that \\"Baby Doe\\" was Bella, and the maternal grandmother of the victim was unaware that the child was ever born. The Department of Children and Families had responded to two neglect complaints regarding Bella; both cases were closed. Police released the information that the child was a murder victim and charged Michael McCarthy, the mother's boyfriend, with Bond's death. They also charged her mother with being an accessory to the crime, believing her to have assisted McCarthy with \\"covering up\\" Bella's death. Larceny was added to Rachelle Bond's charges after she was found to have accepted nearly $1,400 of welfare income after she knew about the death of her daughter. Bond also continued to receive housing benefits. The pair were arraigned on September 21, 2015. Rachelle's bail was set for $1 million; McCarthy was not eligible for bail. McCarthy was scheduled to appear in court again on February 16, 2016, after Rachelle Bond's appearance on January 6. A judge later set Rachelle Bond's trial date to December 1, 2016. Selection of jury members for McCarthy's trial started on May 22. Trials Authorities have acknowledged that since the exact cause of Bella's death remains unknown, asserting that it was homicide to a jury could be \\"difficult to prove.\\" Rachelle Bond alleged that McCarthy had punched the toddler in the stomach multiple times after claiming Bella was a \\"demon\\", and that he was the sole perpetrator of the murder. Prosecutors of McCarthy allege that Bella was murdered in one of many abusive occasions after she had been unco-operative about going to bed. Citing that McCarthy had decided to \\"calm the child down,\\" they say Rachelle had not entered the room alongside her boyfriend. When she did enter, they say she witnessed him near the girl's body, which was \\"swollen and gray,\\" indicating she was deceased. Rachelle Bond's attorney claims McCarthy threatened to murder her client if she contacted authorities. She also maintained that Rachelle was not involved with hiding the victim's body, which had initially been placed in garbage bags and concealed in a refrigerator. Bond later admitted to this accusation as part of a future plea deal. A cadaver dog brought to the house later indicated that it smelled something on the refrigerator. Bond contradicted the belief that the body was placed on Deer Island; she stated that McCarthy had placed the body in a weighted duffel bag and disposed of it in the water, suggesting it drifted to the location where it was found. McCarthy claimed Rachelle was responsible for the death. McCarthy's lawyer objected to claims made by Rachelle Bond's defense and stated that his client had no knowledge of Bella's death, saying no sufficient evidence exists to indicate otherwise. They have also claimed that he had moved out of Rachelle Bond's residence before Bella's death. McCarthy claimed he had left after witnessing Rachelle's negative treatment of Bella, which included emotional and physical abuse. His defense also cited that Rachelle's statements could not be confirmed and that she was more likely to have killed her daughter because of her drug history. The claim of Bella being beaten to death was also challenged, as the autopsy did not indicate any signs of injuries consistent with what Rachelle described. Other claims exist that accuse Rachelle Bond of fabricating the story as a way to avoid being charged with murder. It was announced that McCarthy had sent Rachelle a text message that said \\"don't tell them you have a daughter. We don't want [the Department of Children and Families] getting involved\\". In February 2017, McCarthy's trial was set to take place later in the year. The prosecutor in the case suggested that Rachelle Bond be awarded with \\"time served\\" in exchange for a testimony against McCarthy. His decision was made after considering the allegations that Bond had been threatened to be killed if she came forward about Bella's death. Bond pleaded guilty on February 10, 2017, under the suggested plea bargain, and was credited with time served plus two years of probation. During McCarthy's trial in early June 2017, a \\"lifelong friend\\" of McCarthy's took the stand and expressed that he had warned Rachelle Bond of the potential danger she was in after entering a relationship with Bella's alleged killer. He explained that this was due to McCarthy's \\"dark side\\", including the fact that he heavily researched topics such as demons and satanic rituals. He also had apparently believed he had the ability to expunge demons from a residence. McCarthy's defense provided text messages and journal entries made by Bond that were written after Bella died. The entries still referred to him affectionately, which his attorneys believe suggest his innocence. Bond continued to claim her actions after the murder were \\"out of fear; she was also allegedly \\"tranquilized\\" with heroin injected by McCarthy after the murder. His defense also claimed that Bond was the individual in the relationship with the \\"dark\\" interests. Although McCarthy had been charged with first-degree murder, the judge allowed the jury to consider lesser charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. On June 26, 2017, the jury returned a guilty verdict of second-degree murder, and two days later, he was sentenced to life imprisonment; he will be eligible for parole in 2037.

It has tiny, fleshy leaves with paired leaflets which are deciduous, dropping off in stressful conditions. The flowers usually have five white or yellow petals (sometimes four), ten projecting stamens and a minute style. The fruits are capsules, splitting into five parts when ripe. Distribution and habitat Tetraena qatarensis is native to the Arabian Peninsula and occurs around the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It typically grows in coarse, stony or sandy soils at the edge of saltflats, around salt marshes, and in the sand that accumulates on the base of depressions. It also grows in non-salty locations, on calcareous soils and around the fringes of dune areas, and often dominates plant communities in these locations. On well-drained sandy soil on coastal plains, T. qatarensis may cover 75% of the ground surface, and this plant community is probably the most commonly encountered around the western side of the Persian Gulf. Ecology A large bush of T. qatarensis growing in a highly saline industrial wasteland in Doha, Qatar Tetraena qatarensis grows in arid conditions and is both drought and salt tolerant. In the Persian Gulf area the summer is very hot, any ground moisture present evaporates and the soil becomes increasingly salty. Under these conditions, the leaves dry up and fall off the plant, and it can survive in a leafless state for several years. When significant rain falls in winter, the soil becomes less salty and the plant is stimulated into new growth. The leaf structure and physiology also change with the season, with unifoliate xeromorphic leaves better able to withstand water loss being present during the summer. The seeds have tough coats and germination only occurs after significant rainfall. The plants are found growing in association with several species of soil microfungi, regularly with Cladosporium sphaerospermum, but also sometimes with Penicillium citrinum and Aspergillus fumigatus.

Broadcasting on 99.5 FM, KFXY-LP is owned by San Tan Educational Media and carries a country format known as 99.5 The Ranch. The original construction permit specified operation on 106.7 MHz, but this was soon changed to 99.1 because of severe interference from KKMR on 106.5. The station signed on in early 2014 as KUKQ-LP with an alternative music format known as \\"KQ99.1\\". The KUKQ callsign was formerly used at 1060 AM (now KDUS). After a stint as KOWO-LP \\"Wow 99.1\\" from 2014 to 2015, the station relaunched as KQCX-LP in September 2015, then flipped again to alternative rock as \\"FX 99.1\\" on January 1, 2016. The call sign was changed once more on January 22, 2016, to KFXY-LP; , the station broadcast a classic country format with Americana and Roots programming known as Coyote Country 99.1. After some time off air, KFXY came back on air with a variety format with the name, Fuzzy 99.5. Shortly after that, KFXY re-branded as 99.5 The Ranch and during the early hours of the day, KFXY plays a classic country mixed with some classic rock and Texas Country. In the afternoon hours, KFXY airs a more modern country format from the 90's to now mixed with classic rock and Texas country. The station went off the air November 19, 2017 after they lost their tower site. Their statement to the FCC stated, \\"THE EQUIPMENT HAS LOST POWER AND SITE ACCESS HAS BEEN DENIED.\\" On June 25, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that as control of KFXY-LP had substantially changed by January 1, 2016, only six months after the station's license was granted in July 2015 (FCC regulations prohibit such changes of control within the first three years of an LPFM station's licensed operation), it had failed to comply with a condition of the license and revoked KFXY-LP's authorization.

Since being acquired by the Symantec Corporation in 1990, Norton offered a variety of products and services related to digital security. In 2014, it was announced that Norton's parent company Symantec would split its business into two units - one focused on security, and one focused on information management, with Norton being placed in the unit focused on security. History Peter Norton Computing, Inc., was a software company founded by Peter Norton. Norton and his company developed various DOS utilities including the Norton Utilities, which did not include antivirus features. In 1990, the company was acquired by Symantec and renamed Peter Norton Consulting Group. Symantec's consumer antivirus and data management utilities are still marketed under the Norton name. By early 1991, Symantec's Norton Group launched Norton AntiVirus 1.0 for PC and compatible computers. Since then, the company has updated and diversified its product line until combining its offerings into one seamless product, Norton Security. Products and Services Norton‚Äôs products are primarily digital security tools for personal computers and server devices, and more recently, mobile devices.  Consumer Products  = Norton Security (2014) = Norton Security is a multi-device program that provides malware prevention and removal during subscription period for up to five devices. Other features included in the product are a personal firewall, email spam filtering, and phishing protection. The program was released in September 2014, replacing Norton 360, Norton Internet Security, and Norton AntiVirus. When compared to Norton legacy products, Norton Security came with improved scalability and protection and a money-back guarantee. = Norton Security with Backup (2014) = Norton Security with Backup is Norton‚Äôs premium protection for up to 10 devices. It protects PC, Mac, Android and iOS devices with a single protection plan, and includes Norton Family Premier. This product safeguards against viruses, spyware, malware, and other online attacks.

The last version of Norton Utilities, Norton Utilities 16 for Windows XP/Vista/7/8, was released October 26, 2012.  Norton Guides (1985)  Developed and distributed by Peter Norton Computing. The guides were written by Warren Woodford for the x86 Assembly Language, C, BASIC, and Forth languages and made available to users via a TSR program that integrated with programming language editors on IBM PC-type computers. This appears to be the first example of a commercial product where programming reference information was integrated into the software development environment.  Norton AntiVirus (1991)  Norton AntiVirus was developed and distributed by Symantec, providing malware prevention and removal during a subscription period. It used signatures and heuristics to identify viruses. Other features included were email spam filtering and phishing protection.  Norton 2000 (1998)  Norton 2000 was a program that analyzed both hardware and software aspects of a computer system to check for Y2K compliance.  Norton SystemWorks (1998)  SystemWorks expanded the tools found in Norton Utilities and added other Symantec software titles, primarily antivirus, and later backup software for the high-end versions.  Norton Internet Security (2007)  Norton Internet Security was a computer program that provided malware prevention and removal during a subscription period and used signatures and heuristics to identify viruses. Other features included were a personal firewall, email spam filtering, and phishing protection.  Norton 360 (2007)  Norton 360 was developed and marketed as an \\"all-in-one\\" computer security suite. The package included an antivirus program, a personal firewall, a phishing protection program, and a backup program. What distinguished this suite from Norton Internet Security was the inclusion of file backup and PC maintenance capabilities.  Norton Clean Sweep (2009)  Norton Clean Sweep was designed by Quarterdeck and designed to aid in the removal of installed programs on Microsoft Windows. CleanSweep was acquired by Symantec and sold as a standalone product for a period of time. It is currently unavailable from Symantec standalone and is incorporated in Norton SystemWorks.

It was broadcast on CBS July 3, 1950 ‚Äì August 21, 1950, as a summer replacement for Lux Radio Theatre. Premise Granby's Green Acres featured a former banker \\"who knew little about farming and proved it every week.\\" Characters and Cast Three of the main characters on Granby's Green Acres were much like those heard on many other situation comedies on radio: a husband, his \\"somewhat addled and impractical\\" wife, and \\"their breathless teenage daughter.\\"Dunning, John. (1976). Tune in Yesterday: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, 1925-1976. Prentice-Hall, Inc. . P. 244. Radio historian John Dunning wrote that the husband and wife were \\"inspired by characters heard on the Lucille Ball show, My Favorite Husband.\\" In fact, radio regulars Gale Gordon and Bea Benaderet (who played John and Martha Granby) also played Mr. and Mrs. Atterbury on My Favorite Husband. Dunning noted, \\"The names were changed, but the basic characters remained the same.\\" Granby's Green Acres was Benaderet's \\"one and only full-fledged starring role on radio.\\" Two other regulars were also familiar to radio listeners. Louise Erickson played Janice, the Granbys' daughter, and Parley Baer played Eb, the farm's hired hand.Terrace, Vincent (1981), Radio's Golden Years: The Encyclopedia of Radio Programs 1930-1960. A.S. Barnes & Company, Inc. . P. 105. The storekeeper, Will Kimble, was played by Howard McNear in the first episode and by Horace Murphy in subsequent broadcasts. Bob LeMond was the announcer, and Opie Cates was the music director. Television adaptation Although Granby's Green Acres was not transferred directly to television, as were many old-time radio programs, it was the inspiration for Green Acres. The television program followed two popular programs (The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction) produced by Paul Henning, as Jeffrey Westhoff explained: > CBS asked Henning to create a third show. To avoid the stress of running > three shows at once, Henning asked Petticoat writer Jay Sommers to create > and produce this new program. Sommers proposed reviving Granby's Green > Acres, changing the farmer's name and shortening the title.This meant that > Benaderet's old radio show had become a spinoff of her television show. History The show's creator, Jay Sommers, based its concept on memories of time he spent as a boy on a farm near Greendale, New York. His stepfather went broke trying to make the farm successful. In 1948, Granby's Green Acres was auditioned for a slot on ABC with Hanley Stafford originally set to star.

It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan. It is currently extinct in the wild of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt and Eritrea. The Nubian giraffe used to be widespread everywhere on Northeast Africa. The subspecies was listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN in 2018. Taxonomy and evolution The IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies, one of which is the Nubian giraffe. The Nubian giraffe, along with the whole species, were first known by the binomen Cervus camelopardalis described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the Systema Natur√¶ per regna tria natur√¶, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis in 1758. He described the giraffe from Ethiopia or Sennar of Eastern Sudan.Linnaeus, C. (1758). Nubian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis). Catalogue of the ungulate mammals in the British Museum (Natural History) (1913): 242. A 2016 analysis of giraffe subspecies proposed that the Rothschild's giraffe (G. c. rothschildi) could be considered a conspecific ecotype of the Nubian giraffe, but these results are not definitive. Following Linnaeus's description of the Nubian giraffe, several specimens were described by other naturalists and zoologists since the end of the 18th century under different scientific names, which are all considered synonyms of Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis today: *G. c. aethiopicus by Ogilby, 1836 *G. c. senaariensis by Trouessart, 1898 *G. c. typica by Bryden, 1899 *G. c. rothschildi by Lydekker, 1903 *G. c. congoensis by Lydekker, 1903 Physical description The Nubian giraffe has sharply defined chestnut-colored spots surrounded by mostly white lines, while undersides lack spotting. The median lump is particularly developed in the male giraffe.Seymour, R. (2002) The taxonomic status of the giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis (L. 1758), PH.D Thesis Habitat population Giraffes occurred everywhere in Africa; the Nubian giraffe was widespread throughout North Africa, from Kenya to Egypt. The giraffe lives in savannahs and woodlands. The Nubian giraffe currently lives in eastern South Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia, and isolated pockets in Uganda and Kenya. It was estimated in 2010 that fewer than 250 live in the wild, although this number was uncertain.

Tayforth Universities O.T.C. A History. History Tayforth is descended from a Militia formed from the time of Charles II and the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745. In 1859 a committee was formed in St Andrews to form a volunteer corps of both rifle and artillery. This was carried in a town meeting on 5 December 1859 and was carried unanimously and 3rd (St Andrews) Fife Artillery Volunteers was formed. In 1881 Professor Peter Scott Lang formed the St Andrews University Volunteer Battery of Artillery, named the Anstruther No 7 Battery of the 1st Fife Brigade of Garrison Artillery, although made up entirely of university students and staff. In 1883 the Battery changed its name to University Company 1st Fife VA and the Senatus Academicus pledged ¬£20 per year to the Battery. Throughout its early history the Battery followed an annual training programme including an annual camp, an annual dinner and a church service and parade in St Salvator's Quad. In conjunction with the Battery, in 1906 the University formed a Military Education Committee (MEC) to commence a course in Military Education In 1908 the concept of the Officers' Training Corps was formed and St Andrews, being the oldest university in Scotland and the third oldest in the UK was naturally interested in this. A Military Education Committee was required to constitute the new Unit, and as St Andrews already had one set up they were able to complete the whole range of business in one afternoon, forming St Andrews University OTC. Such business included deciding on the uniform. The cap badge was decided to be the University shield surmounted by the King's Crown. Whilst this is no longer the cap badge it is now seen in A Squadron mess as the squadron crest. During the Great War, 415 former members of the University Company served in the army. The contingent continued to train throughout the war, although with depleted numbers. In 1916 the medical students began to train independently and were recognised as a sub-unit of the contingent. Sadly 78 members of the corps lost their lives, their names are remembered on a memorial board in the A Squadron Mess. Following the formation of Dundee University from University College Dundee, a part of the University of St Andrews, the OTC became St Andrews and Dundee University OTC. With the Addition of Stirling University the OTC was renamed Tayforth Universities OTC, as St Andrews, Dundee and Stirling Universities OTC was considered a bit of a mouthful. The name Tayforth was chosen as Dundee is situated on the River Tay and Stirling on the River Forth. The concern was that St Andrews, as the senior university may not agree with this name, however as the River Tay and the River Forth are the boundaries of the Kingdom of Fife, within which St Andrews is located, it was approved by the MEC. In May 1976, the Old Wyvernians formed as a non-regimental association for the former officer cadets of St Andrews University OTC. The inaugural meeting of the Tayforth Regimental Association was held on 16 June 1984, and was the first of its kind. Whilst other OTC's followed suit The Tayforth Regimental Association is the oldest of its kind.

The book is divided into three sections: Chapters 1 through 6 describe \\"the fundamental characteristics of the second machine age,\\" based on many examples of modern use of technology. Chapters 7 through 11 describe economic impacts of technology in terms of two concepts the authors call \\"bounty\\" and \\"spread.\\" What they call \\"bounty\\" is their attempt to measure the benefits of new technology in ways reaching beyond such measures as GDP, which they say is inadequate.

It can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized to exercise the functions of public character.eminent domain. Retrieved: 10 October 2012. Property taken by eminent domain may be for government use or by delegation to third parties, who will devote it to public or civic use or, in some cases, to economic development. The most common uses are for government buildings and other facilities, public utilities, highways and railroads. However, it may also be taken for reasons of public safety, as in the case of Centralia, Pennsylvania, where land was taken due to an underground mine fire. Some jurisdictions require that the condemnor make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain.  Terminology  The term \\"eminent domain\\" was taken from the legal treatise De Jure Belli et Pacis, written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625, which used the term dominium eminens (Latin for supreme lordship) and described the power as follows: > ... The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so > that the state or he who acts for it may use and even alienate and destroy > such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even > private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of > public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be > supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. But it is to be > added that when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to > those who lose their property. Some U.S. states use the term appropriation (New York) or \\"expropriation\\" (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers.  Condemnation  The term \\"condemnation\\" is used to describe the formal act of the exercise of the power of eminent domain to transfer title to the property from its private owner to the government. This use of the word should not be confused with its sense of a declaration that property is uninhabitable due to defects. Condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking ownership of the property or some lesser interest in it, such as an easement, and must pay just compensation for it. After the condemnation action is filed, the amount of just compensation is determined in trial. However, in some cases, the property owner challenges the right to take because the proposed taking is not for \\"public use\\", or the condemnor is not legislatively authorized to take the subject property, or has not followed the proper substantive or procedural steps as required by law. Also, in some cases the right to take may be denied by the courts for lack of public necessity for the taking (required by statute), but this is quite rare.  Other property  The exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property. Governments may also condemn personal property. Governments can even condemn intangible property such as contract rights, patents, trade secrets, and copyrights. Even the taking by a city of a professional sports team's franchise has been held by the California Supreme Court to be within the purview of the \\"public use\\" constitutional limitation, although eventually, that taking was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders, 32 Cal. 3d 60 (1982).  Constitutional powers and limits  The practice of condemnation was transplanted into the American colonies with the common law. In the early years, unimproved land could be taken without compensation; this practice was accepted because land was so abundant that it could be cheaply replaced. When it came time to draft the United States Constitution, differing views on eminent domain were voiced. Thomas Jefferson favored eliminating all remnants of feudalism, and pushed for allodial ownership. James Madison, who wrote the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, had a more moderate view, and struck a compromise that sought to at least protect property rights somewhat by explicitly mandating compensation and using the term \\"public use\\" rather than \\"public purpose,\\" \\"public interest\\", or \\"public benefit\\". The Fifth Amendment includes the public use requirement under the Takings Clause. Some historians have suggested that these limitations on the taking power were inspired by the need to permit the army to secure mounts, fodder and provisions from local ranchers and the perceived need to assure them compensation for such takings. Similarly, soldiers forcibly sought housing in whatever homes were near their military assignments. To address the latter problem, the Third Amendment was enacted in 1791 as part of the US Constitution's Bill of Rights. It provided that the quartering of soldiers on private property could not take place in peacetime without the landowner's consent. It also required that, in wartime, established law had to be followed in housing troops on private property. Presumably, this would mandate \\"just compensation,\\" a requirement for the exercise of eminent domain in general per the Fifth Amendment. All U.S. states have legislation specifying eminent domain procedures within their respective territories. The power of governments to take private real or personal property has always existed in the United States, as an inherent attribute of sovereignty. This power reposes in the legislative branch of the government and may not be exercised unless the legislature has authorized its use by statutes that specify who may use it and for what purposes. The legislature may take private property directly by passing an Act transferring title to the government. The property owner may then seek compensation by suing in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals for the purpose of acquiring access to their landlocked land. Its use was limited by the Takings Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1791, which reads, \\"... nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\\" The Fifth Amendment did not create the national government's right to use the eminent domain power, it simply limited it to public use. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of public use. In Clark vs. Nash (1905), the Supreme Court acknowledged that different parts of the country have unique circumstances and the definition of public use thus varied with the facts of the case. It ruled a farmer could expand his irrigation ditch across another farmer's land (with compensation), because that farmer was entitled to \\"the flow of the waters of the said Fort Canyon Creek ... and the uses of the said waters ... [is] a public use.\\" Here, in recognizing the arid climate and geography of Utah, the Court indicated the farmer not adjacent to the river had as much right as the farmer who was, to access the waters. However, until the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, the limitations on eminent domain specified in the Fifth Amendment applied only to the federal government and not to the states. That view ended in 1896 when in the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago case the court held that the eminent domain provisions of the Fifth Amendment were incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thus were now binding on the states, or in other words, when the states take private property they are required to devote it to a public use and compensate the property owner for his loss. This was the beginning of what is now known as the \\"selective incorporation\\" doctrine. An expansive interpretation of eminent domain was reaffirmed in Berman v. Parker (1954), in which the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed an effort by the District of Columbia to take and raze blighted structures in order to eliminate slums in the Southwest Washington area. After the taking, held the court, the taken and razed land could be transferred to private redevelopers who would construct condominiums, private office buildings and a shopping center. The Supreme Court ruled against the owners of a non-blighted property within the area on the grounds that the project should be judged on its plans as a whole, not on a parcel by parcel basis. In Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff (1984), the Supreme Court approved the use of eminent domain to transfer a land lessor's title to its tenants who owned and occupied homes built on the leased land. The court's justification was to break up a housing oligopoly, and thereby lower or stabilize home prices, although in reality, following the Midkiff decision, home prices on Oahu escalated dramatically, more than doubling within a few years. The Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005) went a step further and affirmed the authority of New London, Connecticut, to take non-blighted private property by eminent domain, and then transfer it for a dollar a year to a private developer solely for the purpose of increasing municipal revenues. This 5‚Äì4 decision received heavy press coverage and inspired a public outcry criticizing eminent domain powers as too broad. In reaction to Kelo, several states enacted or are considering state legislation that would further define and restrict the power of eminent domain. The Supreme Courts of Illinois, Michigan (County of Wayne v. Hathcock [2004]), Ohio (Norwood, Ohio v. Horney [2006]), Oklahoma, and South Carolina have recently ruled to disallow such takings under their state constitutions. The redevelopment in New London, the subject of the Kelo decision, proved to be a failure and as of ten years after the court's decision nothing was built on the taken land in spite of the expenditure of over $100 million in public funds. The Pfizer corporation, which owned a $300 million research facility in the area, and would have been the primary beneficiary of the additional development, announced in 2009 that it would close its facility, and did so shortly before the expiration of its 10-year tax abatement agreement with the city. The facility was subsequently purchased in 2010 for just $55 million by General Dynamics Electric Boat.  Compensation  The term \\"Severance Damages\\" is used in partial takings of land. It is the award paid to the land owner for the diminution in value of the part of the property that is not taken and remains in the owner's hands. American courts have held that the preferred measure of \\"just compensation\\" is \\"fair market value,\\" i.e., the price that a willing but unpressured buyer would pay a willing but unpressured seller in a voluntary transaction, with both parties fully informed of the property's good and bad features.Osborne M.Reynolds, Local Governments Law, Second Edition, West Group, Min 2001, , p. 505 Also, this approach takes into account the property's highest and best use (i.e., its most profitable use), which is not necessarily its current use or the use mandated by current zoning if there is a reasonable probability of zone change.  Tax implications  When private property is destroyed, condemned, or disposed of, the owner may receive a payment in property or money in the form of insurance or a condemnation award. If property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into money (as in eminent domain) the proceeds can be reinvested without payment of capital gains tax provided it is reinvested in property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, no capital gain shall be recognized.  Bush executive order  On June 23, 2006, the first anniversary of the Kelo decision (see above), President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13406, which stated in Section I that the federal government must limit its use of taking private property to \\"public use\\" with \\"just compensation\\" (both of which are phrases used in the U.S. Constitution) for the \\"purpose of benefiting the general public.\\" The order limits this use by stating that it may not be used \\"for the purpose of advancing the economic interest of private parties to be given ownership or use of the property taken.\\", However, eminent domain is more often exercised by local and state governments, albeit often with funds obtained from the federal government.

It is named after the city of Ramsar in Iran, where the Convention was signed in 1971. The Philippines enforced the Ramsar Convention in its whole territory on November 8, 1994. Since then, Ramsar has designated 7 Ramsar sites in the country. Two Ramsar sites in the Philippines have been declared by UNESCO as world heritage sites, namely Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park. A national inventory of wetland resources, based on the best scientific information available, is mandated by the Convention since 1990 through Recom 4.6. A Framework for Wetland Inventory was also established by the Convention in 2002 to aid member states in establishing their own national inventory for wetland sites. The inventory makes it possible to prioritize appropriate wetland sites for designation on the Ramsar List, similar to the tentative list of UNESCO, where UNESCO sites must always come from the tentative list. There is currently no publicly disclosed wetland inventory in the Philippines, but it is assumed that such inventory exists as the Philippines, through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, has already nominated at least seven Philippine wetlands since 1994. The current representation of the Philippines in Ramsar wetland nominations is inactive compared with the Ramsar wetland nominations of its peers. By comparison, the Philippines has 7 sites, while Mexico has more than 140, the archipelagic country of Japan has more than 50, the African nation of Algeria has more than 50, and the small country of South Korea has 22. The Philippines, an archipelagic country, theoretically possesses more wetlands than South Korea and North Korea combined. This has prompted various scholars to push the government to participate more in the nominations of Philippine wetlands in the Ramsar Convention. By rule, the Philippines may nominate multiple sites as Ramsar sites like what Mexico did in 2008, where at least 45 of its nominated sites were specifically declared as new Ramsar sites.

DNA is normally found in the nucleus of the cell. Localization of DNA to the cytosol is associated with tumorigenesis, viral infection, and invasion by some intracellular bacteria. The cGAS ‚Äì STING pathway acts to detect cytosolic DNA and induce an immune response. Upon binding DNA, the protein cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) triggers reaction of GTP and ATP to form cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP binds to Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) which triggers phosphorylation of IRF3 via TBK1. IRF3 can then go to the nucleus to trigger transcription of inflammatory genes. This pathway plays a critical role in mediating immune defense against double- stranded DNA viruses. The innate immune system relies on germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon recognition of a PAMP, PRRs generate signal cascades leading to transcription of genes associated with the immune response. Because all pathogens utilize nucleic acid to propagate, DNA and RNA can be recognized by PRRs to trigger immune activation. In normal cells, DNA is confined to the nucleus or mitochondria. The presence of DNA in the cytosol is indicative of cellular damage or infection and leads to activation of genes associated with the immune response. One way cytosolic DNA is sensed is via the cGAS/STING pathway, specifically by the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Upon DNA recognition, cGAS dimerizes and stimulates the formation of cyclic- GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP then binds directly to stimulator of interferon genes (STING) which triggers phosphorylation/activation of the transcription factor IRF3 via TBK1. IRF3 is able to enter the nucleus to promote transcription of inflammatory genes, such as IFN-Œ≤. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)  Structure  cGAS is a 522 amino acid protein and a member of the nucleotidyltransferase family. N-terminal residues 1-212 are necessary to bind dsDNA. This region may contain two different DNA binding domains. C-terminal residues 213-522 contain part of the nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) motif and a Mab21 domain and are highly conserved in cGAS from zebrafish to humans. These regions are necessary to form the catalytic pocket for the cGAS substrates: GTP and ATP, and to perform the necessary cyclization reaction.  Function  cGAS is found at the plasma membrane and is responsible for detecting cytosolic double stranded DNA, normally found in the cell nucleus, in order to stimulate production of IFN-Œ≤. Upon directly binding cytosolic DNA, cGAS forms dimers to catalyze production of 2‚Äô3‚Äô-cGAMP from ATP and GTP. cGAMP then acts a second messenger, binding to STING, to trigger activation of the transcription factor IRF3. IRF3 leads to transcription of type-1 IFN-Œ≤. cGAS is unable to produce 2‚Äô3‚Äô-cGAMP in the presence of RNA. Discovery Prior to the discovery of cGAS, it was known that interferon beta was produced in the presence of cytosolic dsDNA and that STING-deficient cells were unable to produce interferon in the presence of dsDNA. Through biochemical fractionation of cell extracts and quantitative mass spectrometry, Sun, et al. identified cGAS as the DNA-sensing protein able to trigger interferon beta by synthesizing the second messenger, 2‚Äô3‚Äô-cGAMP. This activity is dependent on cytosolic DNA. Enzymatic activity cGAS catalyzes formation of cGAMP in the presence of dsDNA. cGAS directly binds dsDNA via positively charged amino acid residues interacting with the negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone. Mutations in the positively charged residues completely abrogate DNA binding and subsequent interferon production through STING. Upon binding dsDNA, cGAS dimerizes and undergoes conformational changes that open up a catalytic nucleotide binding pocket, allowing GTP and ATP to enter. Here they are stabilized through base stacking, hydrogen bonds, and divalent cations in order to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation to produce the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)  Structure  Cyclic GMP- AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) and the first to be found in metazoans. Other CDNs (c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP) are commonly found in bacteria, archaea, and protozoa. As the name suggests, cGAMP is cyclic molecule composed of one Adenine monophosphate (AMP) and one Guanine monophosphate (GMP) connected by two phosphodiester bonds. However, cGAMP differs from other CDNs in that it contains a unique phosphodiester bonds between the 2‚Äô OH of GMP and the 5‚Äô phosphate of AMP. The other bond is between the 3‚Äô OH of AMP and the 5‚Äô phosphate of GMP. The unique 2‚Äô-5‚Äô phosphodiester bond may be advantageous because it is less susceptible to degradation caused by 3‚Äô-5‚Äô phosphodiesterases. Other advantages of the unique 2‚Äô-5‚Äô linkage may be that cGAMP is able to bind multiple allelic variants of STING found in the human population, while other CDNs, composed of only 3‚Äô-5‚Äô linkages, are not. cGAS bound to dsDNA. Adapted from PDB 4O6A. Discovery cGAMP was discovered by James Chen and colleagues by collecting cytoplasmic extracts from cells transfected with different types of DNA. Cellular extracts were assayed for STING activation by detecting activated IRF3 dimers. Using affinity purification chromatography, the STING activating substance was purified and mass spectrometry was used to identify the substance as cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Chemically synthesized cGAMP was shown to trigger IRF3 activation and IFN-Œ≤ production. cGAMP was found to be much more potent than other cyclic di- nucleotides (c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP). cGAMP was shown to definitively bind STING by using radiolabeled cGAMP cross-linked to STING. Adding in unlabeled cGAMP, c-di-GMP, or c-di-AMP was found to compete with radio-labeled cGAMP, suggesting that CDN binding sites overlap. It was later shown that cGAMP has a unique 2‚Äô-5‚Äô phosphodiester bond, which differs from conventional 3‚Äô-5‚Äô linked CDNs and that this bond may explain some of the unique signaling properties of cGAMP. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) STING is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein and has been shown to directly bind to a variety of different cyclic-di-nucleotides. Expression STING is expressed broadly in numerous tissue types, of both immune and non-immune origin. STING was identified in murine embryonic fibroblasts, and is required for the type 1 interferon response in both immune and non-immune cells.  Structure  STING is a 378 amino acid protein. Its N-terminal region (residues 1-154) contains four trans-membrane domains. Its C-terminal domain contains the dimerization domain, the cyclic dinucleotide interaction domain, as well as a domain responsible for interacting and activating TBK1. Upon binding of 2‚Äô-3‚Äô cGAMP, STING undergoes a significant conformational change (approximately 20 Angstrom inward rotation) that encloses cGAMP. STING bound to cGAMP. While STING exists as a homodimer, only one subunit is shown to highlight the interaction of side chain residues with cGAMP. Adapted from PDB 4KSY  Function  Upon binding of 2‚Äô-3‚Äô cGAMP (and other bacterial CDNs), STING activates TBK1 to phosphorylate downstream transcription factors IRF3, which induces the type 1 IFN response, and STAT6, which induces chemokines such as CCL2 and CCL20 independently of IRF3. STING is also thought to activate the NF-Œ∫B transcription factor through the activity of the IŒ∫B kinase (IKK), though the mechanism of NF-Œ∫B activation downstream of STING remains to be determined. The signaling pathways activated by STING combine to induce an innate immune response to cells with ectopic DNA in the cytosol. Loss of STING activity inhibits the ability of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to fight against infection by certain viruses, and more generally, is required for the type 1 IFN response to introduced cytosolic DNA. STING‚Äôs general role as an adapter molecule in the cytosolic DNA-type 1 IFN response across cell types has been suggested to function through dendritic cells (DCs). DCs link the innate immune system with the adaptive immune system through phagocytosis and MHC presentation of foreign antigen. The type 1 IFN response initiated by DCs, perhaps through recognition of phagocytosed DNA, has an important co- stimulatory effect. This has recently led to speculation that 2‚Äô-3‚Äô cGAMP could be used as a more efficient and direct adjuvant than DNA to induce immune responses. Allelic Variation Naturally occurring variations in human STING (hSTING) have been found at amino acid position 232 (R232 and H232). H232 variants have diminished type 1 IFN responses and mutation at this position to alanine abrogates the response to bacterial CDNs. Substitutions enhancing ligand binding were also found. G230A substitutions were shown to increase hSTING signaling upon c-di-GMP binding. This residue is found on the lid of the binding pocket, possibly increasing c-di-GMP binding ability. Biological Importance of the cGAS-STING pathway Role in viral response The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway is able to generate interferon beta in response to cytosolic DNA. It was shown that DNA viruses, such as HSV-1, are able to trigger cGAMP production and subsequent activation of interferon beta via STING . RNA viruses, such as VSV or Sendai virus, are unable to trigger interferon via cGAS-STING. cGAS or STING defective mice are unable to produce interferon in response to HSV-1 infection which eventually leads to death, while mice with normal cGAS and STING function are able to recover. Retroviruses, such as HIV-1, were also shown to activate IFN via the cGAS/STING pathway. In these studies, inhibitors of retroviral reverse transcription abrogated IFN production, suggesting that it is the viral cDNA which is activating cGAS. Role in tumor surveillance The cGAS/STING pathway also has a role in tumor surveillance. In response to cellular stress, such as DNA damage, cells will upregulate NKG2D ligands so that they may be recognized and destroyed by Natural Killer (NK) and T cells. In many tumor cells, the DNA damage response is constitutively active, leading to the accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA. This activates the cGAS/STING pathway leading to activation of IRF3. It was shown in lymphoma cells that the NKG2D ligand, Rae1, was upregulated in a STING/IRF3 dependent manner. Transfection of DNA into these cells also triggered Rae1 expression that was dependent on STING. In this model, the transcription factor IRF3, via cGAS/STING, upregulates stress-induced ligands, such as Rae1, in tumor cells, so as to aid in NK- mediated tumor clearance Role in autoimmune disease Cytoplasmic DNA, due to viral infection, can lead to activation of interferon beta to help clear the infection. However, chronic activation of STING, due to host DNA in the cytosol, can also activate the cGAS/STING pathway, leading to autoimmune disorders. An example of this occurs in Aicardi‚ÄìGouti√®res syndrome (AGS). Mutations in the 3‚Äô repair exonuclease, TREX1, cause endogenous retroelements to accumulate in the cytosol, which can lead to cGAS/STING activation, resulting in IFN production. Excessive IFN production leads to an over-active immune system, resulting in AGS and other immune disorders. In mice, it was found that autoimmune symptoms associated with TREX1 deficiency were relieved by cGAS, STING, or IRF3 knockout, implying the importance of aberrant DNA sensing in autoimmune disorders.  Role in cellular senescence  It has been shown that the depletion of cGAS and STING in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in primary human fibroblasts denies senescence and SASP (Senescent Associated Secreted Proteins) establishment. Therapeutic role DNA has been shown to be a potent adjuvant to boost the immune response to antigens encoded by vaccines. cGAMP, through IRF3 activation of STING, stimulates transcription of interferon. This makes cGAMP a potential vaccine adjuvant capable of boosting inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that vaccines encoded with the chicken antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), in conjunction with cGAMP, were able to activate antigen-specific T and B cells in a STING-dependent manner in vivo. When stimulated with OVA peptide, the T cells from mice vaccinated with OVA + cGAMP were shown to have elevated IFN-g and IL-2 when compared to animals receiving only OVA. Furthermore, the enhanced stability of cGAMP, due to the unique 2‚Äô-5‚Äô phosphodiester bond, may make it a preferred adjuvant to DNA for in vivo applications.

The event was headlined by a UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout between current champion Daniel Cormier and top contender Alexander Gustafsson. The bout was initially linked as the event headliner for UFC 191. However, the bout was postponed to this event as a result of Cormier's knee injury.

Johny Hendricks was set to face Tyron Woodley in the co-main event. However, Hendricks pulled out of the fight on the day of the weigh-ins due to a kidney stone and intestinal blockage suffered during his weight cut. Therefore, the fight was canceled.

Magsaysay-Ho's work appeals to Modernism by utilizing more abstract designs and styles rather than realistic approaches. She was the only female member of the \\"Thirteen Moderns,\\" a standing group of Filipino modernist artists, and in 1958 was chosen by a panel of experts as one of the six major painters of the country's history.Biografie van Anita Magsaysay-Ho, Geringer Art, geraadpleegd 6 mei 2012 The most famous work of Magsaysay-Ho are subject to the beauty of Filipino women dealing with everyday issues. Collections of her artwork can be found in museums around the Philippines. Biography University of the Philippines, where Magsaysay-Ho studied at its School of Fine Arts Anita Magsaysay was born in 1914 in Manila. Her parents were Armilla Corpus and Ambrosio Magsaysay, an engineer. A cousin of Anita was Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, whose father Exequiel was a brother of Anita's father Ambrosio. At thirteen years of age, she studied at the School of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines (UP), where she took instruction from prominent Filipino painters like Fabian de la Rosa, Fernando Amorsolo, and his brother Pablo Amorsolo. She then followed UP's School of Design, with teachers as Victorio Edades and Enrique Ruiz. After her studies at UP, she left in the 1930s to go to the United States, where she studied at the Cranbrook Academy in Michigan and took class courses on oil painting. At the Art Student's League in New York City, Magsaysay-Ho took classes on drawing. There she met Robert Ho from Hong Kong who was also a student in New York City. They married in 1947 and moved to China, where Ho's shipping industry company, Magsaysay Inc., began. The couple had five children, and the family moved frequently because of Ho's work. They lived in Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, New York, Washington, D.C., and Japan to name a few. Over the span of 50 years, this family moved to thirty different houses after living in Manila together for fourteen years. Wherever she lived, Anita had access to a studio, where she spent most of her time painting. In 1958, the Manila Chronicle formed a panel of experts who decided that Magsaysay-Ho is one of the most significant painters to go down in the history of the Philippines. She was soon named one of the \\"Thirteen Moderns,\\" a group of Filipino modernist artists, and the only woman of the group. In 2005, Alfredo Roces wrote a biography of her titled \\"Anita Magsaysay-Ho: In Praise of Women.\\" Works of Art Magsaysay-Ho found inspiration from her childhood and important women in her life. Although she traveled all her life and encountered many different women from different cultures, all of the women in her paintings are of Filipinas because they are what she is most familiar with. Most of her paintings deal with Filipina women performing tasks such as cooking, harvesting, and tending to farms and children. The women she paints are seen without anger and are not concerned with gender roles or politics, as the women in her childhood were not. Magsaysay-Ho has revealed that she takes a liking to painting women who are at work in the fields as it shows their true strength. Despite frequently travelling, Magsaysay-Ho consistently painted the Philippines based on her memory. Magsaysay-Ho's favorite medium to paint with was egg tempera as used in her earlier work, but the physical demands forced her to utilize other techniques. So, she would paint by means of oils, acrylics, drawings, and lithographs. Her egg tempera paintings, however, are now some of her most sought-after works of art.In the early 1940s, the influence of her teacher Fernando Amorsolo was clearly visible, both in terms of subject and brightness of the paintings. Some call Magsaysay-Ho the \\"Female Amorsolo\\" because, like Fernando, she prefers having women as her subjects of painting. Her work appealed to Social Realism and post-Cubism by painting distortions and semi- abstract faces and portraits. It evolved toward Modernism, which, among other things, is expressed in its Cubist style. Magsaysay-Ho's work can be distinguished between the decades. In the 1950s, her work was exhibited in The Philippine Art Association (PAG) and grouped among other notable Neo-Realist artists. This period is when her most notorious work that involved light and dark contrasts of Filipina women hard at work were created. The 1960s brought along more articulate, spaced-out figures and softened tones. A decade later, her work was inspired by Chinese calligraphy as she created objects found in nature by using ink blots. Finally, in the 1980s Magsaysay-Ho utilized green hues to portray fruits and vegetables that oftentimes resembled women. Her most famous work includes \\"Two Women,\\" a painting portraying two Filipina women with white head-wraps shucking corn together while smiling, \\"Cooks,\\" featuring three Filipina women with pots full of food in front of them, and \\"Mending the Nets\\" that shows two Filipina women conversing while stitching a net. All of these won first place at The Philippine Art Association. On October 3, 1999, her painting \\"In the Marketplace\\" sold for SGD 669,250 (US $405,360) in Singapore.Sale 9909 / Lot 879, Christies.com, geraadpleegd op 16 mei 2012 This was a record high price for any Filipino artist during their lifetime. Death Senator Franklin Drilon, who wanted Magsaysay-Ho's work to be recognized She painted through to old age, until her 2009 stroke. She died three years later on May 5, 2012 in Manila, Philippines, just three weeks before her 98th birthday. A senate resolution was filed by Senator Franklin Drilon recommending Magsaysay-Ho to be conferred the National Artist Award for her contributions to Filipino modern art. The resolution ultimately did not pass as Magsaysay-Ho died a Canadian citizen.

She made three voyages transporting convicts from England and Ireland to Australia and later carried emigrants and other passengers to Australia. Design Bussorah Merchant was built in 1818 at Calcutta, from teak. She was 531 tons (bm) and had three masts. She was felted and doubled in 1833, had repairs to topsides and decks in 1846, and was sheathed with yellow metal in 1849. Later repairs were undertaken in 1852, when she was again sheathed with yellow metal, fastened with iron bolts. Career Bussorah Merchant made one trip to Bengal for the British East India Company. Captain Francis Goddard Stewart left the City Canal on 24 May 1825 and on 20 June was at the Lower Hope (Reach 10 on the Thames River). She reached Madeira on 10 July, reached Kedgeree on 14 November, and arrived at Calcutta on 21 November.British Library: Bussorah Merchant. On this voyage she was carrying a detachment of the 38th Regiment of Foot. On 6 November there was a court martial at Fort William, of Lieutenant Francis Bernard of that regiment for insubordination during the journey towards Captain Greene, commanding officer of the regiment. The court martial found Bernard guilty of most of the charges and sentenced him to be reprimanded, and to the loss of two years rank in the Army and to be placed at the bottom of the list of lieutenants in his regiment.Naval and Military Magazine, June 1827, Vol. 1, p.640. On 26 January 1826 Bussorah Merchant left for England, stopping at Madras, which she left on 23 March. On 23 April, an altercation broke out between Lieutenant Edward Kenny of the 89th Regiment of Foot and Mr. Robert Charlton, the ship's surgeon. The altercation resulted in Lieutenant Kenny shooting and killing Mr. Charlton. Bussorah Merchant arrived at London on 9 July. There Lieutenant Kenny was tried at the Old Bailey on 25 October. The court found Lieutenant Kenny guilty of manslaughter and fined him ¬£10.Annual Register..., (1827), Law Cases pp. 41-43. On her first convict voyage, under the command of James Baigrie and surgeon Robert Dunn, Bussorah Merchant departed London on 27 March 1828 and arrived in Sydney on 26 July.Bateson (1959), pp.298-9. She had embarked 170 (or 172) male convicts, of whom four died en route.Bateson (1959), p.331. The ship was quarantined upon arrival at Spring Cove (near Manly). This was the first time this location was used for quarantine purposes. This was not the first time a ship was quarantined in Australia, that had occurred 10 years earlier. The area of Jeffrey Street in Kirribilli was the first site in Australia to be used for quarantine purposes in 1814 with the Surry. On her second convict voyage, under the command of George Johnston and surgeon William Henderson, she departed The Downs on 6 October 1829 and arrived in Hobart on 18 January 1830.Bateson (1959), pp.310-1. She embarked 200 male convicts and had two deaths en route.Bateson (1959), p.332. On her third convict voyage, under the command of John Moncrief and surgeon James Gilbert, she departed Dublin on 16 August 1831, and arrived in Sydney on 14 December.Bateson (1959), pp.300-1. She embarked 198 male convicts; there were no convict deaths en route.Bateson (1959), p.333. She later plied the London-Australian route for Duncan Dunbar and Company. She left Cork 27 August 1837 with free migrant families and arrived at Hobart 11 December 1837. Sixty-two people died on the voyage and she was quarantined until Jan 1838. The Maritime Museum of Tasmania cites Bussorah Merchants voyage from Ireland to Hobart in 1837 as an example of ignorance of good hygiene. On that voyage four women and 64 out of 133 children died, most of measles and smallpox. On her subsequent voyage Bussorah Merchant left Bristol 15 April 1839 with 236 emigrants to Australia, 84 of them children, of whom only two died during the voyage.

A bowling-all-rounder, he is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off break bowler. In November 2018, against the West Indies, he took the best match figures for a Bangladesh bowler in a Test match.  Early and personal life  Miraz was born in Khulna and grew up in Khalishpur of Khulna city and started playing cricket when he was 8. He went to Kashipur Cricket Academy from where he was first selected for the under 14 National Cricket Tournament. On 15 March 2019, along with several members of the Bangladesh test team, he was moments from entering the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand when a terrorist attack began. All members of the team were \\"deeply affected\\". Miraz decided to marry his long-time fianc√©e Rabeya Akhter Priti on 21 March 2019 in order to overcome the shock of the \\"terror attack\\". 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup In December 2015 he was named as the captain of Bangladesh's squad for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Miraz managed to take his team into semifinal but lost to West Indies. In third place play-off, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by three wickets. Mehidy Hasan Miraz is named Player of the Tournament for his all round performance. He scored 242 runs and took 12 wickets in 6 matches. Domestic career Miraz made his first-class debut against Rajshahi Division cricket team on 16 February 2015. On his debutante matches he made 51 run (he batted only first innings) and took four wickets. He made his Twenty20 (T20) debut on 9 November 2016 playing for Rajshahi Kings in the 2016‚Äì17 Bangladesh Premier League. In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Rajshahi Kings team, following the draft for the 2018‚Äì19 Bangladesh Premier League. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Khulna Tigers in the 2019‚Äì20 Bangladesh Premier League. International career Test cricket Mehidy had a dream debut series as a Test player. After the remarkable 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup there was never any doubt in the team management's mind that they had found themselves an exceptional talent - in fact, in an echo of Australia's unveiling of Shane Warne on the 1993 Ashes tour. He was expected to debut a month ago for Afghanistan ODIs but was deliberately omitted to keep him as a secret from England. On 20 October 2016, Mehidy made his Test debut against England. Even though he is an off break bowler, he opened the bowling in his maiden Test innings. Ben Duckett, another debutant in the same Test match, became Mehidy's first Test wicket. In the same match he also became the seventh and youngest Bangladesh player to take a five-wicket haul on debut in a Test. In his 2nd Test match he became the sixth bowler to take three five-for in his first two Tests and took 19 wickets in the Test series and became the 9th player overall and 1st from Bangladesh to win the man-of-the-series award in debut Test series. Even though he had a horrible series as a batsman scored only 5 runs in 4 innings at an average of 1.25, Mushfiqur Rahim lauded the performances of the 19-year-old, and insisted Mehidy still has much more to offer. He said \\" Mehidyi is a good batsman also. He didn't show that now, but hopefully in future he will be a great all-rounder for Bangladesh\\". For his sensational debut series against England a new house from Bangladesh's prime minister was gifted to him. In November 2018, in the second Test against the West Indies, Hasan took the best match figures by a Bangladesh bowler in Tests, finishing with twelve wickets for 117 runs. One Day International cricket In December 2016 he was named in Bangladesh's One Day International (ODI) squad for their series against New Zealand, although he did not play. In March 2017, he was added to Bangladesh's ODI squad for their series against Sri Lanka. He made his ODI debut in the first match of the series on 25 March 2017 at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium. He took his maiden ODI wicket by dismissing Kusal Mendis for 4 runs. By the end of the match, he had picked up 2 wickets for just 43 runs in his quota of 10 overs ‚Äì his second wicket being Dinesh Chandimal. He surprised everyone with his magnificent bowling. Many said, \\"He didn't look like a bowler bowling in his first match.\\" He picked 4‚Äì29 in 3rd odi vs West Indies in 2018 and helped Bangladesh win series 2‚Äì1. In April 2019, he was named in Bangladesh's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He took 6 wickets and, at an economy rate of 5.08, was Bangladesh's most economical bowler at the tournament. Twenty20 International cricket In April 2017, he was named in Bangladesh's Twenty20 International (T20I) squad for their series against Sri Lanka. He made his T20I debut for Bangladesh against Sri Lanka on 6 April 2017. In April 2018, he was one of ten cricketers to be awarded a central contract by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) ahead of the 2018 season.

Biography Hans Holtermann was from a family of traders and whole merchants on the west coast of Norway. Holtermann's great-grandfather, Coert Holtermann, is believed to have first immigrated from Rothenburg in Germany to Bergen with his son Henrich Holtermann (1650-1730). They acquired citizenship in 1676 and became involved in trading. Hans Holtermann's father, Henrik Holtermann (1683-1728), acquired trading rights in Bergen. At that time there was no market town (kjobstad) in Sunnm√∏re and the Holtermans extended their privileges to Borgund and set up a trading post at Brunholmen that eventually became the nucleus of the town of √Ölesund. Hans Holtermann operated as a trader in Molde and later at Vegsund in Borgund (now √Ölesund).Dale, Bj√∏rn Jonson. 1995. √òrstingar‚Äî√¶ttebok for √òrsta.

Photo by professor Johan Meyer (1860-1940) His first marriage was to Margaretha Knudsdatter Wiig (from Vik in √òrsta, 1692‚Äì1743). His second marriage was to Ingeborg Catharine (a.k.a. Cathrina, Cathrine) Hagerup (August 30, 1730 ‚Äì 1796), the daughter of Bishop Eiler Hagerup.Erlandsen, Andreas. 1855. Biographiske Efterretninger om Geistligheden i Trondhjems Stift. Christiania: Chr. T√∏nsbergs forlag. Holtermann was the brother-in-law of the magistrate Melchior Falch, who was married to a younger daughter of Bishop Hagerup. His son, Knut Holtermann, became a supreme court judge in Copenhagen (then also the capital of Norway). Holtermann purchased the Austr√•tt estate in 1760 and settled there. Drawing by Gerhard Sch√∏ning around 1770 Hans Holtermann purchased parts of the Giske estate circa 1750, and in 1760 Austr√•tt manor in √òrland. Holtermann is believed to have paid 26,000 riksdaler for Austr√•tt. The Austr√•tt manor also included part or full ownership of a large number of smaller farms in the √òrland region.Moe, Wladimir. 1920. Norske Storgaarder. 2nd ed. Kristiania: Aschehoug.

Revenue is also generated from managing and leasing commercial property. Structure and brands Event Hospitality & Entertainment is a public company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, where its shares are traded under the code EVT. For much of its recent history it has effectively been controlled by billionaire Alan Rydge, whose family companies reportedly owned 45 per cent of the shares in 2004, and 60 per cent in 2011. The company has 62 hotels and resorts around the world, along with 75 cinemas in Australia, 54 cinemas in Germany, and 20 cinemas in New Zealand. It makes most of its money from its cinema division, and describes Event Cinemas as its flagship. In 2014, it was the fourth biggest owner of hotels in Australia, operating 9000 rooms across the country. Most of its hotel and cinema brands are based in Australia but some are in other countries: Australia: Atura Hotels, BCC Cinemas (formerly Birch Carroll & Coyle), Edge Digital and Technology, Event Cinemas, Greater Union Cinemas, GU Film House, Moonlight Cinemas, QT Hotels & Resorts, Rydges Hotels & Resorts, State Theatre Sydney, Thredbo Alpine Resort.

Corporate alliances Event Hospitality & Entertainment owns and operates some of its cinema chains as a joint venture with Village Roadshow. Their joint entity was established in 2003 under the name Australian Theatres. Many of its hotels belong to the Global Hotel Alliance. History 1911 ‚Äì 1940s: In 1911, The Christian was released. This was the first film produced by West's Pictures, which later became part of Greater Union. From 1911 to 1913, a series of mergers resulted in the formation of The Combine, a powerful alliance between exhibitor Union Theatres and the production and distribution company Australasian Films. The Combine imported many of its films and was blamed by independent competitors for a drop in the local production of films. In 1932, the box-office hit On Our Selection was produced by Cinesound Productions, a subsidiary which had been set up the previous year by Greater Union Theatres. In 1936, businessman Norman Rydge was elected chairman and managing director of Greater Union Theatres after buying a controlling interest. The company returned to profitability within three years. In 1942, Cinesound co-produced Kokoda Front Line!, the first Australian film to win an Academy Award. A full-length version of a wartime newsreel, it won an Oscar for best documentary. 1980s: In 1980, Alan Rydge inherited the company on the death of his father, becoming the youngest chairman of an Australian public company. In 1984, the company was once again fully Australian-owned after gaining control of Rank Organisation's half share. In 1987, the company acquired Thredbo Alpine Resort.https://www.thredbo.com.au/about-thredbo/history/ Retrieved 4th May 2020. In 1988, Rydge wanted to begin a hotels division and so recruited David Seargeant, who later became managing director. 2000s: In 2004, Amalgamated Hospitality Limited suffered a share plunge after writing off more than $70 million on its German cinemas. In 2005, Greater Union dropped its ban against cinemagoers bringing their own snacks and drinks after an investigation by the New South Wales Commissioner for Fair Trading. The same year, the Rydge family expanded its compound on Point Piper by buying a sixth adjoining property. In 2009, Meredith Hellicar resigned from the company board after being criticised in a judgement by the New South Wales Supreme Court for her part in approving, while chairwoman of James Hardie, a press release which falsely claimed that a trust for asbestosis victims had been fully funded. 2010s: In 2010, Amalgamated bought a chain of cinemas in New Zealand and Fiji from Skycity Entertainment Group. The same year, it also acquired outdoor cinema operator Moonlight Cinema for $1.75 million from Prime Media Group. In the financial year 2010‚Äì2011, Alan Rydge was among the wealthy Australians who donated to a secret fund set up for Sydney politician Malcolm Turnbull. In 2011, Amalgamated sold its 49 per cent share of a cinema chain in the Middle East. The same year, its operations in Queensland suffered losses due to severe flooding in 2010-2011. In 2013, the Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney was sold to Moss Capital for an estimated A$15 million. Amalgamated had owned the park since 1996. In 2014, a three-year plan was unveiled to build or redevelop 14 new cinemas. In December 2015, the company changed its name to Event Hospitality & Entertainment Limited. Its ticker code changed from AHD to EVT on the Australian Securities Exchange. In November 2016, David Seargeant gave notice that he would step down as managing director and CEO in the second half of 2017. He was replaced by Jane Hastings. In 2017, the company sold its two- thirds interest in a Fiji cinema joint venture. 2020s: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in mandatory government-ordered closures of cinema locations between March 2020 to July 2020 in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian government also converted many Rydges hotel locations to mandatory quarantine stations for international and domestic travellers.

Before her entrance into politics, she was an international model, director of a women's magazine and a track-and-field athlete. Biographical sketch Early life and education She was born in Athens and is the daughter of the former Hellenic Army officer and monarchist Alexandros Kountouras. Her father is co-founder and ongoing leader of BEO (ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒÆ ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒüœÅŒ≥Œ¨ŒΩœâœÉŒ∑, Vyzantini Ethniki Organosi, \\"National Byzantine Organisation\\", earlier Vasiliki Ethniki Organosi, \\"National Royal Organisation\\"), the title of which was changed in the Metapolitefsi for legal reasons. From childhood she was engaged in athletics. Her father enrolled her in the National Gymnastic Academy of Greece at the age of twelve as a high- jumper in training. She is a graduate of the National Gymnastic Academy and of the Department of Sport Science and Physical Education (TEFAA) at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. She was a top athlete on the Greek National Track and Field Team, and won the high jump and the 100 metre dash at the 1978 Panhellenic Women's Track & Field Championship. Modelling career From 1984 to 1997 she had an international career as a model, and in 1990 she was chosen by CNN as one of the ten most beautiful models in the world. She collaborated for many years with Serge Lutens, a well-known French photographer, designer and producer in the world of fashion, while also having the good fortune to collaborate with the Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido, and is the model most recognized as spokesperson for that brand, and whose face was published in international campaigns. Return to Greece and political career In 1997 she returned to Greece, and from 2004 she was director of a women's magazine. In the 2004 elections, she was elected member of parliament for Athens A for New Democracy. In 2007 and 2009 she was runner- up, even though in 2007 she gathered more votes than in 2004. In November 2011, Elena returned to parliament when Dimitris Avramopoulos vacated his parliamentary seat to become a minister in the government of Lucas Papademos. In February 2012, she voted against the \\"Memorandum 2\\" and party leader Antonis Samaras struck her from the party list of New Democracy. In the dual elections of May and June 2012, she was elected member of parliament for Athens A with Independent Greeks, while as of 2014 she assumed the office of Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee for Cinema. On 14 January 2019, she was expelled from Independent Greeks due to her continuing support for the Tsipras government following the Prespa agreement, which sparked the party's withdrawal from the governing coalition. She was then elected to the European Parliament on the Syriza ticket at the 2019 election. Personal life and family Kountoura is married to former Panellinios and Olympiacos basketball player Sarantis Papachristopoulos, her second husband. The couple have two boys Alexandros and Marios.

Professional career Pre-draft Even though he had a productive career as a defensive end at Kent State, Nix was projected to go undrafted due to his small stature for his position and was not invited to work out at the NFL Combine. He decided to switch to linebacker before Kent State's Pro Day and shed 19 lbs. Representatives from eight NFL teams showed up to Kent State's Pro Day to watch 11 prospects including Dri Archer. Atlanta Falcons On May 10, 2014, the Atlanta Falcons signed Nix to a three-year, $1.54 million contract after he went undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft. He appeared on Hard Knocks with the Falcons.

He originally was signed as an inside linebacker but with too much depth at the position he was again switched to fullback. With the Steelers' history of not typically using fullbacks under offensive coordinator Todd Haley and former coordinator Bruce Arians, Nix's best chance of keeping a position was a roster was to excel on special teams. During the pre-season, he made notable plays on special teams, including a blocked kick. =2015= On September 5, 2015, Nix made the regular season roster and was slated to be the backup to veteran Will Johnson. On October 18, 2015, he made his first career start during the Steelers' 25-14 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. He finished his first season appearing in 15 games with four starts. His first forced fumble was during Week 9 of the 2015 NFL season, on special teams, when the Steelers hosted the Oakland Raiders.

Nix was unfortunately unable to finish the season due to a foot injury. =2016= On January 19, 2016, he was signed to a one-year, $525,000 contract extension. During the 2015-2016 offseason, former starting fullback Will Johnson left via free agency to join the New York Giants. The Steelers named Nix the de facto starter at fullback going into the 2016 regular season. Nix was unable to appear in the first five games due to a back injury he suffered prior to the season-opener. On October 16, 2016, he appeared in his first game of the season during the Steelers' 30-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Nix made his first start of the season during a Week 11 victory over the Cleveland Browns. On January 1, 2017, he made his first two receptions for five receiving yards in a 27-24 overtime win over the Cleveland Browns. He finished his second season with two starts in ten games recording two catches for five yards. =2017= On January 26, 2017, the Steelers re- signed Nix to a one-year, $615,000 contract.

Martinez was elected to the Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. Biography Ramiro Martinez left Cuba in 1945 and moved to New York, New York, where he began broadcasting Major League Baseball games to a number of Hispanic countries. At that era, he worked alongside Argentine baseball commentator and friend Eloy Canel. During this period also, he authored columns for 12 newspaper and 3 magazines. In 1955, Ramirez established himself in Puerto Rico (some unreferenced sources claim he lived in Spain first). Martinez had started his professional career in Cuba not as a sportscaster but as an actor. In Puerto Rico, Martinez quickly began working as a sportscaster and reporter. He began to work there on a radio show that lasted for 50 years. Martinez, who did not openly oppose Fidel Castro, as a reporter was able to interview the Cuban President and El Che Guevara live and in person. Martinez met Roberto Clemente in 1954, as the future baseball Hall- of-Famer played triple-A baseball. The two forged a friendship that lasted until Clemente died in a plane crash on December 31, 1972. Both Martinez and Clemente considered each other to be brothers. Years later, Martinez also forged a strong friendship with boxer Wilfredo Gomez. Martinez had a weekly, Sunday evening television show on Puerto Rico's Canal 2, named \\"De Todo un Poco con Ramiro Martinez\\" (\\"A Little Bit of Everything, With Ramiro Martinez\\") in which he commented about the week's sports news, and instructed the viewers about different sports, including baseball-his favorite sport-, boxing-his second favorite one-, Olympic sports and others. Martinez later became sportscaster for the Miami Marlins's radio transmissions. Ramiro Martinez was also an avid sports memorabilia collector. His three-floor home in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico held what is considered to be the largest sports memorabilia collection in the tiny country, including 5,000 items related to Clemente. In 1973, Martinez released an album dedicated to Clemente's memory. This album was relaunched in 2004 as a compact disc. Martinez also had the largest sports-event-related video collection in Puerto Rico. Death Martinez, who had recently undergone surgery to repair an injury caused by a fall, died in his home in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, on July 8, 2015.

The station is owned by NAHF Inc. It airs a heavy schedule of local news, traffic, and weather information. The station was assigned the WSHF-LP call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on February 17, 2014. The WSHF call letters were originally assigned to AM 1380 in Sheffield, owned by Daylight Broadcasting. This first WSHF was founded by Dick Biddle, who surrendered the station's license to purchase WOWL 1240 in 1952. The WSHF call letters were later used by AM 1290 in Sheffield from 1963 to 1985, when it became WHCM. In 2014, the WSHF calls were resurrected for use on 92.3 FM, a station which originally signed on the air in Muscle Shoals on October 31, 2007. The station rebroadcast WLAY AM 1450's all-Muscle Shoals music format until 2012. During that time, Licensee URBan Radio Broadcasting dropped the WLAY call letters in favor of positioning the combo as \\"1450 & 92.3 The Sound.\\" URBan lost the license for 92.3 FM in 2012, and AM 1450 went silent in December 2014. With WSHF 92.3 FM's sign-on in June 2015, the station continued a tradition of broadcasting that dates all the way back to November 1933 when 1450's predecessor WNRA 1420 signed on the air in Sheffield. On October 1, 2019 WSHF announced it would move up the FM dial from 92.3 to 94.5 FM. The station cited continued interference from a co-channel station in Tennessee as the reason for its move up the FM dial.
