In 1892, Cudahy moved the company to a 700-acre (2.8 km¬≤) plot of land south of Milwaukee which he and his brother John bought for the purpose. This land was in the former Town of Lake, which is now divided between the municipalities of Milwaukee, St. Francis, and Cudahy.

It has recently been placed on Japan's Red List of Threatened Amphibians. Sometimes, sword-tail newts are called fire-bellied newts, not to be confused with the common Chinese and Japanese species, because of their bright orange bellies, which serve as a warning to predators that they are poisonous. They can be differentiated from these two species by their large size, broader heads and (against Japanese fire-bellies) smoother skin. This newt ranges from brown to black above, occasionally with an orange dorsal stripe. Some individuals may have light spotting or speckling on their backs. Sword-tailed newts can reach in males and in females.Caudata Culture Species Entry - Cynops ensicauda They are the largest living members of their genus. Females and males look significantly different in appearance. Females have much longer tails that are actually longer than the rest of their bodies. Males‚Äô tails are much shorter and sometimes display a whitish sheen during breeding season. Habitat and distribution The sword-tailed newt is only found on the Ryukyu Archipelago, an island chain off the southern coast of Japan, as well as on many smaller surrounding islands. This newt's habitat is slow, cool, stagnant bodies of water. They are commonly found in man-made structures such as rice paddies, road-side ditches, and cattle waterholes. The two known subspecies of sword- tailed newt are C. e. ensicauda and C. e. popei. Due to the subtropical climate of its native habitat, it is more tolerant of high temperatures than other Cynops. The sword-tailed newt has no predators, so deforestation and land development are the main reasons for their endangerment. Breeding places are being frequented by only a fourth of the population that was breeding 14 years ago. This lack of breeding is another key reason for them becoming endangered. Many of their breeding places are in roadside ditches and gutters, which can lead to them being run over. Sword-tail newts are extremely territorial, thus making moving their breeding places difficult. Trends and threats The once-teeming populations of C. ensicauda have declined alarmingly in recent years. There has been massive habitat destruction, especially of breeding sites, because of land development. Large, voracious fish of the genus Tilapia have been introduced into traditional breeding ponds. Even where supposedly suitable forest habitat has been preserved, the construction of access roads with concrete drainage ditches often proves fatal. The animals wander about to forage on rainy days and tumble into the ditches, where they are baked by the sun when the rain ceases (Goris and Maeda 2004).

It is closely related to the more widespread tawny owl and to the range-restricted Omani owl. This species is a part of the family Strigidae, commonly known as typical owls, which contains most species of owl. The other owl family is the barn owls, Tytonidae. The desert owl breeds in Israel, northeast Egypt, Jordan, and the Arabian peninsula. Its habitat includes desert, semi-desert, rocky ravines, and palm groves. It nests in crevices and holes in cliffs. Its diet consists of voles, mice and large insects. This is a medium-sized earless owl, smaller than the tawny owl at 29‚Äì33 cm in length. It is largely nocturnal and sedentary. Its stocky body and round head recall a small tawny owl, but it is paler, less streaked, particularly on the underparts, and has yellow eyes. The call of the desert owl is a ', described as similar in rhythm to Eurasian collared dove. The call of females is deeper and less distinct than the call of males. Taxonomy This species was known for over a century by the scientific name Strix butleri, but a 2015 study demonstrated that the holotype of S. butleri was not actually a member of this species, but was instead most likely an Omani owl (which had been described as a new species, S. omanensis, in 2013). Because the allocation of Strix butleri to the Omani owl left the more widespread species without a name, the authors of the study named it S. hadorami after Israeli ornithologist Hadoram Shirihai, and gave it the new common name desert tawny owl (which has been subsequently shortened to desert owl by some authors).

The original screenplay focuses on the choices young lovers must make as they find themselves surrounded by increasing political unrest in late-1930s Europe. Plot In a prologue set in Paris in the year 1924, a young 14-year-old Gilda Bess√©, the daughter of a French aristocrat and an emotionally unstable American mother, is reluctantly told by a fortune teller that the life line on her palm doesn't extend past the age of 34. Fast forward to a rainy night in 1933, when Gilda stumbles into the room of Guy Malyon, an Irishman who is a first-year scholarship student at Cambridge University. She has had a lover's quarrel with one of the dons, and rather than turn her out into the storm, Guy gallantly allows her to spend the night. Later, they become lovers, but the two are separated when Gilda's mother dies and she opts to leave England. A few years later, Guy sees her as an extra in a Hollywood film, and shortly after he coincidentally receives a letter from her inviting him to visit her in Paris, where she's working as a photographer. Guy discovers that Gilda is living with the Spanish-born nursing student/model Mia and has a lover, whom she quickly discards when Guy moves in. The trio are enjoying their unusual living arrangement, but world events are beginning to affect their existence. It is the height of the Spanish Civil War, and idealistic Guy, a long-time supporter of the army of the Second Spanish Republic, is determined to do what he can to help them as Francisco Franco's nationalists gain strength. Mia, too, is anxious to come to the aid of her native land. Gilda, however, has no interest in politics or anything else that might disrupt her life of luxury, and pleads with the two to ignore the conflict, but they feel compelled to act and depart for Spain. By January 1938, Guy becomes a soldier, while Mia becomes a nurse and tends to the wounded. They cross paths one night and, before sleeping with Guy, Mia confesses she was Gilda's lover. In the morning, her ambulance is destroyed by a land mine resulting in Mia's death as well as the ambulance driver. A few months later in July 1938, Guy returns to Paris, where he is ignored by Gilda, who feels his abandonment of her was a form of betrayal. Six years later, Guy is working as a spy with the underground in occupied Paris under the auspices of British intelligence. He learns that Gilda has taken Nazi Major Franz Bietrich as a lover and visits her in their old apartment, where the two make love. The following morning she tells him their affair is over and the two can never see each other again. D-Day is approaching, and Guy throws himself into his work. One day he arrives at a caf√© to meet a contact, but instead is approached by Gilda, who has overheard her German lover plotting a trap and has come to help him escape in cleric's clothing she has concealed in the restaurant's washroom. That night, he and his associates destroy a rail station, but only Guy manages to elude the German soldiers. Guy returns to London, where he discovers Gilda joined the Resistance a few years earlier. With the occupation of Paris having come to an end, he realizes that the locals, who had long regarded Gilda as a Nazi sympathizer and traitor, will seek revenge. As he returns to Paris to find her, Guy is unaware that Bietrich has been killed in Gilda's apartment and that she has been taken captive by a mob intent on avenging the deaths of their loved ones. She is finally killed, off-camera, by a local youth to avenge the death of his sister. The movie ends with Guy in Gilda's ransacked apartment reading the last letter written by her to him.

In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said, \\"The strength of [Charlize Theron's] go-for-broke performance only underlines the weaknesses of the film . . . [which] plays like an entertaining compilation of Hollywood's favorite World War II clich√©s\\" and added, \\"Could it be that Hollywood's six decades of replaying the Good War has left us with nobility fatigue? At least Head in the Clouds is not the debacle of Charlotte Gray and other epic-manqu√©s. But if World War II is to continue to mean anything anymore, it has to be reimagined as a real event, not a deluxe, romantically spiced-up newsreel.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film \\"is silly and the plot is preposterous, but it labors under no delusions otherwise. It wants to be a hard-panting melodrama, with spies and sex and love and death, and there are times when a movie like this is exactly what you feel like indulging.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego called it \\"a glossy, stiff melodrama . . . a mixture of Casablanca and Cabaret, or possibly Hemingway and Henry Miller, and finally, it doesn't work, in part because the erotic content seems self-conscious and force-fit. In fact, if not for the presence of Charlize Theron, it's hard to imagine this film would have attracted anywhere near the kind of attention it's gotten . . . she's not at all bad, but her role as a young American heiress and libertine feels recycled from scores of other movies.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded it one out of a possible four stars and described it as \\"a World War II melodrama of epic silliness and supreme vapidity . . . This spark-free film has no place to go on [the cast's] resumes except under the heading of Cringing Embarrassment.\\"Rolling Stone review Awards and nominations *Genie Award for Best Achievement in Cinematography (Paul Sarossy, winner) *Genie Award for Best Achievement in Costume Design (Mario Davignon, winner) *Genie Award for Best Achievement in Music - Original Score (Terry Frewer, winner) *Genie Award for Best Achievement in Editing (Dominique Fortin, winner) *Genie Award for Best Achievement in Art Direction/Production Design (Jonathan Lee and Gilles Aird, nominees) *Genie Award for Best Achievement in Overall Sound (Pierre Blain, Michel Descombes, Gavin Fernandes, and Marcel Pothier, nominees) *Genie Award for Best Achievement in Sound Editing (Guy Pelletier, Marcel Pothier, Guy Francoeur, Antoine Morin, and Natalie Fleurant, nominees) *Canadian Society of Cinematographers Award for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature (Sarossy, winner) *Jutra Award for Best Costume Design (Davignon, nominee) *Milan International Film Festival Award for Best Film (winner) ReferencesExternal links *Official website 2004 films 2000s war drama films 2000s historical films 2004 LGBT-related films British films British historical films British romantic drama films British war drama films British LGBT-related films Canadian films Canadian romantic drama films Canadian LGBT-related films Canadian war drama films English-language films Bisexuality-related films Films directed by John Duigan Films set in the 1920s Films set in the 1930s Films set in the 1940s Films set in Paris Films set in London Films set in Spain LGBT-related drama films Spanish Civil War films World War II films Tango films Cultural depictions of Django Reinhardt 2004 drama films ","title":"Head in the Clouds (film)"},{"id":"1343518","text":"Crna or CRNA may refer to: * Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, a medical qualification in the United States * ƒårna na Koro≈°kem, a municipality in Slovenia * cRNA, RNA derived from cDNA through standard RNA synthesis See also *Crna Reka (disambiguation) *Crna Bara (disambiguation) ","title":"Crna"},{"id":"1343524","text":"Hat pin from motorman on the Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee railroad A motorman is a person who operates a tram (streetcar), electrified tram (trolley) car, light rail, or rapid transit train.

Career Cudahy dropped out of school at age 14 and found a job working at Layton and Plankinton, Milwaukee, an area meat packing plant. He worked his way up the ranks and eventually became a private meat inspector. By 1869, Cudahy was a manager in charge of the packing house at Plankinton, Armour and Company, which had been established in Milwaukee in 1852. In 1873, he was made partner in Armour and Company. With the help of his brothers Edward and Patrick, he established the Cudahy Packing Company in South Omaha, Nebraska in 1890. Real estate By the late 19th century, Cudahy had become a wealthy man living a comfortable life. He took an interest in Mackinac Island, Michigan as a summer home. He also owned a home in Hubbard's Annex on the island in the late 19th century, which he later sold to his brother Edward. He then went to California in 1897 and traded in real estate to expand his fortune. He returned to Mackinac Island in 1904 and bought , making him one of the largest landowners on Mackinac Island. In 1908, Cudahy sold his share of the Cudahy Meatpacking Company and acquired a 2,800 acre (11 km¬≤) Rancho San Antonio east of Los Angeles, California. He subdivided the ranch and sold it as one acre (4,000 m¬≤) lots. This area was incorporated in 1960 as the City of Cudahy. Cudahy handpicked renowned architect Frederick Wainwright Perkins to fulfill his visions of a West Bluff mansion. Perkins also designed the Governors Mansion on the island. In 1904, construction was completed on his mansion which he named Stonecliffe which was the largest private home on Mackinac Island. It went through a number of owners after Cudahy's death in 1910. In 1970, Stonecliffe was purchased by an entrepreneur named George Staffan who converted the mansion and associated buildings into a first class resort hotel called The Inn at Stonecliffe in which capacity it continues to function to this day. Personal life In 1866, Cudahy married Catharine Sullivan. The couple had seven children, four boys and three girls. Death On November 27, 1910, Cudahy died of double pneumonia at a Chicago hospital.

It is called Melassich Riwwelboi or Melassichriwwelkuche (molasses crumb cake) in the Pennsylvania Dutch language.  Description  Shoofly pie is a molasses crumb cake baked in a pie crust. The primary ingredients of the filling are molasses, flour, brown sugar, egg, and water. The addition of a pie crust makes it easier for people to hold a piece in the hand while eating it. It comes in two different versions: wet-bottom and dry- bottom. The dry-bottom version is baked until fully set and results in a more cake-like consistency throughout. The wet-bottom version is set like cake at the top where it was mixed in with the crumbs, but the very bottom is a stickier, gooier custard-like consistency. A Montgomery pie is similar to a shoofly pie, except lemon juice is usually added to the bottom layer and buttermilk to the topping. Treacle tart is a pie with a filling made from light treacle.  History  Shoofly pie began as a crust-less molasses cake called Centennial cake in 1876, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. In the 1880s, home bakers added a crust to make it easier to eat alongside a cup of coffee in the morning, without plates and forks. Precursors include Jenny Lind cake, a gingerbread cake from the middle of the 19th century. Because the cake contains molasses but no eggs, historians conclude that it was typically baked during the winter, when chickens laid no eggs but when molasses would store well in the cold weather. The use of baking powder places its invention firmly after the Civil War and in the 1870s, when Pennsylvania Dutch bakers began using baking powder.

In May 2011, TCBY launched Super Fro-Yo, a reformulated version of its yogurt with a more nutrient-rich profile. The company brought down the fat content of its yogurt to below 2 percent, so it can be labeled low fat. On January 10, 2012, TCBY launched a Greek frozen yogurt product. TCBY is the first frozen yogurt chain to offer Greek frozen yogurt. Every year, TCBY offers mothers across the nation a free frozen yogurt on Mother's Day, and fathers a free frozen yogurt on Father's Day. Store giveaway In October 2009, TCBY launched the \\"This Could Be Yours: The Great TCBY Store Giveaway,\\" a contest that rewarded one person with his or her own TCBY store. To enter, contestants submitted a video, no longer than two minutes, explaining why they should be the recipient of their very own TCBY, why their town is the perfect location, and what they have to offer the brand.

Played by horror film mainstay Vincent Price, the character was identifiable by his pale bald head and white and yellow suit. He believes himself to be \\"the world's smartest criminal\\", and his crimes usually have an egg motif to them; he also includes egg-related puns in his speech (\\"egg- zactly\\", \\"egg-cellent\\", etc.). Additionally, he would use a wide assortment of egg-shaped weapons, such as laughing gas eggs and tear gas eggs (laid by chickens on a diet of onions). Background Like many other villains, Egghead was created specifically for the 1966 Batman TV series (e.g., King Tut, Shame, The Siren, Chandell, the Bookworm, and Louie the Lilac). Egghead would go on to be introduced in the comic books. Fictional character biography Egghead was introduced in the second season two-parter, \\"An Egg Grows in Gotham\\" and \\"The Yegg Foes in Gotham,\\" where he schemes with Chief Screaming Chicken (Edward Everett Horton) of the Mohican Indian tribe to revert control of Gotham City to the Chief's people. In return, Egghead would also govern the city and enable the criminal underground to run amok. Their scheme is foiled by Batman (Adam West) and Robin (Burt Ward). Egghead would return three times in the third season with his new partner and love interest Olga, Queen of the Cossacks (Anne Baxter), an exile from Bessarovia. The first two third-season appearances, \\"The Ogg and I\\" and \\"How to Hatch a Dinosaur\\", were actually filmed as one multi-part story, but split into two separate stories (Season 3 episodes 8 and 9) prior to airing. In \\"How to Hatch a Dinosaur,\\" Egghead and Olga plan to hatch an egg of a Neosaurus and later to try to feed Robin and Batgirl to it. It does not work, however, and the Neosaurus -actually Batman in disguise - advances toward Egghead and Olga, causing them to surrender to the police. Egghead and Olga appear for the final time in season three in episode 15, \\"The Ogg Couple\\", in which they steal the Sword of Bulbul and the Egg of Ogg. In \\"The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra,\\" Egghead (alongside Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Catwoman, and King Tut) is freed from prison by Dr. Cassandra Spellcraft and her husband Cabala. Dr. Spellcraft promises Egghead control over the poultry farms when she takes over Gotham City, even giving him and the other villains her camouflage pills to assist in their crime spree. Egghead is one of only two Batman 1960s series villains to deduce Batman's secret identity (and the only one to do so through deductive reasoning instead of trickery). Reasoning that the enormous \\"egg-spense\\" involved in producing Batman's various gadgets would point to only one of three Gotham City millionaires, and deducing that two could not be the Caped Crusader (one has a French accent, which Batman does not have, and the other is left-handed, whereas Batman is right-handed), he concludes that the last, Bruce Wayne, must be Batman. In other media=Television Egghead as portrayed by Vincent Price * Egghead debuts in the 1960's Batman TV series portrayed by Vincent Price. * Egghead can be seen in Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Day of the Dark Knight!\\" as a convict trying to escape Iron Heights Penitentiary, but was stopped by Batman and Green Arrow, among other villains from the show and the Adam West series. Film * According to Batman Forever and Batman & Robin director Joel Schumacher, Egghead was one of the lead choices considered by Mark Protosevich to be the main antagonist of his cancelled fifth Batman film Batman Unchained, alongside King Tut, the Mad Hatter and the Scarecrow. * In the animated film Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders (which is an adaptation of the 1960s TV show), Egghead appears among other criminals during the climax after Robin and Catwoman free Egghead and the other villains from Gotham City Penitentiary. He is seen fighting Batman and his duplicates by using egg-like bombs. * In Team StarKid's comedy musical Holy Musical B@man, Egghead makes a minor appearance, stealing all the chickens from Gotham City, hoping to see its citizens suffer from a lack of eggs. He is almost immediately defeated by Batman and Robin. * Egghead briefly appears in The Lego Batman Movie, but his voice actor is uncredited. He is seen tossing eggs at his opponents and laughing similarly to Vincent Price at the time when he was among the villains assisting in Joker's attack on Gotham City. Egghead later appears using an egg-shaped mech to fight off the Phantom Zone inmates. * Egghead is seen in Batman vs. Two-Face. He appears as one of the super-criminals that Hugo Strange and Harleen Quinzel are attempting to treat. Comics * A bald criminal called Egg-Head appeared in Detective Comics #63 (May 1942). He is a flunky in the employ of Mr. Baffle, a criminal said to rival Batman in intelligence. Baffle's other henchman is a bespectacled criminal called Fish. Readers were asked to write in if they would like to see more of Mr. Baffle. Apparently, they did not, because neither he nor his henchmen ever appeared again. * Egghead has rarely made cameo appearances in other Batman media outside of the 1960s series. He can be seen in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #3-4 as an inmate of Arkham Asylum, battling Batman gladiator-style after being set free from his cell by Jeremiah Arkham. * He is also featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold issue #16. In this issue, his real name is given as Edgar Heed and he seeks to awaken Egg Fu. * Egghead appears in Batman '66 where the comic series is supposed to take place in the same continuity as the original series. He appears in issue #3, in the story \\"The Joker Sees Red\\", in which he is an inmate of Arkham Asylum. Later on in the same issue, he appears in the story \\"Scrambled Eggs.\\" He is depicted as the ancestor of Universo in the one-shot Batman '66 Meets the Legion of Super-Heroes. * He appears as Professor Egghead in Gotham Academy #14. * In the DC Rebirth reboot, Egghead is mentioned by Copperhead and Cheshire as one of the many villains whom Two-Face has enlisted to make failed attempts on Batman's life.All-Star Batman #2/ DC Comics.

Over 3,000 years old, the site contains the remains of a port city founded by the Philistines in the 12th century BC. It is located near the Yarkon River, on the grounds of the Eretz Israel Museum. History Residential quarter, Tel Qasile In 1815, after excavating the ruins of ancient Ashkelon, Lady Hester Stanhope proposed a dig at a site called el-Khurby located 12 miles northeast of Jaffa on the banks of the Awgy River (today the Yarkon River). Stanhope's companion observed that ‚Äúthere were many proofs that this district was once highly populous.‚ÄùRestoring the Reputation of Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope, Neil Asher Silberman, BAR 10:04, Jul/Aug 1984 Modern excavation of the site commenced in 1948 under Benjamin Mazar, who received the first archaeological exploration permit issued by the nascent state of Israel. The excavations revealed the gradual development of the Philistine city over 150 years, from its founding (Level XII) to the peak of its growth (Level X) at the end of the 11th century BC. Archaeological findings The sacred area of the Philistine city was unearthed to reveal three temples, built one on top of the other. The temples were constructed with walls of sun-dried mud bricks covered with light-colored plaster. Low benches were built along the length of the walls. Many offering and cult vessels were found on the floors, concentrated mainly around the \\"bamah\\" and in the storage alcoves of the temples. A residential block was found on the north side of the street, while in the south side workshops and storehouses were unearthed. The houses were built to a standard plan - they were square, with an area of approximately 100 square meters per apartment. Each apartment comprised two rectangular rooms with a courtyard separating them. Islamic Khan Excavations in the 1980s revealed a large courtyard building, dating from the Abbasid era.Petersen, 2001, p. 291 The building has been dated by its excavators to a period between the ninth and eleventh century, though both earlier (Umayyad) and later (Crusader) occupations of the site were found. The design of the building and its position (at a river crossing point), indicate that it was a khan. Only the northern part of the building was excavated, the rest only visible as robber trenches.robber trench From the excavated parts, it is estimated that the building was 28 meters square. A paved entrance in the middle of the north wall led to a courtyard, paved with gravel. The courtyard had arcades on the east and west sides, supported by columns. In the north-west corner of the courtyard were the remains of a staircase. Several small rooms, lining the courtyard, were exposed.

He was one of the sovereigns who bore the title \\"Kulottunga\\", literally meaning \\"the exalter of his race\\" in Tamil. He did not belong to the main line of Cholas but was rather a prince of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty. His mother, Ammangaidevi, was a Chola princess and the daughter of emperor Rajendra Chola I. His father was king Rajaraja Narendra of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty who was the nephew of Rajendra Chola I and maternal grandson of Rajaraja Chola I. According to historian Sailendra Nath Sen, his accession marked the beginning of a new era and ushered in a period of internal peace and benevolent administration. Kulottunga had diplomatic relations with the north Indian city Kanauj and also with distant countries like Cambodia, Sri Vijaya, Khmer empire, kingdom of Pagan (Burma) and China. He established Chola overlordship over the Sri Vijaya province Kedah in Malaysia.Singapore in Global History by Derek Thiam Soon Heng, Syed Muhd Khairudin Aljunied p.40 An inscription in a Taoist temple in Guangzhou, dated to 1079 CE, declares Kulottunga, King of Chulien (Chola) to be the supreme chief of the Land of San-fo-tsi (Sri Vijaya). According to Tan Yeok Seong, the editor of the inscription, Kulottunga ruled both the Chola and Sri Vijayan kingdoms. In the small Leyden grant that is dated to 1090 CE, the king of Kadaram (Sri Vijaya) is mentioned as a vassal of Kulottunga.. Like his predecessors, Kulottunga was a patron of arts and literature and the much celebrated Tamil poem Kalingattuparani, attributed to poet Jayamkondar, was composed during his rule.A History of Indian Literature, 500-1399: From Courtly to the Popular by Sisir Kumar Das p.209 His records also testify to the highly organised system of fiscal and local administration. During his reign Kulottunga carried out a massive land survey that formed the basis for taxation.The Cambridge Shorter History of India p.191Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern by Raj Kumar p.116 According to historian Nilakanta Sastri, Kulottunga avoided unnecessary wars and evinced a true regard for the well-being of his subjects. He had a long and prosperous reign characterized by unparalleled success that laid the foundation for the well being of the empire for the next 150 years. Birth and early life An artist's impression: Kulottunga Chola instructs the surveyors CE. 1086 Kulottunga was born under the star of Pusya. The details of the king's family and parentage are available from a number of grants and plates like the one from Chellur (a village in Kakinada Taluq of East Godavari district) that was issued by his son, prince Vira Chola, and from literary works, such as the famous poem Kalingattupparani. Kulottunga was the maternal grandson of Emperor Rajendra Chola I through the latter's daughter Ammangadevi.Gazetteer of the Nellore District: Brought Up to 1938 by the Government Of Madras p.38History of Tamilakam. Darkness at horizon by T. V. Kuppuswamy (Prof.), Shripad Dattatraya Kulkarni, Shri Bhagavan Vedavyasa Itihasa Samshodhana Mandira p.325 His father was the Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja Narendra who himself was the son of Kundavai, the younger sister of Rajendra Chola I and the daughter of Rajaraja Chola I. Rajaraja Narendra married princess Ammangadevi, the daughter of his maternal uncle, Rajendra Chola I of the solar race. The latter is described as \\"the ornament of the race of the sun\\" in the Chellur plates of Vira Chola. The poem Kalingattuparani gives the details of Kulottunga's birth in the canto \\"Avataram\\" (incarnation), wherein his mother is described as belonging to the solar race and his father to the lunar race. Kulottunga is described as an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu in the canto. An excerpt from the poem reads: > Vishnu appeared again in the royal womb of the queen of him of the race of > the moon which dispels all darkness, ... Rajaraja's gracious Lakshmi (queen) > who was of the rival race of the sun. As a Chola prince he conquered the Sri Vijaya province Kedah and Chakrakota province (Bastar-Kalahandi district-Koraput region) on behalf of his maternal uncle, emperor Virarajendra Chola, in the 11th century.Ancient India: Collected Essays on the Literary and Political History of southern India by Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar p.131Dimensions of Human Cultures in Central India: by Professor S.K. Tiwari p.163Tribal Roots of Hinduism by Shiv Kumar Tiwari p.209 Accession According to the Tamil poem Kalingattuparani, Kulottunga was brought up in the court of Rajendra Chola I in Gangaikondacholapuram. During his youth, Kulottunga participated in many wars, serving alongside both Rajendra Chola I and his successors, Rajadhiraja I, Rajendra Chola II and Virarajendra Chola. During this period, he engaged in the northern campaigns of the empire in and around Sakkarakottam and Vayiragaram where he secured several victories and proved his mettle in warfare. The Sakkarakottam area is identified with the present day Bastar- Kalahandi district-Koraput region which together formed the Chakrakota province back in medieval times. According to Kalingattuparani, it was around this time that Mannar-Mannavan, that is, the \\"king of kings\\", suddenly died and the empire was thrown into a state of anarchy until Abhaya, that is Kulottunga, returned and restored order. The Teki, Chellur and Pithapuram grants of Kulottunga's sons, dated in the 17th, 21st and 23rd years of the king's reign, state that in the absence of the king's father, Rajaraja Narendra, Kulottunga was first crowned as the lord of Vengi where he obtained great fame. As per the plates. the king was later crowned in the Chola Rajya, a position said to be not less exalted than Devendra (Indra). These events are narrated as a flashback story in the Chellur grant, wherein Kulottunga explains to his son, prince Vira Chola, that he left Vengi to his (Kulottunga's) paternal uncle (Vijayaditya) as he (Kulottunga) desired the Chola kingdom. Other sources like Vikramankadevacharita, a work on the western Chalukya Vikramaditya VI by his court poet Bilhana, and Vikraman Solan Ula, a work on Kulottunga's son and successor Vikrama Chola by poet Ottakoothar, corroborate these events more or less and both works agree that there was a king between Virarajendra Chola and Kulottunga. This king has been identified with Adhirajendra and it is after the death of this Chola king that the kingdom was thrown into a state of anarchy. According to Vikramankadevacharita, Kulottunga got dislodged from Vengi due to some confusion in the Chola kingdom after the death of Virarajendra Chola. Even during the time of Virarajendra Chola, Vikramaditya VI and the Eastern Ganga king Rajaraja Devendravarman both supported Vijayaditya, the paternal uncle of Kulottunga, in his claim to the Vengi kingdom. Kulottunga is then said to have marched south to the Chola capital. Bilhana goes on to state that his patron, Vikramaditya VI, tried stopping Kulottunga from ascending the Chola throne by instead installing Adhirajendra (Vikramaditya's brother-in-law) as king. However this arrangement was short-lived and Kulottunga eventually succeeded in capturing the throne. Historian Nilakanta Sastri argues against the theories proposed by Fleet and other similar historians, about a hostile invasion of the Chola empire by Kulottunga. In Sastri's words, \\"the work Vikramankadevacarita does not contain the remotest suggestion that Kulottunga put his rivals out of the way by secret murder or even by open fighting\\". Kulottunga's own inscriptions also speak of the lack of leadership in the Chola country at the time of his ascension and in his records the king claims that he rightfully inherited the excellent crown of the Cholas. The king's epigraphs poetically claim that he ascended the throne to prevent the goddess Lakshmi of Southern region from becoming common property (an allusion to the illegitimate claims to the throne and meddling of affairs by kings of rival kingdoms), and to remove the loneliness of the goddess of the Chola country adorned by river Ponni (an allusion to the power vacuum in the empire). Thus it was under these circumstances that Kulottunga ascended the Chola throne in 1070 CE and established himself by soon overcoming the threats to the Chola Empire. According to Sastri, Kulottunga was in his teens or barely into his twenties when he ascended the throne. Military campaigns= Sakkarakottam  When Kulottunga was still a prince, he participated in many of the northern campaigns of his predecessor Virarajendra Chola. In the fifth year of his reign Virarajendra Chola dispatched his army to Kalinga and beyond it to Sakkarakottam. These expeditions appear to have been led by Kulottunga, who in his inscriptions claims that while he was still heir-apparent, he overcame the treachery of his enemies and by the strength of his arm and sword captured herds of elephants at Vayiragaram, conquered Sakkarakottam and graciously took tribute from the king of Dhara. Vayiragaram is identified with Wairagarh, a few miles off Bastar in the Chanda district and Sakkarakottam is the area in and around Bastar-Kalahandi-Koraput region which was called as the Chakrakota mandala in medieval times. Dhara is the Nagavanshi king Dharavarsha who was the ruler of Sakkarakottam during this period. The \\"treachery\\" that Kulottunga speaks of is an allusion to the internal politics of the empire and the schemes of his rivals who sought to deny him his rightful inheritance. According to Sastri, in spite of these setbacks, Kulottunga was successful in carving out a small principality for himself, north of Vengi, for Kulottunga claims that he gently raised the goddess of the earth residing in the \\"Land of the rising sun\\" and placed her under the shade of his parasol just like god Vishnu, who in his Varaha avatar lifted the earth. Western Chalukya conflicts The Western Chalukya-Chola rivalry goes back to the beginning of the 10th century. The Western Chalukyas waged many wars with the Chola emperors and on each occasion the wars ended with the Cholas chasing their rivals, the Chalukyas, out of the battlefield, occupying their capital, with death of their generals or feudatories and levying tribute. Tailapa II and his son Satyashraya, who were opponents of Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I, ended up being defeated at Annigeri and at Kogali respectively, Jayasimha was defeated in Kadambalige, Ahavamalla Someshwara I suffered defeats many a time at the hands of Rajadhiraja Chola, and lost his brother Jayasingan in battle with Rajendra Chola II. Kudala sangama, the site of many a battle between the Cholas and Chalukyas during the period of Virarajendra Chola After Rajadhiraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II, their brother Virarajendra Chola defeated Ahavamalla Someshwara I on not less than five occasions. Virarajendra Chola also put to flight the latter's two sons, Vikkalan (Vikramaditya VI) and Singanan (Jayasimha III), multiple times in the battles of Kudala sangama. Virarajendra Chola also defeated the eldest son of Ahavamalla Someshwara I, and crown-prince Someshwara II in Kampili, and spoiled his coronation ceremony. Ahavamalla Someshwara I seems to have died in the reign of Virarajendra Chola as there is no mention of him in Kulottunga's records. This is evident from a record of Virarajendra Chola, who in his fifth year states that unable to bear the disgrace of his earlier defeats, Ahavamalla Someshwara I wrote a letter to the Chola calling for war, but in the end never showed up and instead fled and plunged himself into the ocean. This is conceded in Bilhana's Vikramakadevacarita, a work on the life of Vikramaditya VI who claims that Ahavamalla Someshwara I died around this time by committing ritual suicide by drowning himself in the Tungabhadra. Upon his father's death, Vikramaditya VI approached Virarajendra and sued for peace and the Chola agreed as he saw in him an ally to counter and nullify the crown-prince Someshvara II. Accordingly, the Chola offered his daughter's hand in marriage, bestowed upon him the Rattapadi-seven-and-a-half-lakh country and made him the Vallabha (Chalukyan king). Vikramaditya readily accepted the deal for he had his own plans to overthrow his elder brother, which he would eventually accomplish and then usurp the throne. There was also another contender, Vijayaditya, on whom Virarajendra had bestowed Vengi towards the end of his reign. Some historians identify this Vijayaditya with the Eastern Chalukyan prince and half-brother of Rajaraja Narendra while others like Venkayya suggest that this person was yet another younger brother of Vikramaditya VI. That this Vijayaditya was an ally of Vikramaditya VI is evident from an inscription of Rajadhiraja Chola I. So at the end of Virarajendra's reign, Kulottunga found himself facing Vikkalan (Vikramaditya VI), the latter's younger brother Singanan (Jayasimha), their elder brother Someshwara II and their younger brother or ally Vijayaditya. It was clear from the time Kulottunga ascended the throne that a confrontation with the Western Chalukyas was imminent as Vikramaditya VI could never accept the union of the Chola and Vengi kingdoms under the same ruler, let alone Kulottunga's accession, for it simply meant an enemy too powerful. Kulottunga knew this from the very beginning and accordingly made preparations for the showdown. In 1075-76 CE, the war began with the incursion of the Chalukyan forces into the Chola territories and the two armies met in the Kolar district. What followed was the Chola counter-attack popularly known as the Nangili episode. In the ensuing battle, the Chalukyan army was completely routed and chased by the Chola forces from the rocky roads of Nangili all the way to the Tungabhadra via Manalur. Vikramaditya is said to have retreated hastily and fled, leaving behind the corpses of his dead elephants along the way. Kulottunga captured a thousand elephants at Navilai and conquered two provinces the Gangamandalam (the province of the Western Ganga dynasty) and Singanam as a direct result of this war. Navilai has been identified with Navale-nadu in the Mysore district, and Singanam referred to the region of Jayasimha, the younger brother of Vikramaditya VI. The word Konkana desam (country of Konkan) is substituted for the word Singanam in some of the records. Kulottunga, in his records, claims that at the end of this war, he broke the pride of Vikramaditya VI and that Vikkalan (Vikramaditya VI) and Singanan (Jayasimha) had nowhere to retreat except to plunge into the western ocean. Some other records of Kulottunga state that Vikramaditya VI fled back to his own dominion (north of the Tungabhadra), his pride broken, and that he (Vikramaditya VI) was happy to be there as the Chalukya did not go to war with the Chola for a long time. This is conceded by Bilhana in the Vikramankadevacarita, wherein he states that after these initial wars, there was a long period of peace (about half a century) between the two kingdoms. Towards the end of Kulottunga's reign, Vikramaditya VI occupied Vengi for a short while when Vikrama Chola left south for the latter's coronation. Vikrama Chola re-acquired these territories a few years after his ascension. Pandya and Chera campaigns Map of the Pearl Fishery Coast, on the southeast portion of the Indian peninsula. Corrections by M. G. S. Narayanan on K. A. Nilakanta Sastri are employed. Once he finished dealing with Vikramaditya VI, Kulottunga turned his attention to the south and first took up the cause of bringing the ancient Pandimandalam, the country of the Pandyas, into his fold. The Pandya country never reconciled to the Chola overlordship and its rulers were a constant source of trouble for the Chola emperors. The Pandyas made use of the confusion in the Chola country during the accession of Kulottunga and tried once again to reassert their independence. Back in the days of Rajendra Chola I, the Pandya country was ruled over by Chola-Pandya viceroys, but by the time of Kulottunga, this system had ceased to exist and \\"Five Pandya\\" princes from the old line rose against the king. Kulottunga could not take this situation lightly as the loss of the Pandya territories meant a serious threat to the existence of the Chola kingdom itself. As soon as the Chalukyan war ended, Kulottunga turned all his energy to the suppression of the revolts in the Pandya territory (c. 1077-1081 AD).Corrections to K. A. Nilakanta Sastri by M. G. S. Narayanan point out that Kulottunga oversaw only one expedition to the Chera Perumal kingdom (in c. 1097). Sastri had assumed that Kulottunga led two military thrusts to south Kerala in c. 1077-1081 and in c. 1097 (see, M. G. S Narayanan, PerumƒÅ·∏∑s of Kerala. Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 125-28.) According to the Cholapuram inscription (1100 AD) the Cholas marched south with a huge army, conquered the Pandya country, the forests were the Five Pandya entered as refugees, the Pearl Fisheries, the Podiyil and Sahya Mountains, and Kanya Kumari and fixed the boundaries of the South Country (the Pandya country) at Kottar. Another inscription of his, in Sanskrit (undated) from Chidambaram, gives a similar account, where the king is said to have overcome the Five Pandyas with the help of a huge army, burnt down the fort at Kottar, and erected a pillar of victory at Kanya Kumari (and thus making the rebel vassal kings obedient).M. G. S Narayanan, PerumƒÅ·∏∑s of Kerala. Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 125-28. Podiyil Mountains (conquered by Kulottunga around 1077-81 AD) Kulottunga's south Kerala campaign is now dated c. 1097 CE (it was initially assumed that the 1077-81 campaign also covered the rebelling Keralas). The Chera Perumal kings, who like their Pandyan neighbours, had followed suit and rebelled against their Chola overlords. Naralokavira Kalinga Rayan, a commander of the Pandya-Chola forces, lead a Chola thrust into southern Kerala and conquered the Chera country up to the port of Quilon (c. 1097 CE, \\"subdued the numerous forces of the Keralas\\"). A record of Jatavarman Srivallabha Pandya (dated to 1101 AD) praises his overlord Kulottunga as the \\"Conqueror of Quilon\\". Kantalur Salai and Vizhinjam, located in ancient Ay country and under the influence of the Cheras, also came under the Chola rule. It seems that the Chera Perumals managed to recover the Kollam-Trivandrum- Nagercoil region around 1100/02 CE. According to the Cholapuram record (1100 AD), the eventual southern boundary of the Chola influence was located at Kottar (\\"fixing of the boundaries of the southern country\\"). The Kollam- Trivandrum-Nagercoil region was later (c. 1102-1118 AD) reconquered by Jatavarman Parakrama Pandya for his overlord Vikrama Chola. By c. 1100 CE, Kulottunga had successfully subjugated rebelling southern regions as far as the Pandya country, annexed the Pearl Fishery Coast, the ancient Podiyil mountains (in present-day Tirunelveli), and \\"fixed his southern boundary\\" at Kottar. He did away with the old system of appointing Chola-Pandya viceroys and instead built multiple cantonments as far south as Kottar, and heavily garrisoned the strategically important locations of the southern dominions. These units were in charge of protecting his interests and collecting tribute but did not interfere with the internal administration of the conquered territories, a responsibility which he left to the native chiefs and feudatories. His inscriptions belonging to this period are found in Cholapuram, Agastheeswaram, Suchindram, Variyur, Kanyakumari and Kottar. Vengi The Vengi kingdom was a bone of contention between the Cholas, the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani and the Eastern Gangas from the times of Rajaraja Chola I. It was a site for proxy war during the times of Virarajendra Chola, who managed to wrest control of it from the Western Chalukyas and bestowed it on Vijayaditya, the paternal uncle of Kulottunga. It is unclear as to why Kulottunga was overlooked in the accession of Vengi as he would have been the rightful heir. On the other hand, it is of interest to note that Vijayaditya had briefly sided with Rajaraja Devendravarman of the Eastern Gangas. So, Virarajendra Chola agreed to bestow the Vengi kingdom on Kulottunga's paternal uncle Vijayaditya to avoid fighting wars on two fronts, that is, to avoid engaging both the Western Chalukyas and the Eastern Gangas. In any case, Kulottunga was generous enough to let his paternal uncle, the usurper Vijayaditya, to rule over Vengi even after he ascended the Chola throne. During this period in 1073 CE, the Vengi kingdom was invaded by the Kalachuri king Yakshakarna of Tripuri. However, this was merely a raid in search of riches rather than an invasion for territorial gains, and the intruders were repulsed by Vijayaditya. After the death of Vijayaditya in 1077, Kulottunga brought the Vengi province directly under his control and appointed his sons to rule over it. Rajaraja Chodaganga, the eldest son of Kulottunga, was first appointed as viceroy but as per inscriptions, the prince did not feel at home and returned to the Chola dominions in the south within a year. According to the Teki plates of Rajaraja Chodaganga, the Vengi province under him lay between Manneru in the Nellore district in the south and Mahendragiri in Ganjam district in the north. Rajaraja Chodaganga was followed by his brother Vira Chola who ruled for six years until 1084. The Chellur plates of Vira Chola state that he was crowned in the city of Jagannatha (Jagannatha-nagari). The two princes once again governed the Vengi province alternately for a period of five years and four years respectively. They were then followed by their brother Vikrama Chola who ruled over the region until he was made heir apparent in 1118 CE. According to the Pithapuram pillar inscription of Mallapadeva, dated 1202 CE, the Vengi province became devoid of a ruler and fell into a state of anarchy when Vikrama Chola left for the Chola dominions in the south towards the end of Kulottunga's reign. Vikramaditya VI used this opportunity to occupy Vengi during this period. However, this invasion was short lived and Vikrama Chola recaptured the province and annexed it to the Chola empire as soon as he ascended the throne.

This region comprised the whole of present- day Odisha and northern part of Andhra Pradesh. These three regions together were referred to as Trikalinga. The Kalinga kingdom bordered the northern part of Vengi and therefore it was only natural for the different rulers of Kalinga to try and expand into the Eastern Chalukya territory or in the case of Kulottunga, the northern-eastern part of the Chola dominions. During the 11th century, the Kalinga kingdom was ruled by the Eastern Ganga dynasty who invariably became involved in Vengi and thereby indirectly in the Chola politics. The records of Kulottunga contain descriptions of two Kalinga wars. The first war seems to have occurred before 1096 CE as Kulottunga first claims to have conquered Kalinga in a record dated in the 26th year of his reign. From the brief nature of the description regarding the first war, this expedition seems to have occurred during Kulottunga's youth. The king himself is said to have left the throne, crossed Vengi in the north, and set fire to Kalinga after destroying a number of chiefs. The first Kalinga war seems to have been brought about by Kalinga's aggression against Vengi. The war resulted in the annexation of the southern part of Kalinga to the Chola kingdom. This is evident from the Teki plates of Kulottunga's son, Rajaraja Chodaganga, whose dominions included the region up to Mahendragiri in the Ganjam district in the north. The second invasion took place a few years later, sometime before the 33rd year of the king's reign, and is the subject of the Kalingattuparani. This expedition was led by his general Karunakara Tondaiman who defeated the Kalinga ruler Anantavarman Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Anantavarman was the son of Rajaraja Devendravarman and Chola princess Rajasundari, described as the daughter of Rajendra Chola. The identification of Anantavarman's maternal grandfather is a controversial topic. Some historians like Sastri identify this Rajendra Chola with Virarajendra Chola while others like Kielhorn identify this king as Kulottunga. According to the poem Kalingattuparani, this relationship did not stop Kulottunga from invading Kalinga and causing Anantavarman to flee. The Chola army is said to have returned with vast booty from this campaign. This fact is also borne out by an inscription of the king from the Bhimesvara temple in Draksharama. It is dated in the 33rd year of the king's reign and states that an officer of the king, titled variously as Pallavaraja and Vanduvaraja, reduced the whole of Kalinga to ashes, destroyed the Ganga Devendravarman in battle with the aid of the Kosala army, and planted a pillar of victory in the Odra frontier so as to raise aloft the fame of his king, Kulottunga Chola. This chief is none other than Karunakara Tondaiman as he is said to be from Tirunaraiyur nadu and the lord of Vandai as in the poem. His personal name is given as Tiruvarangan and is said to be the son of Sirilango of Vandalanjeri in Tirunaraiyur nadu. He is described as a sad-vaishnava (good vaishnavite) and is said to have built a Vishnu temple made of black stone in Alavely. According to the poem, the reason for the second war was a response to the default of Kalinga in its payment of annual tributes to Kulottunga by Anantavarman. Another view, by some historians like Venkayya is that, Kulottunga took up the expedition in order to help his relative Anantavarman against North Kalinga rebels. Yet another view is that, Devendravarman belonged to a collateral line of the Eastern Ganga dynasty and had opposed the accession of Kulottunga's relative Anantvarman. There is an inscription of Kulottunga from the Bhimesvara temple in Godavari district that describes a gift by the son of Anantavarmadeva. So it would seem that the latter was a vassal or at least in friendly terms with Kulottunga for sometime. Sri Lanka  Polonnaruwa Velakkara Inscription (Tamil and Sanskrit) According to the Mahavamsa, the Cholas were driven out of Lanka in the 15th year of Vijayabahu which coincides with the accession date of Kulottunga. Therefore, it would seem that the Sinhalese king took the opportunity to attack the Chola forces in the island nation at a time when the kingdom under Kulottunga was dealing with multiple revolts and attacks in the mainland. In 1070 CE, Vijayabahu attacked the Chola forces from his enclave in the Rohana district and defeated them. He sent two armies, one from Mahanagakula via Dakkinadesa, and the other via the well known route along Mahavali-Ganga. These armies defeated the Chola forces or what was left of them and captured Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. After his victory over the Cholas, Vijayabahu got himself anointed in Anuradhapura. A few months later he moved to Polonnaruwa, renamed it as Vijayarajapura, made it his capital, and declared himself king of the island nation. Unlike the epigraphs of his predecessors, like Rajaraja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I and Rajadhiraja Chola I, that describe the details of their expeditions to the island nation, Kulottunga's inscriptions are generally silent in regards to Lanka or with regards to any campaigns or wars against the Sinhalese rulers. According to Sastri, Kulottunga was content with keeping the Chola empire from disintegrating on the mainland and was not that affected with the loss of the island nation. It is of interest to note that Vijayabahu married Lilavati, the daughter of Jagatipala, a former ruler of Rohana, after she escaped from the Cholas and returned to the island kingdom. Jagatipala was originally a prince of Ayodhya who had migrated to Lanka and become ruler of Rohana. He was slain on the battlefield during the Lankan expeditions of Kulottunga's predecessor, Rajadhiraja Chola I, when the Sinhalese kingdom lost four crowns in quick succession. At that time, this princess along with her aunt or mother was taken captive by the Chola forces. These events are described in great detail in the Mahavamsa and in an inscription of Rajadhiraja Chola I. Overseas contacts Srivijaya empire around 8th century Kulottunga maintained overseas contacts with kingdoms of Sri Vijaya, China and Khmer Empire. The renaming of the famous harbor of Visakhapattanam in Andhra Pradesh as Kulottungacolapattanam also indicates his interest in trade with foreign countries across the Bay of Bengal. In 1077 CE, king Chulien (Chola) Ti-hua-kialo sent an embassy to Chinese court for promoting trade. Sastri identifies this Chola ruler with Kulottunga. This trading venture seems to have ended profitably for the Cholas and they returned with over 81,000 strings of copper cash and many more valuables. The Khmer king Suryavarman II, builder of the famous Angkor Wat, sent a mission to the Chola dynasty and presented a precious stone to Kulottunga in 1114 CE.A History of India Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund p.125 According to Burmese accounts, Kyanzittha, the ruler of Pagan (Burma) met with the Chola royal family by sending an ambassador to the Chola emperor. In an inscription in Pagan, he even claims to have converted the Chola to Buddhism through a personal letter written on gold foils. There is also evidence to suggest that Kulottunga, in his youth (1063 CE), was in Sri Vijaya, restoring order and maintaining Chola influence in that area. Virarajendra Chola states in his inscription, dated in the 7th year of his reign, that he conquered Kadaram and gave it back to its king who came and worshiped his feet. These expeditions were led by Kulottunga to help the Sailendra king who had sought the help of Virarajendra Chola. An inscription of Canton mentions Ti-hua-kialo as the ruler of Sri Vijaya. According to historians, this ruler is the same as the Chola ruler Ti-hua-kialo (identified with Kulottunga) mentioned in the Song annals and who sent an embassy to China. According to Tan Yeok Song, the editor of the Sri Vijayan inscription of Canton, Kulottunga stayed in Kadaram after the naval expedition of 1067 CE and reinstalled its king before returning to South India and ascending the throne. Trade relations and cultural contacts established during the reigns of Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I were actively maintained by Kulottunga and his successors. In 1089 CE, the ruler of Sri Vijaya sent two ambassadors to Kulottunga's court, requesting him to renew the old grants to the Buddhist monastery (Chulamani Vihara) in Nagapattinam that was built during the period of Rajaraja Chola I. Extent of the empire The Chola kingdom remained formidable under Kulottunga in his 45th regnal year (c. 1115 CE). Except for the loose hold over Lanka, the rest of the empire remained intact. The boundary between the Cholas and the Western Chalukyas was as always the Tungabhadra river. The hold over Vengi was quite firm, and Dakkina Kosala (south-west Kalinga) and some parts of Kalinga (proper) including the capital Kalinganagara, the modern Mukhalingam in the Srikakulam district, was under the Chola rule. Port Quilon, on the Malabar Coast, was recovered by prince Vikrama Chola sometime between c. 1102 and c. 1118 CE. Towards the end of Kulottunga's reign, when his son Vikrama Chola, the viceroy of Vengi left south for the latter's coronation, the northern half of the Vengi kingdom seems to have slipped from his hands and gone to the Western Chalukyan empire under Vikramaditya VI. According to some historians, during this period, Kulottunga also lost the province of Gangavadi, the province of the Western Gangas, to Hoysala Vishnuvardhana. The latter seems to have attacked and defeated the Chola Viceroy, Adigaiman, the controller of the Kongu and Kannada country.  Administration  Ruins of the ancient city of Gangaikondacholapuram Kulottunga's capital was Gangaikondacholapuram. Kanchi was next in importance and had a palace and an \\"abhisheka mandapam\\" (royal bathing hall) from where the king issued many of his charters. The king's inscriptions speak of a highly organized form of fiscal and local administration. He carried out a massive land survey which formed the basis for taxation. He promoted free trade by abolishing tolls or transit duties and came to be known as \\"Sungamtavirrton\\", that is, \\"one who abolished tolls\\". Kulottunga did away with the old system of appointing Chola- Pandya viceroys in the southern territories. The king, instead built military cantonments that were in charge of protecting his interests and collecting tribute, but did not interfere with the internal administration of the conquered territories, a responsibility which he left to the native chiefs and feudatories. Kulottunga was ably assisted in his campaigns and internal administration by his officials some of whom were; Karunakara Tondaiman, described as the minister and warrior of Abhaya; Solakon who distinguished himself in the campaigns in the west against the Kongas, Gangas and Mahrattas; the Brahmin Kannan of great fortress; Vanan (possibly the Bana Vanakovaraiyan also called Suttamallan Mudikondan) who is said to be dexterous in the use of his beautiful bow in battle; the general Naralokaviran alias Kalingar-kon who distinguished himself in the Pandya and south Kerala wars; Kadava: Vailava, the lord of Chedi (Malayaman) country; Senapati (General) Anantapala; the Irungovel chieftain, Adavallan Gangaikonda Cholan alias Irungolan; the royal secretary (\\"Tirumandira-olai\\"), Arumoli-Vilupparaiyar; and the accountant, Arumoli-Porkari. Gonka I, a vassal from the Velanati Chodas family was greatly responsible for the political stability of the Chola power in the Vengi region.Social and Cultural Life in Medieval Andhra by M. Krishna Kumari p.11 In appreciation of his services, the emperor conferred on Gonka I the lordship over 6000 villages on the southern bank of the Krishna River. Personal life Kulottunga's chief queen was Dinachintamani, others being Elisaivallabhi and Tyagavalli. Copper-plate grants state that Kulottunga married Madurantaki, the daughter of Rajendradeva of the Solar race, and had by her seven sons. According to some historians, she is identical with Dinachintamani. She seems to have died sometime before the thirtieth year of Kulottunga. Thyagavalli took the place of the chief queen upon Dinachintamani's demise. The poem Kalingattupparani mentions Tyagavalli together with Elisai Vallabhi (also known as Elulagudayal). It also states that Thyagavalli enjoyed equal authority with the king. Another queen, called SolakulavalliyƒÅr, is also mentioned in inscriptions. She was instrumental in renewing the grant of Anaimangalam in favour of the Buddhist Chulamani Vihara at Nagapattinam. He also seems to have married a Pallava princess called Kadavan-Mahadevi. Epigraphs mention three of his sons, Rajaraja Chodaganga, Vira Chola and Vikrama Chola, of which Rajaraja was the eldest. Religious attitude The empire under Kulottunga was secular in nature and the king encouraged both Saivism and Vaishnavism. The king and his family members continued to make endowments to the Nataraja Temple in Chidambaram. He was tolerant towards other religions, like Buddhism, and renewed the grants made to the Chulamani Vihanra, the Buddhist monastery at Nagapattinam.A History of India by Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund p.125 Historians dispute the identification of Krimikanta Chola, the persecutor of Vaishnavite acharya Ramanuja, with Kulottunga. One of the reasons for this disagreement is because, Ramanuja is said to have returned to the Chola kingdom from Hoysala Vishnuvardhana's court after an exile of 12 years (upon the Chola king's death), whereas Kulottunga ruled for 52 years. Some scholars are of the opinion that Kulottunga was secular through his early and middle years and persecuted Vaishnavites towards the end of his reign, succumbing to Saivite pressure. There is reason to believe that the king encouraged Vaishnavism during the later years as his records mention him giving gifts to the Vishnu shrines. For example, he visited the Ulagalandaperumal temple in Kanchipuram with his two queens, Tribuhavanamudaiyal and Solakulavalli, and made benefactions in the 40th year of his reign.  Art and architecture  Melakadambur-Karakkoil Kulottunga was a patron of arts and architecture. The poet-laureate Jayamkondar is said to have adorned his court. The composition of the famous poem Kalingattuparani is attributed to him. Some scholars consider the poet Kambar to be a contemporary of Kulottunga I and the Ramavataram is said to have been composed during his rule. Others place him during the reign of Kulottunga Chola II or III. Likewise a few believe that Ottakoothar, the author of the three Ulas namely the Kulothunga Cholan Ula, Vikraman Chola Ula and Rajaraja Cholan Ula, lived during his reign while others place him during the reign of his successors viz. Vikrama Chola, Kulottunga II and Rajaraja Chola II. The construction of the Amritaghateswarar Shiva temple in Melakadambur is attributed to the reign of Kulottunga Chola I. It is called as Karakkoil, and is perhaps the earliest shrine built in the shape of a chariot with wheels, and drawn by spirited horses. The temple contains an inscription of the king, dated in the 43rd year of his reign, corresponding to 1113 CE. During his time, Kulottunga Chozhapuram, now called Thungapuram, was a site of intense religious activity. The streets in the city are laid out like Madurai (square shape), hence it is called as Siru (small) Madurai. Kulottunga constructed two temples in Siru Madurai, one called Sokkanathar temple for Lord Siva, and the other, a Vishnu shrine called Lord Vinava Perumal Temple or Varadaraja perumal temple. Kulottunga was also on friendly terms with the Gahadval kings of central India, who had Lord Surya for their tutelary deity. Later, inspired by his visits to the Gahadvala kingdom, Kulottunga built several temples dedicated to the Sun God, especially the Suryanar temples at Pudukkottai and Nagapattinam.  Inscriptions  Kulottunga's inscriptions mostly begin with the introduction \\"pugal madu vilanga\\" or \\"pugal sulnda punari\\". The former gives details about his conquest over Cheras, Pandyas and Vikramaditya VI while the latter is even more detailed and includes the details of his early life, viz., his heroics in Chakrakotta and Vayiragram and how he came about to wear the excellent crown of jewels of the Chola country. An inscription from Kanchi beginning with the introduction \\"Pugal madu\\" mentions his birth star as Pusya. Another inscription of the king, from the Tripurantakesvara temple in Chingleput district, mentions the resale of some lands that were bought in the second year of Virarajendra Chola. In his early years, the king styled himself as Rajakesarivarman alias Rajendracholadeva. We have an inscription of the king from Kolar dated in the second year of his reign. He is called Rajakesarivarman alias Rajendra Chola deva and it mentions his heroics in Sakkarakottam and Vayiragaram. It states that an officer of the king called Virasikhamani Muvendavelar inspected a temple in Kuvalala nadu, a district of Vijayarajendra-mandalam and appointed a committee. There is another inscription from the Adhipurisvara temple in Tiruvorriyur, dated in the third year of his reign, wherein he is styled as Rajakesarivarman alias Rajendracholadeva. It states that Muvendavelar, an officer of the king, and a native of Aridayamangalam in Mudichonadu, a sub-division of Kalyanapuramkonda- sola-valanadu, bought some lands and donated them for feeding a Brahmana and a Sivayogin. The names Vijayarajendra-mandalam and Kalyanapuramgonda-sola- valanadu are significant and evidently named after Kulottunga's predecessor, Rajadhiraja Chola I, who sacked the Western Chalukya capital Kalyanapuram towards the end of his reign. Rajadhiraja Chola I then assumed the title Vijayarajendra after performing the \\"Virabhiseka\\" (anointment of heroes).

When used loosely, electrical energy refers to energy that has been converted from electric potential energy. This energy is supplied by the combination of electric current and electric potential that is delivered by an electrical circuit (e.g., provided by an electric power utility). At the point that this electric potential energy has been converted to another type of energy, it ceases to be electric potential energy. Thus, all electrical energy is potential energy before it is delivered to the end-use. Once converted from potential energy, electrical energy can always be called another type of energy (heat, light, motion, etc.). Electrical energy is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (1 kW¬∑h = 3.6 MJ) which is the product of the power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure energy using an electricity meter, which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer.  Electricity generation  Electricity generation is the process of generating electrical energy from other forms of energy. The fundamental principle of electricity generation was discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist Michael Faraday. His basic method is still used today: electric current is generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or disc of copper between the poles of a magnet. For electrical utilities, it is the first step in the delivery of electricity to consumers. The other processes, electricity transmission, distribution, and electrical energy storage and recovery using pumped-storage methods are normally carried out by the electric power industry. Electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by chemical combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. There are many other technologies that can be and are used to generate electricity such as solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.

It embraces an all- encompassing system of behavior and of responsibilities that spells out all Samoans' relationships to one another and to persons holding positions of authority. This is how Samoans are raised and live, and provides support and direction to individuals within family and political structures. Central to the organisation of Samoan society is the culture's faamatai, the traditional system of social organisation. Hosts have responsibility for the actions of their guests, and may incur a fine from the village authorities for infractions of local customs. Faa SƒÅmoa includes the way one stands, walks and speaks, for example by saying \\"tulou\\" when one walks in front of someone who is seated. Likewise, it is extremely disrespectful to eat or drink when walking through a village. As another example, most Samoan villages enforce a period of prayer in the early evening, signified by ringing a bell or by blowing a conch shell. During this brief curfew (the sa) one should not stop in the village if passing through. Appointed guardians, or aumaga, may stand by the road to ensure that travelers do not enter. In addition to the set familial relationships, which extend to one's entire extended family (the ‚Äòaiga) with its familial chief (the matai), Samoans show respect to persons in positions of authority, and reverently observe customs of long standing which have rather more force than mere etiquette. History When missionaries arrived from Europe in 1830, they found ways to associate Samoan cultural beliefs with Christianity, which contributed to the spread of Christianity in 19th-century Samoa. An example of these purportedly shared beliefs is the respect of one's elders. In faa SƒÅmoa, the young respect older generations, especially their parents and grandparents.

The novel's setting in the worlds of finance (from which it draws its title), politics and media, was inspired by the writer's early experiences working for the BBC and the Liberal Party. The novel was released (BBC Books, 1998) following the production of a television adaptation of the same name (BBC Two, 1998). Adaptations The seven-part radio adaptation of the same name (BBC Radio Four, 1995) by Tavener and Peter Baynham, starring Michael Williams and Barry Foster in the lead roles, was followed by three six-part sequels (BBC Radio Four, 1997-1999). The three-part television adaptation of the same name (BBC Two, 1998) by Malcolm Bradbury stars Warren Clarke and Alun Armstrong in the lead roles. The characters of Charles Prentis and Martin McCabe introduced in the novel were featured in their own spin-off series Absolute Power (BBC Radio 4, 2000-2006/BBC Two, 2003-2005), which was also created and written by Tavener.

In the years leading up to World War II, Cudahy served as United States ambassador to Poland and Belgium, and as United States minister to Luxembourg and the Irish Free State. Early life Cudahy was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Patrick Cudahy the meat packing industrialist and Anna Cudahy. He graduated from Harvard University in 1910 and from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1913. Cudahy served during World War I as a lieutenant in Company B of the U.S. Army's 339th Infantry Regiment. This regiment was part of the Polar Bear Expedition, which was sent to north Russia to intervene on behalf of the anti-communist forces in the Russian Civil War. On November 14, 1918, Cudahy led a counter-attack that succeeded in breaking through and routing the 1,000 Bolshevik troops that on November 11 (Armistice Day) had encircled and attacked the 600 American, Canadian, and Royal Scots soldiers who were holding the village of Tulgas on the Northern Dvina. However, his eventual disillusionment with the campaign in north Russia led him to write (under a pseudonym) the book Archangel: The American War with Russia. Back in the United States, Cudahy headed his family's real estate company, building the Cudahy Tower Apartments on the shore of Lake Michigan in Milwaukee. Diplomatic service Between 1933 and 1940, Cudahy served the United States as minister to several European nations. From September 6, 1933, until April 23, 1937, Cudahy served as the American ambassador to Poland. His time in Poland was marked by a militarily backed government under J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and continued tensions between Poland and Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. From August 23, 1937, Cudahy served as minister to the Irish Free State, which became the Republic of Ireland in December 1937. His official title was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, and he served until January 15, 1940. In January 1940, Cudahy became both the ambassador to Belgium and the minister to Luxembourg. He was forced to leave these posts after Germany occupied Luxembourg and Belgium in May 1940, and the nations set up governments-in-exile. In 1941, Life magazine commissioned Cudahy to interview Hitler, which he did at Berghof. Cudahy later authored the book The Armies March, recounting his experiences in Europe leading up to the war, including the Battle of Belgium and his meeting with Hitler. Death and descendants Cudahy died in September 1943, when he was thrown from a horse on his Brown Deer estate north of Milwaukee. Cudahy's son, Michael Cudahy, founded Marquette Electronics and became a major philanthropist in the city of Milwaukee. Cudahy's daughter, Mary Keogh- Stringer (born Mary Toulgas Cudahy), was a successful artist; the dedication of The Armies March reads; for Toulgas Cudahy whose name was taken from the battle twenty-three years ago on Armistice Day in the American war with Russia, in the hope that her generation may see an enduring armistice.

Biography=Early life and career Rhea was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky and began singing publicly at the Hill Street Baptist Church of that city, where she was a member of the children's choir. In 1925 she went to Chicago and became a member of the R. Nathaniel Dett Club of Music and Allied Arts and attended and graduated from Chicago Musical College. Her professional debut was at Chicago's Kimball Hall in 1929, and she continued to make regular concert performances across the United States as she studied operatic roles in a period that lasted more than two decades. Notable appearances After a 1927 performance of \\"O Don Fatale\\" from Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlos for the Dett Club Scholarship Fund at Pittsburgh's Grace Presbyterian Church , the columnist Sylvester Russell had this to say, \\"As a vocalist... Madam Rhea is a genuine contralto of wonderful range and power, hardly excelled in richness and as the star of the occasion she occupies a place among the greatest human voices produced.\\" In the early 1930s Rhea toured the country with Ethel Waters in the stage production of Rhapsody in Black, and was for a time the feature soloist of the Cecil Mack Choir. At a time when black performers found it difficult to appeal to a wider audience, Rhea was presented by her teacher Romano Romani to the executive staff of the Metropolitan Opera, where in 1934 she became the \\"first person of her race to be granted an audition at the famous opera house\\". Although she was \\"highly praised for her artistic presentation,\\", the Met would wait until 1955 when Marian Anderson would become its first black star. After her performance on May 13, 1935 of a song as the character Josephine in Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore, Rhea won over 6,000 votes from the audience and became the first black winner of an audition of the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, and toured with the group under the name Rea Parada. Her experience at the Met notwithstanding, Rhea became the first black performer to star in \\"the title role of a major opera company\\" when in Chicago on December 27, 1937 she appeared in Verdi's Aida with William Franklin as Amonasro in a performance of the Chicago Civic Opera Company. In attendance for the performance was the drama critic for the Chicago Tribune Cecil Smith, who commented: \\"A musical event without parallel in grand opera in America took place at the Civic Opera House last night when two colored singers, La Julia Rhea and William Franklin, sang the Ethiopian roles of Aida and Amonasro in a special performance of Aida ... Both singers won a goodly success and were warmly applauded.\\"The Chicago Tribune - Obituaries, July 8, 1992 The costume Rhea wore for that performance was a gift from her teacher and mentor, the internationally renowned opera star Rosa Raisa, who had herself worn it at her debut performance of Aida in 1914. Both Rhea and Franklin appeared in productions of the National Negro Opera Company (NNOC), as well as in operettas by Gilbert and Sullivan.Eileen Southern, The Music of Black Americans: A History, W. W. Norton & Company; 3rd edition, p. 416. . The production of Aida in which Rhea made the inaugural performance of the National Negro Opera Company in 1941 was organized by the NNOC Guild as part of Pittsburgh's National Association of Negro Musicians annual meeting. Mary Cardwell Dawson organized the event.Southern, 529. In 1942 she appeared with Chicago Mayor Edward J. Kelly, Olivia de Havilland, Marian Anderson, Oscar G. Mayer, Sr. and other luminaries at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago to sell bonds during World War II under the auspices of the Chicago Musical War Rally. Later life After she no longer gave public performances, Rhea continued her involvement in the world of opera by giving private lessons to young opera hopefuls at her home in Blue Island, where she was known for her annual lawn parties that were attended by musicians from across the country. She also appeared from time to time over the public airwaves. ReferencesFurther reading * The Music of Black Americans: A History. Eileen Southern. W. W.

It stars Pen√©lope Cruz, Claudia Gerini, Elena Perino and the director himself. Both Castellitto and Cruz received critical praise for their performances, as well as several awards, including the prestigious David di Donatello. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.  Plot  Timoteo (Sergio Castellitto), a surgeon, gets the shocking news that his fifteen-year-old daughter Angela (Elena Perino) has been seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. As she is operated upon, Timoteo looks out of a window to see (or imagines seeing) a woman, her back facing him, proceeding to sit down on a chair in the rain outside. He notices her prominent red heels and turns away in disbelief, indicating he was familiar with them. His subsequent reminiscences about an old affair comprise the remainder of the film. A subsequent scene shows Timoteo sitting in a bar in an unfamiliar location on a hot day. Italia (Pen√©lope Cruz), a woman of Albanian origin working at the bar and wearing red heels, offers to let him make a seemingly important call from her home. The inebriated Timoteo, having entered her flat, rapes Italia and subsequently pretends to fall in love with her. He learns from her, among other things, she was sexually abused in her childhood by a dress salesman (who is later revealed to be her father). He decides to leave his wife Elsa (Claudia Gerini) and conveys this to Italia but, just as he is about to come clean, he discovers that Elsa is pregnant. Meanwhile, Italia also becomes pregnant with his child. Timoteo, now in a real dilemma, cannot gather the courage to confront Elsa in her condition. Italia, unaware of this, interprets Timoteo's hesitation as a lack of commitment on his part and is heartbroken by this perceived betrayal. Later, Timoteo encounters a seemingly unstable Italia dancing frenziedly outside her house. On his chiding her, Italia tells him agitatedly that she has had their child aborted at a nearby gypsy's, adding bitterly it was for the best as she would not have made a good mother anyway. Greatly disturbed by this development, Timoteo leaves and goes home to his pregnant wife. Some months later, Timoteo, shopping with his wife who is about to deliver, spots Italia in a crowd and rushes after her in the rain. After catching up with her, he profusely apologises to Italia, asking her forgiveness for all the pain he caused. After reacting violently initially, Italia tells him that she knew now why he could not leave his wife and that she understood. He also learns from her that she would be moving to another town shortly. Next morning, Timoteo offers to drive Italia down to her new town. During the journey, his feelings for Italia grow stronger and he confesses his desire to marry and settle down with her in the new town. While having dinner, Timoteo marries himself off to Italia and refers to her as \\"my wife\\" while speaking to a waitress. That night, he is woken by Italia's screams as she is gripped by unbearable pain in her abdomen. She is rushed to the local hospital, where an ultrasound reveals her belly to be full of blood, indicating a botched abortion. A desperate Timoteo then proceeds to operate on Italia. She dies soon after briefly regaining consciousness. His recollections are interrupted by a nurse who informs him that his daughter's condition has stabilised. He then visits her with his wife. In the final act, a relieved Timoteo takes out Italia's red shoe, which she had lost on the way to the hospital the day she died, and that the funeral company had refused to put in the closed coffin, and which he had carefully preserved, and kisses it as a gesture of thanks.

History  Maylands was named by William Wadham (who married Jane Cooper circa 1852 in Adelaide) and Luke M Cullen, early settlers who sold the land that made up the original town in 1876. There is a Mayland in the English county of Essex from whence the Cooper family emigrated. Maylands consists of mostly medium density residential properties, predominantly in an east-west elevation with most streets in the suburb oriented north-south. Many of its houses having been built in the late 19th century and early 20th century, there are South Australian examples of colonial, Federation and some art deco architecture. Unlike Stepney, to Maylands' west, the dwellings are usually larger with some remaining homes attached to small market gardens. There are few \\"workers cottages\\", but most are found in the north-western section of the suburb. Some heritage preservation has occurred in the suburb. The then Metropolitan Tramways Trust (or MTT) was converted into a set of unit accommodation by the South Australian Housing Trust. The suburb is also known for the antique stores along Magill Road.  Landmarks  One of the most notable landmarks includes the Maylands Hotel, which is located opposite Cruickshank Reserve on the south eastern corner of the Phillis and Clifton Streets intersection. The hotel remains whereas the Tip-Top Bakery site on the south-western corner of the same intersection was demolished and replaced by townhouses. The Maylands Hotel has become a popular eatery, with it arguably being off the beaten track and hidden in leafy suburbia. Up until the 1990s, the hotel had a beer garden. With the introduction of poker machines into South Australia, this beer garden was replaced by an extended dining area and poker machine area.

It is located on the historic Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, Israel. From 1932 to 1971 housing the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, it is currently a museum dedicated to the signing of the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the history of Tel Aviv. Origins At the vicinity of where Independence Hall now stands, sixty-six families gathered on April 11, 1909 to conduct a lottery for plots of land in a new Jewish neighborhood, to be known as Ahuzat Bayit. Meir and Zina Dizengoff acquired plot number 43, on which they built their home. Meir Dizengoff served as the head of the new neighborhood council. In 1910, at a general meeting, the residents of Ahuzat Bayit, inspired by Theodor Herzl's Altneuland (English: Old-New Land), unanimously decided to rename their neighborhood Tel Aviv. As the neighborhood grew and became a city, Dizengoff became its first mayor.

The house underwent extensive renovations and became the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1932. The museum moved to its current location in 1971. Independence In the main hall of the building, at 4 PM on May 14, 1948, in the presence of the members of the Vaad Leumi (Jewish National Council) and the leaders of the Yishuv, David Ben- Gurion proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel, eight hours before the British Mandate of Palestine was due to end. After Ben-Gurion read the Declaration of Independence, Rabbi Fischman (Maimon) recited the Shehecheyanu blessing, and the Declaration was signed. The ceremony concluded with the singing of Hatikvah, now Israel's national anthem.

Typically a song is played, and the performer expressively performs a sign language version of the lyrics. Whereas singing uses pitch, tone, and emotions to convey expressions, sign singing relies on the performer's hands, body, and facial expressions. Choirs can perform sign singing and have gathered popularity in recent years as accessibility for the Deaf community and interest in signing languages have risen. Competitions in which sign choirs can compete include the National Signing Choir Competition in the UK. Well-known sign singers include the Japanese Tomoko Nakayama, a follower of Nichiren Buddhism, and the bawdy Australian duo Dislabelled. In London in 2003, a series of \\"Deaf Idol\\" events were held where deaf participants competed in karaoke singing, dance etc., in a similar format to the TV show Pop Idol. Sign language can be used to express extremely nuanced feeling, and so sign singing is an important creative input for the deaf. Sign singing is featured in the movie Napoleon Dynamite during a scene when two members of the \\"happy hands club\\" perform a song titled \\"The Rose\\" written by Bette Midler, entirely in sign. The signing club depicted in the film was largely inspired by a sign singing club that was previously established at Preston High School (Idaho), where the movie was filmed. The film brought wider attention to the club, originally called the \\"Good hands club,\\" which was founded by educator Dan Robertson, who conceived the idea for the group while studying ASL at Brigham Young University. In 2013 the troupe performed on stages at Disneyland, in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and flew to Orlando for the convention of a large corporation. A sign language interpretation by the late Kimberly Rae Schaefer during Pearl Jam's 2000 tour for \\"Given to Fly\\" garnered public attention for the passionate and emotional signing. The National Anthem was sung and signed in British Sign Language at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics by The Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children.

Though Afghanistan has had democratic elections throughout the 20th century, the election institutions have varied as changes in regimes have disrupted political continuity. Kingdom of Afghanistan=1949 In 1949, Afghan Prime Minister Shah Mahmud allowed relatively free national assembly elections, and the resulting seventh Afghan Parliament (1949‚Äì1951), which has become known as the \\"Liberal Parliament\\", gave voice to criticism of the government and traditional institutions, allowed opposition political groups to come to life, and enacted some liberal reforms, including laws providing for a free press. This being the seventh parliament, six must have been elected from 1924 to around 1945.The state of the media in AfghanistanRegional Surveys of the World - Far East and Australasia 2003 34th ed. p.62 1952 The Afghan parliamentary election in 1952 was considered a step backward from the one in 1949. As part of the government crackdown in 1951 and 1952 ending liberalization, the Kabul and Gazni University student union had been dissolved in 1951, newspapers critical of the government had been shut down, and many of the leaders of the opposition had been jailed. 1964 In 1964, King Mohammed Zahir Shah ordered the convening of a Loya jirga - a national gathering that included the members of the National Assembly, the Senate, the Supreme Court, and both constitutional commissions - to draft and approve a new Afghan constitution. 167 members of the assembly were elected by the provinces, and 34 members were appointed directly by the king. Although most of the 452 people (including six women) assembled were predominantly officials who could be expected to support the royal line, the Loya Jirga of September 1964 also included members elected from the entire nation. While the government did screen out many potential dissidents, \\"on the whole ... delegates to the Loya Jirgah appeared to represent the full range of social, political, and religious opinion.\\" 1965 Most observers described the 1965 election as remarkably fair despite difficulties such as widespread illiteracy, low voter turnout, lack of political parties, and attempts by some government officials to influence the results. The 216-member Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of parliament, included representation by anti-royalists, supporters of the king, Pashtun nationalists, both the left and right of the political spectrum, entrepreneurs and industrialists, political liberals, a small leftist group, as well as conservative Muslim leaders who still opposed secularization. This was Afghanistan's 12th parliament, so there must have been three more National Assembly elections in 1955-62. 1969 The 1969 parliamentary elections, with voter turnout not much higher than in 1965, produced a parliament that more or less reflected the distribution of power and population of rural Afghanistan - conservative landowners and businessmen predominated, and many more non-Pashtuns were elected than in the previous legislature. Most of the urban liberals and all female delegates lost their seats. Few leftists were in the new 13th parliament, although Babrak Karmal and Hafizullah Amin (a mathematics teacher educated in the United States) were elected from districts in and near the capital Kabul. Republic of Afghanistan (1973‚Äì1978)Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978-1992)=1987 In 1987, the Soviet-backed Afghan communist government introduced a law permitting the formation of other political parties, announced that it would be prepared to share power with representatives of opposition groups in the event of a coalition government, and issued a new constitution providing for a new bicameral National Assembly (Meli Shura), consisting of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives (Wolesi Jirga), and a president to be indirectly elected to a 7-year term.The Europa World Year Book 2003, Volume 2, 2002 43rd, Taylor & Francis Group p.400 Local elections were held throughout the country in August 1987, with a considerable number of the elected representatives reported to be non-PDPA members. On September 30, Mohammad Najibullah was unanimously elected as President of the Revolutionary Council. In November 1987, a Loya jirga unanimously elected Najibullah as President of the State. 1988 In April 1988, elections were held for both houses of the new National Assembly. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the National Front, which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government.History.com: Afghanistan Islamic State of Afghanistan=1992 Following the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the ouster of the communist government in April 1992, an indirect election for president took place in December 1992. An interim government, headed by a prime minister, was formed in June 1993. . Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2003-present)=2004 Under the 2001 Bonn Agreement, Afghanistan was scheduled to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in 2004 in order to replace the transitional government led by American-backed Hamid Karzai since his appointment in December 2001.New Leader Urges Foes To SurrenderClan Leader Turned Statesman: Hamid Karzai Presidential elections were held in 2004, but parliamentary elections were not held until mid- September 2005.March 2005 UN Security Council report on parliamentary elections delay Hamid Karzai won the election with 55.4% of the votes and three times more votes than any other candidate. 2005 Afghanistan held parliamentary and provincial council elections on September 18, 2005. Final results were delayed by accusations of election fraud, and were finally announced on November 12, 2005. Former warlords and their followers gained the majority of seats in both the lower house and the provincial council (which elects the members of the upper house). Women won 28% of the seats in the lower house, six more than the 25% guaranteed in the 2004 Constitution. Turnout was estimated at about 50%, substantially lower than at the presidential election in October 2004. This was blamed on the lack of identifiable party lists as a result of Afghanistan's new electoral law, which left voters in many cases unclear on who they were voting for. 2009 The Afghan presidential and provincial council elections held on August 20, 2009 were widely characterized as marred by lack of security, violence, extremely low voter turnout, and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud.Afghan commission orders first ballots invalidatedWave of Attacks Engulfs Afghanistan Over 2,800 complaints were received by the Election Complaints Commission, with the largest proportion concerning irregularities at the poll, including ballot box stuffing and voter intimidation.Afghanistan's Troubled ElectionAfghan election results give Karzai 55% of vote The New York Times wrote, \\"fraud was so pervasive that nearly a quarter of all votes were thrown out.\\" According to an article by The Times, \\"some 1.26 million recorded votes were excluded from an election that cost the international community more than $300 million.\\" (Another estimate placed the cost at $500 million.)Hamid Karzai faces another ballot after 1m votes ruled out Karzai Agrees to November 7 Runoff in AfghanistanAfghanistan's runoff election must be delayed Official election monitors and the UN placed voter turnout in the August 20 first round of the election at only around 30-33%.AIHRC-UNAMA Joint Monitoring of Political Rights, Presidential and Provincial Council Elections, Third Report, 1 August ‚Äì 21 October 2009Dr Abdullah 'makes history' in challenge to Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai On October 20, 2009, under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, President Hamid Karzai announced his acquiescence to a run-off vote between himself and his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, to be held November 7.Hamid Karzai agrees to run-off amid fears of more violence and fraudAfghan elections - an uncertain futureWith New Afghan Vote, Path Forward Is Unclear Finally on November 1, however, Abdullah announced that he would no longer be participating in the run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met, and a \\"transparent election is not possible.\\" A day later, on November 2, 2009, officials of the very same election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan for another 5-year term.Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is ScrappedObama calls Afghan election 'messy' but upholds its final outcome According to The New York Times, the Afghan election commission and Karzai had been under intense pressure from the United States and its allies to cancel the run-off. Abdullah said the appointment had \\"no legal basis\\" and Afghans deserved a better government.Abdullah Says Karzai‚Äôs Confirmation as Afghan President Illegal 2010 The next parliamentary elections were held on September 18, 2010. In July 2010, Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Afghanistan and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), described these as the \\"mother of all issues\\" elections. \\"They will not be Swiss elections, they are going to be Afghan elections,\\" he said, suggesting the event might not fit the Western definition of democracy. More than 2,600 candidates, including more than 400 women, are running for office.\\"U.N. official: Taliban knows they can't win war\\"\\"Pentagon expects tough Afghan fight\\" During the run-up to the elections in September 2010, the Taliban intimidated villagers in certain areas from voting. People in the villages would not vote because the Taliban left night letters warning they will cut off the finger of anyone if they find it marked with the indelible ink used to prevent multiple voting.Taliban Plans Attacks to Disrupt Afghan Vote Intended to Promote Stability Bloomberg September 16, 2010 In late November 2010, Afghanistan's election commission disqualified 21 candidates from the September 18 parliamentary elections for alleged fraudulent activities, a spokesman said. 19 of the candidates were winning or leading their races, according to partial election results, while two others had failed to win seats. 2014 A presidential election was held in Afghanistan on 5 April 2014. Incumbent president Hamid Karzai was not eligible to run due to term limits. An initial field of 27 candidates was whittled down to 8 with front runners Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani. Fraud allegations tainting the final result resulted in a recount of votes at 1,900 of the 23,000 polling stations. Ghani was eventually declared the winner in September 2014. 2018 Parliamentary elections were held on 20 October 2018 to elect members of the House of the People.https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2018-10-19/voting-begins-in- afghan-parliamentary-polls-despite-threats They had originally been scheduled for 15 October 2016, but were initially postponed to 7 July 2018, and then again to 20 October.

He played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Surrey and captained England in Test cricket. His school nickname \\"Shrimp\\" remained with him through his life, but few cricket sources refer to him by anything other than his initials. He was a selector for the England cricket team, and a cricketing knight. Early life Leveson Gower was born in Titsey Place near Oxted in Surrey, the seventh of twelve sons of Granville William Gresham Leveson-Gower JP DL FSA, by his wife The Hon Sophia Leveson Gower LJStJ (n√©e Leigh). His father was a great-great grandson of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (descending from his youngest son, John), and served as Liberal MP for two years for Reigate from 1863 to 1865. His mother was the daughter of Chandos Leigh, 1st Baron Leigh and sister of Sir Edward Chandos Leigh QC and James Wentworth Leigh. His uncles, and brothers Frederick Leveson-Gower and Evelyn Marmaduke Gresham Leveson-Gower, also played first-class cricket. He was educated at Winchester College, where he played cricket for the school first eleven for three years from 1890, and in 1892 he captained the school team to its first victory against Eton College for 10 years, scoring 99 runs and taking 8 wickets for 33 runs in the match. The school team also included Jack Mason, who later played first-class cricket for Kent. He attended Magdalen College, Oxford, and played cricket for Oxford for four years, receiving his blue in 1893 and captaining the Oxford team in 1896. He hit 73 runs and took 7‚Äì84 in the match against Cambridge in 1895. He did not receive a degree. Cricket career He started to play for Surrey as an amateur in 1895. He played his last match for Surrey in 1920, but continued to play occasional first-class cricket until 1931. In all, he played in 277 first-class matches, scoring 7,638 runs at a batting average of 23.72, including 4 centuries, and took 46 wickets at an average of 29.95, including 5 wickets on three occasions. His highest first-class score, 155, was reached playing for Sussex against Oxford in 1899. As captain of Surrey from 1908 to 1910, he led the team to 3rd, 5th and 2nd in the County Championship. He was treasurer of Surrey from 1926 to 1928, and the club's president from 1929 to 1939. He was an outstanding fielder, and took 103 catches. He toured the West Indies with Lord Hawke in 1896‚Äì97, and North America with Pelham Warner in 1897. He joined the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tours to South Africa in 1905‚Äì6, but did not play in the Tests. He returned to South Africa in 1909‚Äì10, and captained England in all three of the Test matches he played, winning one and losing two against South Africa in 1909/10, with Frederick Fane captaining the other two Test matches of the series. He played for the Gentlemen against the Players on several occasions. For fifty years he played a major role in organising the Scarborough Festival which takes place at the end of each English cricket season.E. W. Swanton (1980) Barclays World of Cricket ‚Äì 2nd Ed.

He was knighted for his services to cricket in 1953 and in the same year he published a book of reminiscences entitled Off and on the Field. Other activities Outside cricket, Leveson Gower was a stockbroker. He married Enid Mary Hammond-Chambers in 1908. They had no children. He served as a major in the Royal Army Service Corps in the First World War, and was mentioned in dispatches. He died in Kensington, survived by his wife.

It is located 53 km north-east of Trivandrum City, 78 km south-east of Varkala Beach and 69 km north-east of Kovalam Beach at an altitude of . Ponmudi (Varayadumotta) peak is a part of the Western Ghats mountain range that runs parallel to the Arabian Sea. Ponmudi is also called Kashmir of Kerala and is a popular honeymoon destination in South India. The normal temperature of Ponmudi is between . Tourism Ponmudi is connected to Trivandrum by a two-lane highway (SH2 & SH 45). The last 18 km starting from Anapara has scenic views, as it winds through the mountains and tea gardens. The travel along this stretch provides a thrilling experience as drivers and riders have to navigate 22 Hairpin turns. Ponmudi is also a popular spot for backpacking and trekking. The climate is pleasant year-round. Other attractions near Ponmudi include Golden Valley and a number of rivulets and rapids, some even across the road. The lush forest area has tropical vegetation. A variety of wildlife inhabit the hills. The Golden Valley offers vistas of the hills and access to the Kallar River. Flowing through a wilderness area, it has rounded pebbles, cool water, fish, and lush green trees. Some notable tourist attractions located in Ponmudi are Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary, Echo Point and various trekking spots. Mist-laden valleys, especially Golden Valley near Kallar River, also draw tourists. Travelers can find a deer park and wood and stone cottages coloured in bright hues. Located about 1.5 km from the hill station, is the Ponmudi Falls. Around 3 km from the Ponmudi Resort, is the Deer Park. The Meenmutty Falls, another tourist attraction of the region, is about 3 km from the Kallar Main Road. Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary, located on the outskirts of Ponmudi, is a preserve spread across and accommodates a variety of wild animals and birds like Asian elephants, sambar, leopards, lion-tailed macaques, Malabar grey hornbills, etc. Another main attraction in the region is Agasthyarkoodam, one of the highest peaks in the Western Ghats, with the highest peak at 1868 m. This peak is known for its wilderness, and can be accessed only with the Forest Department's permission. Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve is another attraction covering Neyyar, Peppara, Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuaries and divisions of Achencoil, Thenmala, Konni, Punalur, and Thiruvananthapuram Ecology The landscape of Ponmudi is an interspersing of valleys and hills with forestland and plantations. Ponmudi is having an extensive importance of biodiversity, which plays a major role in maintaining the ecological balance of the area. Ponmudi is host to 283 species of birds, many of which are endangered and threatened. Birds endemic to this region include the painted bush quail, the Malabar grey hornbill, the Wayanad laughingthrush, the broad- tailed grass bird and the Nilgiri pipit. The grasslands of Ponmudi are the breeding grounds of the broad-tailed grass bird, a threatened species. Fifty- nine per cent of the 483 bird species in Kerala are found at Ponmudi. Of the 16 species of birds endemic to the Western Ghats, 15 are at Ponmudi. Of the 332 species of butterflies in the Western Ghats, 195 are found here. Of the 37 butterfly species endemic to the Ghats, 24 are found at Ponmudi. The spot puffin, a rare butterfly, has been sighted at the Kulachikarai-Panayam- Merchiston area where ISRO's land comes. Similarly, Ponmudi is also host to many species of reptiles and amphibians, including the highly endangered Travancore tortoise, the Malabar Gliding Frog and the Malabar tree toad. Nilgiri tahr is also found in Ponmudi hill top. Kallar and Menmutty Falls Kallar situated en route to the hill station of Ponmudi, Kallar gets its name from the River Kallar, which flows through the region. Kallu means 'stone' and Aru means 'river', hence the name Kallar. The river is well known for its abundance of attractive, round-shaped boulders and pebbles, especially in the upper reaches and middle portion of its course. Here one can take a dip in the crystal clear waters to cool off, and also watch the many rapids and small pools that dot a good part of the river in this area. Meenmutty Falls, Thiruvananthapuram is one of the main attractions located nearby Ponmudi hills and is around 45 km from Thiruvananthapuram. This waterfall is about 3 km away from the Kallar-Ponmudi road. The main attractions are waterfalls and the small natural pools and rocks located beside the way to the waterfalls. In order to reach the place, one has to take a long trek that passes through dense forests, upon taking special permission from the Forest Department. A guide will be sent along with tourist groups to the falls. Facilities for trekking are easily provided at Kallar Vana Samrakshana Samithi, which is a forest protection group at Kallar.

Adult worms attach to abomasal mucosa and feed on the blood. This parasite is responsible for anemia, oedema, and death of infected sheep and goats, mainly during summer in warm, humid climates.Burke, Joan, Research Animal Scientist. Management of Barber pole Worm in Sheep and Goats in the Southern U.S. USDA, ARS, Dale Bumpers Small Farms Research Center, Booneville, AR.> Females may lay over 10,000 eggs a day, which pass from the host animal in the faeces. After hatching from their eggs, H. contortus larvae molt several times, resulting in an L3 form that is infectious for the animals. The host ingests these larvae when grazing. The L4 larvae, formed after another molt, and adult worms suck blood in the abomasum of the animal, potentially giving rise to anaemia and oedema, which eventually can lead to death. The infection, called haemonchosis, causes large economic losses for farmers around the world, especially for those living in warmer climates. Anthelminthics are used to prevent and treat these, and other, worm infections, but resistance of the parasites against these chemicals is growing. Some breeds, such as the West African Dwarf goat and N'Dama cattle, are more resistant than other breeds to H. contortus (haemonchotolerance). Morphology The ova is yellowish in color. The egg is about 70‚Äì85 Œºm long by 44 Œºm wide, and the early stages of cleavage contain between 16 and 32 cells. The adult female is 18‚Äì30 mm long and is easily recognized by its trademark \\"barber pole\\" coloration. The red and white appearance is because H. contortus is a blood feeder, and the white ovaries can be seen coiled around the blood-filled intestine. The male adult worm is much smaller at 10‚Äì20 mm long, and displays the distinct feature of a well-developed copulatory bursa, containing an asymmetrical dorsal lobe and a Y-shaped dorsal ray. Life cycle The adult female worm can release between 5,000 and 10,000 eggs, which are passed out in the feces. Eggs then develop in moist conditions in the feces and continue to develop into the L1 (rhabditiform), and L2 juvenile stages by feeding on bacteria in the dung. The L1 stage usually occurs within four to six days under the optimal conditions of 24‚Äì29 ¬∞C. The L2 rhabditform sheds its cuticle and then develops into the L3 filiariform infective larvae. The L3 form has a protective cuticle, but under dry, hot conditions, survival is reduced. Sheep, goats, and other ruminants become infected when they graze and ingest the L3 infective larvae. The infective larvae pass through the first three stomach chambers to reach the abomasum. There, the L3 shed their cuticles and burrow into the internal layer of the abomasum, where they develop into L4, usually within 48 hours, or preadult larvae. The L4 larvae then molt and develop into the L5 adult form. The male and female adults mate and live in the abomasum, where they feed on blood.  Genetics  The H. contortus draft genome was published in 2013. Further work to complete the reference genome is underway at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institutehttps://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/helminths/haemonchus- contortus.html in collaboration with the University of Calgary, the University of Glasgow, and the Moredun Research Institute. Developing genetic and genomic resources for this parasite will facilitate the identification of the genetic changes conferring anthelmintic resistance and may help design new drugs or vaccines to combat disease and improve animal health. Pathogenicity Clinical signs are largely due to blood loss. Sudden death may be the only observation in acute infection, while other common clinical signs include pallor, anemia, oedema, ill thrift, lethargy, and depression. The accumulation of fluid in the submandibular tissue, a phenomenon commonly called \\"bottle jaw\\", may be seen. Growth and production are significantly reduced. Prevention and treatment Prophylactic anthelmintic treatment necessary to prevent infection in endemic regions, but wherever possible, a reduction on reliance on chemical treatment is warranted given the rapid rise of anthelmintic resistance. A commercial vaccine known as Barbervax in Australia or Wirevax in South Africa has become available in recent years. This works mainly by reducing egg output and hence pasture contamination. The vaccine contains proteins from the lining of the intestines of the Barber's Pole worm. The animal produces antibodies against the protein which circulate in the blood. When the Barber's pole worm drinks the blood the antibodies attach to its stomach lining, preventing digestion and starving the animal. Following this, the worm produces fewer eggs and eventually dies off. Targeted selective treatment methods such as the FAMACHA method may be valuable in reducing the number of dosing intervals, thus reducing the percentage of surviving parasites that are resistant to anthelmintics. Faecal egg counts are used to track parasite infestation levels, individual animals' susceptibility, and anthelmintic effectiveness. Other management strategies include selective breeding for more parasite-resistant sheep or goats (e.g. by culling the most susceptible animals or by introducing parasite-resistant breeds such as Gulf Coast Native sheep); careful pasture management, such as managed intensive rotational grazing, especially during peak parasite season; and \\"cleaning\\" infested pastures by haying, tilling, or grazing with a nonsusceptible species (e.g. swine or poultry).Anderson, Samuel. \\"Summary of Results: New England Small Ruminant Producer Survey.\\" Northeast IPM Center, 2013. http://www.northeastipm.org/neipm/assets/File/New-England-Small-Ruminant- Survey-Results-2013.pdf Recent research has also shown that the use of hair sheep breeds, such as Katahdins, Dorpers, and St. Croix, can be chosen for resistance to internal parasites for economical standards; additionally, the hair breeds provide resistance without showing any significant effect growth performance of their progeny. One of the riskiest methods that can be used for treatments is the use copper of oxide wire particles (COWP) to aid in the destruction of the parasites inside the gut without the use of chemicals. However, in sheep, the dosing would need to be monitored extremely closely because if they are administered too high of a dose, then they will slip into copper toxicity. For the COWP, the lowest recommended dose would need to be administered to remain safe for sheep. The study conducted found that treatment with the COWP reduced faecal egg counts by >85%. Treatment with the copper oxide wire particles could lead to less reliance on anthelmintics because the COWP allows for the reduction in establishment of parasitic infections, especially if the producer is trying to reduce the larval population on their pastures. Recent research shows fugal lectins are able to inhibit larval development. These fungal lectins are Corprinopsis cinerea lectins - CCL2, CGL2; Aleuria aurantia lectin - AAL; and Marasmius oreades agglutinin - MOA. These four toxic lectins bind to specific glycan structures found in H. controtus. Some of these glycan structures might represent antigens which are not exposed to host immune system, and thus have potential for vaccine or drug development.

Born in Irlam, Lancashire, the son of Benjamin Heywood, and educated at Eton College, Heywood joined the family business, Heywood's Bank in the 1840s. Heywood sponsored many philanthropic causes, including Manchester Mechanics' Institute, Chetham's Hospital, Manchester Grammar School and Owens College. He was selected as High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1888. He married Eleanor Barton, daughter of Richard Watson Barton, on 7 September 1847; they had no children. Life On 9 September 1825, Oliver Heywood was born in Irlams O' Th' Height near Manchester, England to the prominent English banker and well known philanthropist Sir Benjamin Heywood and his wife Sophia Ann Robinson. Located in St. Ann's Square, the Heywood bank was one of the more recognisable bank names in Manchester but had suffered some tarnishing of its image from the 1700s. Heywood was educated in Liverpool at St. Domingo House, at the time, a boarding school for boys that was housed by a large mansion. He then was educated at Mr. Mertz's School in Manchester and then at Eton College for his higher education. Heywood followed the finishing of his formal education by traveling abroad before beginning his very promising career in the family banking business.Williams Deacon‚Äôs, 1771‚Äì1970 (Manchester: privately published by Williams & Glyn‚Äôs Bank Ltd, 1971) On 7 September 1847, Heywood married Eleanor Barton, the daughter of a merchant from Pendlebury named Richard Watson Barton. The couple first lived in Acresfield in the house where Heywood had been born in Irlams O' Th' Height near Manchester. However, after the death of Sir Benjamin Heywood in 1865, the couple moved into his house in nearby Claremont. Eleanor died childless in September 1877. Heritage The Heywood family fortune had ties to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Oliver Heywood's great-grandfather, Benjamin Heywood, was one of the family that had lived in Liverpool, where they owned a shipping company in the 1700s. This transported goods made in Manchester to West Africa, where they were traded for African slaves who were then taken to Barbados. There the slaves were traded in turn for sugar and cotton, which were landed in Liverpool on the ships' return voyage. The slave trade was lucrative but eventually recognised as unscrupulous. It was from this activity that Benjamin Heywood had been able to establish the family bank in Manchester in 1788. Business In 1845, Heywood joined his father's banking company, called Sir Benjamin Heywood & Co.. In 1847, he was made a partner in the company, as also later were his three younger brothers. In 1860, upon the retirement of his father, Oliver became the senior partner of the bank, which was then renamed as Heywood Brothers & Co. Under Oliver Heywood's leadership, the bank fulfilled his father's legacy within the business; the bank kept its reputation that it had earned for reliability and prudence. These two particular qualities would prove to be both tested, then after reaffirmed, to be defining for the bank's survival during the financial crisis of 1866, which was spurred by the collapse of an old and prestigious banking firm \\"Overend, Gurney & Co.\\"; this major bankruptcy caused a serious panic within the English banking sector.‚ÄôOliver Heywood and the Overend Gurney Crisis‚Äô, Three Banks Review, December 1951, vol. 12, pp. 29-40 Oliver Heywood was in London at the time when the crisis first struck. He witnessed all the panic that had ensued after the bankruptcy of Overend, Gurney & Co.; the entire banking sector in London was in chaos. Heywood's first instinct was to hurry home to Manchester to check on the firm: luckily everything at the firm had been copacetic, just how he left it. The firm's well-weathering of the financial crisis of 1866 is largely given credit to how Heywood managed his company, he was reliable and prudent. Never taking a risk that was too dangerous or that would over-extend the firm financially.Oliver Heywood‚Äôs diary relating to the Overend Gurney crisis in 1866 is featured in RBS History 100 In 1876, Oliver Heywood would remain the senior partner of Heywood Brothers & Co. until the firm was acquired by Manchester & Salford Bank. As part of the agreement made in the acquisition, there was an arrangement that Heywood and his three younger brothers would continue to hold high ranking positions in Manchester & Salford Bank. The arrangement made Heywood and his brothers directors in the new firm.T P Heywood, Reminiscences, Letters, and Journals of Thomas Percival Heywood, Baronet. Arranged by his eldest daughter (Isabel Mary). With a preface by the Rev. George Body. (Manchester: printed for private circulation, 1899) In 1878, Heywood had retired all his obligations, beyond being a shareholder, to the Manchester & Salford Bank. This virtually meant that he stopped attending the board meetings that were required of a member of the Board of Directors; and in turn was not re-elected to the firm's board. Heywood's reasoning for no longer attending the board meetings came from a place of disapproval with the firm's general manager Thomas Read Wilkinson's recent acquisition. Wilkinson had made the decision to purchase Hardcastle, Cross & Co., the bank that was located in Bolton. Philanthropy Oliver Heywood's family bank was very successful during the Victorian era. The prosperity from the Heywood Bank rewarded the family handsomely, the amount of wealth Heywood was receiving allowed him to have more time and focus on charitable and philanthropic work. These righteous pursuits also included but were not only limited to liberal causes in Salford and Manchester. Heywood's philanthropic interests had a particular focus in education. He started off supporting and financing for projects to erect and establish working men's colleges. Heywood even assisted his resources to help erect and establish the Owens College, which eventually became a forerunner of the University of Manchester. Heywood's philanthropic pursuits were looked at as very admirable considering that many of his contemporaries were uninterested in public duties. His contemporaries, or other people with substantial wealth, were moving out of the grimy cities to the more desirable country manor or suburban areas. Since a large portion of the wealthy were no longer living in the cities, this meant that consequently this sect of the wealthy was also less interested in providing charity for a community that they no longer inhabited. Heywood, deciding to stay in Manchester, and with his very generous inclinations, was very prone to provide a little extra to his community's needs. Some of Heywood's contributions and support he led to education were mainly in Manchester and included: Victoria University, Owens College, Manchester Grammar School, Manchester High School for Girls, Hulme Grammar School, Manchester Technical School, Manchester School Board, Salford School Board, and the Association for the Promotion of Technical Education in the Manchester District. Heywood also provided his support and contributed to the healthcare organizations and facilities of Manchester, these include: Hospital for Sick Children, St Mary‚Äôs Hospital, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Salford Royal Hospital, the Royal Eye Hospital Manchester, the Royal Asylum, and the Provident Dispensaries Association.E Edwards, Manchester worthies and their foundations (Manchester: J. Galt & co, 1855) Heywood was passionate and often locally involved to the best of his capacity towards, what was then considered, \\"Progressive Causes\\". He was a staunch supporter of the Anti- Slavery movement in England, and in turn, the world. It was not considered rare or bizarre to find Heywood at local Anti-Slavery meetings in Manchester. One of the more notable meetings, held in November 1872, recorded Heywood in attendance; it was focused on the stopping of the African slave trade that was being carried out in East Africa. Heywood's father, Sir Benjamin Heywood, was a parliamentary representative during the 1830s. Despite Heywood's father's political legacy and his own public record of charity and public service, Heywood never took a career in politics seriously. Heywood was admired for his subtle disposition and his high qualities of competence and generosity. It was only natural that Heywood was offered the parliamentary seat for Salford as the liberal candidate on multiple occasions; he turned the whole proposition down, flattered. Legacy In 1888, Heywood's public work and sacrifice was acknowledged by the city of Manchester making him the city's first Honorary Freeman. On 17 March 1892, he died in his home. He was buried at St. John's church in Pendlebury. The funeral ceremony was vast and impressive: The bishops of Guildford and Manchester both conducted the service where thousands of people showed up to pay their respects and 150 carriages were used. On the afternoon of Heywood's funeral, shops in Irlams O' Th' Height and Pendlebury closed in his honour.Report of funeral of Oliver Heywood, Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 22 March 1892 It was decided to erect a marble statue in commemoration and to place it in Albert Square, Manchester. The commission was given to Albert Bruce-Joy, with the ¬£2600 cost being met by contributions from 332 donors. Bruce-Joy had previously sculpted a statue of John Bright in Albert Square and the committee overseeing the Heywood memorial believed that his statue of Heywood would complement that of Bright.

They possess ubiquinone 10 as their major respiratory quinone, contain glycosphingolipids (GSLs), specifically ceramide, instead of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their cell envelopes, and typically produce yellow-pigmented colonies.Sphingomonas, Microbewiki By 2001, the genus included more than 20 species that were quite diverse in terms of their phylogenetic, ecological, and physiological properties. As a result, Sphingomonas was subdivided into different genera: Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Sphingosinicella, and Sphingopyxis. These genera are commonly referred to collectively as sphingomonads. The sphingomonads are widely distributed in nature, having been isolated from many different land and water habitats, as well as from plant root systems, clinical specimens, and other sources; this is due to their ability to survive in low concentrations of nutrients, as well as to metabolize a wide variety of carbon sources. Numerous strains have been isolated from environments contaminated with toxic compounds, where they display the ability to use the contaminants as nutrients. Some of the sphingomonads (especially Sphingomonas paucimobilis) also play a role in human disease, primarily by causing a range of mostly nosocomial, non-life- threatening infections that typically are easily treated by antibiotic therapy.Sphingomonas paucimobilis Bloodstream Infections Associated with Contaminated Intravenous Fentanyl, Lisa L. Maragakis, Romanee Chaiwarith, Arjun Srinivasan, Francesca J. Torriani, Edina Avdic, Andrew Lee, Tracy R. Ross, Karen C. Carroll, and Trish M. Perl, Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 15, No. 1, January 2009 Due to their biodegradative and biosynthetic capabilities, sphingomonads have been used for a wide range of biotechnological applications, from bioremediation of environmental contaminants to production of extracellular polymers such as sphingans (e.g., gellan, welan, and rhamsan) used extensively in the food and other industries. The shorter carbohydrate moiety of GSL compared to that of LPS results in the cell surface being more hydrophobic than that of other Gram-negative bacteria, probably accounting for both Sphingomonas' sensitivity to hydrophobic antibiotics and its ability to degrade hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. One strain, Sphingomonas sp. 2MPII, can degrade 2-methylphenanthrene. In May 2008, Daniel Burd, a 16-year-old Canadian, won the Canada-Wide Science Fair in Ottawa after discovering that Sphingomonas can degrade over 40% of the weight of plastic bags (Polyethylene) in less than three months.TheRecord.com‚ÄîCanadaWorld‚ÄîWCI student isolates microbe that lunches on plastic bags A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 expressing a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) has also been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium from alkaline solutions.

It is dominated by its largest building, the Grade I listed Manchester Town Hall, a Victorian Gothic building by Alfred Waterhouse. Other smaller buildings from the same period surround it, many of which are listed (the buildings on the north side are in Princess Street). The square contains a number of monuments and statues, the largest of which is the Albert Memorial, a monument to Prince Albert, Prince consort of Queen Victoria. The square, named after the Prince, was laid out to provide a space for the memorial in 1863‚Äì67. Work on the town hall began in 1868 and was completed in 1877. History Adolphe Valette. The Albert Memorial (left) and Gladstone statue (right) can be seen in the foreground. Albert Memorial (Thomas Worthington & Matthew Noble, 1869) The area in which the square is situated was once derelict land and an area of dense housing near the Town Yard and the River Tib (named Longworth's Folly). The square's creation arose out of a project by Manchester Corporation's Monuments Committee to erect a memorial to Prince Albert who had died of typhoid in 1861. After initial proposals to create a memorial library, museum or botanical gardens, the committee decided to erect a statue in a decorated canopy. It was originally planned to place the monument in front of the Royal Infirmary building at Piccadilly, between the statues of Wellington and Peel. However it was felt that its ornate Gothic design was not in keeping with the neoclassical infirmary.Stewart, Cecil (1956) The Stones of Manchester. London: Edward Arnold; pp. 81‚Äì84 In 1863, land was offered by the Corporation which was cleared to make way for a public space. The project won much public support; the Manchester Bricklayers' Protection Society donated 50,000 bricks towards the monument's construction, \\"as an expression of sympathy towards our beloved Queen\\". When construction problems arose (the site was found to be riddled with drains and culverts) and the bricks were used up on the foundations alone, a public subscription was launched in 1865 and a further ¬£6,249 was raised, in spite of the hardships of the Cotton Famine. Clearing the site began in 1864, and required the demolition of over 100 buildings, including the Engraver's Arms pub, a coffee roasting works, a smithy, a coal yard and various warehouses. The project was encouraged by the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to open the Albert Monument in 1869. It was decided to construct a new town hall for Manchester, as the old building in King Street had become too small. Following an architectural competition, Gothic designs for a building with a high bell tower by Sir Alfred Waterhouse were selected, and the Town Hall was begun in 1868 and completed in 1877. In the early 1970s, there was a plan to build an underground station under Albert Square and neighbouring St Peter's Square, as part of the ill-fated Picc-Vic tunnel project. publicity brochure The project was eventually cancelled and the station was not built. In April 1972, the area around Albert Square was designated a conservation area, and in 1981 to include the neighbouring, newly created Lincoln Square. (The creation of Lincoln Square completed a \\"procesional way\\" from the Law Courts through Spinningfields and Lincoln Square to the Town Hall.) The centre of Albert Square was originally laid out in the form of a traffic circle and a group of bus stops occupied the western part. In 1987 the square was redesigned and the eastern side in front of the town hall was pedestrianised. The square was laid with fan-shaped granite setts, York stone paving and 'heritage'-style cast-iron street furniture. Monuments=Albert Memorial Close-up of the Albert Memorial Albert Square's largest monument is the Grade I listed Albert Memorial, commemorating the Prince Consort. It features a marble statue of Albert standing on a plinth and facing west, designed by Matthew Noble (1862‚Äì1867). The figure is placed within a large Medieval-style ciborium which was designed by the architect Thomas Worthington. Noble was commissioned by the then mayor, Thomas Goadsby, to sculpt the Prince's likeness, and the designs were personally approved by Queen Victoria. Worthington himself had, at the age of 18, been presented with the Royal Society of Arts' Isis Gold Medal by Prince Albert for a design for a Gothic-style chancel. His Medieval-style design for the Albert Memorial was inspired by the Church of Santa Maria della Spina in Pisa. Although his design was unusual for its time, commentators have suggested he may have been influenced by George Kemp's Scott Monument in Princes Street, Edinburgh, built 20 years earlier. The memorial is topped with an ornate spire, and on each side a crocketed gable with canopied pinnacles on colonettes. Within the canopies stand symbolic figures representing art, commerce, science and agriculture. Below these stand secondary figures representing particular disciplines: *The Four Arts: painting, architecture, music, sculpture *Commerce: the Four Continents *The Four Sciences: chemistry, astronomy, mechanics, mathematics *Agriculture: the Four Seasons The coloured sett paving which was laid around the memorial in 1987 depicts floral representations of the Four Home Nations of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Proposals to move or demolish the Albert Memorial have been made; a plan to replace Prince Albert with a war memorial following the First World War was defeated; and when the Albert Memorial had fallen into disrepair, it was proposed that it should be demolished. It was rescued from destruction several times by campaigners, and was finally restored with help from Robert Ernest Shapley in 1976‚Äì77. The Albert Memorial Restoration Committee, chaired by J. L. Womersley, raised ¬£50, 000 to repair the memorial through public appeal, a fact that is noted in an inscription at its base.

Claims that Worthington's design influenced George Gilbert Scott in his London monument are disputed. Scott, writing in his Recollections, stated that his idea of building a medieval canopy was original, \\"so new as to provoke much opposition\\".

He was born in Christchurch and graduated from the University of Auckland in 1963 with a Diploma of Architecture. That same year he joined Structon Group Architects, and he became a partner in 1965. In 1968 he was a principal partner in setting up Athfield Architects with Ian Dickson and Graeme John Boucher (Manson). Athfield died in 2015 due to complications from a routine procedure which resulted in pneumonia, at the Wellington Hospital, where he was being treated for prostate cancer.  Projects  A documentary 'Architect Athfield' (1979), which examines the frustrations and achievements of one of New Zealand's most lively and innovative architects. In 1965 Athfield started work on his first major project, Athfield House, for his family and a studio. Located in Khandallah, Wellington, this distinctive group of structures stands out amongst neighbouring conventional suburban houses. His early projects were constructed with a broad palette of materials including corrugated iron, plaster, stainless steel and fibre glass. As a reaction to much of the bland \\"Modern\\" architecture of the period, Athfield built in a deliberately vernacular style using features harking back to colonial buildings. His designs incorporated finials, steeply pitched roofs, timber weatherboards, verandahs and double hung windows. He was also inspired by the architecture of the Greek Islands with their exterior envelopes of continuous plaster and small windows. Conversely, he also much admired the buildings of Mies van der Rohe with their precise and refined detailing of industrial materials. Yet another area of influence for Athfield was the geometric massing of the Japanese Metabolists. Athfield combined all these disparate elements into a highly eclectic and personal style. During the 1970s Athfield built and renovated numerous domestic houses and buildings, developing a distinctive and highly personal design approach based on the repetition of small scale elements and complex massing. Critical opposition to these 'cartoon houses' did not bother him (Manson). Another criticism of Athfield's houses were that they were built for charm and not practicality. Athfield believed, however, that \\"in a house, you should get a surprise every time you turn a corner and look up\\" (Manson). Wellington City LibraryAthfield's practice expanded during the 1980s from mainly residential work to a wider variety of community and commercial buildings. As well as continuing to work on small-scale projects, his portfolio includes churches, pubs, council flats, stadiums and commercial high-rise buildings. Athfield's best known works include Telecom Towers, Civic Square and Wellington Central Library, Jade Stadium in Christchurch and work on the design of the Bangkok rapid transport system. He was a President of the New Zealand Institute of Architects, judged many design competitions and was a keynote speaker at many overseas conferences. His firm's later projects included Chews Lane Precinct, the Wellington Overseas Passenger Terminal redevelopment and the Wellington Marine Education Centre. A documentary on Athfield, Architect of Dreams, was produced for the NZ Documentary Festival. Following the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, Athfield was appointed as an Architectural Ambassador to Christchurch. Awards and honours Athfield won over 60 national and international architecture and design awards. In 1976 he won first prize in the International Competition for the Urban Environment of Developing Countries. In 1978 he was placed first equal in a Low Cost Housing Design Competition in Fiji. He won 13 NZIA Supreme Awards for his outstanding architectural projects. In 2004 he won the New Zealand Institute of Architects' highest honour, the Gold Medal. Athfield was the first New Zealand architect to register as an APEC architect. Athfield was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1996 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to architecture, and in the 2015 New Year Honours he was promoted to Knight Companion of the same order. He received a Distinguished Alumni Award in 1997 from the University of Auckland, and in 2000 he was awarded an honorary LitD by Victoria University of Wellington. Accepting his honorary doctorate on 18 April, Athfield stated: > I accept this on behalf of architects, designers, plumbers and gas fitters. > We have suffered at the hands of accountants and engineers for too long.

The inaccessible ocean-front cliffs include fossil-bearing strata of the Eumeralla Formation that date back to about 106 million years ago and has provided discoveries important in the research of the natural history of dinosaurs in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere as a whole.  Geological time-line  During the Early Cretaceous the location was a flood plain within a great rift valley that formed as Australia started to separate northward from Antarctica. Sand, mud and silt deposits covered and sometimes preserved the remains of dead animals and plants. As the rift valley sank, the deposits were overlaid by sediment, which turned to rock under pressure. In the last 30 million years the sediments have been uplifted to form the Otway Ranges and Strzelecki Ranges, bringing them near the surface again. The richest find of petrified dinosaur bones is confined to narrow thin (up to 0.3 m) layers, most likely ancient stream beds serving as repositories of the bones of smaller animals.  History of discovery  In 1903, geologist William Hamilton Ferguson was mapping the rocky coastal outcrops a few kilometres west of Inverloch and uncovered the first dinosaur fossil ever discovered in Australia. 75 years later, the exploration and excavation of the Dinosaur Cove site was conducted by teams of volunteers overseen by Tom Rich and Patricia Rich. The dinosaur taxa, Leaellynasaura amicagraphica and Timimus hermani, are named for the children of the Riches', Tim and Leaellyn. Heavy mining equipment and dynamite was used to blast away overlying strata to uncover the fossiliferous rock layers in the cliff face. Over geological time since, the rock was pushed so deep that heat and pressure hardened it much, before it came again to the surface. As a result, a common way to look for fossils in it was to break each lump with a sledgehammer, and after each blow to examine all new broken surfaces for cross-sections of bone. Any pieces that showed bone were sent to the laboratory to extract the bone by careful preparation. In the 1980s and 90s Dinosaur Cove yielded hypsilophodontid-like dinosaurs as Leaellynasaura amicagraphica and Atlascopcosaurus loadsi, and a Coelurosaur, as well as fragments of what may be a caenagnathid (relatives of the Oviraptors). One fossil from this diverse taxa, collectively called the \\"polar dinosaurs of Australia\\", has been interpreted as showing possible adaptations to vision in low light conditions and possibly were warm-blooded; this has been suggested as an explanation for how some of these dinosaurs foraged for food during the polar winter months. It is worth noting that although these dinosaurs lived at polar latitudes, the Cretaceous climate was significantly milder than today, so temperatures within the Antarctic and Arctic Circles were vastly different from the climate at these latitudes today, because the lopsided arrangements of the continents made sea currents and monsoon winds blow across the polar areas and not round and round them, and so stopped cold pools from developing around the poles. An astragalus bone of what was originally thought to be an ancient relative of Allosaurus, but is now thought to be a megaraptoran was discovered at the site, making it the first discovery in the southern hemisphere.

He was part of the first generation of black opera singers to achieve wide success and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. He began his opera career at the New York City Opera in 1946 during a time when the NYCO was one of the few American opera companies hiring black artists. He sang a varied repertoire there through 1955, after which his career was largely based in Europe until his death at the age of fifty. Biography Winters began to study singing privately in Salisbury, North Carolina, before entering Howard University in 1941, where he studied singing with Todd Duncan. After graduating from Howard in 1944 with a bachelor's degree in Music, he joined the Eva Jessye Choir. Shortly thereafter he sang the lead role in a concert production of Clarence Cameron White's Ouranga. Following this he became musical director in the Special Services Division at Fort Huachuca as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. After the end of World War II, Winters moved to New York City in 1946 where he was almost immediately engaged for the Broadway musical revue Call Me Mister, portraying a variety of smaller roles. His official recital debut followed in 1947 at Town Hall in New York. Then, in 1948, he debuted as an opera singer in the New York City Opera (NYCO) in Verdi's Aida as Amonasro. He portrayed several more roles with the NYCO over the next seven years, including Dessalines in William Grant Still's Troubled Island (1949), the four villains in Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann (1949), Escamillo in Georges Bizet's Carmen (1949), Tchelio in Sergei Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges (1950), Tonio in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci (1950), Timur in Giacomo Puccini's Turandot (1950), Alfio in Cavalleria rusticana (1950), The Messenger in the world premiere of David Tamkin's The Dybbuk (1951), the title role in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto (1951), King Balthazar in Gian Carlo Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors (1952), Colline in Puccini's La boh√®me (1952), the title role in B√©la Bart√≥k's Bluebeard's Castle (1953), Count Almaviva in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (1954), Joe in Show Boat (1954), Germont in Verdi's La Traviata (1955), and Diomede in the New York premiere of William Walton's Troilus and Cressida (1955) among others. While working with the NYCO, Winters also toured as a concert artist and performed in operas with companies in Europe. In 1949 he came to Europe for the first time, drawing particular acclaim for a recital given in Berlin. He also gave concert tours in Central America and in the United States Virgin Islands. In 1950 he joined the roster of principal baritones at the Royal Swedish Opera where he sang a number of roles for two seasons. In 1951, he sang the role of Porgy opposite Camilla Williams's Bess in the most complete recording of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess made up to that time. He made his debut with the Hamburg State Opera in 1952 reprising his role in Aida, returning there frequently through 1957. He made his first appearance with the New York Philharmonic singing excerpts from operas in concert in 1957. In 1957 Winters became a principal baritone on the roster at the Deutsche Oper Berlin where he spent most of his time performing in operas through 1961. He also sang in a number of roles with the Vienna State Opera and the San Francisco Opera during these years, including the title role in Carl Orff's Die Kluge, Amonasro, Fritz Kothner in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, Tonio, and Wolfram in Tannh√§user. In February 1960 he returned to Broadway as Tyree Tucker in Ketti Frings's play The Long Dream. One of the few non-singing roles he portrayed during his career, Winters garnered a Tony Award nomination for his performance. He returned for one last performance at the NYCO in 1962, portraying the role of Porgy. He returned to the Hamburg State Opera in 1961, working as a principal baritone with the company until his untimely death at the age of 50 in 1965.

It includes two divisions: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) and IBM Global Technology Services (GTS). IBM Global Business Services IBM Global Business Services (GBS) is the professional services arm of Global Services, including management and strategy consulting, systems integration, and application management services. Revenues from the Global Business Services were $13.5 billion in 2014. History IBM's early involvement in IT services can be traced back to the mid-seventies and its Data Processing Support Services (DPSS) division. At the time, the company was under regulatory pressure to unbundle its support services from the sale of hardware. Additionally, with the launch of its early teleprocessing and database products, such as CICS and IMS, many customers could only acquire the expertise needed to build their applications through hiring consulting services directly from IBM itself. Later, in 1989, Eastman Kodak Company and IBM completed an agreement by which IBM designed, built and managed a new state-of-the-art data center for Kodak in Rochester, New York under the brand name ISSC, Integrated Systems Solution Corporation. Also in 1989, IBM introduced Business Recovery Services, an offering that enables a business to continue operations in the event of an unplanned outage or disaster. In 1992, the company formed IBM Consulting Group, as a new management consulting organization with service lines in Business Transformation and IT Strategy Consulting. This initiative was led by Robert M. Howe, IBM vice-president and general manager of IBM Consulting Group. The group was rebranded to IBM Business Innovation Services in 2001, and then IBM Business Consulting Services. As the management consulting became more entangled with more technology delivery, the integrated organization became known as IBM Global Business Services. In 2002, IBM Global Services acquired the management consulting and technology services arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, around the same time some of the other Big Four accounting firms were selling off their consulting arms (this was from intense pressure to avoid conflicts of interest in light of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). PwC's consultancy business was sold to IBM for approximately US$3.9 billion in cash and stock. This nearly doubled the number of consultants within IBM Global Services, adding 30,000 consultants in 52 countries. In 2016, IBM announced its planned acquisition of Promontory Financial Group in September 2016 and completed the transaction in November 2016. Organizational structure IBM Global Business Services is organized into three growth platforms which contain seven service lines: * Digital Strategy & Interactive: Digital Strategy, IBM iX * Cloud Application Innovation: ADM Innovation, Cloud Application Migration Services, Next Gen EA * Cognitive Process Transformation: Cognitive Business Decision Support, Cognitive Process Re-Engineering, Cognitive Process Services Acquisitions * PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Consulting, 2001 * Bluewolf, 2016 * Resource/Ammirati, 2016 * Promontory Financial Group, 2016 IBM Global Technology Services IBM Global Technology Services (GTS) provides information technology (IT) services for clients around the world. GTS professionals design, build, run and maintain critical infrastructure and systems across clients‚Äô IT environments. In recent years, GTS has expanded its capabilities in hybrid cloud and is applying automation and Watson in its services delivery, especially through the IBM Services Platform with Watson launched in July 2017. On October 8, 2020 IBM announced it was spinning off the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its GTS division into a new public company, an action expected to be completed by the end of 2021.

She was the youngest of four children. Her siblings were Mary, Helen, and Cornelius. Williams grew up in a poor neighborhood with music as an important part of her family. Even her grandfather, Alexander Carey, was a choir leader and singer. Her parents instilled an appreciation for music, church, and education during her childhood. By the age of eight, Camilla enjoyed playing the piano, and singing at school and Danville's Calvary Baptist Church. Williams trained at Virginia State College, now Virginia State University, and received her bachelor's degree in music education. After her college education, she left her job as a third grade teacher to study music in Philadelphia with a prestigious voice instructor, Marion Szekely Freschl. To help Williams pay for her new studies, Tossie P. Whiting, former English teacher of hers at Virginia State College, founded the Camilla Williams fund. She earned a Marian Anderson Award in 1943 and 1944, and she continued to receive honors in vocal competitions. Career Beginning in 1944, Williams performed on the coast-to-coast RCA radio network. In 1946 she was the first African American to receive a regular contract with a major American opera company, making her debut with the New York City Opera in the title role in Puccini's Madama Butterfly. Her performance was hailed by a critic for The New York Times as \\"an instant and pronounced success.\\" During her time at the New York City Opera, she performed Nedda in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Mimi in Puccini's La boh√®me, Marguerite in Gounod's Faust, Micaela in Bizet's Carmen, and the title role in Verdi's Aida.Elizabeth Nash. \\"A Day with Camilla Williams\\", Opera Quarterly 18, no. 2 (2002): 219‚Äì230 Williams sang throughout the United States and Europe with various other opera companies. In 1951 she sang Bess in the landmark, first complete recording of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, alongside bass-baritone Lawrence Winters and conductor Lehman Engel. Though she enjoyed the recording experience, she believed strongly that the work ought to be restaged to better portray contemporary African American life, reflecting her decision to refrain from performing the work on stage. In 1954 she became the first African American to sing a major role with the Vienna State Opera, and performed her signature role in Madama Butterfly. In August 1963, as part of the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, she sang \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at the White House and, when scheduled performer Marian Anderson was delayed trying to get through the gathered throngs, Williams sang the anthem before 250,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial, preceding Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. A noted concert artist, Williams toured throughout the United States, Latin America, in fourteen African countries, as well as numerous countries in Asia: Formosa, South Korea, China, Japan, Laos, South Vietnam, the Philippines, New Zealand and Australia. In addition, she was a soloist with the Royal Philharmonic, BBC Symphony, Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. In 1950 she recorded Mahler's Symphony No. 8 with Stokowski and the New York Philharmonic. During the 1970s, Williams taught voice at many places, including Brooklyn College, Bronx College, Queens College, Talent Unlimited, and Danville Museum of Fine Arts. Williams was the first African-American Professor of Voice appointed to the voice faculty of what is now known as the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in 1977. In 1984 she became the first African-American instructor at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China. In 1997 Camilla Williams became a Professor Emerita of Voice at Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, but continued to teach privately. Marriage and family In 1950, Williams married Charles T. Beavers, a civil rights lawyer who worked closely with Malcolm X. He died in 1969. From 2000 to 2011, she lived in companionship with her accompanist Boris Bazala, from Bulgaria.

W. Murnau, starring G√∂sta Ekman as Faust, Emil Jannings as Mephisto, Camilla Horn as Gretchen/Marguerite, Frida Richard as her mother, Wilhelm Dieterle as her brother and Yvette Guilbert as Marthe Schwerdtlein, her aunt. Murnau's film draws on older traditions of the legendary tale of Faust as well as on Goethe's classic 1808 version. Ufa wanted Ludwig Berger to direct Faust, as Murnau was engaged with Variety; Murnau pressured the producer and, backed by Jannings, eventually persuaded Erich Pommer to let him direct the film. Faust was Murnau's last German film, and directly afterward he moved to the US under contract to William Fox to direct Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927); when the film premiered in the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin, Murnau was already shooting in Hollywood. It has been praised for its special effects and is regarded as an example of German Expressionist film. Plot The demon Mephisto has a bet with an Archangel that he can corrupt a righteous man's soul and destroy in him what is divine. If he succeeds, the Devil will win dominion over earth. The Devil delivers a plague to the village where Faust, an elderly alchemist, lives. Though he prays to stop the death and starvation, nothing happens. Disheartened, Faust throws his alchemy books in the fire, and then the Bible too. One book opens, showing how to have power and glory by making a pact with the Devil. He goes to a crossroads as described in the book's procedure and conjures up the forces of evil. When Mephisto appears at the roadside, he induces Faust to make a trial, 24-hour bargain with the Devil. Faust will have Mephisto's service till the sand runs out in an hourglass, at which time the Devil will rescind the pact. At first, Faust uses his new power to help the people of the village, but they shun him when they find out that he cannot face a cross. They stone him and he takes shelter in his home. Faust then makes a further deal with Mephisto, who gives Faust back his youth and offers him earthly pleasures and a kingdom, in return for his immortal soul. Mephisto tempts Faust with the vision of a beautiful woman. He then takes him to a wedding feast in Parma, to meet the subject of his vision, an Italian Duchess. Faust departs with her, leaving the Devil to kill her groom. Just as Faust is making love to her the sands run out. He is obliged to seal the deal permanently in order to continue his love-making; he is Mephisto's forever. Faust soon grows weary of debauchery and yearns for \\"Home\\". Here Faust falls in love with an innocent girl, Gretchen, who is charmed into loving Faust by a golden chain left by the Devil. Faust comes to Gretchen's room. The devil rouses the mother who sees them and drops dead from shock. The devil then incites her soldier brother, Valentin, to run home to catch her lover. Valentin and Faust fight a duel. The Devil intervenes and stabs Valentin in the back. He then goes around town shouting \\"murder\\". Faust and Mephisto flee on the back of a hellish steed. Valentin condemns Faust for his murder and his sister as a harlot in his dying breath. She is put in the stocks and subjected to jeering. The girl has a child (by Faust) and ends up in the streets. In a blizzard she sees a vision of a warm cradle and lays her child down on the snow, where the child dies. Soldiers find her and she is sent to the stake as a murderess. Faust sees what is happening and demands Mephisto take him there. Faust arrives just as the fire has been started to burn his lover. Faust wishes he had never asked to have his youth back. Mephisto smashes the mirror with Faust's reflection and he loses his youth. He runs through the assembled mob towards Gretchen; and it is as an old man that Faust throws himself onto the fire to be with his beloved. Gretchen recognizes Faust and sees him in her heart as a young man again as the fire consumes them together. Their spirits rise to the heavens. The angel reveals to Mephisto that he has lost the bet because Love has triumphed over all.

Filming took six months, at a cost of 2 million marks (only half was recovered at the box office). According to film historians, Faust seriously affected studio shooting and special effects techniques. Murnau uses two cameras, both filming multiple shots; many scenes were filmed time and again. As an example, a short sequence of the contract being written on parchment in fire took an entire day to film. Intertitles The task of writing the intertitles was originally assigned to , a German novelist and playwright who had moved into screenwriting. He decided to combine various lines from the original folk tale, Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and Goethe's Faust, Part 1, as well as providing some of his own. However, his efforts were disliked by the Ufa production team, and Gerhart Hauptmann, one of Germany's leading playwrights and winner of the Nobel prize for literature, was engaged instead. Hauptmann agreed to write his own completely new intertitles for 40,000 marks, twice what Ufa had offered. Kyser found out, and there was an exchange of vituperative letters between the two writers. The film received a pre-release showing with Hauptmann's intertitles at the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz on 26 August 1926. Unfortunately, Ufa's directors felt that Hauptmann's titles were even worse: Ufa informed Hauptmann just a week before the premiere of \\"unexpected difficulties\\", and in the end Faust opened with Kyser's intertitles at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo on 14 October 1926. Hauptmann's verses were separately printed as a brochure for sale in cinemas. Variant cuts There were several versions created of Faust, several of them prepared by Murnau himself. The versions are quite different from one another. Some scenes have variants on pace, others have actors with different costumes and some use different camera angles. For example, a scene with a bear was shot with both a person in costume and an actual bear. In some versions, the bear simply stands there. In one version, it actually strikes an actor. Overall, five versions of Faust are known to exist out of the over thirty copies found across the globe: a German original version (of which the only surviving copy is in the Danish Film Institute), a French version, a late German version which exists in two copies, a bilingual version for Europe prepared by Ufa, and a version prepared by Murnau himself for MGM and the US market (July 1926). Restoration and versions known to exist The copy of the original German version lacks a number of scenes. With the copies available, a 106-minute reconstructed version has been released by Kino International with English intertitles on DVD. A commentary is also an optional extra on the DVD. The original intertitles have also been recovered. The US version includes titles and scenes filmed especially by Murnau, where for example the scene in which Aunt Marthe offers Mephisto a drink that he rejects as causing heartburn: in the US version, Mephisto rejects the drink for having had alcohol, an ironic reference to Prohibition in the United States; again in the US version, Mephisto offers Marta a necklace, from the Great Khan of the Tartars, rather than the cousin from Lombardy, as Murnau believed the US audience would not have heard of Lombardy. One scene was done with a text juxtaposition, as again, Murnau believed the American audience wouldn't grasp the imagery by itself. This is also the only version having the originally conceived finale of the ascension of Faust and Gretchen into Heaven. In all others, the scene is rather more conceptual. Books appearing in the film were labeled or any plans with text were shot twice, in German and in English. The bilingual version was prepared to be shown aboard trans-Atlantic ships traveling from Hamburg to New York City. Therefore, they catered to both American and German audiences. The French version is generally believed to represent the poorest choice of scenes, both including the largest number of filming errors (e.g., showing assistants holding doors, actors slipping, Gretchen stepping on her dress, showing the stage maquette). It does hold takes that do not exist in any other versions, however. Reception Faust was a \\"financial flop\\". German critics disliked the adaptation from its source texts and Gosta Ekman's performance. In later years, the film has been called one of seven \\"canonical examples of German Expressionist cinema\\". Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, based on , with a rating average of 8.59/10. A 2006 review in The New York Times called it \\"one of the most astonishing visual experiences the silent cinema has to offer.\\" Japanese film director Shinji Aoyama listed Faust as one of ten greatest films of all time in 2012. He said, \\"I always want to remember that movies are made out of the joy of the replica. The fascination of movies is not their realism, but how to enjoy the \\"real\\". In that sense, I always have Faust in my mind as I face a movie, make a movie, and talk about a movie.\\" Legacy The Readers Library Publishing Company published in 1926 a \\"Readers Library Film Edition\\", an adaptation of the film plot to novel form written by Hayter Preston and Henry Savage. The \\"Bald Mountain\\" scene served as the inspiration for the \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" sequence in Walt Disney's 1940 animated film Fantasia. Notes * In 1995, the American Composer Timothy Brock composed a soundtrack to the film, which has been released on CD by K Records. * In 2003, a DVD was released in Spain, containing a detailed documentary by Filmoteca Espa√±ola on the making of Faust, as well as a comparative analysis of the several copies and versions released. * In 2004, British musician and composer Geoff Smith composed a new soundtrack to the film for the hammered dulcimer, which he performed live as an accompaniment to the film. * In 2005, a DVD was released featuring new music written by Dutch jazz composer Willem Breuker.

Bethany, located in Richmond, Indiana, is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. History The seminary was founded in 1905 as Bethany Biblical Seminary by A.C. Wieand and E. B. Hoff. While the two were traveling in the Holy Land overlooking the village of Bethany from the Mount of Olives in 1901‚Äì02, they decided to name the new Bible institute Bethany. In 1994, the seminary moved from Oak Brook, Illinois, to Richmond, Indiana, to form a partnership with the Earlham School of Religion, a Christian theological school in the Quaker tradition. Educational opportunities Bethany offers students opportunities for a degree in ministry in the form of Master of Divinity and one in research through the Master of Arts degree. Students can further refine their field of study through a degree emphasis in Peace Studies or Ministry With Youth and Young Adults. Peace-related courses cover topics ranging from non-violence and the biblical story, to peace witness in the Anabaptist/Pietist tradition, to mediating conflict in families and churches, to peacemaking in national and international arenas. Master of Divinity students pursuing a degree emphasis in Ministry With Youth and Young Adults complete a practicum experience, and Master of Arts students focus their thesis on youth and young adult ministry. Bethany emphasizes peace, service, simple living, and the importance of the faith community. Along with the Quakers and Mennonites, the Church of the Brethren is an historic peace church, conscientiously opposed to all war, and intentional about working with peacemaking and reconciliation concerns. Several Bethany professionals and graduates are also associated with a renewed interest in theopoetics. Students in either the Master of Divinity or Master of Arts programs can now enroll as residential or Connections students. Connections is designed for persons who cannot relocate to Richmond, and who can commit to taking a mix of classes online, offsite, and on campus as weekend or two-week intensives. One of the primary locations for off-site Bethany courses is the Susquehanna Valley Ministry Center, on the campus of Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. Bethany partners with a wide circle of theological schools to further enhance graduate-level educational opportunities.

Models can be used to represent the desired behavior of a system under test (SUT), or to represent testing strategies and a test environment. The picture on the right depicts the former approach. A model describing a SUT is usually an abstract, partial presentation of the SUT's desired behavior. Test cases derived from such a model are functional tests on the same level of abstraction as the model. These test cases are collectively known as an abstract test suite. An abstract test suite cannot be directly executed against an SUT because the suite is on the wrong level of abstraction. An executable test suite needs to be derived from a corresponding abstract test suite. The executable test suite can communicate directly with the system under test. This is achieved by mapping the abstract test cases to concrete test cases suitable for execution. In some model-based testing environments, models contain enough information to generate executable test suites directly. In others, elements in the abstract test suite must be mapped to specific statements or method calls in the software to create a concrete test suite. This is called solving the \\"mapping problem\\".Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt. Introduction to Software Testing. Cambridge University Press, 2008. In the case of online testing (see below), abstract test suites exist only conceptually but not as explicit artifacts. Tests can be derived from models in different ways. Because testing is usually experimental and based on heuristics, there is no known single best approach for test derivation. It is common to consolidate all test derivation related parameters into a package that is often known as \\"test requirements\\", \\"test purpose\\" or even \\"use case(s)\\". This package can contain information about those parts of a model that should be focused on, or the conditions for finishing testing (test stopping criteria). Because test suites are derived from models and not from source code, model-based testing is usually seen as one form of black-box testing. Model-based testing for complex software systems is still an evolving field. Models Especially in Model Driven Engineering or in Object Management Group's (OMG's) model-driven architecture, models are built before or parallel with the corresponding systems. Models can also be constructed from completed systems. Typical modeling languages for test generation include UML, SysML, mainstream programming languages, finite machine notations, and mathematical formalisms such as Z, B (Event-B), Alloy or Coq. Deploying model-based testing An example of a model-based testing workflow (offline test case generation). IXIT refers to implementation extra information and refers to information needed to convert an abstract test suite into an executable one. Typically, IXIT contains information on the test harness, data mappings and SUT configuration. There are various known ways to deploy model-based testing, which include online testing, offline generation of executable tests, and offline generation of manually deployable tests.Practical Model-Based Testing: A Tools Approach , Mark Utting and Bruno Legeard, , Morgan-Kaufmann 2007 Online testing means that a model-based testing tool connects directly to an SUT and tests it dynamically. Offline generation of executable tests means that a model-based testing tool generates test cases as computer-readable assets that can be later run automatically; for example, a collection of Python classes that embodies the generated testing logic. Offline generation of manually deployable tests means that a model-based testing tool generates test cases as human-readable assets that can later assist in manual testing; for instance, a PDF document in a human language describing the generated test steps. Deriving tests algorithmically The effectiveness of model-based testing is primarily due to the potential for automation it offers. If a model is machine-readable and formal to the extent that it has a well-defined behavioral interpretation, test cases can in principle be derived mechanically. From finite state machines Often the model is translated to or interpreted as a finite state automaton or a state transition system. This automaton represents the possible configurations of the system under test. To find test cases, the automaton is searched for executable paths. A possible execution path can serve as a test case. This method works if the model is deterministic or can be transformed into a deterministic one. Valuable off-nominal test cases may be obtained by leveraging unspecified transitions in these models. Depending on the complexity of the system under test and the corresponding model the number of paths can be very large, because of the huge amount of possible configurations of the system. To find test cases that can cover an appropriate, but finite, number of paths, test criteria are needed to guide the selection. This technique was first proposed by Offutt and Abdurazik in the paper that started model-based testing.Jeff Offutt and Aynur Abdurazik. Generating Tests from UML Specifications. Second International Conference on the Unified Modeling Language (UML ‚Äô99), pages 416-429, Fort Collins, CO, October 1999. Multiple techniques for test case generation have been developed and are surveyed by Rushby.John Rushby. Automated Test Generation and Verified Software. Verified Software: Theories, Tools, Experiments: First IFIP TC 2/WG 2.3 Conference, VSTTE 2005, Zurich, Switzerland, October 10‚Äì13. pp. 161-172, Springer-Verlag Test criteria are described in terms of general graphs in the testing textbook. Theorem proving Theorem proving was originally used for automated proving of logical formulas. For model-based testing approaches, the system is modeled by a set of predicates, specifying the system's behavior. To derive test cases, the model is partitioned into equivalence classes over the valid interpretation of the set of the predicates describing the system under test. Each class describes a certain system behavior, and, therefore, can serve as a test case. The simplest partitioning is with the disjunctive normal form approach wherein the logical expressions describing the system's behavior are transformed into the disjunctive normal form. Constraint logic programming and symbolic execution Constraint programming can be used to select test cases satisfying specific constraints by solving a set of constraints over a set of variables. The system is described by the means of constraints.Jefferson Offutt. Constraint-Based Automatic Test Data Generation. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 17:900-910, 1991 Solving the set of constraints can be done by Boolean solvers (e.g. SAT-solvers based on the Boolean satisfiability problem) or by numerical analysis, like the Gaussian elimination. A solution found by solving the set of constraints formulas can serve as a test cases for the corresponding system. Constraint programming can be combined with symbolic execution. In this approach a system model is executed symbolically, i.e. collecting data constraints over different control paths, and then using the constraint programming method for solving the constraints and producing test cases.Antti Huima. Implementing Conformiq Qtronic. Testing of Software and Communicating Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2007, Volume 4581/2007, 1-12, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-73066-8_1 Model checking Model checkers can also be used for test case generation.Gordon Fraser, Franz Wotawa, and Paul E. Ammann. Testing with model checkers: a survey. Software Testing, Verification and Reliability, 19(3):215‚Äì261, 2009. URL: Originally model checking was developed as a technique to check if a property of a specification is valid in a model. When used for testing, a model of the system under test, and a property to test is provided to the model checker. Within the procedure of proofing, if this property is valid in the model, the model checker detects witnesses and counterexamples. A witness is a path where the property is satisfied, whereas a counterexample is a path in the execution of the model where the property is violated. These paths can again be used as test cases. Test case generation by using a Markov chain test model Markov chains are an efficient way to handle Model-based Testing. Test models realized with Markov chains can be understood as a usage model: it is referred to as Usage/Statistical Model Based Testing. Usage models, so Markov chains, are mainly constructed of 2 artifacts : the Finite State Machine (FSM) which represents all possible usage scenario of the tested system and the Operational Profiles (OP) which qualify the FSM to represent how the system is or will be used statistically. The first (FSM) helps to know what can be or has been tested and the second (OP) helps to derive operational test cases. Usage/Statistical Model-based Testing starts from the facts that is not possible to exhaustively test a system and that failure can appear with a very low rate.Helene Le Guen.

Durags are also used to keep wave patterns from shifting while sleeping.  History  Durags were originally worn by African American women laborers and slaves in the 19th century. In the 1930s, during the Harlem Renaissance and Great Depression, the durag was used to maintain hairstyles. After the Black Power Movement in the late 1960s, the durag became a fashion statement among African Americans, worn by rappers, athletes and men of all ages. In the 2000s, wearing durags in public lost popularity in certain areas, but maintained its popularity in others. However, because of rappers such as A$AP Ferg and the renewed popularity of waves, they regained their status. Today the durag is worn by all genders as a fashion statement or to maintain hairstyles.  Controversy  Some United States high schools attempted to ban the wearing of durags. When John Muir High School in Pasadena, California, banned durags as part of a school dress-code policy, the Black Student Union staged a peaceful walk-out in February 2019. Protesting students contended that school administrators banned the head-wear because of its affiliation with gang culture, although the principal claimed that durags were banned because \\"of values we have for how we present ourselves at school\\". In 2001, the National Football League banned its players from wearing durags and bandanas underneath their helmets.  Etymology  Merriam-Webster placed the earliest usage of \\"do-rag\\" in 1968. However, The New York Times claims that the true spelling of the word is \\"durag,\\" and its popularity began in the 1970s. An alternative etymology claimed that \\"do-rag\\" is \\"dew-rag\\", and \\"dew\\" is a euphemism for sweat. ;Earlier usage * In the August 27, 1965 edition of LIFE magazine, a page 22 photo caption describes a man wearing a \\"do-rag on his new hair-do\\". * On June 4, 1966, the Akron Beacon Journal printed \\"do rag ... a cloth band worn around the forehead as a sweatband or to keep hair in place\\". * In late 1966, \\"do rag ... processed hair done up in black rags\\" appeared in Newsweek. In popular culture  Master P wearing a durag American singer and bassist Thundercat's album It Is What It Is features the song entitled \\"Dragonball Durag\\".

FGC tours heavily and as of June 2006, they have played in 28 states totaling over 400 shows. History Family Groove Company (FGC) started out in January 2001 when Adam Lewis (guitar) and Jordan Wilkow (keyboards) met Janis Wallin (bass) and Mattias Blanck (drums) while studying music at the Musician's Institute in Los Angeles, California. It wasn't long before they recorded their first demo recording and began performing throughout Southern California. The band began touring quite a bit throughout the Western U.S. with regular appearances in San Diego, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon. In Spring 2002, the band released their 10-track debut album, Reachin'. With the number of markets available to the band limited by the vast expanse of the American west, in the fall of 2002, FGC made the decision to relocate to Chicago, Illinois. Since then, the band has pursued an aggressive touring schedule that has included headlining performances, \\"opening band\\" exposure opportunities, and high-profile appearances at festivals like Summerfest, the 10,000 Lakes Festival, and Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, IL. After playing almost 400 more shows and adding over 50 songs to their playlists since their first release, FGC released their second studio album, The Charmer, on April 25, 2006. The Charmer was recorded at Studio Chicago, in Chicago, Illinois in December 2005 with overdubs in January and February 2006. All that touring produced numerous songs. In all, fourteen songs made the cut and are on the album. The music Family Groove Company integrates the groove sensibility developed by James Brown and Herbie Hancock, with the more traditional song structure and consciousness of the hook revolutionized by the Beatles. FGC has avoided the jam band formula of the hip-hop/funk/rock groove combined with endless guitar solos. Their focus has been to supplement their passion for improvisation with an attentiveness to composition. FGC feels that compositional coherence and ingenuity are every bit as important as the \\"jam\\" that has come to be the namesake of their genre.

He also worked as an assistant librarian at the Library of Congress. Biography Murray was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 3, 1852. In 1861, he went to work at the United States Senate Restaurant managed by his brother who was also a caterer. He joined the professional staff of the Library of Congress in 1871. He was eighteen years old, and only the second Black American to work for the Library. Murray became the personal assistant to the Librarian of Congress, Ainsworth Rand Spofford at the age of nineteen. By 1881, he had risen to become assistant librarian, a position he held for forty-one years. Murray married educator Anna Jane Evans (1858 - 1955) on April 2, 1879, with whom he had seven children (five lived to adulthood); the couple became a major force in the social and civic life of the District of Columbia. African American writings Murray began to compile a collection of books and pamphlets authored by African Americans at the request of Herbert Putnam, the successor to Spofford. The collection of work by \\"Negro Authors\\" was to be a part of The Exhibit of American Negroes at the 1900 Paris Exposition. In 1900 Murray published a list of the collections' holdings to date and appealed for additions to the list through donations. Within several months, his list had grown to eleven hundred titles. The Library of Congress's \\"Colored Authors' Collection\\" originated from his efforts. Now known as the \\"Daniel A. P. Murray Pamphlet Collection\\", it contains works dating from 1821 by such authors as Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Benjamin W. Arnett, and Alexander Crummell. Murray planned to expand his collection and create an encyclopedia of African-American achievement; unfortunately, the project never received sufficient support to become a reality. African American affairs Murray was widely acknowledged as an authority on African-American concerns. He was the first African-American member of the Washington Board of Trade, and he testified before the House of Representatives about Jim Crow laws and the migration of African-Americans from rural locations to urban areas. He was twice a delegate to the Republican National Convention and was a member of many other councils and organizations. He was also a prolific author, and a frequent contributor to African American journals, in particular The Voice of the Negro. He was also well known for his writings on African American history, including his monumental but uncompleted Historical and Biographical Encyclopedia of the Colored Race. Murray's personal library of African American works was bequeathed to the Library of Congress upon his death March 31, 1925.

Until the mid-1990s they published their Swedish roleplaying games under the brand name √Ñventyrsspel (meaning \\"adventure games\\"). Publications They published much of their early material in the form of stapled books in G5 (169 by 239 mm) format in a box together with dice. They released the role-playing games Drakar och Demoner (1982), Mutant (1984) (with the later versions Mutant (1989) Mutant RYMD (1992) and Mutant Chronicles), Kult (1991), Chock (1985, a translation of Chill), Sagan om Ringen (1986, a translation of Middle-earth Role Playing) and Stj√§rnornas Krig (1988, a translation of the WEG Star Wars role-playing game). Target Games also published the miniature wargames Warzone and Chronopia, and several collectible card games including Doomtrooper. They also released three generic sourcebooks, Grymk√§fts f√§llor (1987) (translated from the classic game supplement Grimtooth's Traps), Stadsintermezzon (1988) and Skattkammaren (1988) as well as many adventures and sourcebooks for their games. Until the mid-1990s Target Games published their Swedish role-playing games under the brand name √Ñventyrsspel (meaning \\"adventure games\\"). Target Games was reconstructed in 1999 and ceased publication of all of its inventory and the intellectual property rights were transferred to the daughter company Paradox Entertainment, which later became an independent company. Some of the titles have since been licensed to new game companies. Beside role-playing games, the company had its own store chain named Tradition, a trade magazine named Sinkadus, published translated gamebooks (the Lone Wolf series among others) as well as publishing family board games (under the Casper trademark) and translated fantasy novels (beginning with a Conan the Barbarian book). Target Games also published at least three computer games (including one Drakar och Demoner game) before reconstruction. Original products=Drakar & Demoner The fantasy role-playing Drakar och Demoner (first edition published in 1982) was Target Games' best-selling series of games, today the Drakar och Demoner brand is owned by Swedish company Riotminds.Rollspel.nu The rules of the various Target Games editions of the game were all based on the Basic Role-Playing system, with the first editions being translations without major changes. The earlier editions didn't include any campaign setting except for some information about generic fantasy creatures and so on. Over time, different writers created the \\"Ereb Altor\\" campaign setting piecemeal in adventures and source books. For the fifth edition, released in 1994, a new setting was created, dubbed \\"Chronopia\\", that had a darker tone. Mutant 1989 version box cover The name Mutant was used for a series of related science fiction themed role-playing games. The 1984 version was set in a post-apocalyptic world similar to the one in Gamma World. Mutant 2 (1986) was an expansion module with more advanced rules. The 1989 version was a cyberpunk game while the later Mutant RYMD (1992) and Mutant Chronicles (first edition 1993) were science fantasy games set in the Solar System. These versions used variants of the Basic Role-Playing rule system. Later Mutant games include Underg√•ngens arvtagare (Heirs to the Apocalypse) by J√§rnringen, and √Ör Noll by Fria Ligan (who publishes the English-language version of that game, Mutant - Year Zero as Free League) Mutant Chronicles An offshoot of Mutant, as an rpg set in a dystopic future solar system, Mutant Chronicles evolved into a brand of its own. The Mutant Chronicles brand later became so popular that it spawned multiple spin- offs as well, most notably the Doomtrooper collectible card game as well as the Warzone miniature wargame. Kult Kult is a horror-themed game and was first released in 1991. The setting was inspired by Gnostic philosophy and horror films such as Hellraiser. The violent horror themes of the game made it a subject of controversy in Sweden on multiple occasions.From the parliament archives Bjorn.foxtail.nu (unofficial source).

Earlier air data computer systems were electromechanical computers, such as in the F-111. From 1968 to 1970, the first CADC to use custom digital integrated circuits was developed for the F-14. In the 1980s, the Standard Central Air Data Computer (SCADC) was developed to retrofit U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft. F-14 CADC The MP944 chip set was the core of the CADC used to control the swing wings and flight controls of the F-14 Tomcat naval interceptor. The CADC was a multi- chip integrated flight control system developed by Garrett AiResearch and used in early versions of the US Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter. It is notable for early use of MOS custom integrated circuits and has been claimed as the first microprocessor. The CADC was designed and built by a team led by Steve Geller and Ray Holt, and supported by the startup American Microsystems. Design work started in 1968 and was completed in June 1970, beating out a number of electromechanical systems that had also been designed for the F-14. It was classified by the Navy until 1998. Ray Holt's story of this design and development is presented in his autobiography The Accidental Engineer. The CADC consisted of an A-to-D converter, several quartz pressure sensors, and a number of MOS-based microchips. Inputs to the system included the primary flight controls, a number of switches, static and dynamic air pressure (for calculating stall points and aircraft speed) and a temperature gauge. The outputs controlled the primary flight controls, wing sweep, the F-14's leading edge \\"glove\\", and the flaps. The MP944 ran at 375 KHz. It contained six chips used to build the CADC's microprocessor, all based on a 20-bit fixed-point- fraction two's complement number system. They were the parallel multiplier unit (PMU) in a 28-pin DIP, the parallel divider unit (PDU) (28-pin DIP), the random-access storage (RAS) (14-pin DIP), the read-only memory (ROM) (14-pin DIP), the special logic function (SLF) (28-pin DIP), and the steering logic unit (SLU) (28-pin DIP). The complete microprocessor system of 28 circuits consists of 1 PMU, 1 PDU, 1 SLF, 3 RASs, 3 SLUs, and 19 ROMs. In 1971, Holt wrote an article about the system for Computer Design magazine,1971 paper on the CADC (which was classified and never published) but the Navy classified it, and finally released it in 1998. For this reason, the CADC and MP944 remain fairly obscure in spite of their historical importance.

The use of the term is now generally restricted to those asking for admission into a monastery or a religious institute, both before actual admission and for the period of time preceding their admission into the novitiate. Currently, however, common usage terms the person who has not yet been accepted by the institution as an \\"inquirer\\" or \\"observer\\". The term is most commonly used in the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion (which includes the Episcopal Church, which uses the term to designate those who are seeking ordination to the diaconate or priesthood. Postulancy is generally considered the first formal step leading to candidacy and ordination). The Eastern Orthodox Churches uses this term less frequently.  Service and purpose  The length of time that a prospective candidate remains a postulant may vary depending on the institution, or the postulant's individual situation. Among active religious institutions, it typically lasted 4‚Äì6 months. At present, many monasteries have a candidate spend 1‚Äì2 years in this stage. During this time, the postulant generally participates as fully as possible in the life of the community, joining the novices and professed members for work and prayer. Since the candidate is not a formal member of the institution at this stage, it is easier for a man or woman not fully certain about religious life to re-examine his or her intentions and commitment before entering the novitiate. Likewise, should the person be determined to be unsuited to the life, a postulant can be dismissed by an institution without the need for any formal procedure. The term is also sometimes used to describe the ecclesiastical status of a person who has discerned a call to the priesthood or to the diaconate and has received parish and diocesan endorsement. The candidate retains postulant status throughout seminary, until ordination to the transitional diaconate takes place. The postulant who will not pursue ordination into the priesthood is ordained into the vocational diaconate.  College fraternities  In college fraternities, the term postulant is also used to describe those who have yet to be initiated into the fraternity, while they are going through the process of becoming a brother or a sister.

It is situated just to the east of Basingstoke, and in the 2001 census had a population of 7,232. Its former name is Basing (which several neighbouring village signs highlight).  History  Old Basing was first settled around 700 by an Anglo- Saxon tribe known as the Basingas, who gave the village its name (the meaning being \\"Basa's people\\"). In the ninth century it was a royal estate and it was the site of the Battle of Basing on about 22 January 871, when a Viking army defeated King √Üthelred of Wessex and his brother, the future King Alfred the Great. It is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The centre of the village, The Street, contains many old houses, and St Mary's Church. The River Loddon, whose source is in Worting to the west of Basingstoke, flows through the village. Old Basing is perhaps best known for the ruins of Basing House which was built between 1532 and 1561 on the site of a Norman castle. It was the home of the Marquesses of Winchester for several generations before being destroyed after a 24-week siege during the English Civil War. Many names in modern Old Basing allude to the war, such as Cavalier Road and Musket Copse, as well as several sites named after Oliver Cromwell including Oliver's Battery and Cromwell Cottage. Oliver's, a fish and chip takeaway and restaurant is named after Les Oliver who opened the restaurant in the 1970s.. The route of the former Basingstoke Canal also ran around Basing House and then through and around parts of Old Basing. In 1967, the name of the village was changed to Old Basing. Starting in the 1980s, the Lychpit estate was developed to the north of the village, within the boundaries of the civil parish. In 2006, the name of the civil parish was changed to \\"Old Basing and Lychpit\\". Governance The village of Old Basing is part of the civil parish of Old Basing and Lychpit which in turn is part of the Basing ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non- metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council. The Basing ward elects three councillors to Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council and is part of the Basingstoke constituency in elections to Parliament. The current Member of Parliament for Basingstoke is Maria Miller (Conservative) and the current councillors are Onnalee Cubitt (Independent), Stephen Marks (Conservative) and Sven Godesen (Conservative). Entrance gate to the Basing House ruins, Old Basing.  Education  Old Basing provides both an infant school and a junior school. The junior school, named St Mary's, is aided by the Church of England. A new primary school has recently opened in nearby Lychpit. Children from Old Basing proceed to a variety of secondary schools in the Basingstoke area.  Sport  Basing Rovers F.C. is the local football team, founded in 1886. The Recreation Ground in Old Basing is the location for a variety of sporting events as well as the Old Basing Carnival. There are rugby union and football pitches which overlap a cricket ground in addition to five tennis courts (of which one is free), an archery area and a lawn bowling green.

As a professor at Princeton University, he taught and advised many of the contributors to the Golden Age of differential topology, and he played an important role in the modernization and main-streaming of knot theory. Biography Ralph Fox attended Swarthmore College for two years, while studying piano at the Leefson Conservatory of Music in Philadelphia. He earned a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University, and a Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1939. His doctoral dissertation, On the Lusternick-Schnirelmann Category, was directed by Solomon Lefschetz. (In later years he disclaimed all knowledge of Lusternik‚ÄìSchnirelmann category, and certainly never published on the subject again.) He directed 21 doctoral dissertations, including those of John Milnor, John Stallings, Francisco Gonz√°lez-Acu√±a, Guillermo Torres-Diaz and Barry Mazur. He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mathematical contributions include Fox n-coloring of knots, the Fox-Artin arc, and the free differential calculus. He also identified the compact-open topology on function spaces as being particularly appropriate for homotopy theory. Aside from his strictly mathematical contributions, he was responsible for introducing several basic phrases to knot theory: the phrases slice knot, ribbon knot, and Seifert circle all appear in print for the first time under his name, and he also popularized (if he did not introduce) the phrase Seifert surface. He popularized the playing of the game of Go at both Princeton and the Institute for Advanced Study. Selected publications * Introduction to Knot Theory, Richard H. Crowell and Ralph H.

He discovered bradykinin, an endogenous polypeptide involved in the physiology, pharmacology and pathology of blood pressure control and many other phenomena related to the contraction of smooth muscles. Life Rocha e Silva was the son of a psychiatrist, Jo√£o Olavo da Rocha e Silva. He studied at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Brazil (later Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), lecturing in high schools while he was a student in order to support himself. Shortly after graduation he moved in 1937 to S√£o Paulo, and was hired by the Instituto Biol√≥gico (Biological Institute), a state research institution. From 1940 to 1941, Rocha e Silva won a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to go to London, England, where he studied and worked with Heinz Schild at the University College London. In 1942 he returned to the Instituto Biol√≥gico and continued his research line on the role of histamine in the effects of animal venoms. At the Institute, he was soon appointed as the chairman of the Section of Biochemistry and Pharmacodynamics, a position he held until 1957. In that year, Rocha e Silva was invited to be the chairman of the Department of Pharmacology of the recently created Faculty of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto of the University of S√£o Paulo, in the city of Ribeir√£o Preto, state of S√£o Paulo, a position he held until his mandatory retirement in 1980. His health condition worsened shortly thereafter, and he died on 19 December 1983, at the age of 73. Rocha e Silva was one of the greatest scientific and academic leaders of recent history in Brazil. In 1948, with a group of fellow scientists, such as Jos√© Reis, Paulo Sawaya and Gast√£o Rosenfeld, he founded the Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ci√™ncia (SBPC ‚Äì Brazilian Society of the Advancement of Science), similar in scope and philosophy to its British and American (AAAS) counterparts. He was to become three times president of SBPC and its lifetime honorary president. Rocha e Silva was also a founding member of the Brazilian Society of Physiology, in 1957; and of the Brazilian Society of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, in 1966 (to which he served as president from 1966 to 1981). In 1967 he won the Moinho Santista Award (the highest scientific decoration at the time in Brazil) as well as the National Award of Science and Technology from the National Research Council (CNPq). He was also a vice-president of the International Union of Pharmacology. Work Together with colleagues Wilson Teixeira Beraldo and Gast√£o Rosenfeld, Rocha e Silva discovered in 1948 the powerful hypotensive effects of bradykinin in animal preparations. Bradykinin was detected in the plasma of animals after the addition of venom of Bothrops jararaca (Brazilian lancehead snake), which was brought by Rosenfeld from the Butantan Institute, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. This discovery was part of a continuing study on circulatory shock and proteolytic enzymes related to the toxicology of snake bites, started by Rocha e Silva as early as 1939. Bradykinin was to be proved a new autopharmacological principle, i.e., a substance that is released in the body by a metabolic modification from precursors, which are pharmacologically active. According to B.J. Hagwood, Rocha e Silva's biographer, \\"The discovery of bradykinin has led to a new understanding of many physiological and pathological phenomena including circulatory shock induced by venoms and toxins.\\" The practical importance of the discovery of bradykinin became apparent when one of his collaborators at Ribeir√£o Preto, S√©rgio Henrique Ferreira, discovered a bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) in the bothropic venom which increases powerfully both the duration and magnitude of its effects on vasodilation and the consequent fall in blood pressure. On the basis of this finding, Squibb scientists developed the first of a new generation of highly-effective anti-hypertensive drugs, the so-called ACE inhibitors, such as captopril (trademarked Capoten), which have been saving many lives since. Rocha e Silva had many interests besides scientific research and pharmacology. He was an accomplished amateur painter and a writer of fiction and non-fiction. He was interested in the public understanding of science, and wrote articles and books to the general public. He was also one of the founders of \\"Ci√™ncia e Cultura\\", the science magazine of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (SBPC).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 1996. In the episode, Bart makes his own fake driver's license. He rents a car with it and takes Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson on a road trip to Knoxville, Tennessee. Their car is destroyed, leaving them stranded. To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant and ships it via courier from Knoxville, with the boys stowed away inside the crate. The episode was written by Richard Appel, and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. The idea of a road trip was \\"so exciting\\" that the writers immediately knew they wanted to write it. The episode features cultural references to the 1991 film Naked Lunch, American singer Andy Williams, and Look magazine. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics; Central Michigan Life named it the eighth-best episode of the series. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 7.2, and was the fifth-highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot Principal Skinner sends the Springfield Elementary students on a \\"go to work with your parents day\\". Unable to stay home with Marge because school forms state that homemaker is not a \\"real job\\", Bart goes to the DMV with Patty and Selma, and Lisa goes to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant with Homer. At the DMV, Bart makes himself a fake driver's license, which he, Nelson, Martin, and Milhouse use to rent a car. Using an alibi concocted by Bart, the boys tell their parents they are travelling to the National Grammar Rodeo in Canada. Instead they use the rented car for a road trip to the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. Once they arrive, they discover the fair was held fourteen years earlier; all that remains is a wig outlet. The boys each buy a wig and Martin spends the last of their money on an Al Gore doll. When Nelson accidentally knocks the Sunsphere (renamed the Wigsphere) on their car, crushing it, they are left stranded. Bart places a collect call to Lisa ‚Äî who has spent the entire spring break with Homer at work ‚Äî to help him return home while concealing the ordeal from their parents. On her advice, Bart becomes a courier, but he fails to earn enough money to get home. When he is spotted by Skinner during his first assignment flying organ transplants to Hong Kong, Bart again asks Lisa for help. After making Homer promise he will not get upset, Lisa reveals Bart's predicament. To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant from Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He ships it from nearby Knoxville, with Bart as the courier and the boys stowed inside the crate. While Lisa and Homer quietly fume at Bart at the dinner table, Marge remains clueless about his misadventures. At night, Marge receives telephone calls alluding to Bart's mishaps from Principal Skinner, the Tennessee State Police, and the courier service. Homer nervously ducks under the covers and quietly laughs as Marge remains oblivious. Production The writers decided that the characters would go to a \\"funny unlikely place\\", the Sunsphere in Knoxville, Tennessee The episode was written by Richard Appel, who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a \\"go to work with your parents day\\" and Bart getting a driver's license. The \\"go to work with your parents day\\" idea appealed to Appel because it was something he \\"lost the right\\" to do when he went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he \\"didn't have to do anything\\" at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger. The writing staff had never done a spring break episode before so they thought, \\"What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?\\" and came up with the road trip plot. Bill Oakley, the show runner of The Simpsons at the time, said that road trips were something that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was \\"so exciting\\" that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children would go, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a \\"funny unlikely place\\". Oakley's show runner partner, Josh Weinstein, said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show. Homer and Lisa had not been done \\"too often\\" and they wanted the two characters to bond and get closer to each other. The episode was directed by Swinton O. Scott III. It was difficult to animate because the animators had to draw completely new designs for the locations outside of Springfield, such as Knoxville. The car scenes were also difficult to animate. At the time, The Simpsons was using traditional animation without computers, but they had to get one for a scene where the camera spins around the car from above. The car was difficult to animate because it had to \\"look real\\" and not \\"boxy like a truck\\". The car was based on a 1993 Oldsmobile car with rounded edges. The Simpsons animator David Silverman said that the episode was \\"probably the most difficult one\\" Scott had to direct on the show. Cultural references Bart and his friends use Bart's fake license to see the R-rated 1991 film Naked Lunch, an adaptation of William Burroughs's novel dealing with heroin addiction, homosexuality, and hallucinogens. While leaving the theater after viewing the film, Nelson Muntz remarks, \\"I can think of at least two things wrong with that title.\\" The boys also see an Andy Williams concert in Branson, Missouri, and the marquee advertising it outside reads \\"Wow, he's still got it ‚Äì Look magazine\\", with Look having been out of business for 25 years when the episode first aired.. On the road, the boys pick up a hitchhiker, who is based on the hitchhiker in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre horror film series. Principal Skinner books a vacation with AmeriWestica, a parody of America West Airlines. ‚ÄúRadar Love‚Äù by Dutch rock band Golden Earring, is also heard. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Bart on the Road\\" finished 63rd in the ratings for the week of March 25 to March 31, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 7.2. Retrieved on January 6, 2009. The episode was the fifth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, Cops, Party of Five, Martin, and Melrose Place. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it \\"contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average.\\" Dave Foster of DVD Times said that \\"Bart on the Road\\" is an episode which is built upon a \\"frankly ludicrous\\" idea which if the writers were to \\"stumble upon\\" now, \\"we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup a great deal of consideration both on and off the screen.\\" He thought the story was \\"partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of.\\" Foster thinks, \\"what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he \\"loves\\" the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, \\"and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me.\\" Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: \\"Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays.\\" Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it \\"outstanding\\" and summarizing his review with: \\"‚ÄôBart on the Road‚Äô is a fun trip and very funny, but it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable.\\"Canning, Robert (July 22, 2009).

Most were single units but one was a three- car articulated set. Single units The LMS bought three four-wheel diesel railcars from Leyland in 1933. They were numbered 29950‚Äì29952 in the multiple unit section of the LMS carriage number series. Each had a diesel engine. After trials between and they worked from to and and subsequently at in Lanarkshire. They passed to British Railways when the LMS was nationalised. BR withdrew them in 1951, so they never received TOPS classification. An Armstrong Whitworth diesel-electric railcar operated a luxury 12-seat express service on the LMS for two weeks in 1933 between London and Castle Bromwich near Birmingham in connection with a British Industries Fair. This car, with body work by Cravens which incorporated a kitchen, was powered by a standard Armstrong-Saurer 250 bhp engine. Between 1936 and 1937 the LMS trialled two experimental railcars built by Armstrong Siddeley to a French design, which had Michelin pneumatic tyres. These were tested on the Leamington to Nuneaton route. Despite proving popular with passengers and crew, no orders happened, and they were withdrawn in 1937. Articulated unit In 1937 the LMS decided to produce a more modern diesel train for itself. This was a three-car articulated railcar that was outshopped from Derby Carriage and Wagon Works in 1939. The cars were numbered 80000, 80001 and 80002. The streamlined three-car train was a single articulated unit; the two outer coaches were each long and rested on a centre coach that was long. The articulation was an idea that had been already taken up by Sir William Stanier for some locomotive hauled stock. Mechanically the train was a development of railcars that had entered service from 1933 on the LMS Northern Counties Committee's (NCC) lines in Northern Ireland, using an identical arrangement of in-line powertrain as NCC railcars Nos. 2‚Äì4. Under each coach were two vertically mounted Leyland diesel engines driving the inner axle of each bogie through a Lysholm-Smith torque converter. There were six engines for the three-car set which gave a total power of . The whole unit weighed 73 long tons, so this yielded a power/weight ratio of slightly more than 10 bhp/ton which provided a main line standard of performance with a maximum speed of . It worked first on the Varsity Line between and , and then on ‚Äì services. A second unit was planned but never built. 80000‚Äì80001‚Äì80002 was withdrawn on the outbreak of World War II in 1939, stored, and never re-entered passenger service. Overhead line maintenance train In 1949 BR converted the articulated unit to a two-car set for overhead line maintenance. The centre car was removed and the number of engines in the set reduced to two. The driving cabs were given flat ends. To enable engineering staff to work on the overhead cables the roofs of the two coaches were flattened, creating a work space long and wide. Between the two cars a manually-operated lift was installed that could be raised to above roof level. One coach was converted into a workshop with all passenger seats removed and workbench facilities installed. The other coach was converted into staff accommodation with lockers, cooking, washing facilities and a WC, and 12 seats with tables as a mess saloon. An old coach was converted to carry of overhead wire and attached to the unit as a trailer. Portable floodlights for night work were installed in the two coaches and in the trailer. The unit worked on the Manchester ‚Äì Altrincham line. It was moved to Longsight Depot in 1959 and taken out of service shortly afterwards. It still existed in a derelict state as late as 1967. The design may be seen as a step in the development of post-war British Railways diesel multiple units (DMU) such as the Derby Lightweight units, at least as far the powertrain is concerned.

Douglas was an all-rounder who played for Essex County Cricket Club from 1901 to 1928 and captained the county from 1911 to 1928. He also played for England and captained the England team both before and after the First World War with markedly different success. As well as playing cricket, Douglas was a notable amateur boxer who won the middleweight gold medal at the 1908 Olympic Games. Early life Douglas was the son of John Herbert Douglas (1853-1930) and Julia Ann (n√©e Tyler) and was born at Stoke Newington, London in what is now Belfast Road. He was educated at Moulton Grammar School and Felsted School and joined his father's wood-importing firm, which supported his amateur status in cricket and boxing. Douglas also played football once for the England amateur side (occasion unknown, through loss of records). He served in the Bedfordshire Regiment throughout World War I, eventually as major (acting lieutenant-colonel). Boxing career In 1908 Douglas won an Olympic gold medal as a middleweight boxer. All three of his bouts, including the final, described by The Times as \\"one of the most brilliant exhibitions of skilful boxing, allied to tremendous hitting, ever seen.\\", were held on the same day. The silver medal winner, Snowy Baker, 44 years later falsely claimed that Douglas's father was the sole judge and referee. Baker never publicly contested the close points verdict which Douglas, who scored a second-round knockdown over him and won in their Olympic final. Yet, in a 1952 interview, he claimed that Douglas's father had refereed the fight, leading to widespread suspicion of a dodgy decision. In reality Douglas senior was at ringside, to present the medals, in his role as president of the Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA). The real referee was Eugene Corri, who did not have to give a casting vote as the two judges agreed that Douglas was a narrow winner. Douglas Jr, his father and his younger brother, Cecil ('Pickles') were all prominent referees and officials in the ABA, the last also being the leading referee in the professional sport in the 1930s. Besides his Olympic gold, Douglas also won the 1905 ABA middleweight title.  Olympic results  * Defeated Ren√© Doudelle (France) KO round 1 * 2nd round bye * Defeated Ruben Warnes (Great Britain) KO round 2 * Defeated Snowy Baker (Australia) Decision Cricket career Douglas was an untiring fast-medium bowler and obdurate batsman who was nicknamed with a play on his initials JWHT as \\"Johnny Will Hit Today\\", or conversely \\"Johnny Won't Hit Today\\" by Australian hecklers. He captained the school teams at Felsted and was a member of Wanstead C.C. He played for Essex in 1902 and for London County in 1903. In 1904 he returned to Essex where he remained, captaining the side from 1911 to 1928. He played for England before and after the First World War. Douglas was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1915, but play was suspended during the war years. After the war until 1923 had to carry Essex's bowling on his shoulders except when George Louden turned out. He took over 100 wickets in a season seven times with a best of 147 in 1920. The following year against Derbyshire he produced perhaps the most remarkable all-round performance in English first- class cricket history. After taking nine for 47, Douglas stopped a breakdown against Bill Bestwick with an unbeaten 210 that tired him so much he did not bowl until the end of Derbyshire's second innings. He then took two for none, giving him a match record of eleven for 47. Douglas captained England eighteen times, with a Test match record of won eight, lost eight, drawn two. Successful as stand-in captain in Australia in 1911, he won the series 4‚Äì1. On the 1920/21 tour of Australia he led a depleted post-war side which suffered a 0‚Äì5 'whitewash', a scoreline not repeated in an Ashes series until the 2006/7 England team lost by the same margin. Reappointed reluctantly by the M.C.C. in 1921, he lost the first two Tests at home to Warwick Armstrong's side and was displaced as captain but retained in the XI. He captained England in one further Test match, against South Africa in July 1924, and played his final Test on the 1924/25 England tour of Australia. Later life Douglas with his orchids at home in Theydon Bois, Essex, 1926 Douglas married Evelyn Ruby (sister of two of his close wartime friends), the widow of Captain Thomas Elphinstone Case, of the Coldstream Guards, and daughter of Adolphus Ferguson,The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, vol. 86, 1917, p. 132 on 25 December 1916. He had no children but one stepson, the actor Gerald Case. Douglas drowned when the Finnish passenger ship , on which he and his father were sailing back to Britain after buying timber in Finland, sank in the Kattegat seven miles south of the L√¶s√∏ Trindel Lightship, Denmark. Another ship of the same line, Arcturus, had rammed her in fog after the two captains, who were brothers, had tried to exchange Christmas greetings. According to a witness at the post mortem enquiry, Douglas may have been trying to save his father. He was aged 48.

Davies headed Next from its creation in the 1980s, before moving on to start the fashion label 'George at Asda' in the 1990s. Leaving Asda in 2000 following their acquisition by Walmart, he launched the Per Una fashion collection at Marks & Spencer. In 2009, Davies launched his 4th brand (called GIVe) which saw 26 stores opening in selected towns and cities in the UK along with an e-commerce retailing. Dubbed as a \\"serial brand creator\\",http://www.drapersonline.com/news/womenswear/news/davies-to-share- profits-in-new-give-venture/5003644.article the \\"King of the High Street\\" and \\"the leading fashion visionary\\" he was awarded the Drapers Record Life Time Achievement award in 2003 and the \\"Designer of the Decade\\" by Prima in 2004. It has recently been estimated by the Financial Times that Davies has been responsible for the sale of over ¬£54 billion worth of clothing since his time at Next. Early life George William Davies was born in Crosby, Lancashire, on 29 October 1941 to sausage maker George Snr, and seamstress Mary Davies. Davies cites his mother as his motivation to succeed in life in fashion:Dawn Collinson, \\"Fashion icon George Davies: I'm Scouse and proud of it!\\", Liverpool Echo, 14 May 2008. His grandparents lived on a farm in Thornton, Crosby, and his parents moved closer to the coast when he was 11, when his mother took over a post office and his father became a sausage factory manager. Davies attended Bootle Grammar School,Elizabeth Rigby, \\"George Davies‚Äôs new fashion brand\\", Financial Times, 12 June 2009. where he enjoyed sports including golf, football and tennis. Asked recently by the Sunday Times if he had ever been \\"hard up\\" he responded \\"No. When I got pocket money as a young boy, I would save it. Apart from a blip when I was first in business, I've always had money. From the age of 16, I worked as a milkman in my holidays and saved to buy my first car, a Mini van\\". In the same article, Davies was asked if he was better off than his parents had been. \\"Financially, I am. But \\"better off\\" should be measured by more than finance. My parents were an amazingly happy couple and never wanted for anything. My father was the manager of a sausage factory and my mother bought and ran a post office in her fifties\\". A passionate supporter of Liverpool F.C. through his father (nowadays he is frequently seen watching from the directors' box) Davies had trials for the club during the reign of Bill Shankly but was unsuccessful (in 1995 he told The Independent that as things as turned out, it was probably for the best). However, he did go on to play centre forward for Bangor City, and also represented England Universities and England Under 18s at football and scored twice against Scotland.  Early business career  After walking away from Birmingham University where he was studying to become a dentist in the early '60s, Davies returned to Liverpool and applied to work for the retailers Littlewoods whose head office was based in the city. He also applied to work for Pilkington, the glass manufacturer, but Littlewoods responded first. He started off as a graduate trainee before ending up in stock control and then as a buyer (ankle socks). Davies cites his experience at Littlewoods as being the cornerstone of one of his fundamental beliefs of successful retailing ‚Äì the importance of effective stock control and the need for understanding local buying patterns ‚Äì commonly known in retail as Trading. He also credits Littlewoods as offering him \\"the most fantastic training\\" environment which was to strongly contribute to his successes in the future. In 2007, he told The Times \\"During the Whitsun holidays in Manchester, children dressed up in white and took part in the Whit Walks. Sales of white ankle socks went up by 200 dozen in the area and I had only sent 10. The manager of the store was soon on the phone shouting about what some stupid person had done. I had to drive to the supplier in Leicestershire and deliver the socks myself. It saved my job. Without that I don't think I would be here now. It taught me that in retailing every store is different.\\"  First entrepreneurial steps  In 1972 Davies launched his first business ‚Äì Schoolcare, a mail order company specialising in the supply of children's school uniforms. However Schoolcare experienced problems when their bank suffered financial difficulties. Whilst the demise of Schoolcare is no more than a tiny piece in the Davies business jigsaw, it is regarded as the birthplace of another Davies trademark legacy ‚Äì the \\"total look concept\\". In 1973, he was invited to join a fast-growing home- based fashion retailer called Pippa Dee which operated in a similar trading style to Tupperware, counting on a self-employed sales force of over thirteen thousand women to organise house party plan sales across the UK. Davies initially joined as Product and Design Director but very quickly became the driving force behind the sales operation. In a move that was to be reflected in his later business life, Davies left Pippa Dee amid a boardroom struggle and broken promises from other directors. J Hepworth & Son and NEXT In 1981, the chairman of Leeds based men's retailer Hepworth's, Sir Terence Conran, approached Davies to join the retail chain and revamp the concept to better combine their new purchase, the 70 stores of Kendall & Sons Ltd. Briefed to come up with a concept that would bring profitability to Kendall's, Davies' response was a blueprint which became NEXT, now the third most successful high street chain in the UK after Marks & Spencer and BHS/Arcadia Group. The first NEXT shops opened on 12 February 1982, with the Kendall's conversion complete by the end of 1983. Based around \\"the total concept look,\\" it encouraged customers to mix and match within a style, resulting in customers having both trend and buying more. The average NEXT customer would buy five items, not just the one they had entered the shop originally to buy. Made Chief Executive in 1984, Davies then converted the 50 Hepworth's stores to the NEXT format, extending the total concept look at the same time to cover menswear. In 1985, NEXT interiors was added to stores which were deemed in the \\"right demographic areas.\\" In 1986, Davies moved the group's headquarters from Leeds to Leicester, to be closer to the main garment manufacturers. In 1987, the group bought the Grattan catalogue company. Extending first to introduce NEXT childrenswear, he then introduced the NEXT Directory based around four key concepts:http://www.thecatalogshop.co.uk/nextdirectory1990.php *Directory: while a traditional catalogue was printed at a price and kept out of sight, NEXT Directory was hard backed and designed to be placed on a coffee table *Editorial: the directory was photographed by top fashion and media photographers including Neil Kirk and Herb Ritts, and featuring Vogue models including Yasmin le Bon, Uma Thurman and Carla Bruni. *Swatch sample: while traditional catalogues showed glossy paper pictures of models in the clothes, Davies added to the concept by including sample swatches of the actual materials (3\\" x 3\\" cut out and stuck-in squares) *Service: while traditional catalogues often gave a 28-day from delivery service, NEXT Directory offered 48-hour delivery, allowed for by being directly next to the suppliers At the same time, Davies launched the NEXT account card. The pressures of ever- increasing growth and expansion demanded by the analysts in the city caused NEXT to go through turbulent times in 1988. Under new chairman Sir David Jones, Davies' expansion plans and diversification of the brand were cited as one of the causes for the share price dropping. In December 1988, Davies was sacked from Next by chairman Sir David Jones, who accused him of being egotistical and taking Next to the verge of bankruptcy. \\"What Next?\\" After leaving NEXT, Davies spent time writing his autobiography What Next? In 1995, Davies founded Sporter, a sporting aligned clothing manufacturer. It supplies branded merchandise for sports clubs including Liverpool F.C. and Arsenal F.C. as well as Newcastle United F.C. and Rangers F.C..http://www.retail-week.com/george-davies-to-focus-on-sporter-after-per- una/1929563.article Sporter today employs over 100 staff, with offices in the UK, India, Sri Lanka and Italy. George at Asda Approached by UK supermarket chain Asda to create a new range of clothing, in the 1990s Davies produced his second household-name brand, George at Asda.http://direct.asda.com/george/clothing/10,default,sc.html Davies was positive about the approach, the shift of consumer spending moved from high street to out of town accessible development.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8a62a65e-548e-11de-a58d-00144feabdc0.html Asda CEO Archie Norman commented that Davies grasped the fact that the line had to be based on value, and be a distinct brand name on its own. The George brand and range was developed by Davies's company Red Creative, set up to provide full clothing retail solutions through a team of designers and marketeers. In 2000, Asda was bought by the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart of the United States. With the resultant resignation of the UK board, Davies also resigned his direct association. At the time of the takeover, the George brand was turning over ¬£600M.http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/12239/George- surprises-Asda-departure By 2002, Wal-Mart had rolled out George Clothing across the USA,http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/4295709-1.html and presently has annual global sales of ¬£2bn. In October 2009, the BBC reported that George @ Asda brand had officially become the UK's biggest selling clothing retailer, taking over from Marks & Spencer, with a 10% UK market share. Marks & Spencer As one of the top three recognised brands in the UK, Marks & Spencer had a traditionally strong selling women's clothing line. But in 2000 in light of developing fashion trends driven by distinct brands, needed to develop a new approach in their retail format. Introduced to chairman Luc Vandevelde and CEO Roger Holmes through a mutual friend, Davies was given the brief to develop a high-touch and distinct brand/line of clothing which would appeal to a younger female market sector. Developed by Red Creative in three months as a joint venture with Marks & Spencer, Per Una ( For one (woman)), had a logo of three hearts inspired by a postcard Davies picked up in Italy whilst looking for ideas for the new collection. Within three years of launch, per una was creating an annual turnover in excess of ¬£230M, which was over 10% of Marks & Spencer womenswear sales. More importantly, Per Una was attracting a younger audience back into the store, which was having a positive knock on effect in other departments. The Financial Times reported that it was Per Una that put Davies in the super-rich league (he sold the 5-year-old business to Marks & Spencer in 2004 for ¬£125 million) as part of the retailer's efforts to block a potential takeover by entrepreneur Sir Philip Green. ‚ÄúIt (Per Una) was absolutely fundamental in the resurgence of the core appeal of womenswear,\\" said Roger Holmes, the former chief executive of M&S; who signed Davies up in 2001 to bring the Per Una range to Marks. \\"Put in the context of the value it created from saving the company as a whole, it was creating billions of profits for shareholders.\\" Did it save the company? \\"Yes, I don't think that overstates the case.\\" Sir Stuart Rose saw through the acquisition of the Per Una brand and Davies stayed on with the company until 2008, which also saw the launch of his GD 25http://google.com/search?q=cache:sXCMvAycJ5AJ:www.thenewpink.co.uk/2007/09/27/per- una-at-ms-launch-gd25/+gd25&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=uk range celebrating Davies' 25 anniversary in the fashion industry. According to many newspaper articles between 2005 and 2008, the relationship that Davies enjoyed with Rose was not as cordial as the one with his predecessors, Holmes and Vandevelde. However, in a recent article in the business section of the Guardian, it appeared the relationship was back on an even-keel \\"Stuart and I talk,\\" he added, suggesting cold war has become d√©tente. \\"We have a lot in common on a personal level and in truth, I couldn't do what he does and he probably couldn't do what I do.\\" Recently asked by the Sunday Times what his most lucrative piece of work has ever been, Davies responded \\"Building up Per Una and selling it on to Marks & Spencer, without a doubt.\\" On Davies' departure from Per Una in December 2008, Rose commented in the Daily Telegraph that \\"I'll eat my hat if he wants to go and launch another business,\\"  GIVe  On 13 June 2009 George Davies revealed to the Financial Times that he was to launch his fourth fashion business under the name of GIVe as in George 1V ‚Äì his fourth large fashion venture. The small \\"e\\" represents the e-commerce (internet element) of the company. The company has also been named GIVe because it is Davies' intention to donate part of the profits to charitable causes ‚Äì he was quoted in the Sunday Times as expecting this figure to be up to 10% of the company's profits. In a recent article in the Sunday Telegraph, the architect of Davies' sacking from Next, Sir David Jones, was cited as one of the motivations behind the decision to launch the current brand, GIVe. Davies revealed that it was an informal conversation over a drink with Sir David in early 2009 that convinced him to launch GIVe when he was seriously considering whether it was a risk worth taking or not. Sir David Jones confirmed the conversation: \\"I remember the conversation well,\\" \\"Believe it or not, George Davies and I are very good friends after 25 years. George is an outstanding individual ‚Äì he started Next, he did George at Asda ‚Äì and he's a passionate man. Life is too short to hold grudges and I wish him well.\\" GIVe opened its doors in 25 towns and cities across the UK in October 2009 and, according to the FT, provides Italian-inspired, high quality women's fashion clothing at affordable prices. The move (in a recession) is typical of Davies who spots a niche, observes what the competition are doing and then does the opposite. In a June 2009 independent poll conducted by Drapers Online, 100% of the voters agreed that the new venture would be another success story for Davies. Davies describes the range of Italian-inspired luxurious women's wear as \\"affordable luxury\\" and the target sector as being women over the age of 30, although Davies recently commented that \\"it's not about age, it's about attitude\\". In July 2009, Drapers reported that Davies was in advanced discussions with House of Fraser and Dutch retail group Maxeda to take GIVe to a new dimension in terms of store coverage from spring 2010. It was suggested that the potential high-profile partnerships demonstrated the \\"serial brand maker's\\" commitment to creating a fourth \\"mega brand\\" to shake up the fashion sector ‚Äì Davies had been openly critical of the UK's homogenous high street in 2008. In August 2009, Retail Week revealed the locations for GIVe's first stores. Under the headline \\"Fashion legend George Davies has secured a raft of shopping centre deals for his new venture Give\\", the magazine correctly confirmed GIVe's first chosen store sites. In addition to Regent Street, Bluewater and Meadowhall stores, GIVe is opening in Liverpool, Cribbs Causeway, Kingston, Glasgow and Harrogate in October and November. Sixteen independent retailers (including 10 Beales shops) across the UK entered into joint venture agreements with GIVe to carry the range in a large concession- style deal which also opened in October 2009. In the run-up to the brand's launch Davies agreed an exclusive deal with women's fashion magazine Grazia.. Describing the brand GIVe \\"as the most exciting story to come out of retail this year\\" and \\"from what we've seen it's set to be a major new fixture on the British high street\\", Miller revealed that she and her Editor-in-Chief, Jane Bruton, had been given a preview of the new range which Davies kept very firmly under wraps prior to the brand's launch in October 2009. On 22 September, Grazia featured a 24-page promotion dedicated to GIVe and some of its clothing and accessory range. Grazia also highlighted that Emma Trayner (Davies' second daughter) has also played a large part in the selection and design input into GIVe's collection. In an interview with the Business section of the Sunday Times, Davies confirmed that he had invested over ¬£20,000,000 of his own money in the new venture. He told the paper that he planned to donate up to 10% of the company's profits to charitable causes. He also revealed that he was in discussions to take the brand global and that he would be disappointed if GIVe did not see sales of ¬£50m-¬£60m. Davies was described by The Week as being \\"indefatigable\\" ‚Äì in other words incapable of being tired out; not yielding to fatigue; untiring. Elle magazine commented that \\"the designs are still underwraps, but we hear we should expect chic womens wear to rival the likes of Whistles and Karen Millen\\". Davies believes that many large high street retailers have failed to react quickly enough and embrace the power of the internet and its impact on the consumer, including the use of social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter to get the message of new product into the public domain. In an interview in Retail Week, Davies comments that \\"I've had to understand a lot of new things like Twitter, Facebook and blogging because that's the route consumers have gone. I feel the high street has left itself open to the rise of that sort of medium.\\" Davies also revealed to the magazine that the new GIVe stores include in-store internet kiosks giving customers real-time stock information as well as video content of the store's garments on a catwalk (the shopper will scan a bar code into the system and get instant video feedback of what the chosen garment looks like on the catwalk). In addition the same in-store system will allow shoppers to order home delivery. Speaking to the Financial Times in December 2009, Davies discussed his intentions of taking the GIVe brand overseas. It had been widely reported that he was in discussions with several different groups in India and the Middle East and was considering launching the brand outside of the UK in the second quarter of 2010. In the Drapers Record Magazine \\"Top 100 Influential People\\" published in December 2009, George Davies became a new entry at number 9. GIVe was effectively closed for any further trading in early 2011 and the holding company that was its parent company, \\"Sporter Ltd\\" was put into receivership in September 2011.  Personal life and charity support  Davies is the father of seven children (five daughters and two sons) and has three former wives. In 2008, it was reported that he had built a 7-hole golf course in his back garden. Davies divides his time between his family, his business ventures and his seven chosen charities which includes helping the education of under-privileged children in Asia as well as making life more comfortable for British soldiers injured in combat overseas. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Davies revealed that he had decided to give his private yacht away to a charity called Sail 4 Cancer (a charity which provides families suffering from cancer with respite break sailing holidays). He also donated the use of his private jet to the Celebration of Life After Cancer charity who successfully auctioned the prize to raise funds for people who were living and coping with cancer. In addition, Davies was a Governor of Malvern College and is the benefactor behind the George Davies Centre For Retail Excellence at Heriot-Watt University.http://www.sml.hw.ac.uk/gdc/history.html Davies is also a trustee of the Mvumi School Trust, which oversees the DCT Mvumi Secondary School in Tanzania. Davies was found guilty of drink driving in June 2011 following a 5-mile police chase in May 2010. In September 2017, Davies made a ¬£5.15 million donation to the University of Leicester and hospitals associated with it.https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press- releases/2017/september/ps5-15-million-gift-to-university-of-leicester-and- leicester2019s-hospitals-will-help-fight-vascular-disease-and-prevent-limb- amputations This was the University's largest ever philanthropic gift from an individual, with the money largely supporting research into vascular limb disease. The University renamed its Centre for Medicine to the George Davies Centre in honour of this donation in November of that year, with Sir David Attenborough officially opening the building.https://www2.le.ac.uk/staff/announcements/the-george-davies-centre- will-be-officially-named-on-11-november Timeline * 1941 ‚Äì Born George William Davies on 29 October 1941 in Crosby, LancashireGeorge Davies: What Next?

Common usage usually refers to fresh, moving water and thus not to oceans or lakes. In the UK swimming at natural swimming holes has a long history and has recently become known as \\"wild swimming\\",see for instance Waterlog by Roger Deakin (1997) especially since the publication of bestselling books on the subject by Kate Rew and Daniel Start. In southern Australia, a compendium of swimming holes was first characterised by Brad Neal in his 2004 publication of the first edition of the Guide to Freshwater Swimming Holes in Victoria, Australia. Nude swimming is a well-established tradition at some more remote swimming holes and is an attraction for many natural swimming fans, but in many parts of the world remains an illegal activity.  History  A man and woman at a swimming hole, in this case a creek. In Europe, as the nineteenth century dawned, a new era of contemporary artists were rediscovering the appeal of the swimming hole. The waterfall, surrounded by trees and mountains, was now regarded as the quintessence of beauty. William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas de Quincey spent much time bathing in the mountain pools of the Lake District. The study and search for the ‚Äòpicturesque‚Äô and ‚Äòsublime‚Äô ‚Äì an almost scientific measure of loveliness and proportion in the landscape ‚Äì had reached epidemic proportions. The fashionable tours of Provence or Tuscany were replaced by trips to the valleys of Wales, and the dales of the UK's Cumbria and Yorkshire, as Turner and Constable painted a prodigious flow of falls, tarns and ponds. In southern Australia, swimming in natural swimming holes was popular until around the time of the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. In the first half of the 20th century there were several swimming clubs along the Yarra River in Melbourne https://swimmingholeheaven.com/vic-deep-rock.htm, such as at Deep Rock, for example. Numerous chlorinated, municipal swimming pools were built across Victoria in the lead up to the 1956 Olympics, which changed the community's swimming preferences to the local pool, rather than the local river. The swimming clubs along the Yarra River closed in response to this change in preferences. Some of these pre-Olympic swimming pools still exist, such as at Hepburn Pool in central Victoria, and Seven Creeks in Euroa.  Safety  Safety is a concern with swimming in natural settings. Typically there are no lifeguards. Currents can be swift and, in larger rivers, are often hidden beneath the surface. Diving or jumping is especially dangerous as the depth varies from season to season, and there may be hidden rocks below the surface resulting in broken necks or backs and paralysis or death. Alcohol consumption while swimming is especially dangerous, and contributes to at least 20% of deaths by drowning.

The village is just a busy road west of Preston and south-east of Blackpool. It is located on the banks of the River Ribble, close to its entry into the Irish Sea. It is best known for its airfield, Warton Aerodrome and the associated aircraft manufacturing plant of BAE Systems Military Air & Information. The village is part of the borough of Fylde.  History  In 1835 Warton was a township in the parish of Kirkham. For probate purposes, prior to 1858, Warton was in the Archdeaconry of Richmond, in the Diocese of Chester. In his 1870 Gazetteer, Wilson reports that the chapelry of Warton also included the Freckleton township, and comprised 6,598 acres, with a population 1,325 and 270 houses. The property is described as being \\"much subdivided\\". Cotton spinning and the manufacture of sacking, sailcloth, and cordage were the main occupations. There were two churches, both described as \\"good\\". There were also two Methodist chapels.John Marius Wilson, Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870-72)] One of the last sunk post mills in England was situated at the end of Mill Lane.\\"Extract from a newspaper article on windmills, in the \\"Preston Guardian\\" by Mr. T. Harrison Myers, 1914\\" at amounderness.co.uk/warton The mill is reflected in the name of the modern nearby street Post Lane, where a new housing development has been proposed.Homes plan welcomed St Paul's Church St Paul's Church The first church, Holy Trinity on Church Road, was built in 1722 and consecrated in 1725. Originally built as a chapel of ease to Kirkham, it eventually became a parish church with its own vicar.Porter, J. MRCS, LSA (1878) History of the Fylde of Lancashire, Fleetwood and Blackpool: W. Porter and Sons Publisher, Chapter III - Ecclesiastical History (continued). The present church has a sanctuary chair bearing the initials WS and MS and dated 1611. As it was William Shaw, who died in 1720, and who donated the land for the old church to be built on, it is possible that the initials are those of some of his ancestors.Shakeshaft, P. (2013), A History of St. Paul's Church, Warton, Lancaster: Scotforth Books, , p. v. In his 1870 Gazetteer, Wilson reports that the living was a vicarage in the diocese of Manchester with a value of ¬£350, the patron being Christ Church in Oxford. The present church, now dedicated to St Paul, was built in 1886. A selection of celebratory events took place for the 125th Anniversary of the church, over the weekend of 25 and 26 June 2011, including an organ recital. The church is linked with a Lutheran church in Timmerlah in the Diocese of Braunschweig in Northern Germany.St Paul, Warton On 4 August 2014 the church hosted a photographic exhibition to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. During the hours of darkness the church is floodlit. Since June 2018 the vicar has been Rev. Jane Greenhalgh. The curate is Rev. Fiona Haines.https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/19565/about-us/ Greenhalgh was criticised, in 2018, for wearing a white poppy for the annual Remembrance Day service and for by including references to white supremacy, the Ku Klux Klan and the English Defence League in her sermon.https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/warton-vicar-s-apology-after- remembrance-sermon-sparks-walkout-1-9457300 Parish council Bryning-with- Warton Parish Council is one of fifteen such councils that serves the Borough of Fylde.

Test cases underlie testing that is methodical rather than haphazard. A battery of test cases can be built to produce the desired coverage of the software being tested. Formally defined test cases allow the same tests to be run repeatedly against successive versions of the software, allowing for effective and consistent regression testing.  Formal test cases  In order to fully test that all the requirements of an application are met, there must be at least two test cases for each requirement: one positive test and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub- requirement must have at least two test cases. Keeping track of the link between the requirement and the test is frequently done using a traceability matrix. Written test cases should include a description of the functionality to be tested, and the preparation required to ensure that the test can be conducted. A formal written test-case is characterized by a known input and by an expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed. The known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a postcondition.  Informal test cases  For applications or systems without formal requirements, test cases can be written based on the accepted normal operation of programs of a similar class. In some schools of testing, test cases are not written at all but the activities and results are reported after the tests have been run. In scenario testing, hypothetical stories are used to help the tester think through a complex problem or system. These scenarios are usually not written down in any detail. They can be as simple as a diagram for a testing environment or they could be a description written in prose. The ideal scenario test is a story that is motivating, credible, complex, and easy to evaluate. They are usually different from test cases in that test cases are single steps while scenarios cover a number of steps of the key.  Typical written test case format  A test case is usually a single step, or occasionally a sequence of steps, to test the correct behaviour/functionality, features of an application. An expected result or expected outcome is usually given.https://www.softwaretestingstandard.org/part3.php ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4:2019, \\"Part 4: Test techniques\\" Additional information that may be included: *Test Case ID - This field uniquely identifies a test case. *Test case Description/Summary - This field describes the test case objective. *Test steps - In this field, the exact steps are mentioned for performing the test case. *Pre-requisites - This field specifies the conditions or steps that must be followed before the test steps executions. *Depth *Test category *Author- Name of the Tester. *Automation - Whether this test case is automated or not. *pass/fail *Remarks Larger test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions.

These past results would usually be stored in a separate table. Test suites often also contain * Test summary * Configuration Besides a description of the functionality to be tested, and the preparation required to ensure that the test can be conducted, the most time-consuming part in the test case is creating the tests and modifying them when the system changes. Under special circumstances, there could be a need to run the test, produce results, and then a team of experts would evaluate if the results can be considered as a pass. This happens often on new products' performance number determination. The first test is taken as the base line for subsequent test and product release cycles. Acceptance tests, which use a variation of a written test case, are commonly performed by a group of end-users or clients of the system to ensure the developed system meets the requirements specified or the contract. User acceptance tests are differentiated by the inclusion of happy path or positive test cases to the almost complete exclusion of negative test cases.

In mathematics, a Seifert surface (named after German mathematician Herbert Seifert) is a surface whose boundary is a given knot or link. Such surfaces can be used to study the properties of the associated knot or link. For example, many knot invariants are most easily calculated using a Seifert surface. Seifert surfaces are also interesting in their own right, and the subject of considerable research. Specifically, let L be a tame oriented knot or link in Euclidean 3-space (or in the 3-sphere). A Seifert surface is a compact, connected, oriented surface S embedded in 3-space whose boundary is L such that the orientation on L is just the induced orientation from S, and every connected component of S has non-empty boundary. Note that any compact, connected, oriented surface with nonempty boundary in Euclidean 3-space is the Seifert surface associated to its boundary link. A single knot or link can have many different inequivalent Seifert surfaces. A Seifert surface must be oriented. It is possible to associate surfaces to knots which are not oriented nor orientable, as well. Examples A Seifert surface for the Hopf link. This is an annulus, not a M√∂bius strip. It has two half-twists and is thus orientable. The standard M√∂bius strip has the unknot for a boundary but is not a Seifert surface for the unknot because it is not orientable. The \\"checkerboard\\" coloring of the usual minimal crossing projection of the trefoil knot gives a Mobius strip with three half twists. As with the previous example, this is not a Seifert surface as it is not orientable. Applying Seifert's algorithm to this diagram, as expected, does produce a Seifert surface; in this case, it is a punctured torus of genus g = 1, and the Seifert matrix is :V = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}. Existence and Seifert matrix It is a theorem that any link always has an associated Seifert surface. This theorem was first published by Frankl and Pontryagin in 1930. A different proof was published in 1934 by Herbert Seifert and relies on what is now called the Seifert algorithm. The algorithm produces a Seifert surface S, given a projection of the knot or link in question. Suppose that link has m components (m=1 for a knot), the diagram has d crossing points, and resolving the crossings (preserving the orientation of the knot) yields f circles. Then the surface S is constructed from f disjoint disks by attaching d bands. The homology group H_1(S) is free abelian on 2g generators, where :g = (2 + d - f - m)/2 is the genus of S. The intersection form Q on H_1(S) is skew-symmetric, and there is a basis of 2g cycles :a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{2g} with :Q = (Q(a_i,a_j)) the direct sum of g copies of :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}. An illustration of the \\"pushoff\\" of a homology generator a in the positive and negative directions for the Seifert surface of the figure eight knot. The 2g √ó 2g integer Seifert matrix :V = (v(i,j)) has v(i,j) the linking number in Euclidean 3-space (or in the 3-sphere) of ai and the \\"pushoff\\" of aj in the positive direction of S, i.e. the loop that sits in the complement of S above the positive side and projects down onto aj.Dale Rolfsen. Knots and Links. (1976), 146-147. :V - V^* = Q, where V* = (v(j,i)) the transpose matrix. Every integer 2g √ó 2g matrix V with V-V^*=Q arises as the Seifert matrix of a knot with genus g Seifert surface. The Alexander polynomial is computed from the Seifert matrix by A(t)=\\\\det(V-tV^*), which is a polynomial of degree at most 2g in the indeterminate t. The Alexander polynomial is independent of the choice of Seifert surface S, and is an invariant of the knot or link. The signature of a knot is the signature of the symmetric Seifert matrix V+V^\\\\mathrm{T}. It is again an invariant of the knot or link. Genus of a knot Seifert surfaces are not at all unique: a Seifert surface S of genus g and Seifert matrix V can be modified by a topological surgery, resulting in a Seifert surface S‚Ä≤ of genus g + 1 and Seifert matrix :V' = V \\\\oplus \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. The genus of a knot K is the knot invariant defined by the minimal genus g of a Seifert surface for K. For instance: * An unknot‚Äîwhich is, by definition, the boundary of a disc‚Äîhas genus zero. Moreover, the unknot is the knot with genus zero. * The trefoil knot has genus 1, as does the figure-eight knot. * The genus of a (p,q)-torus knot is (p ‚àí 1)(q ‚àí 1)/2 * The degree of a knot's Alexander polynomial is a lower bound on twice its genus. A fundamental property of the genus is that it is additive with respect to the knot sum: :g(K_1 \\\\\\\\# K_2) = g(K_1) + g(K_2) In general, the genus of a knot is difficult to compute, and the Seifert algorithm usually does not produce a Seifert surface of least genus. For this reason other related invariants are sometimes useful. The canonical genus g_c of a knot is the least genus of all Seifert surfaces that can be constructed by the Seifert algorithm, and the free genus g_f is the least genus of all Seifert surfaces whose complement in S^3 is a handlebody. (The complement of a Seifert surface generated by the Seifert algorithm is always a handlebody.) For any knot the inequality g\\\\leq g_f \\\\leq g_c obviously holds, so in particular these invariants place upper bounds on the genus.

Membership The Webbs proposed that the club's membership reflect the entire gamut of political beliefs, and \\"proposed to collect politicians from each of the parties\\". Representing the Liberal Imperialists were Sir Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane; the Tories were represented by economist William Hewins and editor of the National Review Leopold Maxse; and the British military was represented by Leo Amery, an \\"expert on the conditions of the army\\", and Carlyon Bellairs, a naval officer.

The group was further divided over the issue of Tariff Reform following Joseph Chamberlain's resignation as Secretary of State for the Colonies and the increasing dominance of the pro-Unionist membership, which favoured Chamberlain and his tariff reform policies, contributed to the club's dissolution in 1909.

The art is by Georges Topfer from his work Le R√™ve d‚Äôun flagellant (\\"The dream of a flagellant\\"). Dominance and submission (also called D/s) is a set of behaviours, customs, and rituals involving the submission of one person to another in an erotic episode or lifestyle. It is a subset of BDSM. This form of sexual contact and pleasure has been shown to please a minority of people. Physical contact is not necessary, and D/s can be conducted anonymously over the telephone, email, or other messaging systems. In other cases, it can be intensely physical, sometimes crossing into sadomasochism. In D/s, both parties take pleasure or erotic enjoyment from either dominating or being dominated. Those who take the superior position are called \\"dominants\\"‚ÄîDoms (male) or Dommes (female)‚Äîwhile those who take the subordinate position are called \\"submissive\\"‚Äîor subs (male or female). A switch is an individual who plays either role. Two switches together may negotiate and exchange roles several times in a session. The term dominatrix usually refers to a female sex worker who dominates others for pay.:\\"Sexual arousal from consensual interactions that include domination should be distinguished from nonconsensual sex acts.\\" It is common for writers to capitalise the \\"D\\" in Dominant but leave the \\"s\\" in lowercase for the submissive. Many extend this to His/Hers, Him/Her, He/She, etc., to make it clear when they are referring to a Dominant.  History  The dominant and submissive relationship fits within the overarching term of BDSM and its lifestyle. BDSM stands for bondage and discipline (B&D;), Dominant and Submissive (D&S;), and sadism and masochism (S&M;). Many misconceptions of this relationship and its associated activities come from the fact that early theorists conceptualized that sadomasochists and BDSM behavior was a symptom of psychopathology. It was thought that people who participated in this type of sexual play disregarded safety and consent, which influenced the diagnosis, classification, and perception of this type of relationship. These misconceptions of all participants of BDSM having disordered tendencies have related to the definition and criteria for sadomasochism in the DSM-5. Therefore, many in the BDSM community do not fit the criteria. It is possible that this community of BDSM participants was formed in the early 18th century and maybe even before. For example, the dominant and submissive partnership has been shown in early versions of the Kamasutra. Not only is it shown in literature but also in the actions of ancient rulers that would participate in sexually sadistic torture, role play, and finally the assertion of their dominance over subjects. Their actions show severe sadomasochism as well as the early onset behaviors of the community. Currently, the relationship between a dominant and submissive revolves around consent and guidelines. Within the world of BDSM, consent is a core focus and requirement because it is what separates sexual sadism from coercive sexual sadism disorder in the DSM-5. Sexual Sadism Disorder and Sexual Masochism Disorder have been changed in order to show the differentiation of consensual vs. non-consensual partners. As well as showing the new criteria to be classified as one or the other, for example, the person being diagnosed must be experiencing personal distress about their paraphilia rather than distress coming from society's disapproval. The growth of dominant and submissive behavior, sadomasochism, and other BDSM activity are evident through its history coming from ancient times all the way to the separation from disorder to consensual community participant. Overview The inner conflict and surrender connected with dominance and submission are enduring themes in human culture and civilization. In human sexuality, this has broadened to include mutual exploration of roles, emotions, and activities that would be difficult or impossible to act out without a willing partner taking an opposing role. A 1985 study suggests that only about 30 percent of participants in BDSM activities are females. A 1995 study indicates that 89% of heterosexual females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for the submissive- recipient role in sexual bondage, expressing also a preference for a dominant male, and that 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role. Recent research shows that a minority of the population engages or fantasizes about BDSM activity. A national study with 2,800 participants showed that about 14% of men and 11% of women had participated in some sort of BDSM related activity and from those results, it was concluded that approximately 10% of adults have joined in some part of the sexual behavior. A separate study of 1,040 participants discovered 19.2% of men and 27.8% of women express a desire to attempt in masochistic behavior, while 13.9% of the men and 23.7% of the women of the sample reported participating in an act of masochism. A D/s couple posing for a picture. Many submissives wear a collar to denote their status and commitment. A safeword is usually given to the submissive partner to prevent the dominant from overstepping physical and emotional boundaries. It is usually a code word, series of code words or other signal used to communicate physical or emotional state, typically when approaching, or crossing, a boundary. Safewords can have differing levels of urgency - some may bring a scene to an outright stop, whereas others may indicate that a boundary is being approached. A safeword may be used by the Dominant as well as the Submissive if they feel things have gone too far and are uncomfortable continuing. D/s may be ritualized or freeform. It is usually a negotiated lifestyle, with people discussing their wishes, limits, and needs in order to find commonality. A D/s relationship may be sexual or non-sexual, long- or short-term, and intimate or anonymous. Most adherents search for the essential intensity, trust, and intimacy that are required to make any deep relationship possible. Based on gender (of the dominant or submissive), D/s can be divided into the following sub-types:- * Male dominance * Male submission * Female dominance * Female submission Terminology A dominant male publicly holds two submissive females using leashes tied to their neck, Folsom Street Fair, 2010 BDSM is the sexual practices of bondage and torture, dominant and submissive, as well as sadomasochism. D/s participants often refer to their activity as \\"play\\", with an individual play session being called a \\"scene\\". In addition to \\"dominant\\" and \\"submissive\\", a \\"switch\\" is a person who can take either role. The dominant and submissive relations pertain to two people who play with psychological, emotional, and/or physical dominance. Most of the time in sexual relationships like this there is some sort of power exchange through their physical interaction. A scene between two switches can involve trading off the dominant and submissive roles, possibly several times. In contrast, the terms top and bottom refer to the active (agent) and passive (patient) roles, respectively. In a given scene, there is no requirement that the dominant also be the top, or that the submissive be the bottom, although this is often the case. The term vanilla refers to normative (\\"non-kinky\\") sex and relationships, the vanilla world being mainstream society outside of the BDSM subculture. The term comes from vanilla ice cream being considered the \\"default\\" flavor. The term power exchange refers to the empowerment of the dominant by the submissive's surrender to his/ her control. Power exchange is consensual and in reality, it is the submissive that has the underlying control during the relationship exchange. The dominant is attempting to satisfy the submissive's kinks and desires. The terms top and bottom are used as verbs or nouns to describe the physical play of SM but with less of a focus of the \\"sadist\\" and \\"masochist\\" part of the activity. They can be used as synonyms for dominant and submissive. The term dungeon is used as a reference to a space/ room designated for sadomasochism play. It can also be used to describe a club where these activities take place. It can also be a place to practice kinks safely and learn how to carry out activities and play. The term dungeon monitors is used as a description of well-trusted BDSM members that volunteer to monitor dungeons and look out for infractions, distress, or any other form of misconduct or non-consent. The term flogger is used to describe a tool or whip used in sexual scenes. The action of flogging refers to impact play. Usually made of leather with a hard handle and multiple long flat strands attached. The term can also be used to describe the person holding the specialized whip. Linguistic conventions Some people in the D/s world capitalize words and names that refer to dominants, and do not capitalize those that refer to submissives, hence the capitalization of D/s; others do not. It was popularized in internet chatrooms, to make it easier to identify the orientation of the writer or the person being written about. Also, some submissives eschew personal pronouns, instead referring to themselves as \\"this slave\\" or \\"Master Bob's girl\\". This is sometimes considered an expression of modesty, but it is an entirely optional method of depersonalizing a submissive during \\"play\\". It may have roots in the military, where new recruits are required to refer to themselves as \\"this recruit\\", rather than \\"I\\" or \\"me\\". D/s relationship styles A man doing petplay at Folsom Street Fair and wearing dog leash in his neck. There can be any number of partners in a D/s relationship: one dominant may have several submissives, who may in turn dominate others, or a submissive may have multiple dominants. Relationships may be monogamous or polyamorous. Romantic love is not necessarily a feature in D/s: partners might be very much in love or have no romantic relationship at all. Some D/s relationships are sexual, others completely chaste. Fantasy role play can be an element, with partners taking classic dominant or submissive roles, or classic authority-figure roles such as teacher and student, police officer and suspect, or parent and child. Animal play, where one partner takes the role of owner or caretaker and the other takes the part of a pet or animal, can also be D/s play. A classic example of a D/s role is the \\"sissy\\" maid, where an adult male dresses in cartoonish female clothing and performs stereotypical female chores such as housecleaning or serving tea. Cross-dressing in D/s does not always involve a desire to be sissified or made into caricatures of women or to serve: for example, others may desire to be made as beautiful as possible and interact on a \\"girlfriend-to-girlfriend\\" non-sexual basis. Variation in D/s is virtually limitless and the activities take many forms, and may be combined with other forms of BDSM. These variations may include: * professional ‚Äì Dominatrix * resistance play ‚Äì forcing the submissive to do something against their will as an intense form of power play * domestic servitude or consensual slavery * enforced chastity of the submissive * sexual slavery * verbal humiliation *fetishes ‚Äì such as shoe or boot worship, uniforms, smoking, latex, and heavy rubber‚Äîare, among other activities, considered part of BDSM * humiliation/ dehumanization (pony or animal roleplay) * objectification (human furniture): ex. submissive's body used as footstool, or sub's mouth used as spitting bowl and cigarette ashtray * cross-dressing * whipping * corporal punishment * trampling * human toilet ‚Äì golden showers * feminization * cuckold * bondage (sexual) * public humiliation Safety There are some risks commonly associated with D/s. Because it is mostly a mental activity, many of the risks associated with D/s involve mental health. Others involve abuses of the trust inherent in a D/s relationship. Some examples are: * Physically or mentally abusive dominant partner * Self-hating subs * Dominant partners who violate the trust relationship by attempting to isolate the sub from society or monetarily exploit the sub Consent and contracts A nude submissive female cleans the shoe of her male master by licking it (with her consent). Scene is of a public road in USA, 2012. Consent is a vital element in all psychological play, and consent can be granted in many ways. Some employ a written form known as a \\"Dungeon negotiation form\\", for others a simple verbal commitment is sufficient. Consent can be limited both in duration and content. There are many versions of consent but mainly it is the knowledge between the partnership of who plays the dominant role and who plays the submissive. The commitment of knowing who afflicts and receives the pain, bondage, torture, and/or humiliation. As well as the fact that all erotic experiences are performed in a safe, legal, and consensual practice as well as benefiting both parties. The consensual practice is what helps distinguish BDSM participants from a psychiatric diagnosis of a sexual disorder. The community of BDSM has adopted the saying \\"Safe, Sane, Consensual\\" (SSC) and \\"Risk-Aware Consensual Kink\\" (RACK) and a new addition \\"Caring, Communication, Consent, and Caution\\" (4Cs). Consent has also been categorized into three groups: surface, scene, and deep consent. Surface consent has been defined as a simple yes or no. Scene consent has been described as including parameters of a top/ bottom negotiation and agreement of a play scene. While deep consent involves the mental capacity of the bottom (submissive) and the awareness of the top that the bottom is able to use a safeword. The BDSM community have a simple code of conduct concerning the boundaries of safety and negotiation to ensure consensual BDSM. Negotiation in terms of the sexual scenes is required to ensure that the BDSM play is enjoyable and safe for both parties involved. The discussion of what activities are available and the mutual definition of the play is the only way both the dominant and submissive will be able to comfortably perform. There is a complexity to negotiation depending on the trust and emotional attachment the partners have towards each other, the more familiarity between the two the less negotiation needed. The extent of negotiation depends on the partner's involvement, for example, less risk behavior the less negotiation needed. Safewords are verbal codes both partners can recognize as the end or altering of activities done in a BDSM scene. It is an important asset to continue the consent through the relationship and scene itself. The use of a safeword at any time, regardless of the intensity of the scene, usually signifies the end to a scene, or activity and possible withdrawal of consent completely. Within the community of BDSM, there are universal safewords used according to traffic lights and known as ‚Äúhouse safewords‚Äù. Red means stop everything, yellow means slow down and to not go any further, and green meaning go and continue with more intensity. There are also possibilities where speaking isn't an option and so there are ‚Äúsilent safewords‚Äù that are simple gestures that represent stopping an activity, for example, clapping hands, snapping fingers, or any action showing the scene must end. The use of safewords and the abode of them go hand and hand with consent and negotiation. All of it ensures a safe space where both participants are able to enjoy the sexual play. The BDSM community takes consent very seriously and promotes safe play. They provide many resources so people may learn how to respect consent, such as education, information, and safety. They also provide public playrooms with dungeon monitors to make sure the rules are kept and followed. They have consequences for people who break the built trust and disobey the rule of consent and boundaries. Some punishments include being blacklisted from the community and labeled as a ‚Äúpredator.‚Äù Being blacklisted includes being personally ridiculed by individual members, as well as exclusion from play parties, clubs, and organizations held by the community. Although they take all the precautions to the events, coercion and sexual assault still occur inside and outside the community. There are many forms to this that include, knowingly violating consent, accidental violations, and misunderstandings from the lack of communication towards definitions and agreed-upon activities. The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) is an educational organization that is driven to propose positive and safe sex that was founded in 1997. They conducted a survey with 4,598 participants in BDSM and 1,307 of them reported being touched without consent. Out of the participants, 26% reported they were attacked by a predator and 33% said they were coerced. 81% of the sample said that during the activity they wanted it to stop. It's important to include that participants of BDSM are not more likely to be coerced or sexually assaulted, there is no significant relationship between the two. That being said just because someone participates in a dominant and submissive relationship does not mean they will eventually be sexually assaulted or coerced. Consensual non-consensuality is a mutual agreement to act as if consent has been waived within safe, sane limits. It is an agreement that consent is given in advance, sometimes without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned, though within defined limits subject to a safeword, reasonable care, common sense, or other restrictions. The consent is given with the intent of its being irrevocable under normal circumstances. As such, it is a show of extreme trust and understanding and is usually undertaken only by partners who know each other well, or otherwise agree to set clear, safe limits on their activities. It is not unusual to grant consent only for an hour or for an evening. When a scene lasts for more than a few hours, it is common to draft a \\"scene contract\\" that defines what will happen and who is responsible for what. It is a good way to work out what all the parties want and usually improves the experience. Some contracts can become quite detailed and run for many pages, especially if a scene is to last a weekend or more. For long term consent, a \\"slave contract\\" may be drawn up. BDSM \\"contracts\\" are only an agreement between consenting people and are usually not legally binding; in fact, the possession of one may be considered illegal in some areas.14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution Slave contracts are simply a way of defining the nature and limits of the relationship and are not intended to carry legal force. After a slave contract is drafted, some celebrate the event with a \\"collaring ceremony\\", in which the local D/s community is invited to witness the commitment made in the document. Some ceremonies become quite elaborate, and can be as involved as a wedding or any similar ritual. Equipment and accessories A woman submissive wearing a typical \\"slave collar\\" at Cologne Pride. Her male master is pulling her using the ring of O attached to the collar. The woman is also wearing a mouth gag and her hands are in bondage. Some people maintain a special room or area, called a dungeon or playroom, that contains special equipment, such as shackles, handcuffs, whips, queening stools, and spanking benches or a Berkley horse, for example, used for play scenes, or they may visit a BDSM club that maintains such facilities. Collars Many submissives in a submissive relationship wear a collar to indicate their submissive status and commitment. It can be much like a wedding band, except that only the submissive partner wears one. The traditional collar is a neck band in leather or metal, chosen, designed, and even crafted by the dominant partner. Some subs may wear a \\"symbolic collar\\", often a bracelet or ankle chain, which is more subdued than the traditional collar and can pass in non-BDSM situations. It is not uncommon for a sub to have several collars for special occasions. Dog collars are integral for K‚Äì9 roleplaying‚Äîpup-play. Many people‚Äîfor example, some in the punk rock and goth subcultures‚Äîwear collars for other reasons, such as fashion. So, one cannot assume that all people wearing collars are involved in BDSM. Members of the furry fandom may also wear collars as a part of costuming or as fashion. Use of collars in the sexual aspects of furry lifestyle may or may not be connected to BDSM, depending on the individual's preferences. Art and culture=Literature One of the most famous works in this area is Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's Venus im Pelz (Venus in Furs, 1869), in which the protagonist, Severin, persuades a woman, Wanda, to take him on as her slave, serves her, and allows her to degrade him. The book has elements of both social and physical submission, and is the genesis of the term \\"masochism\\" coined by the 19th-century psychiatrist Krafft-Ebing.

MS. 286) is an illuminated Gospel Book which dates from the 6th century. It was made in Italy and has been in England since fairly soon after its creation; by the 16th century it had probably already been at Canterbury for almost a thousand years. It has 265 leaves measuring about 252 x 196 mm,The manuscripts of Sedulius, Carl P. E. Springer Google books and is not entirely complete, in particular missing pages with miniatures. This manuscript is the oldest surviving illustrated Latin (rather than Greek or Syriac) Gospel Book,, Lewine, 489 and one of the oldest European books in existence. Although the only surviving illuminations are two full-page miniatures, these are of great significance in art history as so few comparable images have survived. The Church of England calls the book the Canterbury Gospels, though to scholars this name usually refers to another book, an 8th-century Anglo-Saxon gospel book written at Canterbury, now with one portion in the British Library as Royal MS I. E. VI, and another in the Library of Canterbury Cathedral. History The manuscript is traditionally, and plausibly, considered to be either a volume brought by St Augustine to England with the Gregorian mission in 597, or one of a number of books recorded as being sent to him in 601 by Pope Gregory the Great ‚Äì like other scholars, Kurt Weitzmann sees \\"no reason to doubt\\" the tradition.Weitzmann, 22. There is another, unillustrated, possible survivor of the group in the Bodleian Library, the oldest copy of the Rule of St Benedict. The main text is written in an Italian uncial hand which is widely accepted as dating to the 6th century - Rome or Monte Cassino have been suggested as the place of creation.Schiller, II 14 It was certainly in England by the late 7th or early 8th century when corrections and additions were made to the text in an insular hand. The additions included tituli or captions to the scenes around the portrait of Luke, not all of which may reflect the intentions of the original artist.See Lewine, 487 The book was certainly at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury in the 10th century, when the first of several documents concerning the Abbey were copied into it.De Hamel (2016), p.18 The first abbey-related entry is in a tenth-century Old English hand ‚Äì the ninth-century bequest of Ealhburg, who, in exchange for the monks' daily singing of psalm 20 on behalf of her husband, granted the abbey various products from her estate at Bradbourne, Kent. Among other documents pertaining to the abbey are a land charter in the name of Wulfric, abbot of St Augustine's (989‚Äì1005) and a twelfth-century list of holy relics kept in the abbey which include fragments of the Virgin Mary's cloak and the True Cross, the hair of St. Cecilia, and a finger of St. Gregory the Great. In the late Middle Ages it was \\"kept not in the Library at Canterbury but actually lay on the altar; it belonged in other words, like a reliquary or the Cross, to Church ceremonial\\".Pacht, 11. In the same way the Book of Kells was stolen from the sacristy, not the library, at Kells in the 11th century. The manuscript was given to the Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge as part of the collection donated by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1575, some decades after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It was traditionally used for the swearing of the oath in the enthronements of new Archbishops of Canterbury, and the tradition has been restored since 1945; the book is taken to Canterbury Cathedral by the librarian of Corpus for each ceremony.Archbishop of Canterbury official website . The Augustine Gospels have also been taken to Canterbury for other major occasions: the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1982,John Paul II: reflections from The Tablet, p. 36, Catherine Pepinster, John Wilkins, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, , and the celebrations in 1997 for the 1,400th anniversary of the Gregorian mission.Independent, 1997 The manuscript was rebound at the British Museum in 1948‚Äì49 with plain oak boards and a spine of cream alum-tawed goatskin.De Hamel (2016), p.18  Text  The manuscript is \\"more or less the oldest substantially complete copy\\" of Jerome's translation of the Gospels. His late-fourth century Vulgate gradually replaced the earlier Vetus Latina (\\"Old Latin\\") text used by Christians in the Roman Empire. A 1933 analysis of the St Augustine Gospels by Hermann Glunz documented around 700 variants from the standard Vulgate: most are minor differences of spelling or word order, but in some cases the scribe chooses readings from the Vetus Latina. This supports the St Augustine connection, as Gregory the Great, the supposed donor, wrote in his Moralia that he was using the more fluent Vulgate, except for certain passages where he found the Old Latin more suitable, and his Forty Homilies on the Gospels opts for the older translation in the same places as the St Augustine Gospels.De Hamel (2016), p.33-6 Miniatures The left-hand scenes on the portrait of Luke The manuscript once contained evangelist portraits for all four Evangelists, preceding their gospel, a usual feature of illuminated Gospel books, and at least three further pages of narrative scenes, one following each portrait page.Weitzmann, 18-19, Beckwith, 143. Other writers think the full complement of two pages, a portrait and a grid of scenes from the gospel, preceded each gospel. Only the two pages preceding Luke have survived. However the surviving total of twenty-four small scenes from the Life of Christ are very rare survivals and of great interest in the history of Christian iconography, especially as they come from the old Western Empire ‚Äì the only comparable narrative Gospel cycles from manuscripts in the period are Greek, notably the Rossano Gospels,These were created in Byzantine Italy in a Byzantine style. Beckwith, 143 mentions comparable ivories. and Sinope Gospels, or the Syriac Rabbula Gospels. The equivalent Old Testament cycles are more varied however, including the Greek Vienna Genesis and Cotton Genesis, the Latin Ashburnham Pentateuch, the Quedlinburg Itala fragment, and some others. The miniatures have moved further from classical style than those in the Greek manuscripts, with \\"a linear style which not only flattens the figure, but begins to develop a rhythmic quality in the linear design which must be seen as the beginning of a process of intentional abstraction\\".Weitzmann, 22 For another historian, the figures in the small scenes have \\"a linear form which we immediately perceive to be medieval\\" and \\"are no longer paintings, but tinted drawings. The same tendency is exhibited in the treatment of the architecture and ornament; the naturalistic polychrome accessories of a manuscript like the Vienna Dioscorides are flattened and attenuated into a calligraphic pattern.\\"Hinks, 69. See also Beckwith, 143 The subject of the influence of the miniatures on later Anglo-Saxon art has often been raised, though in view of most of the presumed picture pages of this manuscript now being lost, and the lack of knowledge as to what other models were available to form the Continental post- classical aspects of the Insular style that developed from the 7th century onwards (with Canterbury as a major centre), all comments by art historians have necessarily been speculative. It is clear from the variety of styles of evangelist portraits found in early Insular manuscripts, echoing examples known from the Continent, that other models were available, and there is a record of an illuminated and imported Bible of St Gregory at Canterbury in the 7th century.Wilson, 94 Later works mentioned as probably influenced by the Augustine Gospels include the Stockholm Codex Aureus and the St Gall Gospel Book.Alexander, J. J. G., Insular Manuscripts, 6th to the 9th Century, Survey of Manuscripts Illuminated in the British Isles 1 (London, 1978) - see comments on Parker Library Bibliography below. In general, though evangelist portraits became a common feature of Insular and Anglo-Saxon Gospel books, the large number of small scenes in the Augustine Gospels were not seen again until much later works like the Eadwine Psalter, made in the 12th century in Canterbury, which has prefatory pages with small narrative images in grids in a similar style to the Augustine Gospels.Page from the Morgan Library . These leaves are dispersed, though most of the manuscript, one of the copies of the Utrecht Psalter, is at Trinity College, Cambridge. See Parker Bibliography, comments, passim. Evangelist portrait of Luke Of the four portrait pages, only that for Luke survives (Folio 129v). He is shown sitting on a marble throne, with a cushion, in an elaborate architectural setting, probably based on the scaenae frons of a Roman theatre - a common convention for Late Antique miniatures, coins and Imperial portraiture. The pose with the chin resting on a hand suggests an origin in classical author portraits of philosophers - more often evangelists are shown writing. Above a cornice sits the winged ox, Luke's evangelist's symbol. The pediment has an inscription with a hexameter from the Carmen Paschale by the 5th century Christian poet Coelius Sedulius (Book 1, line 357):Springer, same page and link \\"Iura sacerdotii Lucas tenet ore iuvenci\\" - \\"Luke holds the laws of priesthood in the mouth of the young bull\\" (iuvencus meaning also \\"young man\\").Translation by Peter McBrine Right-hand scenes More unusually, twelve small scenes drawn from Luke, mostly of the Works of Christ (who can be identified as the only figure with a halo), are set between columns in the architectural frame to the portrait. This particular arrangement is unique in surviving early evangelist portraits, though similar strips of scenes are found in ivory book-covers from the same period.Hinks, 69-70 The scenes themselves probably drew from a now- destroyed fresco cycle of the Life of Christ in Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome.Schiller, I 155 The scenes, many of which were rarely depicted in art from later medieval periods,See Schiller, and The Eadwine psalter: text, image, and monastic culture in twelfth-century Canterbury, p. 29, Margaret T. Gibson, T. A. Heslop, Richard William Pfaff, Penn State Press, 1992, , . There is a slightly different list in Google books Francis Wormold in The Cambridge History of the Bible, Peter R. Ackroyd and others, Cambridge University Press, 1975, , include: *The Annunciation to Zechariah (left, top, Luke 1, 8‚Äì20), as he officiates at the Temple *Christ among the Doctors (left, 2nd down, Luke 2, 43‚Äì50) which omits Saint Joseph, probably from lack of space; Mary enters to the left.Google books, Vision and Meaning in Ninth-century Byzantium: Image as Exegesis in the Homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus, Leslie Brubaker, p. 84, Cambridge University Press, 1999, , *Christ preaching from the boat (left, 3rd down, Luke 5, 3) *The Calling of Peter (left, 4th down, Luke 5, 8) *The Miracle of the son of the widow of Naim, (left, 5th down, Luke 7, 12‚Äì16) at the \\"gate of the city\\". *The Calling of Matthew, a very rare scene (left bottom, Luke 5, 27‚Äì32). *\\"...And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?\\" (right, top: Luke 10, 25)Unambiguously labelled with the text, though once the accuracy of the tituli is doubted, the scene might be the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes (Luke 9, 10‚Äì17). Similar round loaves piled on an apostle appear in the depiction of this scene in the Rossano Gospels (Schiller, Vol 1, fig. 479. *\\"...a certain woman from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him...\\" (right 2nd down, Luke 11, 27‚Äì28): \\"extollens vocem quaedam mulier de turba\\". *The Miracle of the Bent Woman (right 3rd down, Luke 13, 10‚Äì17), though labelled with text from Luke 9, 58: \\"Foxes have holes\\" (see below).Lewine, 489 *The one leper out of the ten (?), Luke 17, 12‚Äì19According to Wormald in the Cambridge History cited above, the \\"parable of the fig tree\\" (Luke 13, 6-9), which precedes the miracle of the bent woman (Luke 13, 11‚Äì13). *The Healing of the Man with Dropsy (Luke 14, 2‚Äì5) *The Calling of Zacchaeus (right, bottom), who had climbed a tree to see Christ better (Luke 19, 1‚Äì10).Schiller, I 156. Brubaker, 383, says this is the earliest known example of this as a separate image. The captions in the margins, added later, probably in the 8th century from the handwriting, name the scenes or are quotations or near-quotations from the Vulgate text of Luke identifying them.Vulgate Latin/English side by side text of Luke. For example, the top right caption reads: \\"legis peritus surrexit temptans illum\\" or \\"[a] lawyer stood up, tempting him\\", from Luke 10, 25. The caption two below this one may misidentify the scene depicted, according to Carol Lewine. Even those, like Francis Wormold, who support the caption, admit the scene could not be so identified without it. The caption reads:\\"Ih[esu]s dixit vulpes fossa habent\\", a paraphrase of the start of Luke 9, 58 (and Matthew 8, 20): \\"et ait illi Iesus vulpes foveas habent et volucres caeli nidos Filius autem hominis non habet ubi caput reclinet\\" - \\"Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\\" The image shows Jesus blessing a bent figure, which could match the quotation, or a miracle.The meaning of the image is the subject of Lewine's article Passion scenes Folio 125r contains 12 scenes from the Passion A full page miniature on folio 125r prior to Luke contains twelve narrative scenes from the Life of Christ, all from the Passion except the Raising of Lazarus. This was included because, following John 11.46 ff. it was considered the immediate cause of the Sanhedrin's decision to move against Christ. As in the few other surviving cycles of the Life from the 6th century, the Crucifixion itself is not shown, the sequence ending with Christ carrying the Cross.Schiller,I 183, II 14 However at least two further such pages once existed, at the start of other Gospels.Weitzmann, 18-19, see also Grove Luke is the third gospel, so a panel preceding the Gospel of John might well have completed the Passion and Resurrection story, and two others covered the earlier life of Christ. The scenes around Luke's portrait notably avoid the major episodes in Christ's life such as his Nativity, Baptism and Temptation, probably reserving these scenes for other grid pages. Compared to other cycles of the time, such as that in mosaic at the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, the Passion scenes show an emphasis on the suffering of Christ that was probably influenced by the art of the Eastern Empire and shows the direction Western depictions were to follow in subsequent centuries. From top left the twelve scenes shown, some of which have captions, are:Schiller, II 14, 64-5 & passim *Christ's entry into Jerusalem *Last Supper, the earliest Western image to show the moment of the first Eucharist, rather than the betrayal of Judas.Schiller, II 33 *Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane *Raising of Lazarus *Washing of feet *Betrayal of Christ *Arrest of Jesus *Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus *Mocking of Christ *Pontius Pilate washes his hands *Christ led from Pilate,Schiller, II 64-5 *Simon of Cyrene helps Christ carrying the Cross In contrast to the scenes around the portrait, all of these scenes except Christ led from Pilate were to remain very common in large narrative cycles throughout the Middle Ages and beyond.For a comparable \\"extra\\" scene around the meeting with Pilate, see the 4th century Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus. The difficulty of identifying many of the episodes of the Works from Luke demonstrates one of the reasons why scenes from the period of Christ's ministry became increasingly less common in medieval art. Another reason for this was the lack of feast-days celebrating them. The two scenes at the top of the central column on the Passion page, in contrast, feature in the gospel reading set for Maundy Thursday, and most of the scenes on this page are easily identified. The Raising of Lazarus, with the body in its white winding-cloth, was one miracle that was easily recognised in images, and remained in the usual repertoire of artists. The Hand of God in the Agony in the Garden is the earliest surviving example of the motif in this scene.Schiller, II, 49 NotesReferences *Beckwith, John, Early Christian and Byzantine Art, Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, *De Hamel, Christopher.

He temporarily served as the Secretary of the Navy. Lewis Warrington entered the U.S. Navy as a midshipman in 1800 and steadily rose in rank. For his heroism in the War of 1812, Congress awarded him a medal. Life and career Born at Williamsburg, Virginia on 3 November 1782, Warrington was the illegitimate son of Rachel Warrington and Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau, who was stationed in Williamsburg during the winter of 1781‚Äì1782, following the battle of Yorktown. The matter of his parentage has long been confused by historians and writers, as other French officers, such the Comte de Lauberdi√®re, recorded flirtations with a number of Williamsburg's women, including Rachel Warrington and her sister Cecilia, at the same time.Robert A. Selig, \\"Lauberdiere's Journal,\\" Colonial Williamsburg: The Journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (Autumn, 1995), 33-37, esp. 36 However, more recent research has discovered extended unsuccessful attempts by members of his mother's family to persuade Rochambeau to openly acknowledge his child, along with indications that Rochambeau offered to legitimize his son after Warrington had achieved success and notoriety.Elizabeth Ambler Letters and Warrington Family Correspondence, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation Library; Donation Marie Joseph de Vimeur Rochambeau Papers, University of Florida Smathers Libraries; Charles Jared Ingersoll, History of the Second War Between the United States of America and Great Britain He briefly attended the College of William and Mary before accepting an appointment as a midshipman in the Navy on 6 January 1800. His first duty, in the frigate Chesapeake, took him to the West Indies, where his ship cruised with a squadron during the last year of the Quasi-War with France. His ship appears to have engaged in one action near the end of the cruise. On New Year's Day 1801, she took the French privateer La Jeune Creole. Following the cessation of hostilities with France, Midshipman Warrington remained in the Navy. His ship spent most of 1801 in ordinary at Norfolk, Virginia. The following year, Warrington was transferred to the frigate President for service in the Mediterranean against the Barbary pirates. Over the next five years, he remained with the Mediterranean Squadron, serving successively in President, Vixen, and Enterprise. Promoted to lieutenant in February 1807, he returned home to assume command of a gunboat at Norfolk. In 1809, Lt. Warrington voyaged to Europe in Syren as a dispatch courier. He next served a tour of duty in Essex. When the war with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland began in June 1812, Warrington was in Congress serving as the frigate's first lieutenant while she patrolled the North Atlantic. During his tour of duty in that warship, she made two successful war cruises, capturing nine prizes off the east coast of the United States during the first and four off the Atlantic seaboard of South America during the second. Promoted to Master Commandant in July 1813, he took command of the sloop-of-war Peacock later in the year. On 12 March 1814, he put to sea with his new command bound for the naval station at St. Mary's, Georgia. After delivering supplies to that installation, he encountered the British brig Epervier off Cape Canaveral, Florida. Peacock emerged victorious from a brisk 45-minute exchange with that opponent, inflicting 10 times her own losses on the enemy. For his role in the victory, Warrington received the Thanks of Congress in the form of a Congressional Gold Medal, and of the state of Virginia in the form of a gold-hilted sword. He was also elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. Warrington took his prize into Savannah, Georgia, and then embarked upon his second cruise on 4 June. On that voyage, which took him to the Grand Banks, the Irish coast, the Shetland Islands, and the Faroe Islands, he took 14 prizes. After returning via the West Indies to New York, Warrington took Peacock on her third and final war cruise. His sloop-of-war stood out of New York with Hornet and Tom Bowline on 23 January 1815, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope, and entered the Indian Ocean. Unaware that peace had been concluded in December 1814 at Ghent, Belgium, Warrington led his little force on another successful foray against British commerce. After taking three prizes in the Indian Ocean, he entered the East Indies in search of more game. On 30 June, he encountered the East India Company brig Nautilus in the Sunda Strait and attacked her, despite having been told that peace had been concluded. After a sharp, unequal action which cost the British ship 15 men including her first lieutenant, she surrendered to Warrington. Warrington then released the prize and started for home. Peacock arrived back in New York on 30 October 1815. In 1816, he commanded Macedonian briefly for a voyage to Cartagena, Spain, to convey there Christopher Hughes, the representative of the United States at negotiations over the release of some Americans imprisoned by Spanish authorities. In 1819 and 1820, Captain Warrington commanded Java, followed by Guerriere in 1820 and 1821. Each ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron during his tenure as her commanding officer. Captain Warrington returned home and received orders to duty at the Norfolk Navy Yard. In February 1825, he relieved David Porter as commander of the West Indian Squadron during the latter stages of the piracy suppression campaign and thereafter bore the title, commodore. In 1826, Warrington served as one of three commissioners on a panel charged with selecting a site on which to establish a new South Atlantic fleet. The panel selected Pensacola, Florida - site of the first permanent European settlement in North America in the year 1559 - and Warrington was ordered to Pensacola where he was charged with overseeing the construction of a new navy yard.http://www.pnj.com/story/life/2015/06/18/appleyard-remember- warrington/28945423/ Warrington established a village adjacent to the new navy yard and gave it his name. Warrington Village remained occupied until the 1930s when the property was transitioned for use in naval aviation and the residents were relocated. Many residents moved just outside the navy base, and established a New Warrington. Today, the diverse community is known simply as Warrington. In 1829, Lewis Warrington was promoted and returned to Norfolk for a decade as commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. In 1840, he was reassigned to Washington for another two years as commissioner on the Navy Board. After the 1842 reorganization of the Navy Department, Warrington became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. On 28 February 1844, he took over temporarily the duties of the Secretary of the Navy after Secretary Thomas W. Gilmer died as a result of wounds received when the large cannon \\"Peacemaker\\" exploded during a firing demonstration on board Princeton at Washington. Near the end of March, Warrington relinquished those duties to the new secretary, John Y. Mason, and resumed his former assignment. In 1846, he became Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, which office he held until his death on 12 October 1851. He was buried at Congressional Cemetery at a service attended by President Millard Fillmore, members of the Cabinet, and a crowd of other dignitaries.The National Intelligencer, 15 October 1851 Text of Congressional Gold Medal :Friday, 21 October 1814 :Resolution, expressive of the sense of Congress relative to the victory of the Peacock over the Epervier. :Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be requested to present to Captain Lewis Warrington, of the sloop of war Peacock, a gold medal, with suitable emblems and devices, and a silver medal, with like emblems and devices, to each of the commissioned officers, and a sword to each of the midshipmen, and to the sailing master of the said vessel, in testimony of the high sense entertained by Congress of the gallantry and good conduct of the officers and crew, in the action with the British brig Epervier, on the twenty-ninth day of April, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, in which action the decisive effect and great superiority of the American gunnery were so signally displayed.

The film was made by Embassy Pictures and Solar Productions, in association with and released by Paramount Pictures. The movie was a prequel to the 1961 Harold Robbins novel The Carpetbaggers, which had been made into a highly successful film two years earlier, with Alan Ladd playing McQueen's part as an older man. Nevada Smith depicts Smith's first meeting with another \\"Carpetbaggers\\" character, Jonas Cord, but the two films' stories are otherwise unrelated. Plot In the 1890s American West, outlaws Bill Bowdre, Jesse Coe, and Tom Fitch rob, torture and brutally kill the white father and Kiowa mother of young Max Sand. Max sets out to avenge their deaths. While traveling in the desert, Max uncovers a rusty old gun. Coming upon Jonas Cord, a traveling gunsmith, Max tries to rob him. Cord, recognizing that Max's revolver is non-functional, convinces Max he has failed. Max tells Cord about his vengeful journey. Cord, sympathetic, shelters him and teaches him to shoot. Max hunts the killers, who have since separated. He tracks down Jesse Coe to Abilene, Texas. With help from Neesa, a Kiowa dance hall girl, he confronts Coe in a saloon. A knife fight ensues in a nearby corral. Coe is killed but Max is severely wounded. Neesa takes him to her tribe's camp and nurses him back to health. Soon after, they become lovers. Once recovered, Max continues his pursuit. He learns that Bowdre is in a prison camp located deep within Louisiana's swamps. Max deliberately commits a bank robbery to be sent to the same prison as Bowdre. Max persuades Bowdre to escape with him, planning to kill him in the swamp. Pilar, a local Cajun girl working in the rice fields near the convicts‚Äô camp agrees to help Max. Unaware of Max's plan to kill Bowdre, she obtains a boat and navigates the trio through the swamp. The boat capsizes early on and Pilar is bitten by a venomous snake. Max kills Bowdre and Pilar dies from the snakebite. Max has escaped and is now hunting Fitch, the last murderer. Still blinded by revenge, Max infiltrates Fitch's gang, calling himself, \\"Nevada Smith\\". Fitch knows Max Sand has killed Coe and Bowdre and is coming for him. Though he accepts \\"Nevada\\" into the gang, Fitch is wary. As the gang rides out to commit a gold-transport robbery, Max is spotted by Cord, who calls out his name. Max ignores him and the gang rides on. Fitch now suspects one of his men is Max. As the gang greedily scoops up the stolen gold, Max watches from a hill. Fitch, realizing \\"Smith\\" is Sand, grabs his share and flees. Max pursues him and corners him at a creek. Fitch tries shooting Sand while pretending to surrender, but Sand, faster, shoots Fitch's hand. Fitch gives up and wants Max to quickly kill him. Max shoots Fitch several more times, inflicting flesh wounds. As Fitch lies in the creek, bleeding profusely, Max demands Fitch beg for his life. Fitch calls Max a coward for refusing to kill him. Max decides Fitch is not worth killing and rides away as Fitch continues shouting at Max to kill him. Cast * Steve McQueen as Max Sand, a.k.a.

Alternatively, a deontic logic is a formal system that attempts to capture the essential logical features of these concepts. Typically, a deontic logic uses OA to mean it is obligatory that A (or it ought to be (the case) that A), and PA to mean it is permitted (or permissible) that A. Etymology The term deontic is derived from the Ancient Greek Œ¥Œ≠ŒøŒΩ d√©on (gen.: Œ¥Œ≠ŒøŒΩœÑŒøœÇ d√©ontos), meaning \\"that which is binding or proper.\\" Standard deontic logic In Georg Henrik von Wright's first system, obligatoriness and permissibility were treated as features of acts. Soon after this, it was found that a deontic logic of propositions could be given a simple and elegant Kripke-style semantics, and von Wright himself joined this movement. The deontic logic so specified came to be known as \\"standard deontic logic,\\" often referred to as SDL, KD, or simply D. It can be axiomatized by adding the following axioms to a standard axiomatization of classical propositional logic: : O(A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\rightarrow (OA \\\\rightarrow OB) : PA\\\\to\\\\lnot O\\\\lnot A In English, these axioms say, respectively: * If it ought to be that A implies B, then if it ought to be that A, it ought to be that B; * If A is permissible, then it is not the case that it ought not to be that A. FA, meaning it is forbidden that A, can be defined (equivalently) as O \\\\lnot A or \\\\lnot PA. There are two main extensions of SDL that are usually considered. The first results by adding an alethic modal operator \\\\Box in order to express the Kantian claim that \\"ought implies can\\": : OA \\\\to \\\\Diamond A. where \\\\Diamond\\\\equiv\\\\lnot\\\\Box\\\\lnot. It is generally assumed that \\\\Box is at least a KT operator, but most commonly it is taken to be an S5 operator. The other main extension results by adding a \\"conditional obligation\\" operator O(A/B) read \\"It is obligatory that A given (or conditional on) B\\". Motivation for a conditional operator is given by considering the following (\\"Good Samaritan\\") case. It seems true that the starving and poor ought to be fed. But that the starving and poor are fed implies that there are starving and poor. By basic principles of SDL we can infer that there ought to be starving and poor! The argument is due to the basic K axiom of SDL together with the following principle valid in any normal modal logic: :\\\\vdash A\\\\to B\\\\Rightarrow\\\\ \\\\vdash OA\\\\to OB. If we introduce an intensional conditional operator then we can say that the starving ought to be fed only on the condition that there are in fact starving: in symbols O(A/B). But then the following argument fails on the usual (e.g. Lewis 73) semantics for conditionals: from O(A/B) and that A implies B, infer OB. Indeed, one might define the unary operator O in terms of the binary conditional one O(A/B) as OA\\\\equiv O(A/\\\\top), where \\\\top stands for an arbitrary tautology of the underlying logic (which, in the case of SDL, is classical). Similarly Alan R. Anderson (1959) shows how to define O in terms of the alethic operator \\\\Box and a deontic constant (i.e. 0-ary modal operator) s standing for some sanction (i.e. bad thing, prohibition, etc.): OA\\\\equiv\\\\Box(\\\\lnot A\\\\to s). Intuitively, the right side of the biconditional says that A's failing to hold necessarily (or strictly) implies a sanction. Dyadic deontic logic An important problem of deontic logic is that of how to properly represent conditional obligations, e.g. If you smoke (s), then you ought to use an ashtray (a). It is not clear that either of the following representations is adequate: : O(\\\\mathrm{smoke} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{ashtray}) : \\\\mathrm{smoke} \\\\rightarrow O(\\\\mathrm{ashtray}) Under the first representation it is vacuously true that if you commit a forbidden act, then you ought to commit any other act, regardless of whether that second act was obligatory, permitted or forbidden (Von Wright 1956, cited in Aqvist 1994). Under the second representation, we are vulnerable to the gentle murder paradox, where the plausible statements (1) if you murder, you ought to murder gently, (2) you do commit murder, and (3) to murder gently you must murder imply the less plausible statement: you ought to murder. Others argue that must in the phrase to murder gently you must murder is a mistranslation from the ambiguous English word (meaning either implies or ought). Interpreting must as implies does not allow one to conclude you ought to murder but only a repetition of the given you murder. Misinterpreting must as ought results in a perverse axiom, not a perverse logic. With use of negations one can easily check if the ambiguous word was mistranslated by considering which of the following two English statements is equivalent with the statement to murder gently you must murder: is it equivalent to if you murder gently it is forbidden not to murder or if you murder gently it is impossible not to murder ? Some deontic logicians have responded to this problem by developing dyadic deontic logics, which contain binary deontic operators: : O(A \\\\mid B) means it is obligatory that A, given B : P(A \\\\mid B) means it is permissible that A, given B. (The notation is modeled on that used to represent conditional probability.) Dyadic deontic logic escapes some of the problems of standard (unary) deontic logic, but it is subject to some problems of its own. Other variations Many other varieties of deontic logic have been developed, including non-monotonic deontic logics, paraconsistent deontic logics, and dynamic deontic logics. History=Early deontic logic Philosophers from the Indian Mimamsa school to those of Ancient Greece have remarked on the formal logical relations of deontic conceptsHuisjes, C. H., 1981, \\"Norms and logic,\\" Thesis, University of Groningen. and philosophers from the late Middle Ages compared deontic concepts with alethic ones. In his Elementa juris naturalis (written between 1669 and 1671), Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz notes the logical relations between the licitum (permitted), the illicitum (prohibited), the debitum (obligatory), the , and the indifferens (facultative) are equivalent to those between the possibile, the impossibile, the necessarium, and the contingens respectively.R. Hilpinen (ed.), New Studies in Deontic Logic: Norms, Actions, and the Foundations of Ethics, Springer, 2012, pp. 3‚Äì4. Mally's first deontic logic and von Wright's first plausible deontic logic Ernst Mally, a pupil of Alexius Meinong, was the first to propose a formal system of deontic logic in his Grundgesetze des Sollens (1926) and he founded it on the syntax of Whitehead's and Russell's propositional calculus. Mally's deontic vocabulary consisted of the logical constants U and ‚à©, unary connective !, and binary connectives f and ‚àû. : * Mally read !A as \\"A ought to be the case\\". * He read A f B as \\"A requires B\\" . * He read A ‚àû B as \\"A and B require each other.\\" * He read U as \\"the unconditionally obligatory\\" . * He read ‚à© as \\"the unconditionally forbidden\\". Mally defined f, ‚àû, and ‚à© as follows: : Def. f. A f B = A ‚Üí !B Def. ‚àû. A ‚àû B = (A f B) & (B f A) Def. ‚à©. ‚à© = ¬¨U Mally proposed five informal principles: : (i) If A requires B and if B requires C, then A requires C. (ii) If A requires B and if A requires C, then A requires B and C. (iii) A requires B if and only if it is obligatory that if A then B. (iv) The unconditionally obligatory is obligatory. (v) The unconditionally obligatory does not require its own negation. He formalized these principles and took them as his axioms: : I. ((A f B) & (B ‚Üí C)) ‚Üí (A f C) II. ((A f B) & (A f C)) ‚Üí (A f (B & C)) III. (A f B) ‚Üî !(A ‚Üí B) IV. ‚àÉU !U V. ¬¨(U f ‚à©) From these axioms Mally deduced 35 theorems, many of which he rightly considered strange. Karl Menger showed that !A ‚Üî A is a theorem and thus that the introduction of the ! sign is irrelevant and that A ought to be the case if A is the case. After Menger, philosophers no longer considered Mally's system viable. Gert Lokhorst lists Mally's 35 theorems and gives a proof for Menger's theorem at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy under Mally's Deontic Logic. The first plausible system of deontic logic was proposed by G. H. von Wright in his paper Deontic Logic in the philosophical journal Mind in 1951. (Von Wright was also the first to use the term \\"deontic\\" in English to refer to this kind of logic although Mally published the German paper Deontik in 1926.) Since the publication of von Wright's seminal paper, many philosophers and computer scientists have investigated and developed systems of deontic logic. Nevertheless, to this day deontic logic remains one of the most controversial and least agreed-upon areas of logic. G. H. von Wright did not base his 1951 deontic logic on the syntax of the propositional calculus as Mally had done, but was instead influenced by alethic modal logics, which Mally had not benefited from. In 1964, von Wright published A New System of Deontic Logic, which was a return to the syntax of the propositional calculus and thus a significant return to Mally's system. (For more on von Wright's departure from and return to the syntax of the propositional calculus, see Deontic Logic: A Personal View and A New System of Deontic Logic, both by Georg Henrik von Wright.) G. H. von Wright's adoption of the modal logic of possibility and necessity for the purposes of normative reasoning was a return to Leibniz. Although von Wright's system represented a significant improvement over Mally's, it raised a number of problems of its own. For example, Ross's paradox applies to von Wright's deontic logic, allowing us to infer from \\"It is obligatory that the letter is mailed\\" to \\"It is obligatory that either the letter is mailed or the letter is burned\\", which seems to imply it is permissible that the letter is burned. The Good Samaritan paradox also applies to his system, allowing us to infer from \\"It is obligatory to nurse the man who has been robbed\\" that \\"It is obligatory that the man has been robbed\\". Another major source of puzzlement is Chisholm's paradox. There is no formalisation in von Wright's system of the following claims that allows them to be both jointly satisfiable and logically independent: * It ought to be that Jones goes (to the assistance of his neighbors). * It ought to be that if Jones goes, then he tells them he is coming. * If Jones doesn't go, then he ought not tell them he is coming. * Jones doesn't go. J√∏rgensen's dilemma Deontic logic faces J√∏rgensen's dilemma. This problem is best seen as a trilemma. The following three claims are incompatible: * Logical inference requires that the elements (premises and conclusions) have truth-values * Normative statements do not have truth-values * There are logical inferences between normative statements Responses to this problem involve rejecting one of the three premises. The input/output logics reject the first premise. They provide inference mechanism on elements without presupposing that these elements have truth-values. Alternatively, one can deny the second premise. One way to do this is to distinguish between the norm itself and a proposition about the norm. According to this response, only the proposition about the norm has a truth-value. Finally, one can deny the third premise. But this is to deny that there is a logic of norms worth investigating.

Established on January 15, 1985, Elex Media Komputindo is a subsidiary of Kompas Gramedia Group. Elex is headquartered in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta. Elex Media Komputindo is known as the pioneer of manga publishing in Indonesia, and is now one of the largest comic publishers in Indonesia.  History  Established in 1985, Elex Media initially published various electronic and computer-themed books. The founder of Kompas, Jakob Oetama, was interested in the potential of manga during his visit to Japan in the late 1980s. In 1991, Elex Media plunged into the manga publishing industry with the publication of Kyoko Mizuki's Candy Candy manga, originally published by Kodansha. Other manga like Kungfu Boy, Doraemon, and Dragon Ball began to follow. The decision of the New Order government to allow the establishment of private television stations was also influential in the spread of outside culture, including the manga. Various private television stations licensed and broadcast Japanese anime which also influenced the interest of comic and manga lovers in Indonesia. Indonesian local comics began to appear in 1994 with the publication of the Imperium Majapahit (Majapahit Empire) by Jan Mintaraga. Elex Media began to adopt the Japanese manga style publishing in 1995 and applied it to local comics in 2001. As of December 2008, almost 7500 comic volumes had been published. Elex Media established their adult manga imprint, Level Comics in 2005. Their manga titles including 20th Century Boys, Homunculus, Vagabond, Shin Angyo Onshi, and Soul Eater. They also adopted the age rating system for its readers. All adult-themed comics and manga are published under the Level Comics label, while Elex Media is responsible for publishing comics in all age categories or teenagers. In determining the age rating of an individual comic, Elex Media doesn't follow the rating standards in Japan, but rather the suitability of the comic for readers in Indonesia. Elex Media doesn't publish comics or manga with blatant pornography. In August 2009, Elex Media established Romic (euROpean coMIC line). The book titles included in this category are Lucky Luke, Smurf, Michel Vaillant, Yakari, and Spirou & Fantasio.

He was descended from Atherton Mather (1663‚Äì1734), a cousin of Cotton Mather. His early work dealt with the stability of smooth mappings between smooth manifolds of dimensions n (for the source manifold N) and p (for the target manifold P). He determined the precise dimensions (n,p) for which smooth mappings are stable with respect to smooth equivalence by diffeomorphisms of the source and target (i.e., infinitely differentiable coordinate changes). Mather also proved the conjecture of the French topologist Ren√© Thom that under topological equivalence smooth mappings are generically stable: the subset of the space of smooth mappings between two smooth manifolds consisting of the topologically stable mappings is a dense subset in the smooth Whitney topology. His notes on the topic of topological stability are still a standard reference on the topic of topologically stratified spaces. In the 1970s, Mather switched to the field of dynamical systems. He made the following main contributions to dynamical systems that deeply influenced the field. 1\\\\. He introduced the concept of Mather spectrum and gave a characterization of Anosov diffeomorphisms.Mather, John N. \\"Characterization of Anosov diffeomorphisms.\\" Indagationes Mathematicae (Proceedings).

Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1975. 573‚Äì597. 3\\\\. He developed a variational theory for the globally action minimizing orbits for twist maps (convex Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom), along the line of the work of George David Birkhoff, Marston Morse, Gustav A.

This period may not be less than three years nor longer than six years.\\"Code of Canon Law, canon 655 \\"When the period of time for which the profession was made has been completed, a religious who freely asks, and is judged suitable, is to be admitted to a renewal of profession or to perpetual profession; otherwise, the religious is to leave.\\"Code of Canon Law, canon 657 Conditions for making a temporary religious profession are a minimum age of 18 years, completion of a regular novitiate, freedom of choice on the part of the person making the profession, and acceptance by the superior after a vote by the superior's council.Code of Canon Law, canon 656 Additional conditions for making perpetual profession are a minimum age of 21 years and the completion of at least three years of temporary profession.Code of Canon Law, canon 658 Religious profession is often associated with the granting of a religious habit, which the newly professed receives from the superior of the institute or from the bishop. Acceptance of the habit implies acceptance of the obligation of membership of the religious institute as well as the associated vows. History The origins of religious profession date from the time when Christians were recognized in the Church as followers after perfection in the practice of religious life. We meet them in the third century, under the name of ascetics, called in Greek asketai, and in Latin confessores. Eusebius of Caesarea (Church History, III, xxxvii) numbers among the ascetics the most illustrious pontiffs of the first ages, St. Clement of Rome, St. Ignatius of Antioch, St. Polycarp, and others. After these, in the fourth century, come the hermits and monks, followed in the eleventh century by the canons regular, in the thirteenth century by the mendicant orders, in the sixteenth by the clerks regular, and lastly by the members of religious congregations. Profession for a long time was made by clothing with the religious habit: the aspirant could personally put on the habit or receive it, with or without ceremony, from the abbot or from the bishop. This clothing laid upon him the obligation of poverty and chastity more as a natural consequence of a donation or consecration to God than as arising from formal vows, which did not exist at that time (cf. St. Basil, Regul√¶ fusius tractat√¶ resp. ad 14 interrogat. in P. G., XXXI, 949‚Äì52). The community life, established under Schenoudi, the great disciple of St. Pachomius, added an explicit promise of fidelity to certain precepts. St. Benedict added an express promise of stability, and obedience to the superior. These last promises denoted obligations created in addition to those implied by taking the habit. The first formula, which expressly mentions poverty and chastity, is that of the Constitutions of Narbonne, promulgated in 1260 by St. Bonaventure for the Friars Minor. Then the constitutions of the Minims and clerks regular expressly mention the three essential vows of the religious life, as well as those superadded on account of the special ends of their orders. This discipline is common to religious orders and congregations. Finally the regulations (Norm√¶) of 1901, published in explanation of the present practice of the Holy See, do not permit in new congregations any but the three essential vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. In the Decretal, \\"Quod votum,\\" unic. De veto et voti redemptione (iii, 15) in 6¬∞, Boniface VIII declared authoritatively that the vow of chastity, consecrated by the reception of major orders, or by religious profession in an approved institute, created a diriment impediment to marriage. Some communities of tertiaries not belonging to an approved order were the first to introduce profession accompanied by simple vows, which is now the ordinary practice in the more recent congregations. The \\"Annals of the Order of St. Benedict\\" (vol. I, p. 74)\\"Annals of the Order of St Benedict\\" in the year 537 recognized among the Greeks three classes of religious: the novices, who wore the simple tunic; the perfect, clothed with the pallium; and the more perfect invested with the cuculla, or hood attached to a short cloak, covering the shoulders, which was considered the special emblem of the religious life. In certain monasteries of the East, a distinction was made between persons wearing the short habit, mikroschemoi, and those wearing the long habit, megaloschemoi, a distinction against which St. Theodorus the Studite protested in his epistles (I, ep. x, in P. G., XCIX, 941‚Äì2), and which is still found among the Schismatic Coptic monks (see Kathol. Missionen 1 Oct., 1910, p. 7 sqq.). St. Ignatius of Loyola laid down that in his order there should be a simple profession, followed by more or less frequent renewal of vows until such time as the candidate should be prepared for the solemn or definitive profession; this under Pius IX and Leo XIII has become the common law of all religious orders.

The neighborhood draws its name for the Sursum Corda Co-operative Apartments, a 199-unit low-income housing complex constructed in 1968. The area became a notorious open air drug market plagued by violence and poverty in the 1980s. After a notorious 2004 murder in the neighborhood, demolition and complete renovation of the low-income housing in Sursum Corda was announced in 2007. Little of the redevelopment happened, although extensive demolition occurred. History Residential neighborhoods north of Massachusetts Avenue underwent a prolonged decay in the first half of the 20th century. Controversial urban renewal plans of the 1950s and 1960s called for massive demolition of the area, part of it comprising the old Irish American neighborhood of Swampoodle. The plans though were only partially executed. Sursum Corda Co-operative Various Masonic and religious organizations took advantage of loan programs of the recently created U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build housing for some of the displaced households. A group of Catholic activists from the nearby Gonzaga College High School and the parish of St. Aloysius conceived of a new urban village to house some of the households displaced by the demolitions. They also received support from the D.C. Public Housing Authority and the then-Senator from New York, Robert F. Kennedy. The leading organizer and founder of the Cooperative was Eugene L. Stewart, an alumnus of Georgetown University. In 1965, Stewart was approached as a member of the Georgetown Alumni Association and asked if the Association would become involved by sponsoring a low income housing project. The idea presented to him was for students and alumni to assist with tutoring the poor and their children in the community. Stewart presented the ideas to the Alumni Board of Governors, but the plan was rejected. He formed Sursum Corda, Inc. and oversaw the construction of the Sursum Corda Cooperative. Image of Sursum Corda Cooperative on 1st Street NW, taken in January 2014. Construction on the new development began in 1967. It was named Sursum Corda, a Latin expression meaning \\"Lift up your hearts\\" (which is intoned at the start of the Eucharistic Prayer during the Mass). The original plan called for 155 resident-owned and 44 rental townhouses on four acres (16,000 m¬≤), arranged on courtyards and alleys around a horseshoe-shaped street (1st Terrace, L Place, and 1st Place NW) to promote a sense of community. The style was quite unusual for public housing of the era, in that the neighborhood was largely closed off, presaging some of the HOPE VI rehabilitation plans. The units offered amenities such as air conditioning, washer and dryer units, and kitchen garbage disposals. Rents were originally fixed at 25 percent of the residents' income. A group of nuns from the religious institute of the Religious of the Sacred Heart (R.S.C.J.) were among the first residents, aiming to support and minister to the new residents. Father Horace McKenna, a Jesuit priest at St. Aloysius Church at Gonzaga College High School and well-known advocate for the poor, established a program to bring Georgetown University undergraduate students to tutor children in the neighborhood, a program which continues to the present day. McKenna Walk NW is named for him. Disadvantageous tax laws led to neglect of the properties, and the arrival of crack cocaine in the 1980s sent the neighborhood into a steep decline. Its layout made it difficult to police, and consequently an ideal drug market and frequent battleground for street gangs. Despite the efforts of the Tenants Association, it became associated with poverty and crime. Even the nuns were driven away, the last departing in the early 1990s. Other community landmarks The Sursum Corda neighborhood also contains the Julius Hobson Plaza Condominiums (named for Julius Hobson, a civil rights activist and member of the first elected Council of the District of Columbia), the Severna Apartments, Sibley Plaza, the Turnkey, and the Tyler House Apartments. Sibley Plaza and the Turnkey are both owned by the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), while the DeSeverna and Tyler House Apartments contain large numbers of units subsidized by the DCHA. Local landmarks include the Walker-Jones Education Campus (preschool through eighth-grade) on New Jersey Avenue NW between Pierce and L Streets NW and its associated athletic field and basketball courts; the K Street Farm (a good farm managed by Walker-Jones teachers) on the northwest corner of K Street NW and New Jersey Avenue NW; and the Northwest One Neighborhood Library (built in 2009). Neighborhood redevelopment On January 23, 2004, 14-year-old Jahkema \\"Princess\\" Hansen was murdered in the Sursum Corda Co-operative. Hansen was involved with 28-year-old Marquette Ward, a known drug dealer. On January 18, 2004, Ward shot and killed 21-year- old Mario J. Evans in a hallway at the Temple Court Apartments for refusing to sell him a discounted drug. Hansen and an 18-year-old girl witnessed the murder. Ward, worried that Hansen would talk to the police, paid 22-year-old Franklin Thompson $8,000 to kill Hansen. While Hansen ate dinner at a friend's apartment in the Sursum Corda Co-op on January 23, Thompson burst into the apartment and opened fire, wounding a 12-year-old girl. Hansen fled through the apartment. Thompson chased her and shot her twice in the head. Thompson and Ward were both convicted of first-degree murder in 2006. Hansen's murder, which The Washington Post called \\"heinous\\" and \\"execution-style\\", shocked many residents of the city and drew attention to the terrible housing conditions and severe crime occurring in the neighborhood. It also prodded city officials to spur redevelopment in the area. Northwest One project Determined to change the Sursum Corda neighborhood, the government of the District of Columbia announced a plan to tear down the Sursum Corda Co-op, the Golden Rule housing and retail complex, the Temple Court Apartments, and other nearby buildings and construct a $700 million mixed use housing, office, and retail center for low-income residents. The city said that William C. Smith & Co., Jair Lynch Partners, Banneker Ventures, and Community Preservation Development would lead the project. Dubbed Northwest One, the project would build 1,630 units (spread among apartments, condominiums, and townhouses), rebuild of retail space, add of office space, and construct a health clinic (to be run by Unity Health Clinic). Northwest One would triple the residential density of the area, and increase low-income housing to 571 units from 410 units. An additional $45 million in city funds would be used to rebuild Walker-Jones Elementary School and construct a new branch library in the area. Little actual redevelopment occurred, although most of the buildings were demolished. The Sursum Corda co-operative declined to participate in the redevelopment. But the owners of other structures, such as the Golden Rule complex (owned by Bible Way Temple, a nearby church) did. Temple Court Apartments was the largest housing complex in the area, with 520 units. But the Bush Companies, which owned Temple Court, wanted to out of the federal and city government- subsidized low-income housing plans and wanted to convert its units to market- rate housing. The District of Columbia exercised eminent domain over Temple Court, seizing it and ensuring it would not block the Northwest One plan. Demolition of the participating structures occurred in 2008, with residents dispersed to other public housing projects in the city. In 2009, the redeveloped Walker-Jones Education Campus and the Northwest One Neighborhood Library opened. But then redevelopment stopped. DCHA never assigned anyone to oversee the project, which left no one to push the developers to fulfill their agreement. DCHA itself was required to move from its headquarters at 1133 North Capitol Street NE to vacate and demolish its own headquarters to make way for the planned new housing, but the agency never did so. DCHA then lost the blueprints for the project, and only relocated them in June 2013. DCHA then discovered‚Äîafter it had demolished the building‚Äîthat the Temple Court Apartments were built with a mortgage insured by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. This $3.9 million insurance policy required that only subsidized housing could be built on the Temple Court land, but the Northwest One project envisioned market-rate, office, and retail use there. Mayor Adrian Fenty and Mayor Vincent C. Gray both pledged to resolve the issue, but never did. Only two of the many planned Northwest One buildings were constructed. One was the 2M Street Apartments at 2 M Street NE. Built with $16.8 million in DCHA funds, only 93 of its 314 units are subsidized for low-income residents. The other was the Severna Apartments, owned and built by Bible Way Temple. The $15.7 million building (constructed with $1.9 million in DCHA funds) opened in 2011. All of its units are for low-income residents. The construction of the nearby NoMa - Gallaudet University Metro station and a surge in property values sparked redevelopment of the area. New Sursum Corda project In August 2015, Sursum Corda Cooperative Association announced it had partnered with Winn Development Co. and adjacent private landowners in the neighborhood to redevelop the Sursum Corda co-op and the surrounding of land into a new high-density, mixed use housing development. The development, which will occur in two phases, will contain more than 1,100 apartments, six times the co-op's current capacity. Five buildings, with of residential space, of retail space, and 800 parking spaces, will be constructed on two parcels. The first phase, constructed on the parcel at L and 1st Streets NE, will contain three buildings of 164 units, 166 units, and 100 units. The second phase, located at the site of the current Sursum Corda Co-operative Apartments, will see two buildings of 339 units and 373 units. Starting in November 2018, Toll Brothers development began demolition paving the way for the re-development.

It is a perennial herbaceous species, growing 30‚Äì100 cm (rarely 140 cm) tall with erect dark green stems 2‚Äì8 mm in diameter, smooth, with about 10‚Äì30 fine ridges. At each joint, the stem has a whorl of tiny, black-tipped scale leaves 5‚Äì10 mm long. Many, but not all, stems also have whorls of short ascending and spreading branches 1‚Äì5 cm long, with the longest branches on the lower middle of the stem. The side branches are slender, dark green, and have 1‚Äì8 nodes with a whorl of five scale leaves at each node. The water horsetail has the largest central hollow of the horsetails, with 80% of the stem diameter typically being hollow. Equisetum fluviatile - a broken stem with the central hollow exposed. The stems readily pull apart at the joints, and both fertile and sterile stems look alike. The water horsetail reproduces both by spores and vegetatively by rhizomes. It primarily reproduces by vegetative means, with the majority of shoots arising from rhizomes. Spores are produced in blunt-tipped cones at the tips of some stems. The spore cones are yellowish-green, 1‚Äì2 cm long and 1 cm broad, with numerous scales in dense whorls. The water horsetail ranges throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, from Eurasia south to central Spain, Italy, the Caucasus, China, Korea and Japan, and in North America from the Aleutian Islands to Newfoundland, south to Oregon, Idaho, northwest Montana, northeast Wyoming, West Virginia and Virginia. This horsetail is sometimes seen as an invasive species because it is very hardy and tends to overwhelm other garden plants unless it is contained. When planting, it is best to plant them with the rhizome in a container. The water horsetail is most often confused with the marsh horsetail E. palustre, which has rougher stems with fewer (4-8) stem ridges with a smaller hollow in the stem centre, and longer spore cones 2‚Äì4 cm long. Uses The water horsetail has historically been used by both Europeans and Native Americans for scouring, sanding, and filing because of the high silica content in the stems. Early spring shoots were eaten. Medically it was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to stop bleeding and treat kidney ailments, ulcers, and tuberculosis, and by the ancient Chinese to treat superficial visual obstructions. Rootstocks and stems are sometimes eaten by waterfowl. Horsetails absorb heavy metals from the soil, and are often used in bioassays for metals. According to Carl Linnaeus, reindeer, which refuse ordinary hay, will eat this horsetail, which is juicy, and that it is cut as fodder in the north of Sweden for cows, with a view to increasing their milk yield, but that horses will not touch it.

It was formed on 29 July 1961 and officially registered on 13 August 1961 by left-wing members of the People's Action Party (PAP) who had been expelled from the PAP. The prominent founding members of the Barisan were Dr Lee Siew Choh and Lim Chin Siong. It became the biggest opposition party in Singapore in the 1960s and the 1980s. The main objectives of the Barisan included eradicating colonialism, establishing a united independent and democratic Malayan nation comprising the Federation of Malaya and Singapore and introducing an economic system to promote prosperity and stability in society. The party was merged into the Workers' Party of Singapore in 1988. Background Since its formation, the PAP was divided into the Lee Kuan Yew camp and the left-wing camp led by Lim Chin Siong. The common ground of anti- colonialism and independence of Singapore was the basis for the co-operation between the two camps. Differences in their mass bases also encouraged such co-operation. During the early years, the left-wing camp mainly commanded support from the Chinese masses, rural people and trade unions, while support for Lee Kuan Yew's camp was mainly found in the English-educated community. With the support of the working class, the PAP won the third-most seats in the 1955 election and formed the main opposition. In 1959, with the support of the trade unions, the PAP won the election and formed the Government under Lee Kuan Yew. However, the two camps were ideologically and politically different in nature. During its formative years, the left-wing members already showed their dissatisfaction with the policies carried out by Lee Kuan Yew and his failure to fulfill his promises to help secure the release of the left-wing political detainees. Finally, the contentious issue of merger with Malaysia triggered the split within the PAP. On 27 May 1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, suggested the creation of a new Malaysia state consisting of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. The reactions towards merger within the PAP were divided. The merger with Malaysia was supported by the Lee Kuan Yew camp as a means of assuring Singapore's future security and prosperity, while opposed by the left-wing camp as the merger was seen as an attempt to \\"wipe out the left-wing forces in Singapore\\" (Interview with Dr Lee Siew Choh). The rupture within the PAP was widened by the Hong Lim and Anson by-elections in 1961. Displeased with the PAP government's refusal to abolish the Internal Security Council(ISC), refusal to back down the merger plan and refusal to release the remaining political detainees, the PAP left-wingers abandoned support for their own candidates in favour of Ong Eng Guan (in Hong Lim) and David Marshall (in Anson), which led to the PAP's defeat in the two by-elections. After the Anson by-election, the left-wing camp planned to oust Lee Kuan Yew from the party but they worried that their actions would cause the British to hold up plans for Singapore's independence. As a result, the left-wingers had a meeting with Lord Selkirk, the British Commissioner-General at Eden Hall, which was later known as the \\"Eden Hall Tea Party\\". At the meeting, the left got assurance from Selkirk that Britain was committed to independence and would not intervene militarily to maintain control after the overthrow of Lee Kuan Yew's government. Formation On 20 July 1961, Lee Kuan Yew called an emergency meeting of the Legislative Assembly to vote on a motion of confidence in the Government. Twenty-six assemblymen voted for the government and twenty-four, including thirteen of PAP left-wingers, either abstained or voted against the motion of confidence. The thirteen PAP left-wingers who abstained from voting were then expelled from the PAP. The expelled members, including Lim Chin Siong, Sidney Woodhull and Fong Swee Suan, then proceeded to form an opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. After the split, 35 branch committees out of 51 and 19 of 23 paid organising secretaries of the PAP went over to the Barisan. The Barisan was officially inaugurated on 17 September 1962, with Lim Chin Siong as its secretary-general and Dr Lee Siew Choh as chairman. Its founding slogan was ‚Äògenuinely full internal self-government‚Äô through merger with Malaya and it shared the same aim with the PAP-‚Äòthe creation of an independent, democratic, non-communist, socialist Malaya‚Äô. The main objectives of the new party were presented in following four statements: # To eradicate colonialism and set up a united national independent state comprising the Federation of Malaya and Singapore # To establish a democratic Government of Malaya based on universal adult suffrage of all those who are born in or owe their allegiance to Malaya # To bring into being an economic system that will endure a prosperous, stable and just society # To mobilise all sections of the people for the building of a Malayan nation Merger issue While the Barisan supported the merger with Malaya, the party campaigned vigorously against the PAP government's merger terms with the Federation of Malaya. According to the merger terms agreed by the PAP government, Singapore would retain its autonomy in education and labour at the expense of the rights of Singapore citizens and seats in the new Federal Parliament. The Barisan demanded that Singapore citizens should automatically become Malayan citizens with proportional representation in the Federal Parliament. At the end, the PAP government advocated that a referendum should be held to test popular support for the merger. The Referendum Bill on the merger incorporated proposals and amendments from the Barisan, David Marshall, Ong Eng Guan and SPA-UMNO. Three offered options A, B, C respectively proposed by the PAP, David Marshall and the SPA-UMNO. However, the Barisan appealed to voters to cast blank votes on the referendum stating that no option correctly expressed Barisan's thoughts and the three options would \\"sell out Singapore\\". This move had been anticipated by the PAP government; a clause had been inserted within the Referendum Ordinance stating that voters who cast blank votes were unable to make a decision themselves and they must necessarily follow the majority. That is, the blank votes would be automatically counted together with whichever of the options that won the majority. The Referendum on Merger was held on 1 September 1962, and the results were: * Option (A): 397,626 votes (71%) * Option (B): 9,422 votes (1.7%) * Option (C): 7,911 votes (1.4%) * Blank votes: 144,077 votes (25%) Option A won the majority, with the Barisan defeated. Reasons for decline=Operation Coldstore Tunku Abdul Rahman was worried about the impact of Singapore's leftist influence in a unified Malaysia. He demanded that Singapore's political opposition be arrested as a condition of merger. The PAP was hesitant about the arrests as they could damage the PAP's popularity in Singapore. However, the Brunei Revolt of 8 December 1962 gave the PAP a 'heaven sent opportunity' to justify the arrests. The Barisan's open support of the Brunei revolt gave the PAP an excuse that the arrests were to prevent possible communist subversion and safeguard the security and safety in Singapore. On 2 February 1963, the ISC launched a crackdown against leftists and their supports. Under the action, code-named Operation Coldstore, 107 people including political, trade unionists and student leaders who had shown support for the Brunei Revolt were detained. Among those detainees, half of them were Barisan central leaders. Operation Coldstore was a fatal blow to the Barisan. Operation Coldstore almost paralysed the Barisan because of the detention of its major leaders including Lim Chin Siong. However, remaining Barisan leaders did not give up their struggle. On 22 April 1963, Lee Siew Choh and remaining Barisan activists launched the \\"City Hall Battle\\". They marched from the Barisan's headquarter in Victoria Street to the steps of City Hall to protest the mass arrests in February and presented a petition to the Prime Minister in protest against the 'ill treatment' of the detainees. The protest was put down and seven party leaders including Lee Siew Choh were arrested. 1963 general election defeat After Operation Coldstore and ensuing protests, major cadres of Barisan were detained or put on long trials. These events severely diminished the strength of the Barisan, which prevented the party from effectively taking part in the 1963 general elections, and the party was eventually defeated in the elections. The 1963 elections ended with a clear victory of PAP winning thirty-seven of the fifty-one seats. The Barisan won thirteen, and the remaining seat fell to Ong Eng Guan who contested under the banner of the United People's Party. After the elections, the Malaysian Government took a series of actions to further debilitate the Barisan. On Malaysia Day on 16 September 1963, the security authorities decided to launch two further crackdowns on the \\"left-wing\\" extremists. In those September and October operations, \\"some fifteen leaders of the Communist United Front\\" were rounded up. Some student activists from Nanyang University were soon arrested for alleged subversive activities. In late August 1963, seven trade unions under Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU) controlled by the Barisan, were served notices by the Government to show cause why they should not be deregistered. On 30 October, the seven unions which were supposed to close down were eventually struck off the register. In October, the government dissolved two of Barisan's most effective ancillary associations, The Singapore Rural Residents' Association and Singapore Country People's Association. Intra-party strifeNational Service= Soon after Malaysia was formed, alarmed by Indonesia's confrontation and rebel activities in the Borneo territories, the central parliament in Kuala Lumpur passed legislation which required all youth between the age of 18 and 25 to register for National Service. The left-wingers regarded this action as a government move \\"to counter the left-wing movement\\" However, within the left-wing camp, there were two different strategies to campaign against the National Service scheme supported by two schools led respectively by Chen Hock Wah, who was a member of the CPM and Lee Siew Choh, who was Chairman of Barisan. Chen Hock Wah proposed a two-step policy called \\"Principled Registration\\" or \\"Registration under Protest\\". The first step was not to stop persons affected being registered. The second step was to tell the persons affected not to present themselves for rollcall if they were actually mobilised for active service after registration. On the other hand, the camp led by Lee Siew Choh advocated a boycott of the law and proposed affected persons should not even register in the first place. A great quarrel broke out in Barisan and Chen's strategy obtained majority support. Finally, Lee Siew Choh, together with seven other founding members resigned from the party attributing his resignation to the difference between him and other leaders. The party was split wide open, though Lee was persuaded to resume his chairmanship of Barisan on 9 March 1965. =Singapore's separation from Malaysia= The Barisan had fought against the merger with Malaysia, however, upon the declaration of Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, leaders of Barisan declined to recognise the independence of Singapore. Lee Siew Choh, chairman of Barisan attacked the independence obtained by Singapore, stating that it was not genuine and released public slogans of \\"Crush Malaysia\\", \\"Phony Independence\\", and \\"Boycott Parliament\\". Reaction towards Singapore's independence within the left-wing camp was again divided. Lim Huan Boon, who was a member of the Communist Party of Malaya and one of Barisan's representatives in the Legislative Assembly recognised the independence of Singapore stating that there was no such thing as phony or half independence. Lim Chin Siong, another leader of Barisan who was in detention, also considered Singapore's independence to be genuine. Taking the view that there was neither true national independence nor parliamentary democracy, Barisan began to boycott Parliament and elections. In October 1966, the Barisan had all its remaining representatives in Parliament resign their seats and started what they called an extra-parliamentary struggle. An editorial in The Straits Times commented that the Barisan chose the wrong time to launch an extra- parliamentary struggle: ‚ÄúTo give up the constitutional arena, at a time when none other exists, is very much like giving up politics altogether‚Äù. The departure from the parliament arguably sealed the fate of Barisan. Final days By 1967, Barisan had been depleted and its declining fortunes was seen in the contraction of its membership. Within three years from 1963 to 1966, the number of its branches had shrunk to 33 from 36 with only 22 effective. In contrast, the PAP maintained its 51 branches throughout the three years. The Barisan boycotted the General Elections in 1968 and allowed the PAP to win all 51 seats in the Parliament. Barisan returned to contest the 1972 General Elections. However, it failed to win any seat in this and subsequent elections. It was clear that Barisan was no longer in a position to function effectively as a political party. In May 1988, the Barisan was dissolved into the Workers' Party of Singapore to strengthen the opposition and applied for dissolution. The application was denied approval as Barisan's constitution required all its branches to agree to the dissolution but none were left. Hence, it was left dormant since. Communist debate From the perspective of the PAP government, the Barisan was a communist-controlled organisation which Lee Kuan Yew labelled as a \\"main open front communist organization\\" The ISC stated that the Barisan activists were indeed communist-inspired and the Barisan was controlled by the Communists to sabotage the formation of Malaysia. Although admitting that they adopted Communist tactics for the anti- colonial cause because, at the time, such tactics would gather mass support, Lim Chin Siong refuted the Communist label attached to him and the Barisan. He claimed: \\"Let me make it clear, once and for all, that I am not a Communist, or a Communist front-man, or, for that matter, anybody‚Äôs front-man.\\" \\"I was an MBA League member, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I was a communist...MBA is far from MCP...Study the Manifesto of the PA; it was more anti-colonial and more communist in doctrine...Of course during that time, the largest surviving party in Malaya was MCP and PAP was relatively new, so it was inevitable the thinking was influenced by communism.\\" (Interview with Lim Chin Siong) It may have been possible that the Barisan was merely inspired by successful Communist movements elsewhere to end colonialism and to mobilise the masses, and there is uncertainty about whether the Barisan was Communist controlled or not. \\"It is not clear whether the Barisan is merely a front for the Communist Party and its executive in Singapore, the Town Committee, or whether it is a party which is willing to accept Communist support, though the ultimate objective did not call for the creation of a Communist political system nor the establishment of a beachhead for the Chinese People‚Äôs Republic.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Infopedia: Barisan Sosialis * HistorySG: Barisan Sosialis is formed Defunct socialist parties in Singapore Political parties established in 1961 1961 establishments in Singapore Political parties disestablished in 1988 1988 disestablishments in Singapore ","title":"Barisan Sosialis"},{"id":"1344054","text":" ","title":"Aolbonics"},{"id":"1344068","text":"Richard Howly (1740 ‚Äì December 1784), sometimes spelled Howley, was an American planter and lawyer from Liberty County, Georgia. He served briefly as the Governor of Georgia in 1780, as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1780 and 1781, and as Chief Justice of Georgia in 1782 and 1783. Early life Little is known about Howley's early life. In 1775 he married Sarah Fuller of Charleston, South Carolina, the widow of William Fuller and mother of two daughters. Subsequently, the couple had two daughters of their own, only one of whom reached adulthood. Revolutionary War When the Revolution began, Howley was practicing law in Sunbury, where he also owned a small plantation and a few slaves. He was not prominent in the early stages of the Revolution in Georgia. Savannah fell to the British on December 29, 1778, and Colonel Augustine Prevost began a siege of Sunbury. When Fort Morris surrendered in January 1779, Howley and his family fled to Augusta. The British occupied eastern Georgia, and fighting moved into the back country. Georgia Whigs, openly divided into radical and conservative factions since the infamous duel in May 1777 between patriot leader Button Gwinnett and Lachlan McIntosh, vied for political leadership as they tried to convene a new assembly in Augusta. After selecting an executive council to govern the sections of the state still under Whig control, this council, dominated by conservative Whigs, elected John Wereat president on August 6, 1779. Howley was associated with the radical Whig faction and a close ally of George Walton who, after the joint American and French siege of Savannah failed in October 1779, was sent to Augusta to hold new elections. Backed by Howley, George Wells, and their back country supporters, Walton organized a rival assembly in November 1779. This body elected Walton governor and Walton, Howley, and three others delegates to the Continental Congress, in effect ousting Wereat from power. Within two months, Walton departed for Philadelphia. The assembly elected Howley governor on January 4, 1780 and empowered him to act on behalf of the government even if forced into exile. During these uncertain times he called on Georgians to be steadfast in their support of independence. As British raids increased, the council directed Howley to flee to the Carolinas. Howley and several council members transported the state archives and some paper money to New Bern, North Carolina. On July 1, 1780 he was among those listed under the British Disqualifying Act. Political life Howley took his seat in Congress in July 1780. He assisted in obtaining a new loan from France. His primary interest, however, was to guard against peace proposals that would allow Britain to retain control of Georgia. With Walton and William Few, he published Observations upon the Effects of Certain Late Political Suggestions by the Delegates of Georgia. Howley lost his re-election bid to Congress and returned to Georgia. He was elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1782. He was able to acquire confiscated Tory property being sold in Chatham and Liberty counties. Aedanus Burke turned down an offer to become chief justice of Georgia, and in October 1782 Howley was appointed pro tempore chief justice. He represented Liberty County in the general assembly during 1783 and 1784, after which he moved his residence to Savannah. Death A devout Roman Catholic, Howley journeyed to St. Augustine in December 1784 to receive sacraments of penance and holy communion that were not available in Georgia. While there, he wrote to Bishop Echevarrio of Cuba requesting that priests from Florida be sent to administer sacraments to Catholics in Georgia. Apparently ill when he returned from Florida, Howley died at his residence in Savannah.

Formed in 1880 and based in Hammersmith, it initially operated largely as a road surfacing contractor. The business was acquired by Godfrey Mitchell in 1919, and he developed it into a construction and housebuilding firm. In July 2007, Wimpey merged with Taylor Woodrow to create Taylor Wimpey. Wimpey was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1934. History=Early years The business was founded by George Wimpey and Walter Tomes (the latter sold out in 1893) as a stone working partnership in 1880 in Hammersmith.White, p. 2 The company built the first Hammersmith Town Hall in 1896, and went on to lay the foundations for the first \\"electric tramway\\" in London in the late 1890s. The company also built the White City Stadium complex which included a series of pavilions and gardens for the Franco British Exhibition of 1908 as well as an 80,000-seat Olympic stadium for the 1908 Olympic Games. The Mitchell Era The former headquarters of George Wimpey in Hammersmith Grove, London George Wimpey died in 1913 at the age of 58. His family put the business up for sale in 1919. Godfrey Way Mitchell bought the firm and decided to retain the Wimpey name.White, p. 8 Sir Godfrey Mitchell remained George Wimpey's executive chairman until 1973. Mitchell built up a fleet of steam rollers and took contracts for public and private paving jobs. Much of the work was for new housing estates and Mitchell observed that the company could make more money as a developer than just as a contractor; having tested this first with his own money, he initiated the company's first residential development, the Greenford Park Estate, in 1928.White, p. 10 By 1930, Wimpey was building around five hundred houses a year, rising to a peak of 1,370 in 1934. However, private housebuilding ceased on the outbreak of war in 1939 and Wimpey concentrated on defence work. It built 93 aerodromes, factories and army camps, and finished the war as one of the country's largest contractors.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. . In the immediate post war period, building controls prevented any substantial return to private housebuilding and Wimpey turned instead to the local authority market and by the early 1950s Wimpey was building 18,000 local authority houses a year. Wimpey was pre-eminent in the use of no-fines concrete construction (concrete made without sand) in high and low rise housing. It was also expanding its building and civil engineering divisions, particularly overseas where it became one of the larger international contractors. The end of building controls in 1954 allowed Wimpey to re-enter the private housing market. It did so in a substantial way through its regional structure, becoming the country's first national housebuilder; by 1972 Wimpey was building private houses at an annual rate of 12,500, some three times the rate of its nearest competitor. Although Wimpey experienced rising profits in the 1970s, thanks to its Middle East contracting, the group was beginning to lose direction. Godfrey Mitchell may have retired as Chairman in 1973 but he remained a director and a dominant figure until his eventual retirement from the Board in 1981, following his 90th birthday. Operational control was diffused between four joint managing directors, and the regions rather than the centre were the dominant force. Unlike some of the newer housebuilders, Wimpey's housing was mixed in operationally with its construction business. Volumes declined and, by the end of the 1980s, private housing sales were down to around 5,000 houses a year. Acquisitions and Merger Despite attempts to change, private housing remained contractor dominated, but in November 1995, the Board announced a radical solution: Wimpey was to transfer its construction and minerals divisions to Tarmac in return for the latter's housing division (largely McLean Homes). Wimpey was once again selling 12,000 private houses a year.Merger document February 1996 Two more major housing acquisitions followed, both divisions of contractors seeking to focus on their core contracting business. In August 2001, McAlpine Homes was acquired from Alfred McAlpine, bringing with it a 4,000 houses a year business; the following year Wimpey bought the 1,200 houses a year Laing Homes from John Laing. In March 2007, the company announced plans for a ¬£6 billion nil premium merger with Taylor Woodrow, to be called Taylor Wimpey. The merger was effected by means of a scheme of arrangement, leaving the original Taylor Woodrow shareholders with 51% of the new Taylor Wimpey. Taylor Woodrow provided the new chairman and finance director, while the chief executive and the managing director came from Wimpey.Merger documentation March 2007 Tudor Trust When Mitchell took George Wimpey public in 1934, he set up a unique ownership scheme wherein the charitable Tudor Trust held about half of the firm's shares. The Tudor Trust later diluted its stake to 5% (as a result of a rights issue) from 34%, which was in itself steadily reduced over the years. Just before the Taylor Wimpey merger on 2 July 2007, the Tudor Trust no longer held a reportable interest in its own name in George Wimpey, such interest being below the declarable 3% threshold.Tudor Trust: Annual Report and Accounts 2007/08 Operations=United Kingdom housebuilding George Wimpey homes in the United Kingdom were sold under three distinct brands: the core 'George Wimpey' brand, the 'Laing Homes' brand, which had previously been used solely in the South East and Midlands, and the affordable 'G2' brand launched in 2006. In the 1970s, George Wimpey became the United Kingdom's largest private house builder, selling 106,440 homes in the decade, and in the 1980s, George Wimpey began to reinforce Wimpey Homes as a brand, focusing on quality compact housing. Advertising, featuring the famous Wimpey cat, ensured Wimpey Homes became a household name in house building. By 2002, there were four brands: Wimpey Homes, McLean Homes, McAlpine Homes and Laing Homes. Under the leadership of the current chief executive, Peter Redfern, (who was then head of housing), the operations were merged, and ‚ÄòWimpey Homes‚Äô, ‚ÄòMcLean Homes‚Äô and ‚ÄòMcAlpine Homes‚Äô were replaced with ‚ÄòGeorge Wimpey‚Äô under a new three-dimensional purple and orange squares corporate identity. Laing Homes was retained due to its more upmarket status and its greater brand recognition. This brand disappeared in June 2008, as a result of the merger with Taylor Woodrow. In 2006, George Wimpey launched an affordable 'G2' brand, focussing on one and two bedroom luxury apartments. Its prime target markets were value-conscious first time buyers and key workers. Sponsorship George Wimpey was the Main Sponsor of St Johnstone F.C. until 2008/09, when George Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow merged.

Wimpey Minerals Wimpey Minerals was one of the largest aggregate, coated stone and construction material producers, with significant operations in the United Kingdom and United States, and smaller operations overseas. North American operations George Wimpey also had operations in the United States trading under Morrison Homes, which was acquired in 1984 when it was based in San Francisco, Northern California. George Wimpey later added to its US operations with the acquisition of Richardson Homes of Denver, Colorado in 2001. Morrison Homes was initially founded in Seattle in 1905 by C.G. Morrison and moved to northern California in 1946. Operations were extended to cover Phoenix, Central Valley, Sacramento, Denver, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa, Reno, Austin, Dallas Fort Worth and Houston.

It is located in a sheltered spot overlooking a silted up estuary opposite Par and near the beach of Par Sands. It is on the Saints' Way path. Tywardreath was featured by Daphne du Maurier in her novel The House on the Strand. Although this was a fictional tale of drug-induced time-travel, the history and geography of the area was carefully researched by du Maurier, who lived in a house called Kilmarth (, meaning horses' ridge), to the south. The seal of the borough of Tywardreath was a Shield of Arms, a saltire between four fleurs-de-lis, with the legend \\"Tywardreath\\". The arms are derived from those of the priory: the saltire for St Andrew, the patron of the priory and parish church; the fleur-de-lis for the French mother house at Angers. Tywardreath was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) when it was one of 28 manors held by Richard from Robert, Count of Mortain. There were 2 hides of land and land for 12 ploughs. One virgate of land was held by Richard with 4 ploughs and 7 serfs; 8 villeins and 18 smallholders had the rest of the land with 3 ploughs. There were 6 acres of woodland and 100 acres of pasture. The manor was valued at ¬£2 though it had formerly been worth ¬£4.Thorn, C. et al. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 5,3,8 Although the civil parish is shown under Tywardreath and Par there is an electoral ward (which also includes Par) shown under the name of Tywardreath only. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,897. Tywardreath Priory The settlement grew out of a Benedictine priory established at around the time of the Norman conquest. Founded from the Abbey of SS. Sergius and Bacchus, Angers in France, it was founded to contain only about seven monks, the endowment being sufficient for that number. The house was poor but powerful in the area, controlling the port of Fowey and having lands scattered over Cornwall. Being regarded as an \\"alien monastery\\" subject to a French mother house, the Crown frequently took it into its \\"protection\\", taking all its temporal income for itself, as the alien houses' loyalty to the English crown was suspect, and they were sending profits from their English lands to \\"enemies\\" abroad. The Crown's action transferred the money from the coffers of a French abbot to those of an English king. The result was a poor, demoralised monastery, devoid of its monks, who were expelled in the early 1400s. A slow revival from about 1406 brought English monks into the house, and it regained its prestige and much of the property it had lost, having become \\"denizen\\", i.e. naturalised as English. However, by 1535 and the Valor Ecclesisticus the priory was valued at less than ¬£200 annually, and like many others it was suppressed by the Crown in 1536. Nothing survives of the monastery today, except some carved stones in the parish church, next to where the priory stood. Attempts are being made to explore the site using modern archaeological methods. A modern story (Methuen's 'Little Guide - Cornwall, July 2016) implausibly explains the lack of remains of the priory by saying the last prior shipped the stone back to France. Corrody in Tywardreath Priory A corrody was an annual charge on the priory's income, originally a voucher issued by the priory to pay board and lodging of founders whilst visiting, and later monetised and used by kings as transferable pensions. In 1486 Henry VII recommended his servant William Martyn for a corrody of 5 marks (¬£3 6s. 8d.) a year charged on the manors of Tywardreath and Trenant. A corrody, no doubt the same one, was held in this Priory in 1509 by Hugh Denys of Osterley (died 1511), Groom of the King's Close Stool to Henry VII.Cornwall Archives 146 ART/3/146 On the death of Denys, Henry VIII transferred the corrody (\\"in the King's gift by death of Hugh Denys\\") to John Porth, another courtier.Letters & Papers, Foreign & Domestic of Henry VIII, vol 1, 1920. St. Andrew's Church St Andrew's Church was first dedicated in 1343 but was extensively rebuilt, at a cost of ¬£3,000, reopening on 8 September 1880. With the exception of the tower and arcade the church was rebuilt by the architect Richard Coad of Liskeard. The new organ was supplied by Hele & Co, of Plymouth. The tower houses a peal of six bells. Memorials include those to the Harris family, active in the English Civil War. Philip Rashleigh, of Menabilly, the famous mineralogist and MP for Fowey, is buried here. In 1880 following the rebuild, the bench ends of the Rashleigh aisle recorded the history of the family from Jonathan Rashleigh of 1338, and the many Cornish and Devon families they have married into. Historic estates There is a Cornish cross outside the northwest angle of Tregaminion chapel. Another cross is also in the chapel grounds; this was found in 1889 in use as a footbridge in Lostwithiel.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 83 & 273-74 Andrew Langdon (1994) records five crosses in the parish of Tywardreath. These are two at Tregaminion, two at Menabilly and Trenython Cross. The crosses at Menabilly are Methrose Cross and Barrs Cross. The former was originally in the parish of Luxulyan and the latter on the boundary of the parishes of St Sampson and Lanlivery. Trenython Cross was found in 1898 by John Gott, Bishop of Truro; it was re-erected in the grounds in 1987.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 68-71 Menabilly Tregaminion ChapelThis Chapel was consecrated in 1816 and was commissioned by William Rashleigh as a private chapel and dedicated to his wife Rachel who died while it was being built. William Rashleigh however remarried in 1817. It is now part of the Tywardreath Vicarage and regular Sunday services are held here. One of the crosses at Tregaminion Chapel Within the parish is the historic estate of Menabilly, long the seat of the Rashleigh family, in 1873 the largest landowners in Cornwall.Per the Return of Owners of Land, 1873 At Tregaminion was a private chapel belonging to the Rashleighs of Menabilly. Trenython Outside the village on the road up to Castle Dore is Trenython Manor (, meaning the gorse farm). It was originally built for Colonel Peard in thanks from Garibaldi for support during his Italian struggle. For 15 years from 1891 it was the bishop's palace for the Diocese of Truro. For half of the 20th century it was a railway convalescent home. A local paper at the time reported: \\"Trenython, the seventh Railwaymen's convalescent home, was opened by Viscount Churchill, chairman of the GWR. It has accommodation for 85 men ‚Äì the cost of refurbishment about ¬£25,000 ‚Äì and the architect was Mr B. Andrew of St Austell. The two Egyptian Pillars standing sentinel inside the front door had originated from the Temple of Ephesus and are thousands of years old. Trenython is to be a self-contained institution with its own water supply, own electric system and own sewerage system.\\" Today Trenython Manor is a country house hotel.

Elections in China are based on a hierarchical electoral system, whereby local People's Congresses are directly elected, and all higher levels of People's Congresses up to the National People's Congress (NPC), the national legislature, are indirectly elected by the People's Congress of the level immediately below.Article 97 of the Constitution of China The NPC Standing Committee may partially alter laws passed by the NPC when the NPC is not in session, which is significant since the Standing Committee meets more frequently than the NPC. Governors, mayors, and heads of counties, districts, townships and towns are in turn elected by the respective local People's Congresses.Article 101 of the Constitution of China Presidents of people's courts and chief procurators of people's procuratorates are elected by the respective local People's Congresses above the county level. The President and the State Council are elected by the National People's Congress, which is made of 2980 people. Electoral system=Direct elections People's Congresses of cities that are not divided into districts (), counties (), city districts (), towns (), townships (), and lastly ethnic townships (), are directly elected. Additionally, village () committee members and chairpersons are directly elected.Article 111 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China Local People's Congresses have the constitutional authority to recall the heads and deputy heads of government at the provincial level and below. =Local People's Congresses= A list of voters posted in a neighbourhood in Shenzhen, Guangdong. April 11, 2014. Under the electoral law of , nomination of candidates for direct elections (in counties, townships, etc.) can be made by the Communist Party of China, the various other political parties, mass organizations, or any voter seconded by at least 3 others. The final list of electoral candidates must be worked out through \\"discussion and consultation\\" or primary elections, which in practice is done via the election committee in consultation with small groups of voters, through a process known as the \\"three ups and three downs\\" (, ). According to the Chinese government, the \\"three ups and three downs\\" process is supposed to operate as follows: * the election committee collates all of the nominations, checks them, and publishes the list of nominees and their basic details (first \\"up\\"). The published list is given to groups of electors, comprising the voters in each geographical or institutional electorate for discussion (first \\"down\\"); * the views of the groups of electors are conveyed via group representatives at a committee meeting, in order to reduce the number of candidates (second \\"up\\"). The views of different elector groups and the discussions at the committee meeting are then conveyed to voters, and their views are sought (second \\"down\\"); and * the views of the groups of electors are once again collated and reported to the election committee which, by reference to the views of the majority of electors, determine the final list of candidates (third \\"up\\"). The list of names and basic details is published by electorate (third \\"down\\").\\"‰∏â‰∏ä‰∏â‰∏ã\\"ÂçèÂïÜÁ°ÆÂÆöÂéø‰π°‰∏§Á∫ß‰∫∫Â§ß‰ª£Ë°®Ê≠£ÂºèÂÄôÈÄâ‰∫∫ÁöÑÂÖ∑‰ΩìÂÅöÊ≥ïÊòØ‰ªÄ‰πàÔºü (What is the specific procedure for the \\"three ups and three downs\\" method for determining through consultation the official candidates for People's Congress Representatives at the county and prefecture level?), Hebei People's Congress, 6 December 2011 The number of candidates for an election should be 50% to 100% larger than the number of seats, voting is to be done by secret ballot, and voters are entitled to recall elections. Eligible voters, and their electoral districts, are chosen from the family () or work unit ( or ) registers for rural and urban voters, respectively, which are then submitted to the election committees after cross-examination by electoral district leaders. Electoral districts at the basic level (townships, towns, etc.) are composed of 200‚Äì300 voters but sometimes up to 1000, while larger levels (counties, etc.) are composed of 3000 to 4000 voters =Local People's Governments= Heads of People's Governments are formally elected by the People's Congress of that level pursuant to the Organic Law on Local People's Congresses and Governments, but the heads of township governments have been experimentally elected by the people through various mechanisms. There are several models used: At pp. 77‚Äì87. * direct nomination and election () * direction election () * two ballots in three rounds () * competition based on mass recommendation () * nomination and election by the masses ( or ; literally \\"sea election\\") * public recommendation and public election () * vote of confidence () =Village chiefs= Since taking power in 1978, Deng Xiaoping experimented with direct democracy at the local level. Villages have been traditionally the lowest level of government in China's complicated hierarchy of governance. Many have criticized the locally elected representatives as serving as \\"rubber stamps\\", though during some eras the Communists have flirted with the idea of potentially allowing some competition. In the early 1980s, a few southern villages began implementing \\"Vote for your Chief\\" policies, in which free elections are intended to be held for the election of a village chief, who holds a lot of power and influence traditionally in rural society. Many of these multi-candidate elections were successful, involving candidate debates, formal platforms, and the initiation of secret ballot boxes. The suffrage was not universal, with eligible citizens above age 18 having the right to vote and be elected. Such an election comprises usually over no more than 2000 voters, and the first-past-the-post system is used in determining the winner, with no restriction on political affiliation. The elections, held every three years, are always supervised by a higher level of government, usually by a County Government. Part of the reason for these early elections was to shift the responsibility of ensuring good performance and reduced corruption of local leaders from the Chinese bureaucracy to the local villagers. Under the Organic Law of Village Committees, all of China's approximately 1 million villages are expected to hold competitive, direct elections for sub- governmental village committees. A 1998 revision to the law called for improvements in the nominating process and enhanced transparency in village committee administration. The revised law also explicitly transferred the power to nominate candidates to villagers themselves, as opposed to village groups or Chinese Communist Party (CCP) branches. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, as of 2003 the majority of provinces had carried out at least four or five rounds of village elections. All Local People's Congresses of China are conducting elections of local government leaders. Indirect elections People's Congresses of provinces (), directly controlled municipalities (), and cities divided into districts () are indirectly elected by the People's Congress of the level immediately below. =Local People's Governments= The Local People's Congress at each administrative level‚Äîother than the village level in rural areas, which hold direct elections‚Äîelects candidates for executive positions at that level of government. =National People's Congress= The National People's Congress (NPC) has 2987 members, elected for five year terms. Deputies are elected (over a three-month period) by the people's congresses of the provinces of China, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and the armed forces. The size of each college of delegates is related to the number of electors in the constituency. 36 deputies are elected in Hong Kong. =National People's Government= The President and Vice President of China, the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the NPC, the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the President and Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court are all elected by the NPC on the nomination of the Presidium of the NPC. The Premier is elected by the NPC on the nomination of the President. Other members of the State Council are elected by the NPC on the nomination of the Premier. Other members of the Central Military Commission are elected by the NPC on the nomination of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. In the 2008 election for the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, for example, president Hu Jintao, the only candidate, received a majority of approval votes. However, some electors chose to write in other names; the most popular write-in candidate was former premier Zhu Rongji. For appointed positions requiring the approval of the People's Congress, such as the premier and cabinet ministers, delegates may either approve or disapprove of the appointment. Relevant laws provide that if the single candidate does not receive more than 50% approval, the position is left vacant until the next session of the People's Congress. This rarely happens in practice, and has never happened at the national level. Party system Officially, China is a multi-party socialist state under the leadership of the CCP. There are a small number of independent candidates for people's congress, particularly in neighborhoods of major cities, who sometimes campaign using weibos posted on the internet. Although there is no legal requirement for either membership in or approval by the Communist Party, in practice the membership of the higher people's congresses and people's governments are largely determined by the Party. Independent candidates are strongly discouraged and face government intervention in their campaigns. In practice, the power of parties other than the Communist Party of China is eliminated. Because none of the minor parties have independent bases of support and rely on Communist Party approval for appointment to positions of power, none have the capacity to serve as a true opposition party. Whereas there are Communist Party Committees in People's Congresses at all levels, none of the other parties operate any form of party parliamentary groups. In order to represent different segments of the population and bring in technical expertise, the CCP does ensure that a significant minority of people's congress delegates are either minor party members or unaffiliated, and there is tolerance of disagreement and debate in the legislative process where this does not fundamentally challenge the role of the Communist Party. Communist Party regulations require members of the People's Congresses, People's Governments, and People's Courts to implement CCP recommendations (including nominations) pursuant to the CCP Regulations on the Selection and Appointment Work of Cadres of Both CCP and Government Organs.. \\"Regulations on the Selection and Appointment Work of Cadres of Both CPC and Government Organs\\". > \\"These regulations apply to the selection and appointment of cadres to the > working departments and/or internal institutes of the Central Committee of > the CCP, the NPCSC, the State Council, the National People's Consultative > Committee, the Central Disciplinary Committee of the CCP, officials (not > including the heads) of the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's > Procuratorate and their internal institutions, officials of local CCP > organs, people's congresses, people's governments, political consultative > committees, people's courts, people's procuratorates at and above county > level, and their internal institutions, as well as officials of the internal > institutions of the working organs mentioned above.

Furthermore, while legally responsible for the oversight of the administration, it is difficult for a person in a people's congress without party support to exercise effective control or power over the administration of the executive at a given level. Electoral history No parties other than the Communist Party and the eight allied parties were allowed at the elections, which took place from October 2012 to March 2013. The same nine parties are represented at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Legislation The first electoral law was passed in , and the second on . The 1979 law allowed for ordinary voters to nominate candidates, unlike the 1953 law which provided no such mechanism. The 1979 law was revised in , removing the reference to the ability of political parties, mass organizations, and voters to use \\"various forms of publicity\\", and instead instructing that the \\"election committees should introduce the candidates to the voters; the political parties, mass organizations, and voters who recommend the candidates can introduce them at group meetings of the voters\\". In , the election law was amended to disallow primary elections. Traditionally, village chiefs were appointed by the township government. The Organic Law of Village Committees was enacted in 1987 and implemented in 1988, allowing for direct election of village chiefs instead.

The site has three General Electric boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear generating units and is owned entirely by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). With a generating capacity of nearly 3.8 gigawatts, it is the second most powerful nuclear plant in the United States, behind the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona, and the most powerful generating station operated by TVA. History The nuclear power plant is named after a ferry that operated at the site until the middle of the 20th century. Browns Ferry was TVA's first nuclear power plant; its approval occurred on June 17, 1966 and construction began in September 1966. In 1974, the time of its initial operation, it was the largest nuclear plant in the world. It was the first nuclear plant in the world to generate more than 1 gigawatt of power. The lake provides main cooling, and 7 small fan towers assist during limitations on water temperature. The 600 ft concrete chimney vents gases. In 2006, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) renewed the licenses for all three reactors, extending their operation for an additional twenty years past their original 40-year licensing period. TVA employs 1500 people at the plant, making it the largest employer in Limestone County, Alabama . The planned Toyota-Mazda factory will employ 4000 when completed.  Power Uprates  On August 16, 2017, the NRC approved TVA's request for a 14.3% uprate of each reactor's output. Each unit's gross electrical output was 1,155 MWe (1,101 MWe net), but after power uprates during refueling outages in Fall 2018 for Unit 1, Spring 2019 for Unit 2, and Spring 2018 for Unit 3, the gross electrical output for each unit was increased to 1,310 MWe (1,256 MWe net). The uprate for Unit 3 was completed in July 2018, and in January 2019 for Unit 1. The final uprate, for Unit 2, was completed in August 2019, completing the $475 million project. The electrical power increase of each unit was facilitated by the maximum operating thermal output of each reactor being increased from 3,458 MWth to 3,952 MWth.  Unit 1  Unit 1 is a 1,256 MWe net BWR/4 built by General Electric. Construction started on Unit 1 on September 12, 1966 and originally came online on December 20, 1973. Commercial operation began on August 1, 1974. It was licensed to operate through December 20, 2013. However, Unit 1 was shut down for a year after a fire in 1975 damaged the unit. The unit was subsequently repaired and operated from 1976 through March 3, 1985, when all three Browns Ferry units were shut down for operational and management issues. Starting in 2002, TVA undertook an effort to restore Unit 1 to operational status, spending $1.8 billion USD to do so. The NRC approved the restart of Unit 1 on May 15, 2007 and the reactor was brought up to criticality on May 22. During initial testing after restart, on May 24, 2007, a leaky hydraulic control pipe in the turbine hall burst, spilling about of non-radioactive fluid, and the newly restarted reactor was temporarily powered down. Reactor power-up and tests resumed on May 27 and the unit started supplying power to the electricity supply grid on June 2, 2007, reaching full power on June 8. The Browns Ferry restart was estimated to pay for itself in five years. On May 4, 2006, NRC issued a renewed license, adding twenty years to operate through December 20, 2033. Unit 1 generated 9,801 GWh of electricity in 2017, achieving a capacity factor of 101.62%.  Unit 1 fire  Polyurethane foam used to fill a cable tray penetration at a power plant in Nova Scotia (subsequently removed and replaced with firestop mortar). On March 22, 1975 a fire started when a worker using a candle to search for air leaks accidentally set a temporary cable seal on fire. At Browns Ferry, foamed plastic, covered on both sides with two coats of a flame retardant paint, was used as a firestop. The fire spread from the temporary seal into the foamed plastic, causing significant damage to the reactor control cabling in the station. An NRC bulletin explained the circumstances of the fire. > The fire started in the cable spreading room at a cable penetration through > the wall between the cable spreading room and the reactor building for Unit > 1. A slight differential pressure is maintained (by design) across this > wall, with the higher pressure being on the cable spreading room side. The > penetration seal originally present had been breached to install additional > cables required by a design modification. Site personnel were resealing the > penetration after cable installation and were checking the airflow through a > temporary seal with a candle flame prior to installing the permanent sealing > material. The temporary sealing material was highly combustible, and caught > fire. Efforts were made by the workers to extinguish the fire at its origin, > but they apparently did not recognize that the fire, under the influence of > the draft through the penetration, was spreading on the reactor building > side of the wall. The extent of the fire in the cable spreading room was > limited to a few feet from the penetration; however, the presence of the > fire on the other side of the wall from the point of ignition was not > recognized until significant damage to cables related to the control of > Units 1 and 2 had occurred. This later resulted in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission making significant additions to the standards for fire protection through the publication of 10CFR50.48 and Appendix R. According to the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, the newly restarted Unit 1 does not comply with these standards. Unit 3 was not affected by the accident. This event was pivotal not just for firestopping in the nuclear field, but also in commercial and industrial construction. While the nuclear field went to installations of silicone foam, a wider array of firestops became prevalent in non-nuclear construction.  Unit 2  Unit 2 is a 1,259 MWe net BWR/4 built by General Electric which originally came online on August 2, 1974, and is licensed to operate through June 28, 2034. Unit 2 generated 8,396 GWh of electricity in 2017, achieving a capacity factor of 86.81%. Unit 2 returned to service in 1991, after all three reactors were shut down in 1985. During a drought in August 2007, Unit 2 was shut down for one day because water temperature in the Tennessee River rose too high for the water to be used for cooling and then discharged back into the river.Mitch Weiss, Drought Could Force Nuclear Plants to Shut Down, Associated Press, January 23, 2008, retrieved from WRAL-TV website, April 7, 2009 Beginning in 2005 Unit 2 was loaded with BLEU (Blended Low Enriched Uranium) recovered by the DOE from weapons programs. This fuel contains quantities of U-236 and other contaminants because it was made from reprocessed fuel from weapons program reactors and therefore has slightly different characteristics when used in a reactor as compared to fresh uranium fuel. By making use of this fuel which would otherwise have been disposed of as waste the TVA is saving millions of dollars in fuel costs and accumulating a database of recycled uranium reactions in LWR use.TVA press release  Unit 3  Unit 3 is a 1,260 MWe net BWR/4 built by General Electric which originally came online on August 18, 1976 with a capacity of 1,105 MWe net, and is licensed to operate through July 2, 2036. Unit 3 returned to service in 1995 after all three units were shut down in 1985 for maintenance and repairs. Unit 3 generated 9,651 GWh in 2017, achieving a capacity factor of 99.70%. The power update of 155 MWe was completed in July 2018. Additional incidents=March 19, 1985 TVA decided to shut the entire plant down and keep it shut down indefinitely in order to focus on making improvements to all three units in order to bring it back into regulatory compliance following extremely negative assessments from the NRC. Unit 2 finally resumed operation on May 24, 1991, with Unit 3 following it on November 1, 1995, although Unit 1 did not resume operation until June 2, 2007. May 10, 1986 Cooling tower #4 (which was wide, long, and four stories tall) was destroyed in a fire caused by sparks from the electrical cooling fans in the tower hitting the abnormally dry redwood slats within the tower on May 10, 1986. During normal operation, water was kept flowing near-continuously over the redwood slats within the tower, but after close to two months of inactivity, the slats were very dry and extremely flammable. $5 million of damage was done. May 23, 1996 Cooling tower #3 (which was in the process of being refurbished at the time) was heavily damaged in a fire on May 23, 1996, with about 80% of the tower destroyed. April 27, 2011 Crumpled towers At 5:01 PM on April 27, 2011, all three reactors scrammed due to loss of external power caused by a tornado in the vicinity of the plant. Control rod insertion and cooling procedures operated as designed with no physical damage or release of radiation. Diesel backup generators provided power after a brief period of outage. An NRC Unusual Event, the lowest level of emergency classification, was declared due to loss of power exceeding 15 minutes. Additionally, a small oil leak was found on one generator. Due to widespread transmission grid damage from the storms, Browns Ferry was unable to produce power for the grid and significant blackouts occurred throughout the Southeastern United States.NRC: Event Notification Report for April 28, 2011TVA: Power Restoration Updates  January 2015  A drain line leaked 100-200 gallons of water containing tritium levels above acceptable EPA drinking water standards. The leak was fixed within three hours of when it was discovered and was largely contained within the plant area.  May 2015  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that 5 contract workers failed to conduct roving fire watch patrols as required by NRC. As a result, Tennessee Valley Authority was fined $140,000 for failing to maintain adequate fire watches in 2015 at Browns Ferry.  Surrounding population  The 2010 U.S. population within of Browns Ferry was 39,930, an increase of 12.3 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 977,942, an increase of 11.0 percent since 2000.

In 1908, Garvin agreed to take over the editorship of the Sunday newspaper The Observer, revolutionising Sunday journalism and restoring the paper, which was facing financial troubles at the time, to profitability in the process. Youth and early years in journalism The youngest of two children, Garvin was born in Birkenhead. His father, Michael Garvin, was an impoverished Irish labourer who died at sea when Garvin was two, leaving him to be raised by his mother Catherine. Though a voracious reader, he left school at the age of thirteen and worked first as a messenger, then as a clerk. His elder brother, Michael, became a teacher; his status as the family's primary source of income led them to move, first in 1884 to Hull, then to Newcastle five years later. Despite undergoing examination to join the civil service, from an early age Garvin yearned to become an editor. As a teenager he contributed letters and articles to the Eastern Morning News and the Dublin Weekly Freeman, much of which reflected his early advocacy for Home Rule. In 1891, Garvin applied to Joseph Cowen for a position at the Newcastle Evening Chronicle. Given a position as a proof-reader and occasional contributor, Garvin spent the next eight years honing his skills as a journalist, with Cowen serving as his mentor and father-figure. Yet Garvin yearned for a larger stage, and by the end of the decade he became a regular (though anonymous) contributor to the Fortnightly Review, then edited by W. L. Courtney. Garvin's ambition extended beyond Newcastle, however. Through his association with Courtney, Garvin gained a position as a leader-writer for the Daily Telegraph in 1899. Moving to London, his writings on politics and literature soon earned him renown. By now his politics had changed, as he became a unionist and a follower of Joseph Chamberlain. In 1904, Garvin accepted the editorship of The Outlook, a weekly publication which was being turned into a platform for the promotion of Chamberlain's scheme of tariff reform. Though The Outlook quickly saw a rise in circulation and influence, its failure to turn a profit led to the paper's sale and Garvin's exit two years later. Pre-war editorship of The Observer Vanity Fair, 1911 Soon after his departure from The Outlook, Garvin was approached by newspaper magnate Lord Northcliffe. Though he turned down a financially lucrative offer to write for Northcliffe's flagship publication, the Daily Mail, in 1908 Garvin agreed to take over the editorship of the historic Sunday newspaper The Observer. First published in 1791, the paper had recently faced financial troubles that led to its acquisition by Northcliffe. Within eighteen months, Garvin had reshaped The Observer, revolutionising Sunday journalism and restoring the paper to profitability in the process. With the Unionist Party still recovering from its massive defeat in the general election of 1906, Garvin soon emerged as a dominant figure in Unionist politics. Using The Observer as a platform, he denounced the budget introduced by Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George in 1909, and he encouraged the Unionist- dominated House of Lords to veto it. As the question of Home Rule for Ireland increasingly overshadowed British politics, Garvin advocated a federalist solution to the problem. By 1911, a rift had emerged between Garvin and Northcliffe over the critical issue of tariff reform. When their dispute became public, the press baron agreed to sell the paper to William Waldorf Astor, who accepted Garvin's proposal to assume ownership on condition that Garvin edit the Astor-owned Pall Mall Gazette as well. In 1915, Astor gave the two papers to his son, Waldorf as a birthday gift; Waldorf Astor then sold the Pall Mall Gazette, which allowed Garvin to leave his position with that paper and focus on editing The Observer. First World War Despite being an admirer of German culture, Garvin was alarmed by the growing challenge the country posed to Britain in international politics. Through his friendship with First Sea Lord Admiral John Fisher, he gained access to inside information on naval matters which he used to inform editorials calling for a greater naval construction program. When war broke out in 1914, Garvin embraced Britain's involvement in the conflict. He was close to many people in power, most notably Fisher (who left retirement to return to his former position as First Sea Lord soon after the start of the conflict), Lloyd George, and Winston Churchill, and he enjoyed considerable influence during this period. Yet the conflict brought great personal tragedy to Garvin. At the start of the war his only son Roland Gerard Garvin (known to his family as \\"Ged\\") enlisted with the South Lancashire Regiment and was shipped to France. Though subsequently assigned a staff position, Ged transferred back to a combat posting soon after the start of the Somme campaign and was killed in a night assault on German line in late July. Heartbroken at the loss, Garvin never recovered from Ged's death, and it shaped many of his attitudes to subsequent events. Despite his bitterness towards the Germans, Garvin believed in the need for a just settlement of the war. Soon after the armistice he published his first book, The Economic Foundations of Peace, in which he called for a lenient treaty and Anglo-American co-operation as the cornerstone for an effective League of Nations. When the punitive terms of the Treaty of Versailles were published, he denounced it in an editorial as leaving the Germans \\"no real hope except in revenge.\\"Observer text timeline  Newsroom  guardian.co.uk at www.guardian.co.uk Later years In 1921, Garvin moved from London to Beaconsfield. From there, in a home once owned by Edmund Burke's agent he continued to edit The Observer, and he began work on a biography of his hero Joseph Chamberlain. Though three volumes of the Chamberlain biography were published in the early 1930s, Garvin never wrote the final fourth volume, and the project was completed after his death by Julian Amery. During this period Garvin also served as editor-in-chief of the fourteenth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1926‚Äì1932). Yet Garvin's stature as a man of letters masked his declining influence during this period. Working from Beaconsfield cut him off from much of the political life of the British capital. A new generation of British politicians emerged with whom Garvin had few connections. Alarmed by Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, he pushed for a program of rearmament. He also became an advocate of appeasement, both of Hitler to buy time for rearmament, and Benito Mussolini in an effort to win the Italian leader's support for an alliance. Saddened by the outbreak of war in September 1939, Garvin nonetheless was a strong supporter of the war effort. Heartened by Churchill's return to the Admiralty, Garvin offered unflinching support for his old friend after he became Prime Minister in May 1940. Such support created a rift between Garvin and Astor. Though the two had been of like mind regarding appeasement, Astor opposed the concentration of war powers in Churchill's hands. Adding to the tension was Astor's son David, whose attempts to inject a more liberal tone into the newspaper were viewed by Garvin as an effort to criticise the Prime Minister. As a result, when Garvin published an editorial in February 1942 in support of Churchill remaining in office as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, the Astors viewed it as a breach of their contract and requested Garvin's resignation. Garvin quickly received an offer from Lord Beaverbrook to write a weekly column for his newspaper the Sunday Express. Switching to the Daily Telegraph in January 1945, Garvin continued to write a weekly column until just prior to his death from pneumonia at the age of 78. Personal life Garvin was married twice. In 1894 he married Christina Ellen Wilson, who bore him his son Ged and four daughters: Viola, Una, Katherine, and Ursula. After Christina's death in 1918, Garvin married Viola Woods (n√©e Taylor), the former wife of Unionist politician Maurice Woods.

First started in 1990 and announced soon thereafter, it remained vaporware for many years before it was finally released as NEO in 1995. It was sold for only a short period before being dropped (along with OpenStep) in 1996. In its place is what is today known as Enterprise JavaBeans.  Background  In the early 1990s the 'next big thing' in computing was to use desktop microcomputers to display and edit data being provided by mainframes and minicomputers. Although a number of methods for this sort of access already existed, the division of labor was not at all even. For instance, SQL required the workstation to download huge data sets and then process them locally, whereas use of terminal emulators left all of the work to the server and provided no GUI. It seemed that the proper split of duties would be to have a cooperative set of objects, the workstation being responsible for display and user interaction, with processing on the server. Standing in the way of this sort of solution was the massive differences in operating systems and programming languages between platforms. While it might be possible to build such a system that would work on any one combination of workstation and server, the same solution would not work on any other system. Oddly, the differences between any two programming languages on a single platform was almost as great. Each language had its own format for passing parameters into procedure calls, the file formats that they generated were often quite different. In general terms, it was not always possible to write different portions of a program in different languages, although doing so often has real utility. The problem was not so acute on minicomputers and mainframes where the vendor often specified standards for their libraries, but on microcomputers the programming systems were generally delivered by a variety of 3rd party companies with no interest in standardization. Nevertheless, this problem was being addressed in the early 1990s through the introduction of various shared library systems. These were actually intended to ease resource use on smaller platforms, by allowing a number of programs using a common resource, like the GUI, to share a single copy of code instead of each loading a separate copy into memory. As a side effect of being able to be called from many programs, these systems also defined a standard way to call them, using an interface definition language, or IDL, to allow any language on the platform to understand the code inside the library. Extending these systems to support remote procedure calls behind the scenes was seen as a natural evolution, providing a solution to the client/server programming problem. At the time there were a number of major projects to deliver such a system, including IBM's System Object Model (SOM/DSOM), NeXT's Portable Distributed Objects, Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM/DCOM) and many CORBA flavors. Sun, attempting to position itself as the future IBM in terms of backoffice support, felt they had to attack this market as well.  Spring, DOE, OpenStep, NEO  Sun's solution was based on work in their Spring operating system, which used intercommunicating objects for almost all programming tasks. Modifying this to work under a 'traditional' Unix like Solaris was not all that difficult, although Unix makes the assumption that all programs run locally, and an interface for remote access had to be added. For this, DOE added an object request broker (ORB) that ran on the backoffice servers, listening for DOE requests and handing them off to the proper program to be handled. During development, CORBA became a key buzzword in the industry. This prompted a delay while the ORB was re-engineered for CORBA support. Under the CORBA model, different objects, like those from DOE or SOM, would be able to interact by sharing a common interface. A bigger problem for Sun is that they had no integrated desktop object programming solution. Although C++ object libraries were becoming common on some platforms, their own SunOS (later known as Solaris) operating system and associated SunView and X window systems were 'plain C' based, while their newer NeWS windowing environment was based on a network-extensible object oriented dialect of PostScript. In order to supply a comprehensive and flexible object programming solution, Sun turned to NeXT and the two developed OpenStep. The idea was to have OpenStep programs calling DOE objects on Sun servers, providing a backoffice-to-frontoffice solution on Sun machines. OpenStep was not released until 1993, further delaying the project. By the time DOE, now known as NEO, was released in 1995, Sun had already moved on to Java as their next big thing. Java was now the GUI of choice for client-side applications, and Sun's OpenStep plans were quietly dropped (see Lighthouse Design). NEO was re- positioned as a Java system with the introduction of the \\"Joe\\" framework, but it saw little use. Components of NEO and Joe were eventually subsumed into Enterprise JavaBeans. Although distributed objects, and CORBA in particular, were the \\"next big thing\\" in the early 1990s, by the second half of the decade interest in them had essentially disappeared. Web-based applications running entirely on the server became the new \\"next big thing\\", and the need for a powerful display system on the client side faded, largely replaced by lightweight GUIs based on HTML and JavaScript (\\"Browser User Interfaces\\").

He became a critic of the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu. After the Romanian Revolution, Brucan engaged as a political analyst. Early life He was born in Bucharest to wealthy Jewish parents living in Berzei Street, near Matache MƒÉcelaru Market.Brucan, p.7 His father was a wholesale wool merchant who imported fabrics from England in the aftermath of World War I, suits of fine English fabrics being a luxury item that was popular among the Romanian bourgeoisie that was rising by the economic boom. He attended the German-language Evangelische Schule of LuteranƒÉ Street and the Saint Sava National College. In 1929 came the Wall Street Crash, leading to the Great Depression and a slump in the luxury industry, including English clothes and Brucan's father's shop in ≈ûepcari Street went bankrupt and the Brucan family was left penniless.Brucan, p.8 They moved into a modest apartment on Vlad ≈¢epe»ô Street. Brucan's father found a job as a fabric expert working for a German merchant, but as that was not enough to feed a family of six, Silviu Brucan began giving private lessons to pupils of wealthy families, thus gaining access to the world of the rich landowners and industrialists.Brucan, p.9 In his memories, Brucan said that the sharp contrast between the world of luxury of the privileged classes and the misery of those who worked hard all day to earn a living and the feeling of social injustice strongly influenced him. As a social outcast (his father had been indicted for fraudulent bankruptcy) and as a Jew in the 1930s, he was prevented by the Iron Guard supporters from formally studying at the University of Bucharest.Brucan, p.11 Nevertheless, with the help of some friends, he attended some courses at the university, such as the lectures of historian Nicolae Iorga, the philosopher Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, the aesthetician Tudor Vianu and the philosopher Nae Ionescu.Brucan, p.12 Early activism Brucan joined the left-wing movement at the age of 18. He was attracted by the opinions found in leftist and antifascist weekly newspapers such as St√Ænga (The Left), Era NouƒÉ (New Era) and Cuv√Æntul Liber (Free Word). Brucan joined communist groups, which organized \\"cultural evenings\\" at the houses of some supporter. There, he met literate communist supporters such as Alexandru Sahia. He began reading Marxist literature and soon was co-opted into party operations, being asked to hide some illegal party documents (speeches at a Comintern meeting in Prague) at his home.Brucan, p.13 In 1935, the moderate left-wing Diminea≈£a newspaper competed against Universul, a nationalist right-wing newspaper. To eliminate his rival, the owner of Universul, Stelian Popescu, began an anti-Semitic campaign (the owners of Diminea≈£a were Jews) leading to fascists burning copies of the newspaper and associated posters. The communist and socialist youth organized vigilante groups to defend the newsstands. Brucan was part of one of the left-wing groups defending the newsstands of Gara de Nord and was involved in a fight with Iron Guard supporters, sustaining a severe head injury. He subsequently worked as a journalist, first writing a fashionable social column at Gazeta de searƒÉ, then working as a proofreader at AdevƒÉrul Literar Brucan met Aurel Alicu, a leader of the National Peasant Youth, with whom he started in 1937 a weekly called Dacia NouƒÉ, having writers from both the traditional parties (National Liberal and National Peasants Party) and from left-wing circles (Miron Constantinescu, Corneliu MƒÉnescu, Roman Moldovan and Victor Iliu). The newspaper was published for a year until the Octavian Goga government shut it down.Brucan, p.14 In late 1938, he was conscripted, serving at a border guard unit at the frontier with Bulgaria, where he was acquainted with both komitadji extremists who attacked Romanian outposts, the Aromanian colonists in Southern Dobruja and the Middle Eastern smugglers who illegally crossed the border with hashish or opium.Brucan, p.14-15Koliopoulos, Giannƒìs. Plundered Loyalties: Axis Occupation and Civil Strife in Greek West Macedonia, 1941‚Äì1949, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 1999, . p. 69. During World War II, Brucan lived in the attic of a house in a quiet area in Cotroceni, working as an illegal press worker for the Communist Party's newspaper Sc√Ænteia.Brucan, p.31 In 1943, he was arrested by a police agent who accidentally noticed him on Buze»ôti Street, recalling his face from a photograph of a fellow Communist who had been previously arrested. However, as the police could not find any incriminating evidence, he was released a few days later.Brucan, p.31-32 After the 23 August 1944 coup In September 1944, upon Romania's exit from the Axis camp and the onset of Soviet occupation, he was named the general secretary of Sc√Ænteia (the deputy editor in chief to Leonte RƒÉutu), the official newspaper of the Communist Party.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.212, 304, 309 As long as the other newspapers still were published, Sc√Ænteia competed with them for the readers and Brucan, with the rest of the editors, tried to make a professional newspaper.Brucan, p.35 However, as party newspapers and independent newspapers were forcefully closed, one by one, by the new communist authorities, the Sc√Ænteia journalists became office clerks working 9 to 5 and writing ideological editorials for the indoctrination of the workers, who were \\"full of hope for a glorious future\\".Brucan, p.35-36 As editor of Sc√Ænteia, he supported the prison sentences of Iuliu Maniu, Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu and Corneliu Coposu (see TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair). He also supported the repression of anticommunist journalists, such as Radu Gyr and Pamfil ≈ûeicaru, asking for the death penalty for the latter. During this period, Brucan's wife, the Stalinist Alexandra Sidorovici (with whom he had three children: daughter Anca, and sons Dinu and Vlad), became a public prosecutor of the Romanian People's Tribunals, which allowed her to ask for death sentences for many war criminals; the sister of Teofil Sidorovici, she was a member of the nomenklatura of the Communist government. For a short while (1948‚Äì1949), Brucan was Professor of Journalism at the University of Bucharest although he never graduated from college. A close collaborator of Communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Brucan, along with Sorin Toma and Mihail Roller, was among the prominent party ideologues of the group that was co-ordinated by Leonte RƒÉutu after the late 1940s and into the 1950s.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.212, 304 Ambassador to the United States A loyal Soviet agent, Brucan was ambassador of Romania to the United States in 1955. He used the experience as the basis of a book that he co-authored with Sidorovici (a virulent attack on American institutions), He was ambassador to the United Nations between 1959 and 1962 as well as the head of Televiziunea Rom√¢nƒÉ.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.263, 309 Conflict with Ceau≈üescu Progressively from the 1960s, Brucan became an opponent of the new leadership around Ceau≈üescu. Initially, upon news that Ceau≈üescu had been appointed general secretary, he considered renouncing his political career to focus on an office at the university, but he was persuaded by Emil BodnƒÉra≈ü to remain an activist. He was a professor of Scientific Socialism at the Bucharest Faculty of Medicine.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.309-310 According to Brucan himself, he faced a period of financial insecurity and began work as a translator to cover his expenses. He also sent several works, subject to censorship at home, to be published in the United States. They showed his move towards reformism that he advocated to be applied inside the Eastern bloc.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.310 In 1987, after sending an anti-Ceau≈üescu declaration to the foreign press (to the BBC, the International Herald Tribune, and United Press International), a relatively -mild criticism for the violent repression of the Bra≈üov Rebellion,Cioroianu, p.487 he was sentenced to house arrest. At the time, Brucan had won the approval of Soviet authorities, which had already engaged in Perestroika policies and had been extended informal protection by the Soviet embassy in Bucharest, allowing him a relevant degree of freedom.Cioroianu, p.487; Neumann, p.183 With the help from , the chief of the Securitate, he was issued a passport, and in 1988, despite being expelled from the party, he spent six months in the United States, where he was in contact with the United States Department of State, headed by George P. Shultz. Brucan also claimed to have been invited to Moscow by Soviet politicians Mikhail Gorbachev and Anatoly Dobrynin, who endorsed criticism of Ceau≈üescu and a Romanian version of Glasnost. Based on the personal testimonies of Gorbachev's adviser, scholar Vladimir TismƒÉneanu has disputed all of Brucan's account. The fact that Ceau»ôescu allowed Brucan freedom of movement shows that Ceau»ôescu was not subjecting him to the same restrictions as to common dissidents, especially because of the interest about the safety of Brucan by both the Soviet Union (by making sure that the Pravda correspondent in Bucharest would keep close contact with him) and the governments of Britain and the United States by inviting him as a special guest in their countries.Deletant, p.278 Letter of the Six In March 1989, together with five other Communist dignitaries (Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru B√¢rlƒÉdeanu, Grigore RƒÉceanu, Corneliu MƒÉnescu and Constantin P√Ærvulescu), he signed the open letter known as Scrisoarea celor ≈üase(\\"The Letter of the Six\\").Cioroianu, p.487; Neumann, p.180; TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.262-263, 310 The document, which was immediately broadcast on Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, was a left-wing critique of Ceau≈üescu's policies,Neumann, p.180; TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.262-263 and it led to the swift arrest and interrogation of the signatories by the Securitate and then to their internal exile and house arrest at various locations. The Securitate depicted Brucan as one of several \\"hostile, inveterate, elements\\" and \\"the agent of foreign imperialist secret services\\". Although lacking in actual popular support,TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.263 the letter was argued to be the among most important and influential acts of opposition and a notorious break with the traditions of strict obedience and party discipline. Brucan was sent to a location on the outskirts of Bucharest, in DƒÉmƒÉroaia, the reason for his subsequent colloquial moniker, \\"The Oracle of DƒÉmƒÉroaia\\". Despite increased pressure, most of the contributors to the protest refused to withdraw their statement. Brucan later accused Apostol of having given in to pressures.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.292 During and after the Revolution Brucan was part of the National Salvation Front (FSN) during the Romanian Revolution, joining its Provisional Council and its Executive Committee. As a member of the Council, he was also involved in selecting Roman for the office of Premier. He was a member of the Council (together with Ion Iliescu, Petre Roman and some generals, including Nicolae Militaru) who decided to put the Ceau»ôescu couple on trial at the site in which they were being held in T√¢rgovi»ôte. That was due to the fear that Securitate snipers might attack the barracks and free them.Deletant, p.371 According to the testimony of Petre Roman, Brucan was among those who insisted for Nicolae and Elena Ceau≈üescu to be executed immediately after the trial, a claim that was denied by Brucan. When it was decided that the 10-point programme be read on national television on 22 December, according to Dumitru Mazilu, Brucan wanted it to include a clause that Romania would honour its obligations under the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact. In early January, Brucan made an assurance that the FSN had no intention of turning into a political party but would support some candidates. However, only three weeks later, he supported the transformation of the FSN into a political party, arguing that otherwise, there would be a \\"political vacuum\\" that the new political parties would be unable to fill.\\"Romania's Front to fight elections\\", Guardian, January 24, 1990, Page 24 After public allegations, Brucan resigned from the FSN in February 1990, claiming that he had accomplished his mission to restore stability in Romania and to put the country on a course toward multi-party elections. His prediction that the FSN would win the elections by more than 90%, supported the already-wide suspicions of falsified ballots. Early that year, he bad been the host of investor George Soros at the Group for Social Dialogue, a Romanian NGO that had been formed around the intellectual √©lite of the previous regime. He did not wish to run in the 1990 elections but to be \\"just the adviser\\" of now-President Iliescu. Nevertheless, he later issued a vocal criticism of President Iliescu. In 1990, Brucan contended that Romanians would need 20 years to become accustomed to democracy. That claim became well known in Romania. On the eve of the day of the first free post-communist elections (20 May 1990), Brucan argued that the 1989 Revolution was not anticommunist but only against Ceau≈üescu, not the communism of the 1950s and 1960s. He said that Iliescu made a \\"monumental\\" mistake in \\"conceding to the crowd\\" and banning the Romanian Communist Party.\\"Romania revolution 'not against communism'\\", Guardian, May 19, 1990, Page 24 As a supporter and activist of Soviet autopoiesis, Brucan also had important contributions to transatlantic geopolitics and the emergence of Eurasianism as a geopolitical concept. Later life From the late 1990s, Brucan hosted a news commentary program on the ProTV network (Profe≈£ii despre trecut - \\"Foretellings on the Past\\"), initially together with Lucian M√¢ndru≈£ƒÉ. During his final years, he was also a columnist for Ziarul Financiar. In 1998, he was brought to court by Vasile Lupu, a leader of the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (PN≈¢CD) and a deputy for Ia≈üi County. Speaking on his show, Brucan had called Lupu \\"astute to the square\\" and \\"trained Securitate informant\\" and indicated that \\"any good-faithed National Peasantist who still views himself as a party colleague with Vasile Lupu is self-excluding himself from the PN≈¢CD\\". In 2002, courts decided in Lupu's favour, and Brucan was found guilty of calumny. Brucan was required to pay Lupu the sum of 30 million lei as compensation. At the age of 90, Brucan underwent a seven-hour stomach operation on 4 September 2006. Despite an initial good recovery from surgery, his condition suddenly worsened on 13 September, and he died the following day of cardiac arrest. Legacy Writing in 2006, Vladimir TismƒÉneanu criticized Brucan, arguing that, despite his renunciation of Communism, Brucan had continued to support authoritarianism in public life and to display a taste for intrigue, and that he had attempted to transform the FSN into a \\"big party\\", virtually replacing the PCR.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.52 (The claim that FSN was leftist is dubious at best. apud )TismƒÉneanu pointed out Brucan's post-1990 opposition to Mircea RƒÉceanu, who had been imprisoned on dubious espionage charges under Ceau≈üescu, and who was later rehabilitated by Romanian courts. He has also contended that memoirs authored by Brucan showed little remorse, if not at all, for his early involvement in support of political repression.TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.46, 52 According to Victor Neumann, Brucan's role in the Bucharest episode of the 1989 Revolution had apparently helped indirectly the original and virtually unrelated revolt in Timi»ôoara, especially by preventing a more violent repression against it, but it was never explained.Neumann, p.180 He also argued that Brucan's group of former inner-Party dissidents was, in the eyes of the uninformed public at large, the only \\"credible alternative\\" at the time,Neumann, p.184-185, 189 and cited Brucan's own statement: \\"The train had arrived in the station and we were the only ones who could get on it. What were we to say, that we will not get on? We did it\\".Brucan, in Neumann, p.185 Overall, Neumann contended, Silviu Brucan's political and diplomatic expertise, as well as his adaptability, had made this old Stalinist the \\"ideologist of political transformations in 1989 Romania\\",Neumann, p.189 and had contributed to the supremacy of left-wing discourse in the years following the RevolutionNeumann, p.183, 189 (in regard to the latter point, he cited Brucan arguments, which challenged the existence of the right-wing themes in the ideological makeup of the 1989 movement).Neumann, p.183 Works=English * The dissolution of power; a sociology of international relations and politics, Knopf (1971) * The Dialectic of World Politics (1978) * The post-Brezhnev era: an insider's view, Praeger (1983) * World Socialism at the Crossroads: An Insider's View, Praeger (1987) * Pluralism and social conflict: a social analysis of the communist world, Praeger (1990) * The wasted generation : memoirs of the Romanian journey from capitalism to socialism and back, Westview Press (1993) * Social Change in Russia and Eastern Europe, Praeger/Greenwood (1998) Romanian * Originile politicii americane Bucharest, Editura ≈ûtiin≈£ificƒÉ, 1968 - (Origins of the American policy) * Democratizarea rela≈£iilor interna≈£ionale: premise ≈üi realitƒÉ≈£i, Bucharest, Editura PoliticƒÉ, 1975 - (The democratization of international relations: premisses and realities) * Dialectica politicii interna≈£ionale, Cluj-Napoca, Editura Dacia, 1985 - (The dialectic of world politics) * Pluralism ≈üi conflict social.

The Japanese name is an abbreviation of , which roughly translates to Corpse of a Star; A Precious Child. In North America, it was licensed by Dark Horse Comics and serialized in Super Manga Blast!. A 13-episode anime adaptation by Planet was broadcast in 2003 on the Japanese television station Kids Station. The anime was licensed by Central Park Media and released as Shadow Star Narutaru, and has played on Comcast's Anime Selects multiple times. In 2007 it ran on the Illusion on Demand television network. Central Park Media released the title under their \\"U.S. Manga Corps\\" line, on 4 DVDs, and later re-released the DVDs in a box set. Central Park Media filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the DVDs have since been out of print. Plot The protagonist of the series is a twelve-year-old girl named Shiina Tamai. She bonds with a starfish-shaped \\"dragonchild\\" (baby \\"shadow dragon\\") whom she calls Hoshimaru. The series is mainly about the interaction between Shiina and other young people who have also bonded with dragons. The manga, especially the original Japanese version, is known for the gruesome material that appears as the plot progresses. Despite the young main characters, cute monster designs, and the initial appearance of a Pok√©mon-esque series, the story quickly takes on a much darker and more disturbing tone, with later volumes involving some graphic depictions of gore and sexual violence. The English- and German-language versions of the manga have some edited scenes; entire pages of content were removed from the seventh volume of the English- language release. Media=Manga There are twelve volumes total in the Japanese release, and seven in the English-language one. As a result of Dark Horse's rearrangement of the series' chapters, those seven volumes actually cover volumes 1 to 6 of the original Japanese release. Further chapters were serialized in Super Manga Blast!, and starting with the magazine's 54th issue, the series was translated in its original right-to-left reading format; this lasted until Super Manga Blast! was cancelled five issues later. These chapters have not been collected into volumes yet, nor has Dark Horse announced any plans to further translate Shadow Star. Anime The anime adaptation consisted of 13 episodes, each running for 24 minutes, and adapted the storyline of the first 6 volumes (7 volumes of the American release) of the manga.

Biography Johnson is said to have been born with the last name Garrison, in the area of the Hickory Tavern between Pattenburg and Little York, near the border of what is today Alexandria and Union Townships in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he served aboard a fighting ship, having enlisted under a false age. After striking an officer, he deserted, changed his name to John Johnston, and traveled west to try his hand at the gold diggings in Alder Gulch, Montana Territory. He also became a \\"woodhawk,\\" supplying cord wood to steamboats. He was described as a large man, standing about in stocking feet (but see below) and weighing in the area of with almost no body fat. Rumors, legends, and campfire tales abound about Johnson. Perhaps chief among them is this one: in 1847, his wife, a member of the Flathead American Indian tribe, was killed by a young Crow brave and his fellow hunters, which prompted Johnson to embark on a vendetta against the tribe. According to historian Andrew Mehane Southerland, \\"He supposedly killed and scalped more than 300 Crow Indians and then devoured their livers\\" to avenge the death of the wife, and \\"As his reputation and collection of scalps grew, Johnson became an object of fear.\\"\\"Liver-Eating Johnson\\", in The Mythical West: An Encyclopedia of Legend, Lore, and Popular Culture, Richard W. Slatta, ed. (ABC-CLIO, 2001) p. 211 Evidence says that he would cut out and eat the liver of each Crow killed. This was an insult to the Crow because the Crow believed the liver to be vital if one was to go on to the afterlife. This led to him being known as \\"Liver-Eating Johnson\\". The story of how he got his name was written down by a diarist at the time. There were already two Johnsons (\\"Pear-Loving Johnson\\" and \\"Long Toes Johnson\\"); nicknames were commonplace, and with Johnson's show of eating the liver, he received his name. One tale ascribed to Johnson (while other sources ascribe it to Boone Helm) was of being ambushed by a group of Blackfoot warriors in the dead of winter on a foray to sell whiskey to his Flathead kin, a trip that would have been over . The Blackfoot planned to sell him to the Crow, his mortal enemies, for a handsome price. He was stripped to the waist, tied with leather thongs and put in a teepee with only one very inexperienced guard. Johnson managed to break through the straps. He then knocked out his young guard with a kick, took his knife and scalped him, and then quickly cut off one of his legs. He made his escape into the woods, surviving by eating the Blackfoot's leg, until he reached the cabin of Del Gue, his trapping partner, a journey of about . Eventually, Johnson made peace with the Crow, who became \\"his brothers\\", and his personal vendetta against them finally ended after 25 years and scores of slain Crow warriors. The West, however, was still a very violent and territorial place, particularly during the Plains Indian Wars of the mid-19th century. Many more Indians of different tribes, especially but not limited to the Sioux and the Blackfoot, would know the wrath of \\"Dapiek Absaroka\\" Crow killer and his fellow mountain men. The cabin inhabited by Johnson in the 1880s in Montana, moved into Red Lodge, Montana and on display at the tourism office Johnson joined Company H, 2nd Colorado Cavalry, of the Union Army in St. Louis in 1864 as a private and was honorably discharged the following year. During the 1880s, he was appointed deputy sheriff in Coulson, Montana, and a town marshal in Red Lodge, Montana. He was listed as five foot, eleven and three-quarter inches (1.82 meters) tall according to government records. In his time, he was a sailor, scout, soldier, gold seeker, hunter, trapper, whiskey peddler, guide, deputy, constable, and log cabin builder, taking advantage of any source of income-producing labor he could find. His final residence was in a veterans‚Äô home in Santa Monica, California. He was there for exactly one month before dying on January 21, 1900. His body was buried in a Los Angeles veterans' cemetery. However, after a six-month campaign led by 25 seventh-grade students and their teacher, Johnson's remains were relocated to Cody, Wyoming, in June 1974.

It is also a civil parish in the historic barony of Banagh. While Gleann Cholm Cille is still an Irish- speaking community, English has been steadily replacing Irish as the main language, with only 34% of the people speaking Irish on a daily basis in 2002.Glencolmcille Parish Plan . Cashel (Irish: An Caiseal) is the main village in the district. The name translates into English as \\"valley of Colm Cille\\". Saint Colm Cille, or Columba, is one of Ireland's three patron saints (along with Saint Patrick and Saint Brigid). Colm Cille and his followers lived in the valley for a time and the ruins of several of their churches can still be seen there. History Between 4000 and 3000 B.C., farming people settled in the area. The district was once famous as being the parish of The V. Rev. James Canon McDyer (1910‚Äì1987), who championed the rights of rural people and helped establish community-based industries in the area. A parish council (Comhairle Par√≥iste Ghleann Cholm Cille) has been functioning in Glencolumbkille since the 1930s, to look after the interests and needs of the residents of Glencolumbkille. Members are elected to this body by the residents of the Glencolumbkille church area; elections are held every three years.

Apparently, Bax composed much of his music and wrote many of his poems and stories while staying there. He describes the district and its villages, and the life of its inhabitants, in his autobiography Farewell My Youth. > At one end of the little Glen Bay was a wilderness of tumbled black rocks, > for some reason named Romantia (a particularly \\"gentle\\" ‚Äì or fairy-haunted > place, I was told in Dooey opposite), and upon this grim escarpment the > breakers thundered and crashed, flinging up, as from a volcano, towering > clouds of dazzling foam which would be hurled inland by the gale to put out > the fires in the cottage hearths of Beefan and Garbhros. The savagery of the > sea was at times nearly incredible. I have seen a continuous volume of foam > sucked, as in a funnel, up the whole six-hundred-foot face of Glen Head, > whilst with the wind north-west a like marvel would be visible on the > opposite cliff. There were days when you had to lean hard up against the > wind to keep your feet at all... Yet in that unearthly valley there always > seemed to be a core of peace in the heart of the most ravening tempest. > ‚ÄîArnold Bax, Farewell My Youth There are a number of natural sites nearby, such as the Slieve League (Irish: Sliabh Liag) cliffs, The Silver Strand (Irish: An Tr√°igh Bh√°n) at Malin Beg (Irish: M√°lainn Bhig), and Glen Head (Irish: Cionn Ghlinne) itself. At the centre of one of the largest Gaeltacht areas, the district is known as the home of Oideas Gael, an Irish-language learning institute established in 1984 to promote the Irish language and culture. The district also has a petrol station, grocer, post office, folk village, woolen mill, hill walking and accommodation centre, restaurant, \\"village cafe\\" and two pubs (often with Irish fiddle music). Films shot on location in Glencolumbkille include The Railway Station Man, 1992, starring Julie Christie, Donald Sutherland and John Lynch.

The DFD also provides information about the outputs and inputs of each entity and the process itself. A data- flow diagram has no control flow, there are no decision rules and no loops. Specific operations based on the data can be represented by a flowchart. There are several notations for displaying data-flow diagrams. The notation presented above was described in 1979 by Tom DeMarco as part of Structured Analysis. For each data flow, at least one of the endpoints (source and / or destination) must exist in a process. The refined representation of a process can be done in another data-flow diagram, which subdivides this process into sub-processes. The data-flow diagram is part of the structured-analysis modeling tools. When using UML, the activity diagram typically takes over the role of the data-flow diagram. A special form of data-flow plan is a site- oriented data-flow plan. Data-flow diagrams can be regarded as inverted Petri nets, because places in such networks correspond to the semantics of data memories. Analogously, the semantics of transitions from Petri nets and data flows and functions from data-flow diagrams should be considered equivalent. History The DFD notation draws on graph theory, originally used in operational research to model workflow in organizations. DFD originated from the Activity Diagram used in the SADT (Structured Analysis and Design Technique) methodology at the end of the 1970s. DFD popularizers include Edward Yourdon, Larry Constantine, Tom DeMarco, Chris Gane and Trish Sarson. Data-flow diagrams (DFD) quickly became a popular way to visualize the major steps and data involved in software-system processes. DFDs were usually used to show data flow in a computer system, although they could in theory be applied to business process modeling. DFDs were useful to document the major data flows or to explore a new high-level design in terms of data flow.  DFD components  Yourdon/DeMarco notation DFD consists of processes, flows, warehouses, and terminators. There are several ways to view these DFD components. Process The process (function, transformation) is part of a system that transforms inputs to outputs. The symbol of a process is a circle, an oval, a rectangle or a rectangle with rounded corners (according to the type of notation). The process is named in one word, a short sentence, or a phrase that is clearly to express its essence. Data Flow Data flow (flow, dataflow) shows the transfer of information (sometimes also material) from one part of the system to another. The symbol of the flow is the arrow. The flow should have a name that determines what information (or what material) is being moved. Exceptions are flows where it is clear what information is transferred through the entities that are linked to these flows. Material shifts are modeled in systems that are not merely informative. Flow should only transmit one type of information (material). The arrow shows the flow direction (it can also be bi-directional if the information to/from the entity is logically dependent - e.g. question and answer). Flows link processes, warehouses and terminators. Warehouse The warehouse (datastore, data store, file, database) is used to store data for later use. The symbol of the store is two horizontal lines, the other way of view is shown in the DFD Notation. The name of the warehouse is a plural noun (e.g. orders) - it derives from the input and output streams of the warehouse. The warehouse does not have to be just a data file, for example, a folder with documents, a filing cabinet, and optical discs. Therefore, viewing the warehouse in DFD is independent of implementation. The flow from the warehouse usually represents the reading of the data stored in the warehouse, and the flow to the warehouse usually expresses data entry or updating (sometimes also deleting data). Warehouse is represented by two parallel lines between which the memory name is located (it can be modeled as a UML buffer node). Terminator The Terminator is an external entity that communicates with the system and stands outside of the system. It can be, for example, various organizations (eg a bank), groups of people (e.g. customers), authorities (e.g. a tax office) or a department (e.g. a human- resources department) of the same organization, which does not belong to the model system. The terminator may be another system with which the modeled system communicates.  Rules for creating DFD  Entity names should be comprehensible without further comments. DFD is a system created by analysts based on interviews with system users. It is determined for system developers, on one hand, project contractor on the other, so the entity names should be adapted for model domain or amateur users or professionals. Entity names should be general (independent, e.g. specific individuals carrying out the activity), but should clearly specify the entity. Processes should be numbered for easier mapping and referral to specific processes. The numbering is random, however, it is necessary to maintain consistency across all DFD levels (see DFD Hierarchy). DFD should be clear, as the maximum number of processes in one DFD is recommended to be from 6 to 9, minimum is 3 processes in one DFD. The exception is the so-called contextual diagram where the only process symbolizes the model system and all terminators with which the system communicates.  DFD consistency  DFD must be consistent with other models of the system - ERD, STD, Data Dictionary, and Process Specification models. Each process must have its name, inputs and outputs. Each flow should have its name (exception see Flow). Each Data store must have input and output flow. Input and output flows do not have to be displayed in one DFD - but they must exist in another DFD describing the same system. An exception is warehouse standing outside the system (external storage) with which the system communicates.  DFD hierarchy  To make the DFD more transparent (i.e. not too many processes), multi-level DFDs can be created. DFDs that are at a higher level are less detailed (aggregate more detailed DFD at lower levels). The contextual DFD is the highest in the hierarchy (see DFD Creation Rules). The so-called zero level is followed by DFD 0, starting with process numbering (e.g., process 1, process 2). In the next, the so-called first level - DFD 1 - the numbering continues. E.g. process 1 is divided into the first three levels of the DFD, which are numbered 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. Similarly, processes in the second level (DFD 2) are numbered eg 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 and 2.1.4. The number of levels depends on the size of the model system. DFD 0 processes may not have the same number of decomposition levels. DFD 0 contains the most important (aggregated) system functions. The lowest level should include processes that make it possible to create a process specification (Process Specification) for roughly one A4 page. If the mini-specification should be longer, it is appropriate to create an additional level for the process where it will be decomposed into multiple processes. For a clear overview of the entire DFD hierarchy, a vertical (cross-sectional) diagram can be created. The warehouse is displayed at the highest level where it is first used and at every lower level as well.

Each of the state governments of the United States maintains a series of military decorations for issuance to members of the National Guard, with such awards presented under the authority of the various state adjutants general. Those National Guard soldiers and airmen who subsequently serve in the active or reserve federal forces of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or United States Air Force (i.e., as active duty or reserve members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard) may not continue to wear and display such decorations on a military uniform, unless such activation is under Title 32 status. Active duty regulations allow federal soldiers, airmen, sailors and marines to accept but not to wear state awards. Most states authorize the wear of other states' awards if a soldier or airman has earned awards from a state or territory to which he or she is not presently assigned. The order of precedence is typically the presently assigned state, followed by awards from the District of Columbia, then other states by their order of admission. The following is a list of National Guard decorations, as issued by each of the fifty United States; Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia.

Founded in 1912 by a group of pioneering Benedictine Sisters, today St. Scholastica educates almost 4,000 students annually and has graduated more than 29,000 alumni. The college offers a liberal arts education and is located on 186 wooded acres overlooking Lake Superior. History The College of St. Scholastica owes its existence to the combining of two forces: Benedictine missionaries and the settlement of Duluth. In 1892, Mother Scholastica Kerst and 28 Sisters arrived from St. Joseph, Minnesota, to spearhead the establishment of a Benedictine mother-house and an academy in Duluth. The school and convent were located at Munger Terrace before growth required a move to a new facility at Third Avenue East and Third Street. Named Sacred Heart Institute, the high school continued to grow rapidly. Duluth's rapid expansion led to a third move in 1909 to its present location. Mother Scholastica's vision for the college can be summed up in this quote attributed to her: \\"My dream is that someday there will rise upon these grounds fine buildings like the great Benedictine abbeys. They will be built of stone: within their walls higher education will flourish.\\" The school expanded its course offerings in 1912 to include a junior college and changed its name to The College of St. Scholastica. The college started with only six students and 52 courses offered in eight departments in its first year. Academic leadership and research were stressed early as an integral part of the college's commitment to Benedictine values. In 1924, the college became a four-year liberal arts institute with an enrollment of 68. The school's first baccalaureate degrees were granted in 1926. In 1969 it became a fully coeducational institution. As a Benedictine institution, the college is affiliated with the Order of Saint Benedict. Its endowment stands at more than $89.9 million.

The base of the lily is enclosed by a crescent, the heraldic symbol of the Virgin Mary, and the purity of Christian teaching. Symbolizing the college, a book occupies the center of the field, bearing the motto of St. Scholastica. It is adapted from the second part of the Book of Proverbs line \\"Her ways are ways of beauty, and all her paths are peace,\\" and reads in Latin, \\"Omnes semitae eius pacificae.\\"  Campuses  In addition to the main campus in Duluth, St. Scholastica has sites in St. Cloud, St. Paul and embedded sites in Brainerd, Austin, Cloquet, Inver Grove Heights, Rochester and a virtual campus. The Duluth campus is home to most undergraduate students. The 186-acre campus is set on a hill overlooking Lake Superior. Campus buildings include: Tower Hall, the Science Center, Our Lady Queen of Peace Chapel, Burns Wellness Commons, the 500-seat Mitchell Auditorium, the College Library, the St. Scholastica Theatre, Somers Residence Hall, and nine apartment complexes. A new Health Science Center housing graduate health science programs opened for classes in 2016. The building is at 940 Woodland Ave. in the BlueStone development, about a mile from the main campus. Library The college library provides over 350,000 print and electronic books, full-text journal databases, interlibrary loan services, laptops, wireless Internet access, group study rooms, and quiet study space. It is located on the upper floors of the Romanesque-styled Our Lady Queen of Peace Chapel building. Along with the library, the college archives preserves the written and visual history of the college, as well as housing special collections such as the papers of James Franklin Lewis.http://www.css.edu/Academics/Library.html Tower Hall Tower Hall is St. Scholastica's castle-like central building. Its origins date to a picnic in around 1907, when the Diocese of Duluth's Bishop James McGolrick commented that the top of the hill at the College's current site was a perfect location for a building. According to the historic records of Sister Agnes Somers, McGolrick and a group of students and Sisters climbed to the top of the hill and placed a pile of stones, symbolizing the cornerstone of what would eventually become Tower Hall. The following year saw the groundbreaking and start of construction for Tower Hall. Its first unit was completed in 1909. That September, 75 students from the Institute of the Sacred Heart were relocated to what was then called Villa St. Scholastica. Tower Hall was completed in 1928, and had two towers, a north to south axis of 375 feet, turrets at each end, recessed fenestration, and Tudor towers flanking the fa√ßade. Sharing the campus are St. Scholastica Monastery, home of the Benedictine Sisters; and the Benedictine Health Center and Westwood Assisted Living Facility, which provide experiences for many of the College's health science and behavioral arts and sciences students. In September 2012, the College's Centennial year, St. Scholastica opened a 40,000 square-foot addition to its existing 125,000 square-foot Science Center. The addition includes 7 laboratories for chemistry and biochemistry, 6 faculty- undergraduate student research areas, 2 classrooms for pre-laboratory meetings and general class use, faculty offices, an atrium-style gathering area, a greenhouse, and state-of-the-art environmental and sustainable technologies throughout, including for storage of chemicals and treatment of hazardous waste.  Academics  The college awards bachelor's, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees, and has a student to faculty ratio of 14:1. Undergraduate majors include liberal arts and science programs as well as pre-professional programs. Graduate degrees are offered in health professions, education, technology, business, and social work. All first-year students take part in a program called Dignitas (Dignity). The program's goals are that participants will accept and value the challenges and responsibilities involved in being a first-year college student, reflect on issues from various perspectives, and make connections with the larger community. A combination of course material, co-curricular activities, and common experiences is intended to prepare students for learning both during and after college.

Lagos is located in the region of Los Altos de Jalisco, within the macroregion of the Baj√≠o, one of the most highly developed areas in Latin America. Lagos de Moreno is occasionally known as the \\"Athens of Jalisco\\", owing to the numerous writers and poets who were born there. Lagos de Moreno was founded as Villa Santa Maria de los Lagos on March 31, 1563, by Don Hernando Martel, an Andalusian conquistador. The town was the economic and cultural center of a region that eventually attracted many ranchers. By 1600 there were over 20,000 cattle in the region. Santa Maria continued growing both physically and culturally, and by the 1800s, the town was elevated to a city and renamed to Lagos de Moreno in honor of Pedro Moreno. Lagos de Moreno was the site of the signing of several important political documents, the two identically named but unrelated Convenios de Lagos. The arts flourished in the city during the latter half of the 19th century, but this literary boom decreased somewhat after the Mexican Revolution, especially during the 1940s. Recently, Lagos de Moreno has become an important cultural and tourist destination thanks to its rich history and architecture, some of which still stands from the 17th century. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 153,817 inhabitants, making it the 6th largest city in the state of Jalisco. The estimate for the population in 2015 is 164,981 people. The city serves as the municipal seat of the municipality, which has an area of 2,648.22 km¬≤ (1,022.48 sq mi) and a population of 153,817 inhabitants, and includes many other outlying small communities, the largest of which are Paso de Cuarenta (San Miguel de Cuarenta) and Los Azulitos.  Etymology  The conquistador Hernando Martel gave Lagos de Moreno its original name, Villa de Santa Maria de los Lagos (Town of Saint Mary of the Lakes). The town's name was derived from Saint Mary, the townspeople's chosen patron saint, and the numerous lakes that used to be scattered across the valley. The town was renamed on April 9, 1829, as Lagos de Moreno in honor of Mexican independence hero Pedro Moreno, who was born in the city. History= Pre-hispanic era  The origins of Lagos de Moreno date to its founding as Pechichitl√°n or Teziziatlan by Ahnuvic VII in about 1028 BCE. Then the city served as a capital for the Chichimecatlalli fiefdom. In the 12th century, semi-nomadic Guachichiles occupied the valley and dominated an extensive area stretching from present- day San Juan de los Lagos to southern Coahuila. Before the colonization of Mexico began, indigenous culture thrived in this area, with notable pre- Hispanic architecture being established at Rinc√≥n de Mesa, Sauceda, and El Maguey.  Colonial era  After the fall of the Aztec Empire, explorers set out to explore the western frontier in the Bajio Region. The Spanish expansion in Nueva Galicia was slowed down by several tribes in the vicinity, such as the semi-nomadic Chichimecas and the Guachichiles. To the east of Pechititan, the Guamares inhabited the Guanajuato area, and to the west, the Zacatecos lived. The Zacateco caudillos (chiefs), Xiconaqui and Custique, along with the Chichimecas, struck down multiple Spanish invasions from 1550 to 1590 in the well-known Chichimeca War. However, encomenderos gradually occupied the Bajio. The first Spaniard to build a hacienda in the Laguense valley was Don Diego de Ibarra. Even so, in 1551, a group of Chichimecas attacked his ranch (La Sauceda and San Antonio) and killed all his animals. The constant raids in the area made, for the time being, made settlement of the Lagos region impossible. = Founding of Lagos = Don Hernando Martel founded Villa Santa Maria de los Lagos in 1563. He and his family held considerable influence over the town in its first few decades. After decades of constant combat and raids, the first Spanish authorities of the region were appointed; the priest of Teocaltiche and the Mayor of Teocaltiche had the region stretching from Teocaltiche to the Lagos valley as their jurisdiction. Later, the Royal Audiencia of Nueva Galicia ordered the Mayor of Teocaltiche, Don Hernando Martel from Seville, to establish a town in the vicinity of Pechichitan. The new settlement was founded jointly with the first priest and vicar of the local parish, father Juan de Cuenca Virues, who also participated in the official founding of the Real Comanja mine in 1561. As such, on March 31, 1563, Villa de Santa Mar√≠a de los Lagos was founded by Martel, Cuenca, and Captain Don Pedro de Anda, along with 72 or 73 Spanish noble families and their servants and slaves. Development The residents of Santa Maria chose the Virgin Mary as the namesake of their town and Saint Sebastian as a minor patron saint. The settlement and its surroundings became quite appealing to ranchers; by 1600 around 20,000 head of cattle were active in the Lagos valley, facilitating the eventual creation of the charreria-style rodeo. The increasing population of the area contributed to the naming of the first ordinary Mayor of Santa Maria de los Lagos, the miner Pedro Marfil from Guanajuato. Marfil would be succeeded by Gonzalo Vazquez Baladez, the first and only clergyman to-date to serve as mayor of the town. The town continued to grow steadily in the 17th century, benefiting from the general prosperity of the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire. In 1615, a new jail was inaugurated, and 1621 saw the construction of a third parish temple with a tower that would be completed by 1685. Religious buildings were created often during this period; the Convent of the Poor Capuchins of Saint Joseph was founded and the construction of the Parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and the Temple of Our Lady of the Rosary began during this time. = Mexican War of Independence = Pedro Moreno, namesake of Lagos de Moreno and hero of the Mexican War of Independence.Santa Maria de los Lagos, like the rest of New Spain, underwent rapid political change in the early 1800s. The lawyer Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos spoke to Spanish authorities, advocating for Mexican independence. He subsequently died under mysterious circumstances in the dungeon of the Mexico City Trustee building. In the initial phase of the war, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla himself visited Santa Maria de los Lagos and provided religious services there, even recruiting some families for the fight against the forces of the Spanish Viceroy.  Independence to present  In 1823, the Convenio de Lagos (Agreement of Lagos) was signed in Santa Maria by Nicolas Bravo, Pedro Celestino Negrete, and Luis Quintanar, establishing the Free and Sovereign State of Jalisco. On March 27, 1824, Santa Maria was given the title of city. On April 9, 1829, the city was renamed as Lagos de Moreno in memory of insurgent General Pedro Moreno (1775-1817), a founding father of Mexico who led forces against Spanish authorities in the Mexican War of Independence. In 1855, a second and similarly titled Convenio de Lagos (Agreement of Lagos) was signed in Lagos de Moreno, in which Manuel Doblado and Antonio de Haro y Tamariz recognized the Plan of Ayutla, thus joining the movement to topple conservative President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Ana. During the Reform War, Lagos de Moreno changed hands between liberal and conservative forces multiple times until an eventual liberal victory in 1861. During the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s, residents of Lagos de Moreno like Mariano Azuela and Francisco Guerrero Ramirez joined the fighting. In the subsequent Cristero War, the nearby Mesa Redonda was the site of a battle between federal troops and rebel forces. In 1963, Lagos de Moreno celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding. In recent times, the city has received several important titles. It has been named an Area of Historical Monuments by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) in 1989, a World Heritage Site on the Camino Real \\"Tierra Adentro\\" by UNESCO on August 1, 2010, and \\"Pueblo M√°gico\\" by SECTUR on November 16, 2012. Geography= Climate  Lagos de Moreno has a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cwb) with mild temperatures year round. Temperatures are generally similar for any given month, but daily high and low fluctuations can be very sharp in the winter due in part to the city's altitude and its uneven surroundings. Winters are mild with an average maximum temperature of in January although nighttime temperatures are often cold, with an average minimum temperature of . Many days are sunny, averaging around 15-19 clear days per month and precipitation is low. Nighttime temperatures regularly fall below but extended periods of frost are rare. The Bajio's two main seasons are the wet season and the dry season. The wet season, which runs from June to October sees an increase in precipitation and humidity with July and August being the wettest months. The record high was on March 26, 1942 and the record low was on January 24, 1955. The table below shows detailed statistics on the climate of Lagos de Moreno.  Topography  A view of the Mesa Redonda from the nearby highway. Mesa Redonda was the site of a Cristero War battle.Lagos de Moreno is situated 1,942 meters (6,371 feet) above mean sea level. Lagos is located in the region of Los Altos de Jalisco, within the macroregion of the Baj√≠o, one of the most highly developed areas in Latin America. The city's vicinity is quite mountainous and hilly, with the nearby Mesa Redonda being a particularly notable formation.  Flora and fauna  The nearby Mesa Redonda is home to many unique species of flora. There, two species of cactus endemic only to Jalisco flourish, with one of these species only being endemic to the Mesa Redonda, particularly its very steep slopes, protecting it from predators. Many animals call the Lagos valley home, with fauna including hares, rabbits, deers, and boars. Residents of nearby ranches have commented on the presence of coyotes and snakes in rural areas. Areas like the Mesa Redonda have been utilized by locals to gather vegetables straight from nature, particularly prickly pear cacti.  Demographics  As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 153,817 inhabitants, making it the 6th largest city in the state of Jalisco. The estimate for the population in 2015 is 164,981 people. Lagos de Moreno has a slightly higher female population compared to males with 79,345 females compared to 74,472 males, meaning that the female population is 6.14% higher than the male population.

He was the son of Admiral Frederick Maxse a Radical Liberal Unionist, who bought the National Review for him in 1893. Before the Great War, Maxse argued against liberal idealism in foreign policy, Cobdenite pacifism, Radical cosmopolitanism and, following the turn of the century, constantly warned of the 'German menace'.Maurice Cowling, The Impact of Labour 1920‚Äì1924. The Beginnings of Modern British Politics (Cambridge University Press, 1971), p.78. Life Maxse was educated at Harrow School and King's College, Cambridge, where he took no degree. While at the latter institution he was elected President of the Cambridge Union Society. He was a close friend of journalist and neo- Jacobite Herbert Vivian at Cambridge, and both were frequent visitors at Oscar Browning's apartment. He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb, but would then go on to be one of the most prominent and influential of the tory Die-Hards. The National Review did not gain a distinct voice until the early part of the twentieth century. In 1903 Maxse became an ardent supporter of Joseph Chamberlain's Tariff Reform proposals. The National Review then became the most prominent ideological mainstay of the right-wing of the Conservative Party for two decades, and would flail those members of the Conservative Party who showed the slightest sign of equivocating on support for the House of Lords, the Union, and the Empire in the required manner. In 1911 he conducted the \\"B.M.G.\\" (Balfour Must Go) campaign which resulted in Arthur Balfour resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party, showing that Maxse had become a force to be reckoned among Conservative opinion makers. Maxse supported the Entente, demanded rearmament and a strong policy against the German Empire, which he considered to be the greatest threat to the British Empire. Maxse eagerly welcomed the Great War, but was critical of the government's failings. From 1917 he supported the National party against the Conservative Party leadership, whom he regarded as subservient to David Lloyd George and who would, therefore, keep him in high office.Cowling, p.80. Maxse argued that the 1918 victory against Germany gave the Allies a fleeting opportunity to destroy German power. He viewed the Treaty of Versailles as ineffectual towards that aim and blamed Allied politicians, Lloyd George especially, for bowing to President Wilson's pressure to make the treaty less harsh. Maxse believed Germany was still able to restore itself as the dominant European power. Maxse vehemently opposed the League of Nations: the League was a \\"front-bench affair hurriedly adopted and recklessly advocated simply and solely to please President Wilson\\".Maurice Cowling, The Impact of Labour 1920‚Äì1924. The Beginnings of Modern British Politics (Cambridge University Press, 1971), p.79 He claimed Hindenburg and Ludendorff controlled Germany from behind-the-scenes, regardless of which politician was in office, and that it was unnecessary to appease Germany to prevent her from going Bolshevik because Prussian militarism was still the dominant force. The Allied intervention in Russia, aimed at overthrowing the Bolsheviks, was supported by Maxse, not just because he disliked Bolshevism but because he wanted Russia to resume her pre-revolution role of being an anti-German power. Maxse was also pro-French and pro-Polish. During 1920‚Äì1922, Maxse attacked Lloyd George for failing to \\"f[i]ght for a...greater France, support...Poland, sustain...Bohemia, nourish...Rumania [and] uphold our allies in Russia\\". He became an outspoken critic of British Zionism, condemning attempts to occupy Palestine. Maxse would lose influence with the advent of Stanley Baldwin as leader of the Conservative Party.

It is celebrated every December 30, the anniversary of Rizal's 1896 execution at Bagumbayan (present- day Rizal Park) in Manila. History First Rizal Monument in Daet, Camarines Norte Rizal Day was first instituted with a decree by President Emilio Aguinaldo issued December 20, 1898 and celebrated December 30, 1898 as a national day of mourning for Rizal in Malolos and all victims of the Spanish colonial rule of the Philippines. Daet, Camarines Norte was the first town to follow the decree, building a monument designed by Lt. Col. Antonio Sanz, led by Sanz and Lt. Col. Ildefonso Alegre, and financed by the townsfolk of Camarines Norte and the rest of the Bicol Region. Finished in February 1899, the three-tiered stone pylon inscribing Rizal's novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, and Morga, for Antonio de Morga, author of Sucesos de las islas Filipinas, a book about the early days of the Spanish colonization in the Philippines. With the victory of the Americans against the Spaniards in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Americans took control of the Philippines. In an effort to demonstrate that they were more pro-Filipino than the Spaniards, the American Governor-General William Howard Taft in 1901 named Rizal a Philippine national hero. A year later, on February 1, 1902, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 345, which made December 30 a public holiday. To underscore the solemnity of the event, President Elpidio Quirino signed Republic Act No. 229 into law on June 9, 1948 that prohibits cockfighting, horse racing and jai-alai every December 30. The law also requires that flags across the country remain at half staff throughout the day.  Ceremonies  President Elpidio Quirino leads the 1949 Rizal Day ceremony. Rizal Day ceremonies are held at Rizal Park in Manila. This is usually held early in the morning, led by the President and Vice President, and involves the raising of the national flag at Independence Flagpole, followed by a flypast by the Philippine Air Force and the laying of a wreath at the Rizal Monument. The President also usually has a year-end address that is first broadcast on this holiday. Rites are also held elsewhere in the country, with the chief executive of a province, city, or town presiding. These rites are similar to the one in Manila, and most often include flag-raising, speeches, and wreath-laying ceremony at the locale's own monument to Rizal. Rizal Days in history On his Rizal Day address on December 30, 1937, President Manuel L. Quezon declared through Commonwealth Act No. 184 the adoption of Tagalog as the national language. Under Japanese occupation during World War II, the Rizal Day program of 1942 attended by Benigno Aquino, Sr., and President Jos√© P. Laurel included the recital of Rizal's final poem Mi √∫ltimo adi√≥s in Japanese and the inauguration of the KALIBAPI. Starting in 1936, Rizal Day was also the inauguration day of the incoming president. Presidents usually chose Independence Grandstand (now known as Quirino Grandstand) as the inauguration venue because it faces the spot where Rizal was buried, and also the site of the independence ceremony in 1946, according to historian Manuel L. Quezon III. In the inauguration of Ramon Magsaysay after winning the 1953 presidential election via a landslide, around 300,000 to 500,000 people attended the ceremonies. With the approval of the 1973 constitution, inauguration days were moved to June 30. On the centenary of Rizal's death on December 30, 1996, the program included retracing Rizal's last steps from his cell at Fort Santiago to the execution site, followed by a reenactment of his death and the customary flag-raising. On December 30, 2000, local terrorists (with the backing of Jemaah Islamiyah) bombed five areas in Metro Manila, killing 22 and injuring 100.  Changing the day of commemoration  Being that December 30 is sandwiched between Christmas and New Year's Day, National Historical Commission chairperson Ambeth Ocampo pushed for the moving of Rizal Day from December 30 to June 19, Rizal's birth. This would allow students to participate in commemoration activities as opposed to it being held on December 30 which is in the middle of the Christmas vacation. The House of Representatives approved on its third reading a bill that would have changed it to June 19 on December 10, 2008, but was not acted in time by the Senate after the 14th Congress ended its session and was thus not enacted. On April 29, 2011, President Benigno Aquino III officially declared June 19, 2011 a special one-time non-working holiday in commemoration of Rizal's 150th Birthday.

It was supposedly created by Jue Yuan with help from Bai Yufeng and Li Sou. The emphasis of leopard is speed and angular attack. The leopard does not overwhelm or rely on strength, as does the tiger, but instead relies on speed and outsmarting its opponent. The power of the style derives from its aggressive speed. The leopard practitioner will focus on elbows, knees, low kicks, and leopard punches. Leopard kung-fu is a hit, damage and run style designed to overcome superior forces with inferior resources. Counter attacks are sudden, indirect and short, with the aim of landing a debilitating technique. The goals of Leopard style are to: * develop muscle speed for external strength. * teach patience. * use the leopard punch for penetration and lower body springing power. The leopard style was founded on the creators' observation of the movements of the leopard in the wild, and therefore practitioners of the style imitate these movements. Leopard style techniques are geared towards single, two or three technique combinations that cause a lot of damage, disorientate or even blind the attacker. Blocking is wasted in Leopard ‚Äì the style can be summed up with \\"Why block when you can hit?\\". It does not rely on rooted stances, and would only assume a stance while in attack in order to launch at the opponent. This hit and run technique of the leopard, something especially effective against larger opponents, is unique to the animal. The primary weapon is the leopard fist, which can be likened to a half-opened fist. The primary striking surface is the ridge formed by folding the fingers at the first phalangeal joint; the secondary striking surface is the palm hand. Strikes include the phoenix eye, which is a punch to pressure points including the eye and temple. It is formed by lifting only the index finger's knuckle while the rest are kept in a usual fist form. The leopard fist can also be modified by slightly lifting the fingers to form a claw. The leopard claw can be used to rake, claw, and rip at the face and throat of an assailant. The leopard style is thought to be a midway point between the Tiger and Crane styles, the strength and height. An interesting technique of the leopard is the ability to simultaneously block and strike the opponent. This is not commonly used in the harder martial arts (like the other Shaolin styles, for example). The sheer speed of the leopard is a defining characteristic of the style. In popular culture, the Leopard style is used in the Mortal Kombat series. Darrius uses the art in Deception and the character Nitara also uses the style in both Deadly Alliance and Armageddon.

A ray of light of known velocity is emitted from a nephoscope, which strikes the base of a targeted cloud. The travel time of the return signal is used to estimate the distance to the cloud. Description A nephoscope was an instrument used to measuring the altitude, direction, and velocity of clouds in the 19th century. This is different from a \\"nephometer\\" which is an instrument used in measuring the amount of cloudiness. A ray of light of known velocity is emitted from a nephoscope, which strikes the base of a targeted cloud. The travel time of the return signal is used to estimate the distance to the cloud. The distance to the cloud is calculated using the equation: Mirror nephoscope Mirror Nephoscope The following is from Scientific American and is in the public domain as it was written before 1923. Developed by Carl Gottfrid Fineman this instrument consists of a magnetic compass, the case of which is covered with a black mirror, around which is movable a circular metal frame. A little window in this mirror enables the observer to see the tip of the compass needle underneath. On the surface of the mirror are engraved three concentric circles and four diameters; one of the latter passes through the middle of the little window. The mirror constitutes a compass card, its radii corresponding to the cardinal points. On the movable frame surrounding .the mirror is fixed a vertical pointer graduated in millimeters, which can be moved¬∑ up and down by means of a rack and pinion. The whole apparatus is mounted on a tripod stand provided with leveling screws. To make an observation, the mirror is adjusted to the horizontal with the leveling-screws, and is oriented to the meridian by moving the whole apparatus until the compass needle is seen, through the window, to lie in the north-south line of the mirror (making, however, allowance for the magnetic declination). The observer stands in such a position as to bring the image of any chosen part of a cloud at the center of the mirror, lind the vertical pointer is also adjusted by screwing it up or down and by rotating it around the mirror until its tip is reflected in the center' of the mirror. As the image of the cloud moves toward the circumference of the mirror the observer moves his head so as to keep the tip of the pointer and the cloud image in coincidence. The radius along which the image moves gives the direction of the cloud's movement, and the time required to pass from one circle to the next its relative speed, which may be reduced to certain arbitrary units. This instrument is, however, not very easy to use, and gives only moderately accurate measurements. Comb nephoscope Besson comb nephoscope The following is mostly Scientific American and is in the public domain as it was written before 1923. Developed by Louis Besson director of the Observatory of Montsouris in 1912 this apparatus consists of a horizontal bar fitted with several equidistant spikes and mounted on the upper end of a vertical pole which can be rotated on its axis. When an observation is to be made the observer places himself in such a position that the central spike is projected on any chosen part of a cloud. Then, without altering his position, he causes the \\"comb\\" to turn by means of two cords in such a manner that the cloud is seen to follow along the line of spikes. A graduated circle, turning with the vertical pole, gives the direction of the cloud's motion ; it is read with the aid of a fixed pointer. Moreover, when the apparatus is once oriented, the observer can determine the relative speed of the cloud by noting the time the latter requires to pass from one spike to the next. If the instrument stands on level ground, so that the observer's eye is always at the same height, and if the interval between two successive spikes is equal to one tenth of their altitude above the eye-level of the observer, one need only multiply by 10 the time required for the cloud to pass over one interval to determine the time the cloud travels a horizontal distance equal t.o its altitude. M. Besson revived an old method of Bravais for measuring the actual height of clouds. The apparatus in this case consists of a plate of glass having parallel faces, mounted on a graduated vertical circle which indicates its angle of inclination. A sheet of water, situated at a lower level, serves as a mirror to reflect the cloud. The water is contained in a rel;!ervoir of blackened cement surrounded by shrubbery, and is only a small fraction of an inch in depth, so that the wind may not disturb its level surface. The observer, having mounted' the glass plate on the horizontal axis of a. theodolite set on a window-sill some 30 or 40 feet above the ground, places his eye close to it and adjusts its inclination so that the images of a cloud reflected in the plate and in the sheet of water coincide. Then from a curve traced once for all on a sheet of plotting paper he reads off the altitude of the cloud corresponding to the observed angle on the glass plate. The curve is plotted from simple trigonometrical calculations. At the Observatory of Montsouris the degree of cloudiness, i. e., the amount of the whole ¬∑ sky covered with clouds at a given moment, is determined by means of the nephometer, also devised by M. Besson. This consists of a convex glass mirror, a segment of a sphere, about twelve inches in diameter, in which is seen the reflection of the celestial vault divided into ten sections of equal area by means of lines engraved on the . glass. As shown in our front page engraving, the meteorologist observes through an eyepiece fixed in . an invariable position with respect to the mirror, which latter turns freely on a vertical axis. The observer, whose own image partly obstructs sections 8, 9. and 10, notes the degree of cloudiness in the sections numbered 1 to 7. The cloudiness of each section is estimated on a scale of 0 to 10 ; zero meaning no clouds and 10 entirely overcast. He now rotates the mirror and eyepiece 180 degrees and observes the cloudiness in sections 7, 5, and 2, which represent the regions of the sky that at the first observation corresponded to sections 8, 9, and 10.

His most well-known role came in the television series Northern Exposure (1990‚Äì1995), for which he was consecutively nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards. Early life Corbin was born in Lamesa, the seat of Dawson County, south of Lubbock in West Texas. He is the son of the former Alma LaMerle Scott (1918‚Äì1994), a teacher, and Kilmer Blaine Corbin, Sr. (1919‚Äì1993), a school principal, judge, and Democratic member of the Texas State Senate for two terms, from 1949‚Äì1957. Corbin was named for author J. M. Barrie by his mother. He played football briefly in eighth grade, but soon moved to the arts, including acting and ballet classes. He graduated from Monterey High School. Corbin studied theatre arts at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. At 21, he joined the United States Marine Corps, served two years, and then returned to Tech. Career Corbin began his career as a Shakespearean actor in the 1960s, but today he is more likely to be seen in the role of the local sheriff, military leader, or some other authority figure, though on occasion, he has effectively portrayed murderous villains, as well. To moviegoers, he is well remembered as General Beringer in WarGames, John Travolta's uncle Bob Davis in Urban Cowboy, co-starring with Clint Eastwood in Any Which Way You Can, or Roscoe Brown, July Johnson's bumbling deputy in the acclaimed Western Lonesome Dove. From 1979 until 1984, he appeared in several episodes of Dallas as Sheriff Fenton Washburn. In 1983, Corbin co-starred in the famed television miniseries The Thorn Birds. Corbin played Mary Carson's stockman Pete, who teaches the Clearys' sons how to shear sheep on their aunt's gigantic sheep station Drogheda, in Australia. In 1983‚Äì1984, Corbin played Merit Sawyer in the NBC television series Boone. Corbin's role was that of a stern father to the young actor Tom Byrd, who played Boone Sawyer, an aspiring singer. The program was set in rural Tennessee during the 1950s and was created by Earl Hamner, who had great success earlier with CBS's The Waltons. From 1990 to 1995, Corbin portrayed former astronaut and local business leader Maurice Minnifield on CBS's Northern Exposure, for which he received an Emmy Award nomination. In 1994, Corbin narrated the acclaimed TBS documentary MoonShot, telling the story of the 1960s space race from the first-person viewpoint of Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton. In 2007, he played the character Clay Johnson, father of Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson on The Closer series. In 2000, he played the role of General Carville in consecutive video games, Command & Conquer: Red Alert, Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 and Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge. In 2003, Corbin co-starred with Northern Exposure castmate John Cullum in Blackwater Elegy, an award-winning short film written by Matthew Porter and co-directed by Porter and Joe O'Brien. From 2003‚Äì2008, Corbin played Whitey Durham, the basketball coach for the Tree Hill Ravens on The WB/CW teenager drama series One Tree Hill. He also had a role in 2007's Oscar-winning film No Country for Old Men. Corbin lost most of his hair in the 1990s due to alopecia areata. Since then, he has played various roles with a shaved head, wearing a cowboy hat, or occasionally wearing a full toupee. Corbin is the signature voice of radio station KPLX in Fort Worth, Texas, and has also voiced trailers and promotions for CMT and various other country radio stations. In 2014, he became the spokesman for the Texas Veterans Land Board. In 2014, Corbin worked with Tracey Birdsall on Dawn of the Crescent Moon, followed by working alongside her for the science fiction films At the Edge of Time (2016) and The Time War (2017). In 2020, Corbin had a recurring guest role as Everett Acker in Better Call Saul. Personal life Before breaking into film, Corbin won many cutting-horse competitions. Much of his spare time is spent riding horses and tending to cattle on his small Texas ranch near Fort Worth. He has volunteered his time to charity for many years, including rodeos and being spokesman for the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. In 2006, he participated in the Lubbock centennial. Corbin lives on the ranch with his daughter, Shannon Ross (born 1965) and grandchildren. Shannon had been adopted as an infant; her birth mother, who had an affair with Corbin, gave up the child through the Methodist Mission Home in San Antonio, without having told Corbin of the pregnancy. Corbin found Shannon in June 1991, when she was 26. Corbin has three sons: Bernard Weiss (born 1970), Jim Corbin (born 1979), and Christopher Corbin (born 1982). Christopher has followed in his father's footsteps as an actor. Bernard was adopted by the Weiss family and later in life got in touch with Corbin. His second wife, Susan Berger, and he divorced in 1992. In 2009, Corbin was inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. A recent painting of Corbin has been placed at the museum exhibit.Museum exhibit, Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame, Fort Worth. Corbin has appeared at gatherings of the American Cowboy Culture Association, which holds the annual National Cowboy Symposium and Celebration each September in Lubbock. In September 2011, Corbin was given a lifetime achievement award by the Estes Park Film Festival in Estes Park, Colorado.Cangialosi, Jason. \\"Estes Park Film Festival: Barry Corbin‚Äôs Lifetime Achievement Award.\\" www.milehighcinema.com, The Texas Film Hall of Fame inducted Corbin into its membership on March 8, 2012.

This creation became extinct upon his death in 1912. A second creation was made on 25 June 1917 for Sir William Henry Dunn, of Clitheroe in the County Palatine of Lancaster, Lord Mayor of London.

A remake of The Absent-Minded Professor (1961), the film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and stars Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden, Christopher McDonald, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, Wil Wheaton, and Clancy Brown with Jodi Benson providing a voice. The film grossed $178 million worldwide. In selected theaters, the Pepper Ann episode \\"Old Best Friend\\" was featured before the film. Plot Professor Philip Brainard (Williams), of Medfield College, is a mad scientist who is developing a new energy source in an attempt to raise enough money to save the college from closure. His preoccupation with his research distracts him from his fianc√©e, Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden), who is the president of the college; he has already missed two wedding dates as a result of this, much to Sara's anger. On the day of the third attempted wedding, Brainard is approached by his former partner Wilson Croft (McDonald), who has profited from ideas he has stolen from the chemist and now desires to steal Sara from Brainard and make her his wife, an intention that he declares directly to Brainard, who takes it as a joke. Before he can make it to the wedding, his latest experiment shows quick progress, forcing him to miss this latest wedding date. The resulting substance created from the experiment is a sentient green goo with enormous amounts of elasticity and kinetic energy. It increases in speed as it bounces and proves to be difficult to control, wreaking havoc on the neighborhood before the professor finally manages to capture it. Weebo (voiced by Jodi Benson), Brainard's hovering robot assistant, classifies the substance as \\"flying rubber\\", leading Brainard to christen it \\"Flubber\\". Brainard continues to work on Flubber into the early morning, looking to stabilize the Flubber's movement as opposed to stimulation. Brainard's incorrectly set watch alarm goes off at 6:30 am, and Weebo informs him that he has missed the wedding. Brainard goes to Sara's office and unsuccessfully attempts to explain the situation to her. Meanwhile, Medfield College sponsor Chester Hoenicker (Barry) is disappointed that Brainard has failed his son Bennett (Wheaton) in chemistry class. That night, Hoenicker sends his security guards Smith (Brown) and Wesson (Ted Levine) to Brainard's house in an attempt to persuade Brainard into giving Bennett a better grade. However, Brainard is too busy experimenting with the Flubber to even notice them and unknowingly knocks them unconscious with a Flubber-coated golf ball and bowling ball. He uses Flubber to give his vintage Ford Thunderbird flight. During a test run, he discovers Wilson flirting with Sara (making a bet that she will buy him dinner if Medfield wins, or join him for a weekend in the mountains if they lose). Afterward, Weebo attempts to confess her love of Brainard, only to be shrugged off as a computer. In response, she secretly creates a holographic human version of herself named Sylvia (Leslie Stefanson) in hopes of winning him over. Before Weebo can kiss Brainard in this form as he sleeps, Brainard awakens with another idea for Flubber. He enters a vacant basketball arena and tests the effects of Flubber on a basketball and his shoes. Later, he gives Flubber-padded shoes to the unskilled Medfield basketball team to increase their abilities and defeat their opposing team, Rutland. Back in Brainard's home, looking to have some fun, Weebo unleashes Flubber from his case, allowing him to dance around the house and cause general mayhem. After the close but successful basketball game, Brainard's attempt to win Sara back into his favor fails. Upon returning home, Brainard releases his emotional baggage on Weebo, saying his absent-mindedness is due to his love of Sara. Weebo records Brainard's ramblings and shows the footage to Sara, who then reconciles with Brainard. Brainard demonstrates Flubber's abilities to Sara and they discuss how it can be used for profit. However, Hoenicker discovers Flubber's existence, and after failing to convince Brainard and Sara to sell it to him, summons Smith and Wesson to raid Brainard's house and steal Flubber. Weebo attempts to fend off the henchmen, only to be struck down by Wesson with a baseball bat. Brainard and Sara return to find the home a wreck and find Weber (Brainard's house-robot) cleaning up, Flubber stolen, and Weebo destroyed. Later, Brainard discovers that Weebo had downloaded backup data of herself onto his computer in the event of her destruction, as well as a video recording of Weebo's hologram professing her love for him. Brainard and Sara confront Hoenicker and attempt to save Flubber, under the guise of accepting Hoenicker's offer. While there, they discover that Wilson is allied with the millionaire who wanted to sell it for a profit. Brainard and Sara then reveal their ruse and unleash Flubber, starting a battle between the villains and them. In the end, Brainard and Sara defeat Wilson, Bennett, Hoenicker, and his henchmen, retrieve Flubber, raise enough money to save the college, and finally have a successful wedding, along with Flubber and the \\"daughter\\" of Weebo, called Weebette. The film ends with the family heading to Hawaii in the Thunderbird, flying at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

Sets constructed there included the basketball court, a duplicate of the Professor's house, where some exterior and all interior shots were produced, a separate set portraying the basement of the house, and Hoenicker's library. Many exterior shots of Brainard's house were shot in San Jose at a home that was temporarily modified, including the addition of an observatory on the roof. Sara Jean's office, Hoenicker's living room, and most exterior campus shots were produced at a private girls' high school on the San Francisco peninsula. The exterior shot of the Rutland gym was shot at Stanford. Some scenes were filmed on campus at San Jose State University in Washington Square Hall during production in 1997. The shot of the Professor and Sara Jean floating through the clouds in the Thunderbird was filmed at the former Mare Island Naval facility in Vallejo, California. Other scenes were filmed at the University of the Pacific, Stockton. Gag homages Many gags are embellishments from the 1961 film; John Hughes rewrote the original Bill Walsh screenplay (based on Samuel W. Taylor's short story, A Situation of Gravity originally published in the May 22, 1943, issue of Liberty magazine). Though Walsh died in 1975, he received posthumous credit for this script. Release Flubber made $93 million in the United States and $85 million in other countries for a total of $178 million. Flubber was first released on VHS and Laserdisc on April 21, 1998. The DVD was released on June 16, 1998, with the film's original theatrical trailer as a bonus feature. Reception The film holds a 24% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews; the average rating is 5.3/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"With its overactive focus on special effects and tiresome slapstick, Flubber squanders the immense talent of its cast and crew.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 37/100 (generally unfavorable reviews) based on 19 reviews.

The notional value of one contract is 50 times the value of the S&P; 500 stock index; thus, for example, on June 20, 2018, the S&P; 500 cash index closed at 2,767.32, making each E-mini contract a $138,366 bet. History and structure The contract was introduced by the CME on September 9, 1997, after the value of the existing S&P; contract (then valued at 500 times the index, or over $500,000 at the time) became too large for many small traders. The E-Mini quickly became the most popular equity index futures contract in the world. The original (\\"big\\") S&P; contract was subsequently split 2:1, bringing it to 250 times the index. Hedge funds often prefer trading the E-Mini over the big S&P; since the older (\\"big\\") contract still uses the open outcry pit trading method, with its inherent delays, versus the all-electronic Globex system for the E-mini. The current average daily implied volume for the E-mini is over $100 billion, far exceeding the combined traded dollar volume of the underlying 500 stocks.CME Group - daily trading volumes, cmegroup.com.NYSE - total daily trading dollar volume, nyxdata.com.NASDAQ total daily trading dollar volume, nasdaqtrader.com. Following the success of this product, the exchange introduced the E-mini NASDAQ-100 contract, at one fifth of the original NASDAQ-100 index based contract, and many other \\"mini\\" products geared primarily towards small speculators, as opposed to large hedgers. In June 2005 the exchange introduced a yet smaller product based on the S&P;, with the underlying asset being 100 shares of the highly-popular SPDR exchange-traded fund. However, due to the different regulatory requirements, the performance bond (or \\"margin\\") required for one such contract is almost as high as that for the five times larger E-Mini contract. The product never became popular, with volumes rarely exceeding 10 contracts a day. The E-Mini contract trades from Sunday to Friday 5:00pm ‚Äì 4:00pm (Chicago Time/CT) with a 15-minute trading halt from 3:15pm to 3:30pm CT. From 4:00pm to 5:00pm there's a daily maintenance period.

He succeeded Alfred Milner as private secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Goschen in 1889. He later served overseas as undersecretary for finance in Egypt from 1895 to 1899. His final role was as financial advisor to Lord Curzon, Governor-General of India in 1899. During 1899, he accepted an offer from the financier John Pierpont Morgan of full partnership in the London branch of his firm, J. S. Morgan & Co., where he remained until his death in 1905. He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.

The first president, Machado de Assis, declared its foundation on December 15, 1896, with the by-laws being passed on January 28, 1897. On July 20 of the same year, the academy started its operation. According to its statutes, it is the pre-eminent Portuguese council for matters pertaining to the Portuguese language. The academy is considered the foremost institution devoted to the Portuguese language in Brazil. Its prestige and technical qualification gives it paramount authority in Brazilian Portuguese, even though it is not a public institution and no law grants it oversight over the language. The academy's main publication in this field is the Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language (Vocabul√°rio Ortogr√°fico da L√≠ngua Portuguesa) which has five editions. The Vocabulary is prepared by the academy's Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the Vocabulary, it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese. Since its beginning and to this day, the academy is composed of 40 members, known as the \\"immortals\\". These members are chosen from among citizens of Brazil who have published works or books with recognized literary value. The position of \\"immortal\\" is awarded for the lifetime. New members are admitted by a vote of the academy members when one of the \\"chairs\\" become vacant. The chairs are numbered and each has a Patron: the Patrons are 40 great Brazilian writers that were already dead when the academy was founded; the names of the Patrons were chosen by the Founders as to honour them post mortem by assigning patronage over a chair. Thus, each chair is associated with its current holder, her or his predecessor, the original Founder who occupied it in the first place, and also with a Patron. The academicians use formal gala gilded uniforms with a sword (the uniform is called \\"fard√£o\\") when participating in official meetings at the academy. The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language; it is charged with publishing an official dictionary of the language. Its rulings, however, are not binding on either the public or the government. History , founder of the academy. Foundation The initiative to establish the Academy was taken by and was realised in preparatory meetings that began on December 15, 1896, under the presidency of Machado de Assis. The statuses of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and the membership of the 40 founding fathers were approved at these meetings, on January 28, 1897. On July 20 of the same year, the inaugural session was held at the Pedagogium's facility in the centre of Rio de Janeiro. Without appointed headquarters or financial resources, the solemn meetings of the academy were held at the hall of the Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading, at the premises of the former National Gymnasium and at the Noble Hall of the Ministry of the Interior. The joint sessions were held at the law firm of Rodrigo Oct√°vio, the Academy's first secretary's, at Quitanda Street, 47. In 1904, the academy obtained the left wing of the Brazilian Silogeo, a governmental building that housed other cultural institutions. It remained there until moving to its own headquarters in 1923. Petit Trianon The Petit Trianon in Rio de Janeiro, the seat of the academy since 1923. In 1923, thanks to the initiative of its president at the time, Afr√¢nio Peixoto and of the then-French ambassador, Raymond Conty, the French government donated the French Pavilion building to the Academy. The building had been built for the Independence of Brazil's Centenary International Exposition by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, between 1762 and 1768 and was a replica of the Petit Trianon of Versailles. These facilities have been inscribed as Brazilian Cultural heritage since November 9, 1987 by the State Institute of Cultural Heritage (INEPAC), of the Municipal Secretary of Culture of Rio de Janeiro. To the present day, its halls continue to host regular meetings, solemn sessions, commemorative meetings and inauguration sessions of the new academics, as well as the traditional Thursdays' tea. They are also open to the public for guided tours or for special cultural programs, such as chamber music concerts, book launches, conference cycles and theatre plays. In the buildings' first floor hall stands the decorated marble floor, a French crystal chandelier, a large white porcelain vase from S√®vres and four English bas-reliefs. Inside the building, the following premises stand out: *the Noble Hall, where the solemn sessions take place; *the French Hall, where the new members traditionally remain alone, in reflection; *the Room, where an oil painting on canvas of a collective of nineteenth-century writers and intellectuals, by the painter Rodolfo Amoedo, is depicted; *the Hall of the Founders, decorated with period furniture and paintings by Candido Portinari; *the Machado de Assis Room, decorated with the writer's desk, books and personal belongings, such as portrait by painter Henrique Bernardelli; *the Hall of Romantic Poets, which holds bronze busts of Castro Alves, Fagundes Varela, Gon√ßalves Dias, Casimiro de Abreu and √Ålvares de Azevedo, by Brazilian-Mexican sculptor . On the second floor, one can find the Sessions Room, the Library the Tea Room. The Tea Room is the academics' meeting point before the Plenary Session, on Thursdays. The Library is used by scholars and researchers and holds a collection of Manuel Bandeira. Dictatorship The Dictator Get√∫lio Vargas being invested as member of the academy in 1943. During periods like the Vargas' totalitarian dictatorship or the Brazilian military government, the academy's neutrality in choosing proper members dedicated to the literary profession was compromised with the election of politicians with few or no contributions to literature, such as ex-president and dictator Get√∫lio Vargas in 1943.JORGE, Fernando. A Academia do Fard√£o e da Confus√£o: a Academia Brasileira de Letras e os seus 'Imortais' mortais. S√£o Paulo: Gera√ß√£o Editorial, 1999. The Academy is also accused of not having defended culture expression and freedom of speech during both Vargas' Era and during the Military dictatorship. Both of these ruling periods imposed heavy censorship on Brazilian culture, including Brazilian literature. Characteristic According to its statuses, the Academy aims to promote the \\"culture of the national language\\". It comprises 40 effective and perpetual members, known as \\"immortals\\". These members are Brazilian citizens with published works of relevant literary value. Besides these members, the Academy also comprises 20 correspondent members. All members go through a solemn session, in which dress the Academy's official garment for the first time. During the ceremony, the new member makes a speech remembering her or his predecessor and all previous members that occupied the chair. The Academy, which was a traditionally male institution, elected its first female member on November 4, 1977 ‚Äì the novelist Rachel de Queiroz. This groundbreaking election of the novelist opened the path for other female members. The academy now accounts for four women members (10% of its total membership), one of which, N√©lida Pi√±on, served as president in 1996‚Äì97. Nowadays The writer Fernando Henrique Cardoso, ex-President of Brazil, taking possession as a member of the academy in 2013. Thanks to revenues over $4 million a year, the academy is financially stable. It owns a skyscraper with 28 floors (Pal√°cio Austreg√©silo de Athayde) in the centre of Rio, which the academy rents for office space, generating 70% of its current revenue. The rest comes from rental of other buildings, which were inherited from book editor , in 1917, and from other financial investments. This comfortable situation allows the payment of a \\"jeton\\" to each academician. The academy annually awards several literary prizes: *the Pr√™mio Machado de Assis, the most important literature prize in the country, awarded for lifework; *the ABL prizes for poetry, fiction, drama, essays, history of the literature and for children's literature; *the Jos√© Lins do Rego prize, an extraordinary commemorative prize awarded in 2001 *the Afonso Arinos prize, an extraordinary commemorative prize awarded in 2005. The academy also publishes a literary periodical, the Brazilian Review (Revista Brasileira), with quarterly editions. Orthographic Vocabulary Standing: Rodolfo Amoedo, Artur Azevedo, Sousa's English, Bilac, Ver√≠ssimo, Bandeira, Filinto de Almeida, Passos, Magalh√£es, Bernardelli, Rodrigo Octavio, Peixoto; seated: Jo√£o Ribeiro, Machado, L√∫cio de Mendon√ßa and Silva Ramos. The academy's main publication in this field is the Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language (Vocabul√°rio Ortogr√°fico da L√≠ngua Portuguesa) of which there are five editions. The Vocabulary is prepared by the academy's Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the Vocabulary, it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese. The Orthographic Vocabulary, however, is not a dictionary, as it contains words and their grammatical categories, but not the definition or meaning of the words listed. Thus, unlike the French Academy, the Royal Spanish Academy and other foreign institutions dedicated to the care of a national language, the Brazilian Academy of Letters hasn't published an official dictionary. It has, however, published a School Dictionary of the Portuguese Language (Dicion√°rio Escolar da L√≠ngua Portuguesa), with students as its target customers, in 2009. The academy does plan to publish a full and official Dictionary. For the time being, however, other dictionaries such as the Aur√©lio and the Houaiss remain more prestigious than the School Dictionary, in spite of the fact that the latter is sometimes marketed by booksellers as the \\"ABL's Dictionary\\", due to its being authored by the academy. Both the Houaiss and the Aur√©lio Dictionaries, however, were first compiled by members of the academy Ant√¥nio Houaiss and Aur√©lio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira, respectively. The preparation of an official dictionary of the Portuguese language is a stated goal of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.

The company is headquartered in Farmers Branch, Texas, in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metropolitan area. Its first location opened in Abilene, Texas in 1967. The food chain has locations in Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama and Texas. As of September 3, 2019 there was around 150 units in operation. History Taco Bueno was founded in 1967 by Bill R. Waugh, an art graduate from Abilene Christian University. The first store was located in Abilene, Texas. In 1981, British food manufacturer Unigate paid $32.5 million to acquire Taco Bueno. In 1996, Taco Bueno was sold to Carl's Jr.'s franchisor CKE Restaurants. In 2001, the private investment group Jacobson Partners purchased the chain for $72.5 million to help aid CKE Restaurants in a debt battle. On August 10, 2005, Palladium Equity Partners announced the purchase of Taco Bueno from Jacobson Partners. At the same time, John Miller was appointed CEO of Taco Bueno. In 2011, Ed Lambert became CEO of Taco Bueno, LP., followed by Mike Roper in 2015. In fall 2015, Taco Bueno announced its first delivery expansion collaboration with mobile app Tapingo. In early December 2015, Taco Bueno was purchased by TPG Growth, a division of the Fort Worth private equity firm TPG Capital. On April 28, 2017, season eight, episode seven of the CBS show Undercover Boss, debuted with the CEO of Taco Bueno going into the field to several Taco Bueno locations. As of April 2018, Mike Roper who had left in late 2017, was replaced as CEO by Omar Janjua, who subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 6, 2018 for reorganization and continued operation, and also agreed to be acquired by Dallas-based Sun Holdings, which already owned or controlled over 800 various other fast food franchise locations, for an undisclosed amount. An affiliate of Sun Holdings,Taco Supremo assumed Taco Bueno's outstanding debt and supplied $10 million in fresh working capital to reorganize and revitalize the business. On January 15, 2019, Taco Bueno emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In mid-June 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the chain opened its first Houston location in Katy.

He is recognized chiefly for his 1935 rescue and subsequent 20-year presidency and proprietorship of Algoma Steel. Early life Dunn was born in the village of St. Peter's, now amalgamated into Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada. His father owned a shipbuilding company whose fortunes had been all but wiped out by the sharp decline in the demand for wooden ships, and died when he fell into the harbour when James was an infant. His widowed mother, who was a particularly devout member of St. Luke's Presbyterian church, raised him on her meager earnings as a telegraph clerk. The bereft family also had help from the Fergusons, owners of a large farm, where his mother exchanged household duties for room and board. In his posthumous biography, boyhood and lifelong friend Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook remarks on Dunn's exposure to the Shorter Catechism and the creed of John Knox through his mother's devotion. Specifically, Beaverbrook mentions the responses to Questions 74 and 75 as formative influences on the young Dunn. From childhood, James Dunn was a voracious reader with an excellent memory. After completing his schooling, he left home to find employment and for a time he worked as a deckhand for an American shipping company on Lake Michigan. After this, he made his way to the east coast where he was employed by a manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts. However, before long he returned home where a job as a clerk at the law firm of George Gilbert, where he worked alongside Richard Bedford Bennett, led him to the decision to apply to Dalhousie University Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The small amount of money he had been able to save was not nearly enough to cover his education costs and Dunn worked at a variety of part-time jobs to pay his way through university, including a position in the university library. He graduated in 1898, then worked as a lawyer in Halifax before setting up a law practice in Edmonton, Alberta. Within a short time, Dunn was drawn to the booming economy of Montreal, Quebec where he landed a position with one of the city's prominent law firms. The stockbroker James Dunn became involved in the legal aspects for underwriting activities for companies being listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange and in 1902 he established the J.H. Dunn & Co. stock brokerage company. With $20,000.00 borrowed from his father-in-law, he acquired a seat on the stock exchange. Canadian business at the time was still heavily dependent on investment money from the British financial markets and Dunn became an expert at raising foreign capital for the underwriting of securities as well as selecting the right places to invest. Articulate, outspoken, and with a personality that commanded respect, Dunn had already made contacts with a number of influential people, including a number of railroad executives, one of the most powerful group of entrepreneurs of the day. As a stockbroker, Dunn's company put together a stock issue for William Van Horne, the former president of Canadian Pacific Railway. Van Horne had invested in the Cuba Railroad Company and wanted to raise capital for his \\"Havana Electric Company\\" venture. Already a close friend of fellow New Brunswickers, Max Aitken (the future Lord Beaverbrook) and a bright young lawyer named Richard Bennett, Dunn's brokerage work led to even more business connections with some of the elite of corporate Canada, including George Alexander Drummond, Henry Pellatt and the up-and-coming Izaak Walton Killam. As well, he would become a friend and admirer of the very successful American engineer-turned-entrepreneur, Frederick Stark Pearson. However, the London financial markets were the centre of the economic universe and encouraged by Pearson, in 1905 James Dunn made the decision to take up residency in London. There he ran a new merchant bank in partnership with the Swiss investment dealer, C.L. Fischer, all the while working in conjunction with his Montreal brokerage. At a time of rapid development in mechanized industry, as a result of large hydro-electric projects, shrewd investments, underwritings and stock promotions, James Dunn was soon a wealthy man. Dunn's brokerage house underwrote Pearson's ventures and sufficient capital was raised to allow Pearson to create a massive business empire that included the S√£o Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company in Brazil, the Mexican North Western Railway, the Mexican Tramway Company, and the Mexican Light and Power Company in Mexico, the British American Nickel Company in Canada and the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company. All was not easy and as a director of the Sovereign Bank in Canada that fell victim to the stock market crash of 1907, he experienced severe financial difficulties. Added to this, mismanagement kept hidden by the officers running his Montreal brokerage house, one of whom committed suicide when his discrepancies were revealed, caused Dunn more financial grief. In 1913, his partner Fischer disappeared and went to ground leaving him with monstrous debts, as their firm was a partnership, not a limited liability vehicle, but he managed courageously and with help from his creditors to cover them all. Nine years later, Dunn forgave Fischer when the latter was \\"in virtual destitution\\", even to the point of giving him a job. At the height of the Great War in 1915, his associate Pearson was killed when the Germans sank the RMS Lusitania. Despite these setbacks, he would quickly recoup and go on to become a multi- millionaire. It is reported that Dunn partnered with the Belgian financier Alfred Loewenstein in several business ventures, the duo emerging with more than ¬£1,000,000 profit from their 1920s investment in British Celanese alone. Dunn's close friendship with Max Aitken continued after the wealthy New Brunswicker also chose to live in England. Still very much in touch with his roots, after a 1911 fire destroyed the bells of Christ Church Cathedral in Fredericton, James Dunn donated the replacements for the original 1849 five- ton bells. The First World War provided him with a number of business opportunities and to the ability to serve Britain. For his World War I efforts, he was created a baronet in the 1921 New Year Honours. During his lifetime Dunn became a major industry leader rivaling even the Rothschilds as a central figure in British finance. Although he lived primarily in England during his stockbroking years and maintained a villa in France, Dunn frequently traveled to Canada to spend time at his fishing camp on the Nigadoo River not far from his birthplace. Algoma Steel The Algoma Works as they appeared in 1905, three years before Dunn became involved in the corporation. A number of Sir James Dunn's Canadian investments were in Northern Ontario mining ventures and he began a business relationship with Algoma Steel, a company in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Founded by Francis Clergue, Algoma Steel had been taken over by Philadelphia, Pennsylvania investors after its 1903 bankruptcy. Overly dependent on the production of rail tracks, the steel company suffered through numerous problems and in 1908 Dunn had partnered with a British group of investors who included Robert Fleming to cooperate with an American consortium to form the Lake Superior Investment Co. to acquire Algoma Steel. Although Dunn's role at the time was important, he was still only a minority player and the American investors had control. Algoma Steel went through years of ups and downs, marked by a lack of strong leadership, and in 1935 the company was again forced into receivership, and with it went the city: a plaintive cry for help from the mayor to Dunn details the ordeal. This time, at the age of 61,cbhf.ca: \\"Sir James Dunn\\" Dunn engineered a takeover so that he became the sole controlling shareholder thereby allowing him to take the tough but necessary reorganization measures to restore profitability to the steel maker. To accomplish this, he raised capital by negotiating bank loans, selling his beloved art collection and taking stock instead of income. As Algoma Steel's president and chairman of its board of directors, he successfully turned it into one of the largest steel mills of the day and for more than twenty years guided the fortunes of the company he would eventually make into one of the most profitable producers in Canada. However, all was not sweetness and light for the first several years of his presidency: for example, in July 1937, the Bank of Montreal called in its loans‚Äîin a repetition of events that had destroyed Algoma under Clergue in 1907‚Äîbut Morris W. Wilson of the Royal Bank stepped in to carry the day. As Minister for Aircraft Production in wartime Britain, Beaverbrook would appoint Wilson in 1940 to manage his North American ministry. Dunn's intestinal fortitude is responsible for his claim to at least two significant innovations in the industry. Hematite ore was the foundation of the steel industry in 1935, and it was indeed exploited by Algoma. Next to a hematite deposit owned by Algoma was a mountain more than 1,000 feet high but it contained a low-grade ore called siderite. The experts unanimously declared that Dunn, who wanted to exploit this mountain of siderite, was mad. Nowhere else in the world was an ore of this grade in commercial use. In the early months of 1939, a pilot process seemed to indicate success, but in order to be ascertained it would require full production. Dunn carried the investment through to the end and a positive result was his reward. The next innovation which Dunn developed into production at Algoma was then known as the \\"Sink-Float process\\". The need for innovation was due to the exhaustion of ore supplies at the Helen mine. The process, which had been established at Broken Hill Proprietary by Guillaume Daniel Delprat at the turn of the century because of a similar exhaustion, had been tried once or twice in the US but on ore quite different from that at the Victoria. No Canadian mines had developed this technique; no large-scale equipment was available for experimentation and so the pilot plant would be uncertain and expensive. The gamble was a success, and Dunn pioneered again. The Victoria mine was able for a time from 1945 to supplant the Helen mine, while the latter changed from an open-pit to, in 1949, an underground operation.cityssm.on.ca: \\"Mining in Algoma\\" During the Second World War, the company benefited from the huge demand for steel by the military; however, financial calls from his associates, who needed or wanted to liquidate positions as a result of the French collapse, bedeviled Dunn, who retained in the end his Algoma shares and nothing else. Even then, he mortgaged them to his stockbroker friends. The benefit from a subsidized price for sinter, granted at the corporate nadir of 1935 by the provincial government of Mitchell Hepburn, was cancelled in 1942 by the Conant government. At times Dunn's relationship with the federal government minister in charge of the war effort, C. D. Howe was difficult; Beaverbrook relates a story in which he had to calm Winston Churchill because Howe or Mackenzie King, in the dark days of October 1940, had shredded Dunn's reputation. Howe threatened Dunn on 26 October 1940 with effective expropriation under the War Measures Act and the National Resources Mobilization Act: the government might obtain control of \\"trading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture\\" works, and require him \\"to place [himself], [his] services and [his] property at the disposal of His Majesty in right of Canada, as may be deemed necessary or expedient for securing the public safety, the defence of Canada, the maintenance of public order, or the efficient prosecution of the war, or for maintaining supplies or services essential to the life of the community.\\" A letter to Churchill from Beaverbrook, who at the time was in the former's Ministry, was enough to secure the person and property of Dunn, but his health suffered ill effects, as presently will be related. The week after Dunn had a major surgery, Howe struck again. This time, Howe telephoned on 12 April 1943 to Wilson at the Royal Bank: if Howe's steel experts (likely the same experts Dunn had wrongfooted in the siderite development) were right, either Dunn must stand down from his Chairmanship of Algoma, or he would be forced to expropriate. Many precedents had accumulated over three years, both in the UK and Canada. But Wilson and his Royal Bank stood firm and refused to countenance this extreme. Wilson instead asked for disclosure of the government file, and Howe's bluff was shot. By August 1943, a vice-president at Algoma was removed and the way forward was clear. Dunn and Howe later became friends, and Howe even acquired a summer manor next door to the Dunn estate, Dayspring, at the seaside resort of St. Andrews in New Brunswick. Howe even served as an Executor of Dunn's estate. It was during the war that Dunn had two major health crises brought on by old age. These required hospital stays of 17 days and five weeks respectively. He and Christoforides, who throughout was by his side day and night, succeeded by artful means in keeping both stays from the press. Shortly after the end of the first bout with adversity, he married her. Canada Steamship Lines The SS Norgoma was launched in 1950, one year prior to the Dunn takeover of CSL. In 1944, Dunn was invited to serve on the board of directors of Canada Steamship Lines (CSL), whose ore carriers were an important transporter of ore and coal for the Algoma Steel plant which operated under a geographical disadvantage to its more southerly competitors. Unhappy over CSL's policy of prioritizing service to his steel mill's competition on the lower section of the Great Lakes, with backing from a Winnipeg, Manitoba businessman plus the Montreal publishing magnate, John Wilson McConnell, James Dunn quietly set about buying up shares of the shipping line. He secured a line of credit from the Bank of Montreal and through Earle McLaughlin at the Royal Bank of Canada he raised a war chest that saw him gain effective control of Canada Steamship Lines in 1951. This was followed up by the acquisition of another shipping line with cargo vessels capable of cost-effective delivery of Algoma Steel's products to the southern markets. Within a few years, Dunn was exporting iron ore from his Algoma Ore Properties Limited to American buyers. Art collection One of seventeen portraits by Sir William Orpen, which were commissioned by Dunn, of the settlors of the Treaty of Versailles at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919: William Ferguson Massey, at the time Premier of New Zealand. Sir James Dunn had been an avid art collector for many years. He was introduced to this pastime by van Horne in 1908, and purchased three paintings by Goya before 1911, and a Velazquez by 1912. Dunn was pained when forced by the Fischer debacle to liquidate his art collection in 1914. The transaction included 13 paintings and included Holbein, Bronzino, Manet and El Greco. Dunn commissioned seventeen portraits of participants at the Versailles Conference by Sir William Orpen, amongst whom were Woodrow Wilson and George Barnes. At the height of the depression, commissioned another dozen, this time of his friends like Lord Greenwood, Lord Castlerosse and Lord Beaverbrook, by a down- on-his-luck Sickert. In the late 1940s, he and Christofor, Lady Dunn, developed a friendship with Salvador Dal√≠. The artist went on to paint the portraits of the couple ( Gala-Salvador Dal√≠ Foundation)( Gala-Salvador Dal√≠ Foundation) which are now on permanent display at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick along with one of Dal√≠'s greatest pieces, the \\"Santiago el Grande.\\" As well, the art gallery received other works of art that the Dunns collected including a 1650 painting by Jakob van Loo titled \\"A Gentleman\\" and the Augustus John picture, \\"Dorelia\\" as well as John's portrait of Sir James Dunn. Personal Dayspring, Dunn's home at St. Andrews. In 1901, James Dunn was married to Gertrude Paterson Price, the daughter of a prosperous Quebec City lumber dealer. They had five children before divorcing in 1926: #Mona Dunn (c. 1902-1928). Widely described as 'the most beautiful girl in England' she became at 17 when he met her in Paris in 1919 the mistress of Lord Birkenhead, later Lord Chancellor in the Coalition Cabinet of David Lloyd George.spectator.co.uk: \\"That crooked charmer, Smith\\", 26 Nov 1983, Page 26 She married in 1925 Edmund Tattersall, a war hero of the 5th Dragoon Guards with whom she had in May 1927 a daughter, Monica. Her portrait by William Orpen hangs in the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, and may be viewed on their web-site. Her early death on 19 December 1928 from peritonitis was a crushing blow to her father. It became the subject of an occasional poem by Shane Leslie, which was published by the Ashendene Press. #Sir Philip Gordon Dunn, 2nd Baronet Dunn (1905‚Äì1976), who was father of two daughters: the author Nell Dunn, and Serena Dunn, later Lady Rothschild. #Kathleen Mabel Dunn (1907-1969) #Joan Molesworth Dunn (1908-1982) who married 1928 (and was divorced 1 November 1929 by) Hubert Duggan, an MP, and stepson of Lord Curzon. Upon her divorce she lost custody of an infant child born on 5 August 1929.\\"Decree Nisi For Peeress's Son\\", The Times, 2 November 1929, p. 4. She next married her lover Anthony Jenkinson, who subsequently committed suicide in October 1935.\\"Death of Mr. Anthony Jenkinson\\", The Times, 30 October 1935, p. 11. She married last in 1943, Charles Dutton, 7th Baron Sherborne.http://www.thepeerage.com/p5731.htm #Brigid Leila Dunn (1919-1991) Following the divorce from his first wife in 1926, Sir James Dunn married Irene Clarice Richards, the former wife of Francis Archibald Kelhead Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry. The 1928 death of his daughter Mona Dunn from his first marriage sent him into a state of depression and for a time he thought about cutting back on his business activities and returning home to his native New Brunswick. However, in 1929, his new wife gave birth to a daughter, Anne, who lifted his spirits a great deal. Anne Dunn grew up to be an artist, studying under Henry Moore and in Paris, France with Fernand L√©ger and at the Acad√©mie Julian. Nevertheless, Dunn and his second wife divorced in 1942 following which he married his long- time personal secretary, Marcia Anastasia Christoforides. Thirty-six years his junior, \\"Christofor\\" as she was nicknamed, was very bright, intensely loyal, and a devoted partner. James Dunn would seek her input on most every business matter for the rest of his life. Although a workaholic, enjoyed luxury and maintained an active social life. He was one of the first businessman to acquire a Douglas DC-3 as a private business aircraft, in which he traveled frequently between his homes in Europe and Canada. He kept a vast wine cellar from the vineyards of France and frequented New York City, especially Broadway where he was a friend of television host Ed Sullivan. It was for his service in the Great War that Dunn was knighted in the 1921 New Year's List of Honours. Dunn functioned as a sort of emissary for two Prime Ministers. He first responded when Asquith asked him (and members of the Asquith family) in the autumn of 1914 to write a report on the Army hospital service behind the lines in France. Next, he negotiated with Jacob Borreson an agreement that all of the nickel mined by the Kristiansand Nickel Company of Norway would be sent to Canada for smelting and refining. The British government obtained a virtual blockade on the supply of nickel to Germany, which was forced to purchase nickel from afar (with all the risk entailed by a distant supply) at inflated \\"spot\\" prices. Lloyd George requested a situation report from Dunn on the disrupted supply of foodstuffs from Norway, Sweden and Denmark; Dunn's plans for increasing the supply were sound and worked admirably in practice. In 1949, Dunn was made a King's Counsel in Quebec by Maurice Duplessis. He was a made a member of the bar in five provinces. On 15 August 1950, he was made a Freeman of the City of Bathurst, and in November 1954 the same honour was bestowed by St. Andrews, New Brunswick.St. Croix Courier, 4 Nov 1954 The University of New Brunswick, Dalhousie University, St. Francis Xavier University, Laval University and Queen's University all granted him honorary degrees. Sault Sainte Marie awarded him the Freedom of the City. In January 1956 at the age of 81, after a heart ailment of less than a week Dunn died at his home in St. Andrews, New Brunswick.St. Croix Courier, 5 Jan 1956 In commemoration of his birthday, in the same year, Lady Dunn privately published The Ballad of a Bathurst Boy: 1874-1956, a celebration of her late husband's life in verse. Printed by the University of New Brunswick Press in Fredericton, NB, it was sent to friends and family of Dunn. His widow sold the 10,000 acre camp he had acquired near his birthplace the next year. One source places this parcel on Dunn Road near Allardville, New Brunswick. Lord Beaverbrook (Max Aitken) published in 1961 a detailed biography of his late friend, titled Courage: The Story of Sir James Dunn. The most complete telling of Dunn's life and business career is available in Duncan McDowall's, Steel at the Sault: Francis H. Clergue, Sir James Dunn and the Algoma Steel Corporation 1901-1956 (Toronto:University of Toronto Press, hb 1984 & pb 1988). At the time of his death, Dunn was president of Algoma Ore Properties Ltd, Cannelton Coal and Coke Company, Fiborn Limestone Company, and Canadian Furnace Company. Legacy The Sir James Dunn building at Dalhousie University. As a result of the very substantial taxes on the estate left by Sir James Dunn and Nova Scotia's Izaak Walton Killam who had died the year before in 1955, the government of Canada was able to create and provide an endowment for the Canada Council for the Arts. Dunn also left a very significant estate to his last wife who fulfilled his wishes and made numerous contributions to charitable, cultural, and educational works. Perhaps Dunn's most significant legacy was the discovery of a productive ore near Bathurst, which was exploited by as many as 700 men for half a century from 1953:canadianminingjournal.com: \\"CLOSURE: Brunswick mine closes on a high note\\", 30 Apr 2013 One of the annual scholarships, that were provided by Dunn in 1947 to the University of New Brunswick, was awarded to a Master's student by the name of A.B. Baldwin, who discovered the ore as his thesis work and thus \\"greatly enlarged the bounds of provincial prosperity\\".max1049.ca: \\"Plaque Honouring Local Man's Contribution to Bathurst Mining Camp to be Installed\\"unbhistory.lib.unb.ca: \\"James Hamet Dunn\\" In fact, Dunn had specified in the deed that the scholarship was to be awarded for only New Brunswick geological work; Baldwin, who was originally interested in samples from Quebec's North Shore, was led by the Dunn gift to examine ore from New Brunswick. As used here, the James Hamet Dunn legacy includes not only the bequests of his estate, but also significant charitable gifts that he made during his lifetime, and may no longer exist. Two examples from his hometown suffice to demonstrate his essence: *The James Hamet Dunn Hospital in West Bathurst, New Brunswick was consumed by flames in February 1953 after more than forty years' existence. The hospital iniated in northern New Brunswick a school for nurses. *In May 1931, the Our Lady of Lourdes of the Lady Dunn Institution sanatorium for the care of tuberculosis patients was opened north of Bathurst. It was managed by the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, and later demolished to become the state-financed Chaleur Regional Hospital. A number of foundations, buildings and academic Chairs bear (or bore) his name including: *the Sir James Dunn Jubilee Scholarship at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia; *the Sir James Dunn Wildlife Research Fund of the University of New Brunswick; *the Sir James Dunn Residence at the University of New Brunswick, Saint John campus *at Saint Thomas University, Fredericton, New Brunswick: **the Sir James Dunn Hall and **the Sir James Dunn Student Lounge * at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia: ** a Chair in Law; **the Sir James Dunn Law Library,libraries.dal.ca: \\"Sir James Dunn Law Library\\" **the Sir James Dunn Building for Physics & Atmospheric Science,library.dal.ca: \\"The Buildings of Dalhousie University - Sir James Dunn Building\\" and **the Sir James Dunn Theatre at the Arts Center;symphonynovascotia.ca: \\"Sir James Dunn Theatre\\" * at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick: **the Sir James Dunn Chair in Geology and **the Sir James Dunn Building for the computer science, mathematics and physics departments; *the Sir James Dunn Animal Welfare Centre at the University of Prince Edward Island; * at Queen's University: **a Chair in mining.

(1632) Gabriel Sagard, O.M.R., (fl. 1614-1636) was a French lay brother and Recollect friar, a reform branch of the Order of Friars Minor known for their strict poverty. He was among the first Christian missionaries to New France, and is notable for his writings on the colony and on the Hurons (or Wendat). Sagard's origins, and the dates of his birth and death are obscure. Some historians say he was christened Th√©odat, others believe that Th√©odat was his religious name, which, however, is less likely as his signature on his works is under the name of Gabriel (see illustration). Sagard arrived in New France 28 June 1623. He was sent to accompany Father Nicholas Viel, where they joined four other members of their Order who had been there since 1615, led by Father Denis Jamet. In August, Sagard traveled to a Huron village on the southern shore of Lake Huron, where he began his missionary work and study of the Huron language. In July 1624, he was ordered by his superiors to return to France. All record of him ends some time around 1636. Sagard seems to have either left the Order or he may simply have died while still a friar. Sagard worked with the Hurons. Sagard is remembered for his writings on New France and the Hurons-Wyandot people, ' (Paris, 1632). His ' (1636) included a revised and expanded ' and ' (Dictionary of the Huron Language). An English translation of ' by historian George M. Wrong was published by the Champlain Society in 1939 as Sagard's long journey to the country of the Hurons. It is available online at the Champlain Society website. An authoritative edition of the dictionary of the Huron languageSagard‚Äôs Dictionary of Huron was edited by John Steckley and published in 2009.

Coman worked at Wellesley College for 35 years as an instructor, professor, and dean. Believing that the field of political economy could be harnessed to solve the pressing social problems of the day, Coman created new courses in the discipline. She specialized in research and teaching about the development of the American West, and British and American industrialism. In her work, she criticized capitalism and supported the labor movement. She wrote the first history of American industry as well as the first paper published in The American Economic Review. She was the first female statistics professor in the US and the only woman co-founder of the American Economics Association. Throughout her life, she traveled widely to conduct her economics research. A social activist, Coman supported the settlement movement and the labor movement. She shared a home with poet Katharine Lee Bates for 25 years, and the two women often traveled together. Coman died of breast cancer in 1915. Wellesley College created the Katharine Coman Professorship of Industrial History in her honor.  Early life  Coman was born on 23 November 1857, to Martha Ann Seymour Coman (1826‚Äì1911) and Levi Parsons Coman (1826‚Äì1889) in Newark, Ohio.Norley, Katharine. (2006). \\"Coman, Katharine (1857‚Äì1915),\\" p. 166 in The biographical dictionary of American economists, Volume I, A-I, edited by Ross B. Emmett. Thoemmes Continuum: London. Her mother had graduated from an Ohio female seminary, and her father had been educated at Hamilton College, and thus Coman received much of her early education at home. She attended the University of Michigan for two years, left college to teach in Ottawa, Illinois for two years, and then returned to university. She earned a Bachelor of Philosophy (PhB) degree in 1880, one of only a handful of women to do so. She was heavily influenced by the work of John Stuart Mill, which is evident in her later work as economist and historian. Coman attended lectures about socialism while traveling in London. Later in her career, she was influenced by Alfred Marshall (1890), Francis Amasa Walker (1883), and social Darwinism. While at the University of Michigan, Coman studied under Professors Charles Kendall Adams of the German Historical School; James Burrill Angell, then president of the university; and Henry Carter Adams, a renowned statistician.  Wellesley College  Etching of Wellesley College circa 1881 After earning her PhB, she joined the faculty at Wellesley College, a newly established private college for women. Angell recommended her for the position, noting her talent for teaching. She first taught English rhetoric, and in 1881 became an instructor in history.Bates, Katharine Lee. (1922). Yellow Clover: A Book of Remembrance. New York: E. P. Dutton & Company. In 1883, she was promoted to full professor of history. Because Coman believed that economics could address social problems, she urged the Wellesley administration to offer courses on the subject, and in 1883, she taught the college's first political economy class. Coman was the first American woman to teach statistics and Wellesley became the only American women's college to offer statistics courses before 1900. Coman developed and taught several new courses in economics, history, and rhetoric, including Statistical Study of Economic Problems, Industrial History of the United States, and Conservation of Our Natural Resources, all framed by sociological insights related to social justice. To teach students about the practicality of applying economic theory to real world economic and social problems, Coman escorted her students on field trips to Boston's tenement houses, labor union meetings, factories, and sweatshops. In 1885, at the age of 28, she became professor of history and economics. That same year, she turned down the offer of a position as dean of women at the University of Michigan, stating that she preferred to remain at Wellesley and continue teaching. She was acting dean from 1899 to 1900, during which time she established a new department of economics and sociology, becoming its head in 1900. According to historian Melinda Ponder, Coman was a popular teacher.Ponder, Melinda M. (2017). From Sea to Shining Sea: Katharine Lee Bates. Chicago, IL: Windy City Press. Two of her students, Helen Frances Page Bates and Helen Laura Sumner Woodbury, were among the first American women to earn PhDs in economics. Woodbury is recognized as an important historian of labor and a noted economist, while Helen Bates became a noted social worker. She retired from full-time teaching at Wellesley in 1913, becoming professor emeritus. In writing about the farewell dinner held in her honor, the New York Times said: \\"Miss Coman has been so closely associated with the history and development of Wellesley for so long a time that her loss is felt very deeply by the whole college.\\" Coman continued to research and write until her death in 1915. Coman's papers are held by the Wellesley College Archives. In 1921, the college established the Katharine Coman Professorship of Industrial History to honor her service.  Notable works  Coman and Elizabeth Kendall coauthored the 1902 book A Short History of England for School Use based on research that Coman conducted in England between 1886 and 1894. Coman published The Industrial History of the United States in 1910, the first industrial history of the United States. It was reprinted nine times before 1915. Her 1911 article, \\"Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,\\" was the first article published in the newly formed journal The American Economic Review. Her 1912 work Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi was considered by contemporaneous scholars to be her magnum opus, and \\"one of the most important fruits of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\\" The book outlined the economic history of the American West. In this work, Coman describes the historical economic processes that led to the Far West coming under the control of settlers. She found that settlers were more economically successful than explorers, traders, trappers, and indigenous peoples because the settlers built permanent settlements, reproduced at a higher rate, and established networks of collaboration. Settlement movement activist Jane Addams, a close friend, urged Coman to research social insurance programs in Europe in order to establish similar programs in the United States. Coman studied social insurance in England, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden, but poor health prevented her from continuing her research. Her manuscript, \\"Unemployment Insurance: A Summary of European Systems\\" was published after her death in 1915.  Social activism  Coman was passionate about social and economic issues, especially women's education, poverty, immigration, and labor. Throughout her life, she was active in social reform movements, especially the labor movement and the settlement movement. She served as the president of the electoral board and chair of the standing committee of the National College Settlements Association in 1900. Coman organized a group of immigrant women who worked in Boston sweatshops, naming the group an \\"Evening Club for Tailoresses,\\" and attempted to found a tailor shop that could have been an alternative to sweatshops. She assisted in organizing the 1910 Chicago garment workers' strike, which involved 40,000 factory workers. Coman also worked with the Women's Trade Union League. Working with her economist and sociologist friend Emily Greene Balch and other women, Coman co-founded Denison House in 1892, a college women's settlement house located in Boston, serving as its first chair. Denison House provided a center for Boston's labor activists, and is thought to be the first settlement house on the East Coast.  Personal life  Katharine Lee Bates, author of the words to \\"America the Beautiful\\" For 25 years, Coman lived in a \\"Boston marriage\\"Faderman, Lillian. (1999). To Believe in Women: What Lesbians Have Done for America--A History. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. with Wellesley professor and poet Katharine Lee Bates,D'Emilio, John, and Estelle Freedman. (2012). Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America (Third Edition). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. the author of \\"America the Beautiful\\". Such partnerships were so common among Wellesley faculty that they were called \\"Wellesley marriages\\". Coman and Bates shared a house they named \\"the Scarab\\" with Bates' mother, Cornelia, and her sister, Jeannie. The women reportedly enjoyed life together as family.Burgess, Dorothy. (1952). Dream and Deed: The Story of Katharine Lee Bates. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. Coman frequently traveled for her research on economic history; she visited Europe, the American West, Scandinavia, and Egypt. Bates accompanied her on many of these trips. Some scholars believe the two women were a lesbian couple.  Breast cancer and death  Coman first discovered a lump in her left breast in the fall of 1911 and underwent two surgeries in the following months. At the time, medical doctors did not understand the nature of breast cancer, its causes or its treatments, so the prognosis for Coman was poor. Coman died at home in January 1915 at the age of 58. At the time of her death, Coman was working on an industrial history of New England. During Coman's illness, friends of her and Bates‚Äîmany of them also in \\"Wellesley marriages\\"‚Äîtook Coman out for walks and visits, and invited her to stay at their country homes. They prepared meals for Coman and Bates, brought flowers and fresh vegetables, and performed tasks and services to keep Coman's spirits up. Bates chronicled Coman's illness in her diary, noting hospital visits, surgical procedures, and details about Coman's pain and suffering. According to cancer historian Ellen Leopold, in the days after Coman's death, Bates wrote a memorial to her that was designed to be circulated privately among the women's close friends and family. Leopold believes that the book, For Katharine Coman's Family and Innermost Circle of Friends, is the first breast cancer narrative in American literature. Near the end of Coman's life, the two women exchanged loving farewells through reciting poems and psalms to each other. Several years after Coman's death, Bates continued to mourn and to recall Coman's suffering. In 1922, Bates published a book of poems about Coman's illness, Yellow Clover: A Book of Remembrance. The book's title emerged from the fact that the \\"two Katharines,\\" as the women were known, would send each other sprigs of yellow clover as tokens of affection.  Assessment  A review of Coman's book Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land Beyond the Mississippi (1912) in the San Francisco Chronicle stated that \\"the author is one of those new women who have shown what may be accomplished in the way of research by method and industry and a great deal of enthusiasm.\\" In a 1913 review of her book, economist Thomas Nixon Carver praised Coman's narrative style and lively prose. Also writing in 1913, economist Frederic Paxson criticized the book, arguing that there were factual errors and inaccurate citations, and that the data for the book were already widely available in university research libraries. Paxson does credit Coman with having prepared an extensive bibliography and for providing extensive notes.Paxson, Frederic L. (1913). Economic Beginnings of the Far West: How We Won the Land beyond the Mississippi [by] Katharine Coman. The American Historical Review. 4, 821. . The two-volume book is today hailed as a classic and was reprinted twice; Macmillan in 1925, and Kelly in 1969. The University of Michigan \\"Naming Project\\" notes that she was one of the first historians to use local newspaper articles and government documents as primary sources in her teaching and writing. Gerald F. Vaughn, a contemporary economist writing in 2004, proposes that Coman was America's first female institutional economist. Vaughn notes other important facts about Coman that frame her as a pioneer for women academics, including the fact that at the time, the discipline and profession of economics was dominated by men. She was the only woman among the group of economists who founded the American Economic Association in 1885 and she was the first American woman to become a statistics professor. Vaughn notes that her contributions to economics and social history went beyond being the \\"first woman,\\" for example writing the first article to be published in The American Economic Review and authoring the first industrial history of the US. Coman's extensive work on the processes of institutional change in the American West made her an influential industrial historian and The Industrial History of the United States was widely used as a textbook for decades. In 2011, The American Economic Review commemorated its first hundred years by publishing a list of the top twenty articles in the journal's history. Coman's 1911 article \\"Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,\\" published in 1911, was the first article published by the journal and was reprinted in the 2011 issue. The article analyzed water rights, access, and availability. Also in this issue of The American Economic Review, economist Gary D. Libecap noted that Coman's work continued to be relevant, particularly for scholars interested in the economics of climate change. Elinor Ostrom, an American political economist, believes that Coman's article continues to provide \\"insight into the problems of collective action related to irrigation in the American West.\\"  Selected publications = Books  (reprinted 1908, 1911, 1914) * (reprinted in 1906, 1907, 1908; revised 1910; reprinted 1912, 1918, 1973) * (reprinted 1925; 1969)  Articles   Coman, Katharine.

It is located in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Among the Harvard Medical School affiliated institutions, Joslin is unique in its sole focus on diabetes. Joslin has the world's largest team of board- certified physicians treating diabetes and its complications, as well as the largest staff of Certified Diabetes Educators anywhere in the world. Joslin also supports the world's largest diabetes research team with more than 40 faculty investigators and more than 300 researchers. Roberta Herman, M.D., is currently President and CEO of Joslin Diabetes Center. History Joslin Clinic has helped revolutionize the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes, most notably by improving the survival rate of babies born to women with diabetes, developing sight-saving laser surgery, devising treatments to reduce amputation, and uncovering ways to predict who will develop diabetes. It was named after Elliott P. Joslin, an American doctor and pioneer in the study of diabetes. Some notable historic milestones include: * 1949: Priscilla White, M.D., a founding member of Joslin Clinic, introduces the White Classification of Diabetic Pregnancies. This pioneering concept classifies patients according to their level of risk and tailors their treatment protocol accordingly. When Dr. Priscilla White joined Joslin's practice in 1924, only 56 percent of babies born to diabetic mothers survived; 50 years later when she retired, that rate had jumped to more than 90 percent.Dunn, PM.

Clinical services Some of the clinical programs at Joslin include: Beetham Eye Institute: The Beetham uses advanced diagnostics, laser treatment, cataract and retinal surgery, vision rehabilitation, and novel therapies to help preserve the eyesight of diabetic patients. Pediatric Diabetes Section: Joslin has a reputation for pioneering care and support of pediatric patients with diabetes and their families. The pediatric staff includes board-certified endocrinologists, pediatric diabetes nurse educators, pediatric nutritionists, child psychologists, a social worker, and a child life specialist. Nephrology Section: Joslin provides the educational, medical, and emotional support needed to manage all forms of kidney disease, which impacts a significant number of people with diabetes. The goal is to detect, delay, and potentially reverse the effects of diabetes on the kidneys as early as possible. Multicultural Health Clinics: In response to the fact that Latinos and Asian Americans develop diabetes at a much higher rate, Joslin established clinics for these patient populations. They offer culturally sensitive care and bilingual staff. Patient Education Joslin has the largest staff of Certified Diabetes Educators anywhere in the world. Specialists work with patients one-on-one, or through a variety of programs and classes. Educators work as part of the diabetes care team to provide coordinated, sequenced learning activities. Joslin also offers specialty programs in cardiovascular disease, mental health and counseling services, peripheral neuropathy, obesity, insulin pump therapy, diabetes and pregnancy, diabetes and aging, hypoglycemia, sexual function and disorders of the feet. Joslin has a number of initiatives aimed at developing and providing culturally-competent diabetes education, such as the Latino Diabetes Initiative and the Asian American Diabetes Initiative. Research Many important improvements in diabetes care were developed at Joslin. These include recognition that tight blood glucose control can slow or prevent diabetes complications, creation of treatment protocols to enable women with diabetes to have healthy babies, the identification of markers for pre- diabetes, and pioneering laser surgery for diabetic eye disease. Joslin researchers have won awards and recognition from the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Diabetes Association, among many others.

History Osaka D≈çjima Rice Exchange Statue of Godai Tomoatsu in front of the Osaka Securities Exchange The birthplace for futures transactions: D≈çjima Rice Exchange ( The origin of securities exchanges stems from the Edo period, when an exchange for rice and crops was established in Osaka, which at the time was the economic center of Japan. Each prefecture set up its own warehouses in Osaka for shipping & preservation of their rice (to be taxed by the government), and sold to merchants. One of the most famous merchants was \\"Yodoya\\", which was based in the southern part of the Yodoyabashi area. Some other merchants gradually gathered to create one market. This market was called \\"Yodoya-Komeichi\\", and was the first securities exchange in the nation. Later on, this market was moved to D≈çjima in 1697. The so-called \\"D≈çjimakomekaisho\\", was a physical market that traded in rice-tickets or physical rice. In 1716, Cho-gomai transactions were introduced and recognized by the government in 1730 ‚Äî this is said to be the origin of futures transactions in Japan.

Franklin-Nashville Campaign of the American Civil War. Union forces of 3‚Äì5,000 men under Brig. Gen. Robert S. Granger prevented the 39,000 men of the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. John B. Hood from crossing the Tennessee River at Decatur, Alabama. Background John Bell Hood was marching through northern Alabama on his way to an invasion of Union-held Tennessee. His army had departed northwest from the vicinity of Atlanta, Georgia, in late September 1864, hoping their destruction of Union supply lines would lure Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Union army into battle. Sherman pursued Hood as far as Gaylesville, Alabama, but decided to return his army to Atlanta and instead conduct a March to the Sea through Georgia. He gave responsibility for the defense of Tennessee to Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas at Nashville.Eicher, p. 770. Hood departed from Gadsden, Alabama, on October 22, en route to Guntersville, Alabama, where he planned to cross the Tennessee River. However, he later learned from cavalry Brigadier General Phillip Roddey that crossing place was strongly guarded, while Decatur, forty miles west, was said to be \\"lightly guarded\\". Concerned over the possibility of Federal gunboats destroying any pontoon bridge he might deploy, along with the absence of Nathan Bedford Forrest's horsemen to bring him intelligence, Hood changed his course to Decatur.Stephan M. Hood, pp. 92‚Äì93; Kennedy, p. 392; Sword, p. 64. Battle Map of Decatur Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. When Hood arrived at Decatur on October 26, he found a Federal infantry force of 3,000 to 5,000 men defending an entrenched line that included two forts and 1,600 yards of rifle pits; a much heavier force than Roddey had believed. Two Federal gunboats patrolled the river. On October 27, Hood arranged his army as it arrived to encircle Decatur. The next morning, he sent Confederate skirmishers through a dense fog to a ravine within 800 yards of the main fortifications. At about noon, a Federal regiment drove the skirmishers out of the ravine, capturing 125 men. \\"With the soldiers hungry and supplies scarce\\", Hood knew he could not afford the casualties from a full-scale assault and decided to cross the Tennessee River elsewhere. He marched further the west and crossed near Tuscumbia, Alabama, where Muscle Shoals prevented interference by the Federal gunboats.Stephan M. Hood, pp. 93‚Äì94; Jacobson, p. 43; Sword, pp. 64‚Äì65.

It is located at the center of a star schema or a snowflake schema surrounded by dimension tables. Where multiple fact tables are used, these are arranged as a fact constellation schema. A fact table typically has two types of columns: those that contain facts and those that are a foreign key to dimension tables. The primary key of a fact table is usually a composite key that is made up of all of its foreign keys. Fact tables contain the content of the data warehouse and store different types of measures like additive, non additive, and semi additive measures. Fact tables provide the (usually) additive values that act as independent variables by which dimensional attributes are analyzed. Fact tables are often defined by their grain. The grain of a fact table represents the most atomic level by which the facts may be defined. The grain of a sales fact table might be stated as \\"sales volume by day by product by store\\". Each record in this fact table is therefore uniquely defined by a day, product and store. Other dimensions might be members of this fact table (such as location/region) but these add nothing to the uniqueness of the fact records. These \\"affiliate dimensions\\" allow for additional slices of the independent facts but generally provide insights at a higher level of aggregation (a region contains many stores). Example If the business process is sales, then the corresponding fact table will typically contain columns representing both raw facts and aggregations in rows such as: * $12,000, being \\"sales for New York store for 15-Jan-2005\\". * $34,000, being \\"sales for Los Angeles store for 15-Jan-2005\\" * $22,000, being \\"sales for New York store for 16-Jan-2005\\" * $21,000, being \\"average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for Jan-2005\\" * $65,000, being \\"average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for Feb-2005\\" * $33,000, being \\"average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for year 2005\\" \\"Average daily sales\\" is a measurement that is stored in the fact table. The fact table also contains foreign keys from the dimension tables, where time series (e.g. dates) and other dimensions (e.g. store location, salesperson, product) are stored. All foreign keys between fact and dimension tables should be surrogate keys, not reused keys from operational data. Measure types * Additive - measures that can be added across any dimension. * Non-additive - measures that cannot be added across any dimension. * Semi-additive - measures that can be added across some dimensions. A fact table might contain either detail level facts or facts that have been aggregated (fact tables that contain aggregated facts are often instead called summary tables). Special care must be taken when handling ratios and percentage. One good design ruleKimball & Ross - The Data Warehouse Toolkit, 2nd Ed [Wiley 2002] is to never store percentages or ratios in fact tables but only calculate these in the data access tool. Thus only store the numerator and denominator in the fact table, which then can be aggregated and the aggregated stored values can then be used for calculating the ratio or percentage in the data access tool. In the real world, it is possible to have a fact table that contains no measures or facts. These tables are called \\"factless fact tables\\", or \\"junction tables\\". The factless fact tables may be used for modeling many-to-many relationships or for capture timestamps of events. Types of fact tables There are four fundamental measurement events, which characterize all fact tables. ; Transactional :A transactional table is the most basic and fundamental. The grain associated with a transactional fact table is usually specified as \\"one row per line in a transaction\\", e.g., every line on a receipt. Typically a transactional fact table holds data of the most detailed level, causing it to have a great number of dimensions associated with it. ; Periodic snapshots :The periodic snapshot, as the name implies, takes a \\"picture of the moment\\", where the moment could be any defined period of time, e.g. a performance summary of a salesman over the previous month. A periodic snapshot table is dependent on the transactional table, as it needs the detailed data held in the transactional fact table in order to deliver the chosen performance output. ; Accumulating snapshots :This type of fact table is used to show the activity of a process that has a well-defined beginning and end, e.g., the processing of an order. An order moves through specific steps until it is fully processed. As steps towards fulfilling the order are completed, the associated row in the fact table is updated. An accumulating snapshot table often has multiple date columns, each representing a milestone in the process. Therefore, it's important to have an entry in the associated date dimension that represents an unknown date, as many of the milestone dates are unknown at the time of the creation of the row. ; Temporal snapshots :By applying temporal database theory and modeling techniques the temporal snapshot fact table allows to have the equivalent of daily snapshots without really having daily snapshots. It introduces the concept of time Intervals into a fact table, allowing to save a lot of space, optimizing performances while allowing the end user to have the logical equivalent of the \\"picture of the moment\\" they are interested in. Steps in designing a fact table * Identify a business process for analysis (like sales). * Identify measures of facts (sales dollar), by asking questions like 'what number of X are relevant for the business process?', replacing the X with various options that make sense within the context of the business. * Identify dimensions for facts (product dimension, location dimension, time dimension, organization dimension), by asking questions that make sense within the context of the business, like 'analyse by X', where X is replaced with the subject to test. * List the columns that describe each dimension (region name, branch name, business unit name). * Determine the lowest level (granularity) of summary in a fact table (e.g. sales dollars). An alternative approach is the four step design process described in Kimball: select the business process, declare the grain, identify the dimensions, identify the facts.

He previously served as European Union Special Envoy for the Colombian Peace Process from 2015, T√°naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade from 2011 to 2014, Leader of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2014, Chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe from 2012 to 2013, Minister of State at the Department of the Marine from 1994 to 1997. He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the D√∫n Laoghaire constituency from 1989 to 2016. At the 2011 general election he led the Labour Party to its best electoral performance, with a record 37 D√°il seats. Labour entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael, with Gilmore being appointed T√°naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. As Minister for Foreign Affairs he led Ireland's seventh presidency of the European Council during the first half of 2013, and took on the role of chief negotiator for the Council in talks with the European Parliament on a ‚Ç¨960 billion EU budget for the period 2014‚Äì2020. Throughout 2012, he held the role of Chairperson-In-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Born in County Galway, Gilmore graduated from University College Galway, becoming President of the Union of Students in Ireland. Later, he entered local politics and worked as a trade union organiser. As a Democratic Left TD, he helped to negotiate that party's merger with Labour. He was beaten by his colleague Pat Rabbitte in Labour's 2002 leadership election, following which he was appointed as the party's Environment, Housing and Local Government spokesperson. Gilmore was elected unopposed as Labour Party leader in 2007; he resigned the post in July 2014, and was succeeded by Joan Burton. Early life and career Eamon Gilmore was born into a small farming family in Caltra, County Galway in 1955. When he was 14 months old his father died, leaving his mother to run the mixed farm and raise Gilmore and his younger brother John.Butler, Kate, Sunday Times Home Ireland Magazine. Time and Place Eamon Gilmore. 16 March 2008. Gilmore received his primary education in Caltra, in a small two-teacher national school. He was taught there through the medium of Irish, and he is a fluent Irish speaker to this day. Following his sixth-year state primary exam, he qualified for a scholarship from Galway County Council which enabled him to attend secondary school. He entered Garbally College, Ballinasloe, as a boarder in 1967.Kelly, Ken, Connacht Tribune. Gilmore back on familiar turf for Garbally return. 4 June 2010. Availing himself of a third-level grant to fund his degree, he went on to study psychology at University College Galway (UCG). He was an active member of the Drama Society at the university, where his contemporaries included the theatre director Garry Hynes and actor Marie Mullen who both went on to found the Druid Theatre Company. He also took part in the university debating scene, mainly through the Literary and Debating Society.McGarry, Patsy, Cois Coirbe Memory Lane. Alumni Office NUI Galway, 2008. He was elected class representative and later, at the age of 18, was elected President of UCG Students' Union from July 1974 to June 1975. In 1975, towards the end of his term of office, he joined the UCG Republican Club which was affiliated to Official Sinn F√©in; that party was subsequently renamed Sinn F√©in ‚Äì The Workers' Party, and later still became the Workers' Party. In recent years he has been accused of being evasive on the subject and of trying to play down that he had joined the Official Republican Movement; he has stated that the party \\"was in the process of becoming the Workers' Party at that time, I can't recall exactly the dates\\".Eamon Gilmore interviewed on the 'Marian Finucane Show' on RT√â Radio One, October 2010. From 1976 until 1978, Gilmore served as President of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI). Prior to establishing a career in politics, he worked as a trade union organiser. He joined the Irish Transport & General Workers' Union (now SIPTU) in 1978 and, after brief spells in Dublin No. 4 (Hotels & Catering) and Dublin No. 14 (Engineering) Branches, was rapidly promoted to become Acting Secretary of the Galway Branch (1978‚Äì79), Secretary of the Tralee Branch (1979‚Äì81), and of the Professional & Managerial Staffs Branch (1981‚Äì89). He was heavily involved in organising tax protests in Galway, and resisting redundancies and closures in Kerry.Devine, Francis, Organising History, A Centenary in Siptu. Gill and McMillan, 2009. Gilmore has described the driving factors which have informed his working life, whether as a trade union officer or public representative. \\"I like advocating. I love to share in the joy people get out of cracking it, getting the job or getting some right they should have. I get huge satisfaction out of working for improvements and seeing those come through\\". Personal life He met his wife Carol at university. They have lived in Shankill, Dublin since 1979, and have two sons and one daughter. His brother, John, is a television producer in Washington D.C. He described his beliefs during an interview, saying, \\"I'm agnostic. I doubt rather than I believe, let me put it that way\\". He also said \\"I'm pro-choice\\" when asked during the same interview if abortion should be legalised. He published a book in November 2010 entitled Leading Lights: People Who've Inspired Me. Political career Gilmore was elected to D√∫n Laoghaire Borough Council, and also to Dublin County Council, on 22 June 1985. He was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1989 general election as a member of the Workers' Party for the constituency of D√∫n Laoghaire, and was re-elected at every subsequent general election until his retirement from the D√°il in 2016. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was linked with Proinsias De Rossa in attempting to jettison some of the Workers' Party's Marxist aspect and to move the party towards an acceptance of free-market economics.Proinsias De Rossa, 'The case for a new departure Making Sense', March‚ÄìApril 1992. In an attempt to address these issues Gilmore and De Rossa along with their supporters sought to distance themselves from alleged paramilitary activity at a special Ardfheis held at D√∫n Laoghaire on 15 February 1992. A motion proposed by De Rossa and general secretary Des Geraghty sought to stand down the existing membership, elect an 11-member provisional executive council and make several other significant changes in party structures was defeated.Sean Garland, 'Beware of hidden agendas', Making Sense March‚ÄìApril 1992. The following day at an Ard Chomhairle meeting, Gilmore resigned from the Workers' Party and joined with Proinsias De Rossa and five other Workers' Party TDs to create a new political party, Democratic Left (originally known as New Agenda). Throughout his political career, Gilmore has worked for peace in Northern Ireland. Along with other prominent figures including Proinsias de Rossa and Eamon Dunphy, Gilmore was among the first organisers of the 'Peace Train' campaign which was started in 1989 in response to the repeated bombing of the Dublin to Belfast railway by the Provisional IRA. Northern Ireland was also a priority for Gilmore as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade during which time his efforts to reach out to the unionist community in particular were acknowledged.http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/unionist-politicians-sit- up-in-cambridge-as-gilmore-majors-with-timely-offer-and-powerful- delivery-1.1520423 https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/gilmore-appalled-and- saddened-by-smithwick-findings-1.1616729 In the 'Rainbow Coalition', between 1994 and 1997, Gilmore served as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine where he is credited for overseeing major reform in port ownership, investment in port development, banning nuclear vessels from Irish seas and restricting dumping at sea. With Labour's Brendan Howlin, Gilmore was a central figure in the negotiations that led to the merger of Democratic Left with the Labour Party in 1999 under the Leadership of Ruairi Quinn. After Quinn's resignation in 2002, Gilmore unsuccessfully contested the Leadership won by former student union and political colleague Pat Rabbitte. From 1999 to 2007, he sat on the Labour Party front bench as Environment, Housing and Local Government Spokesperson. Around this time, Gilmore voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. Labour Party leader Gilmore, Derek Nolan and Michael D. Higgins campaigning in Galway in 2008. Banner of Gilmore on Liberty Hall, 2009. Following Pat Rabbitte's resignation as party leader in August 2007, Gilmore announced his candidacy for the leadership. He received support from senior figures such as Michael D. Higgins, Ruairi Quinn, Willie Penrose, Liz McManus and Emmet Stagg, and did not have to contest a ballot, being formally confirmed as leader on 6 September, after being the only declared candidate. He became the tenth leader of the Labour Party. From early on in his Leadership Gilmore insisted that Labour should aspire to lead the next Government and set about building Labour as a third option for voters. At the 2009 local elections, the Labour Party added to its total of council seats, with 132 seats won (a gain of 43) and by July 2010 had gained an additional six seats from councillors joining the party since the election. On Dublin City Council, the party was again the largest party, but now with more seats than the two other main parties combined. At the 2009 European Parliament election held on the same day, the Labour Party increased its number of seats from 1 to 3, retaining the seat of Proinsias De Rossa in the Dublin constituency, while gaining seats in the East constituency with Nessa Childers, and in the South constituency with Alan Kelly. Initially Gilmore was in favour of the 2008 first Lisbon Treaty referendum. When it was lost, he declared that the \\"Lisbon Treaty is dead\\". According to a wikileaks cable dated 23 July 2008 and released in 2011, he told the US Ambassador privately that he would support a second referendum. The Ambassador reported that: \\"He explained his public posture of opposition to a second referendum as 'politically necessary' for the time being\\". In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty proposal was passed by the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. In September 2009, at the Labour Parliamentary Party Meeting in Waterford, Gilmore categorically ruled out a coalition with Fianna F√°il after the next general election, reiterating what he had said in earlier interviews. In his leader's address to the 2010 Labour Party Conference (17 April 2010), Gilmore outlined his vision that the Labour Party should lead the way in building 'One Ireland'. In this speech, he listed the Labour Party's policy priorities as Jobs, Reform and Fairness. He also said he was determined that the Labour Party would run enough candidates at the next general election to enable the Irish people to make Labour the largest party in the D√°il and to lead the next government. In July 2010, Gilmore again ruled out a coalition between his party and Fianna F√°il after a general election, even if such a coalition would put him in a position to become Taoiseach. Gilmore also said his party was well-positioned to win at least one seat in each of the country's 43 constituencies, and two seats in some constituencies in Dublin, Cork, other urban areas and commuter-belt counties. In all, he said the party had the potential to win 50 seats or more. Gilmore also played a leading role in the modernisation and liberalisation of Ireland's social legislation, most notably on divorce and abortion, and has been to the fore in the campaign for gay marriage. He is often quoted for citing gay marriage as \\"the civil rights issue of this generation\\". Gilmore also made a commitment to hold a constitutional referendum on the issue a key plank of the Labour/Fine Gael programme for government. A referendum on gay marriage was held in 2015.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/referendum-on-same-sex-marriage- to-be-held-in-2015-1.1584350 He was a member of the cabinet committee that steered through Ireland's divorce legislation in 1996, as well as a member of the Divorce Action Group which campaigned for the legalisation of divorce in Ireland. In 1983, Gilmore campaigned against the ban on abortion in the Constitution. As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gilmore was behind the most significant expansion of Ireland's embassy network for several decades, opening eight new diplomatic missions across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas in 2014. Despite considerable media focus on the reopening of the embassy to the Vatican, which had been closed for economic reasons in 2011 along with the embassy to Tehran, the new missions are largely trade and investment-focussed.Asia Briefing: Expansion of Irish missions recognises importance of Asia Irish Times, 2014-03-04. In 2013, Gilmore launched the first review of Irish foreign policy since 1996.Gilmore announces 'complete review' of State's foreign policy Irish Times, 2013-11-13. Gilmore has also been a member of the first Economic Management Council (EMC), along with Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, since March 2011. For the first three years of the Fine Gael/Labour government, the EMC was regarded as the lynchpin of the coalition's stability.Success or failure in meeting bailout targets will be crucial test of economic body Irish Times, 2012-08-17.

The party won 37 seats. It did especially well in Dublin, taking 18 seats to become the largest party in the capital. Gilmore topped the poll in the D√∫n Laoghaire constituency. T√°naiste and government minister (2011‚Äì14) Following the election, Labour entered coalition with Fine Gael. Gilmore became T√°naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. He appointed five Ministers to the Cabinet, six Ministers of State and M√°ire Whelan as Attorney General of Ireland. He also recreated the office of the T√°naiste within the Department of the Taoiseach to enhance his control over Government policy. This office was originally created under T√°naiste Dick Spring in 1992, but was abolished by his successor Mary Harney. Troika bailout exit On 15 December 2013, Ireland became the first eurozone country to exit a ‚Ç¨67.5 billion EU/IMF bailout programme following a multi-year programme. The so-called 'troika' bailout was triggered in November 2010 following the collapse of the Irish property market collapsed which in turn had pushed the country's banks into financial crisis. A blanket guarantee on all of the liabilities of the Irish banks ‚Äì established by the previous Fianna F√°il/Green Party Coalition in September 2008 ‚Äì dragged the State to near bankruptcy and forced the government to turn to the EU/IMF as lenders of last resort. In November 2014, the Government announced that it would exit the EU/IMF bailout programme without seeking a precautionary credit line, often referred to as a 'clean bailout exit'. In an interview with RT√â's Morning Ireland radio programme on 15 November, Gilmore explained that the Government had conducted a long process of consultation with international institutions and other EU member states before making the decision to exit the bailout cleanly. He also pointed to the existence of a ‚Ç¨20 billion \\"backstop\\" of reserve funding held by the National Treasury Management Agency that could fund the Irish State up until the beginning of 2015 if so required. Northern Ireland On 11 November 2012, Gilmore became the first Irish Government Minister to take part in the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Belfast when he laid a laurel wreath at the Cenotaph at Belfast City Hall to honour those who had died in the First and Second World Wars. He attended the ceremony again the following year.Eamon Gilmore to lay wreath at Belfast Remembrance event RT√â News, 2012-11-09.Taoiseach, T√°naiste mark Remembrance Sunday RT√â News, 2013-11-10. In September 2013, he was seen to have broken \\"new political ground\\" when in a speech to the British Irish Association in Cambridge, \\"he went out of his way to address a unionist perception of a failure by a number of Irish governments to properly combat the IRA\\".https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/state-willing-to-act-on- unionist-claims-over-ira-gilmore-1.1520539 In the same speech, he also said he hoped that the Government of Ireland could \\"host representatives of the royal family and the British government, along with the leaders of unionism, in Dublin in three years' time in remembering the Easter Rising\\". He was part of the process which aimed at resolving issues relating to parading, flags and emblems, and the past that was chaired by US diplomat Richard Haass from September to December 2013,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/north-s- talks-face-challenge-to-address-survivor-concerns-1.1540919 Draft peace plan for Northern Ireland published online Irish Times, 2014-01-01. and he maintained contact with the parties involved until he was replaced as foreign affairs minister in a cabinet reshuffle the following year.Intensive talks on Haass proposals to take place later this month Irish Times, 2014-06-09.Dublin and London want NI parties back in talks Irish Times, 6 May 2014.Gilmore and Haass to speak about 'window' for NI talks Irish Times, 5 May 2014. OSCE chair On 1 January 2012, Ireland assumed the 2012 chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OCSE) for the first time. In his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gilmore served as the Chairman-in- Office of the OSCE. EU Presidency and budget negotiations As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gilmore led Ireland's seventh Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2013. He chaired the General Affairs Council of the European Union (EU) and acted as lead negotiator for the Council in talks with the European Parliament on a ‚Ç¨960 billion, seven-year budget deal ‚Äì also known as a Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) ‚Äì for the EU for the period 2014‚Äì2020.Gilmore will present EU budget amid MEP resistance Irish Times, 2013-06-25.

Ireland's diplomatic network In November 2011, Gilmore announced the closure of Ireland's embassies in Iran and the Vatican, and a representative office in East-Timor, on economic grounds. Ireland was to retain an ambassador to the Holy See who would reside in Ireland rather than Rome. In January 2014, he announced that eight new diplomatic missions would be opened around the world, focussing mainly on trade and investment.Embassy shake-up targets emerging export markets Irish Independent, 2014-01-22.

Croke Park agreement In December, Gilmore once again put his support behind the Croke Park Deal on public sector pay and conditions. The dismissal of a renegotiation of the deal came in light of Communications Minister Pat Rabbitte's comments that the deal could be renegotiated along with calls from junior Fine Gael TDs that the agreement should be scrapped. Retirement from Irish politics and afterwards On 2 June 2015, Gilmore announced his retirement from domestic politics, and that he would not be contesting the 2016 general election. Since his retirement from Irish politics, Gilmore has worked for the European Union, as Special Envoy and Special Representative. In February 2016, he was appointed as Adjunct Professor in the School of Law and Government in Dublin City University. In 2017, he was Visiting Practitioner Professor of the School of Public Policy in the Central European University, Budapest. He has also lectured at universities, think tanks and public policy conferences throughout Europe, the UK, the USA, Latin America and Africa. He is also a Member of the External Advisory Board of the National University of Ireland, Galway and is a member of the International Advisory Board of the Alpbach Forum in Austria. European Union Special Representative On 1 October 2015, following his retirement from domestic politics in Ireland, Gilmore was appointed by High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini as European Union Special Envoy for the Colombian Peace Process. Gilmore brought particular insights from the Northern Ireland peace process to his work. His record and highly regarded standing as a former foreign minister are understood to have stood him in good stead for the nomination to the post. On 19 February 2019, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini nominated Eamon Gilmore to be European Union Special Representative for Human Rights. His nomination was approved by the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 February 2019.  Awards and Honours  In 2015, Gilmore was named by the Washington based \\"Foreign Policy\\" Magazine as one of the 100 leading Global Thinkers for his role in Ireland's Marriage Equality Referendum, which approved same-sex marriage. In 2016, he was conferred with an Honorary Doctorate in Laws by his alma mater, the National University of Ireland, Galway. The Government of France has made him an Official of the Legion d'Honneur. Colombia has honoured him with the Order of San Carlos (Gran Cruz) for his work on the Peace Process. In 2017, he was shortlisted for the European Innovation in Politics Award for his role in the same sex marriage campaign, and also for his idea to establish the Constitutional Convention (later the Citizen's Assembly), which recommended the holding of the referendum.

Another certificate system that confirms the sustainability of buildings is the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments. Currently, World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia. Building information modelling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports and tunnels. Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by: * Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources * Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building) * Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation A similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally.Hopkins, R. 2002. A Natural Way of Building. Transition Culture. Retrieved: 2007-03-30. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.Allen & Iano, 2008[Allen, E, & Iano, J. (2008). Fundamentals of building construction: materials and methods. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons Inc. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction. A 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildings. These are eco-friendly buildings. Reducing environmental impact One Central Park, Sydney Globally, buildings are responsible for a huge share of energy, electricity, water and materials consumption. The building sector has the greatest potential to deliver significant cuts in emissions at little or no cost. Buildings account for 18% of global emissions today, or the equivalent of 9 billion tonnes of CO2 annually. If new technologies in construction are not adopted during this time of rapid growth, emissions could double by 2050, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Green building practices aim to reduce the environmental impact of building. Since construction almost always degrades a building site, not building at all is preferable to green building, in terms of reducing environmental impact. The second rule is that every building should be as small as possible. The third rule is not to contribute to sprawl, even if the most energy-efficient, environmentally sound methods are used in design and construction. Buildings account for a large amount of land. According to the National Resources Inventory, approximately of land in the United States are developed. The International Energy Agency released a publication that estimated that existing buildings are responsible for more than 40% of the world‚Äôs total primary energy consumption and for 24% of global carbon dioxide emissions.Goodhew S 2016 Sustainable Construction Processes A Resource Text.

Taipei 101, the tallest and largest green building of LEED Platinum certification in the world since 2011. The concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy (especially fossil oil) crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s. The Rachel Carson book, ‚ÄúSilent Spring‚Äù,Carson, Rachel. Silent Spring. N.p.: Houghton Mifflin, 1962. Print. published in 1962, is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building. The green building movement in the U.S. originated from the need and desire for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly construction practices. There are a number of motives for building green, including environmental, economic, and social benefits. However, modern sustainability initiatives call for an integrated and synergistic design to both new construction and in the retrofitting of existing structures. Also known as sustainable design, this approach integrates the building life-cycle with each green practice employed with a design-purpose to create a synergy among the practices used. Green building brings together a vast array of practices, techniques, and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health. It often emphasizes taking advantage of renewable resources, e.g., using sunlight through passive solar, active solar, and photovoltaic equipment, and using plants and trees through green roofs, rain gardens, and reduction of rainwater run-off. Many other techniques are used, such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of ground water. While the practices or technologies employed in green building are constantly evolving and may differ from region to region, fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived: siting and structure design efficiency, energy efficiency, water efficiency, materials efficiency, indoor environmental quality enhancement, operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Retrieved March 06, 2020, from https://www.wbdg.org/design-objectives/sustainable The essence of green building is an optimization of one or more of these principles. Also, with the proper synergistic design, individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect. On the aesthetic side of green architecture or sustainable design is the philosophy of designing a building that is in harmony with the natural features and resources surrounding the site. There are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings: specify 'green' building materials from local sources, reduce loads, optimize systems, and generate on-site renewable energy. Life cycle assessment A life cycle assessment (LCA) can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concernsLife cycle assessment#cite note-1 by assessing a full range of impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process: from extraction of raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Impacts taken into account include (among others) embodied energy, global warming potential, resource use, air pollution, water pollution, and waste. In terms of green building, the last few years have seen a shift away from a prescriptive approach, which assumes that certain prescribed practices are better for the environment, toward the scientific evaluation of actual performance through LCA. Although LCA is widely recognized as the best way to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings (ISO 14040 provides a recognized LCA methodology), it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes, despite the fact that embodied energy and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings. In North America, LCA is rewarded to some extent in the Green Globes rating system, and is part of the new American National Standard based on Green Globes, ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Protocol for Commercial Buildings. LCA is also included as a pilot credit in the LEED system, though a decision has not been made as to whether it will be incorporated fully into the next major revision. The state of California also included LCA as a voluntary measure in its 2010 draft Green Building Standards Code. Although LCA is often perceived as overly complex and time consuming for regular use by design professionals, research organizations such as BRE in the UK and the Athena Sustainable Materials Institute in North America are working to make it more accessible. In the UK, the BRE Green Guide to Specifications offers ratings for 1,500 building materials based on LCA. Siting and structure design efficiency The foundation of any construction project is rooted in the concept and design stages. The concept stage, in fact, is one of the major steps in a project life cycle, as it has the largest impact on cost and performance.Hegazy, T. (2002). Life-cycle stages of projects. Computer- Based Construction Project Management, 8. In designing environmentally optimal buildings, the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project. Exterior Light Shelves - Green Office Building, Denver, ColoradoHowever, building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process, and varies from one building to the other, never repeating itself identically. In addition, buildings are much more complex products, composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage. A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building's relevant life-cycle stages. Energy efficiency An eco-house at Findhorn Ecovillage with a turf roof and solar panels Green buildings often include measures to reduce energy consumption ‚Äì both the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials and operating energy to provide services such as heating and power for equipment. As high-performance buildings use less operating energy, embodied energy has assumed much greater importance ‚Äì and may make up as much as 30% of the overall life cycle energy consumption. Studies such as the U.S. LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick, concrete, or steel. To reduce operating energy use, designers use details that reduce air leakage through the building envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and treesSimpson, J.R. Energy and Buildings, Improved Estimates of tree-shade effects on residential energy use, February 2002. Retrieved:2008-04-30. to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs. Onsite generation of renewable energy through solar power, wind power, hydro power, or biomass can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building. Power generation is generally the most expensive feature to add to a building. Water efficiency Reducing water consumption and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of water consumption is that in many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout the life of a building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. Point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.California Integrated Waste Management Board. (January 23, 2008).

Their environmental engineering consists of a hybrid central chilled water system which cools floor-by-floor with steam instead of water. Burn's Mechanical set-up the entire renovation of the 58 story, 1.4 million square foot sky scraper. Materials efficiency Building materials typically considered to be 'green' include lumber from forests that have been certified to a third-party forest standard, rapidly renewable plant materials like bamboo and straw, dimension stone, recycled stone, recycled metal (see: copper sustainability and recyclability), and other products that are non- toxic, reusable, renewable, and/or recyclable. For concrete a high performance or Roman self-healing concrete is available. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) also suggests using recycled industrial goods, such as coal combustion products, foundry sand, and demolition debris in construction projects. Energy efficient building materials and appliances are promoted in the United States through energy rebate programs. Indoor environmental quality enhancement The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) category in LEED standards, one of the five environmental categories, was created to provide comfort, well-being, and productivity of occupants. The LEED IEQ category addresses design and construction guidelines especially: indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal quality, and lighting quality. Indoor Air Quality seeks to reduce volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants. Buildings rely on a properly designed ventilation system (passively/naturally or mechanically powered) to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated, filtered air as well as isolated operations (kitchens, dry cleaners, etc.) from other occupancies. During the design and construction process choosing construction materials and interior finish products with zero or low VOC emissions will improve IAQ. Most building materials and cleaning/maintenance products emit gases, some of them toxic, such as many VOCs including formaldehyde. These gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants' health, comfort, and productivity. Avoiding these products will increase a building's IEQ. LEED, HQE and Green Star contain specifications on use of low-emitting interior. Draft LEED 2012 is about to expand the scope of the involved products. BREEAM limits formaldehyde emissions, no other VOCs. MAS Certified Green is a registered trademark to delineate low VOC-emitting products in the marketplace. The MAS Certified Green Program ensures that any potentially hazardous chemicals released from manufactured products have been thoroughly tested and meet rigorous standards established by independent toxicologists to address recognized long term health concerns. These IAQ standards have been adopted by and incorporated into the following programs: * The United States Green Building Council (USGBC) in their LEED rating system * The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) in their section 01350 standards * The Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) in their Best Practices Manual * The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association (BIFMA) in their level¬Æ sustainability standard. Also important to indoor air quality is the control of moisture accumulation (dampness) leading to mold growth and the presence of bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns. Water intrusion through a building's envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building's interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth. A well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes, cooking, bathing, cleaning, and other activities. Personal temperature and airflow control over the HVAC system coupled with a properly designed building envelope will also aid in increasing a building's thermal quality. Creating a high performance luminous environment through the careful integration of daylight and electrical light sources will improve on the lighting quality and energy performance of a structure.WBDG Sustainable Committee. (August 18, 2009). Sustainable. Retrieved October 28, 2009, from http://www.wbdg.org/design/ieq.php Solid wood products, particularly flooring, are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates. Wood itself is considered to be hypo- allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recommends hardwood, vinyl, linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity. Interactions among all the indoor components and the occupants together form the processes that determine the indoor air quality. Extensive investigation of such processes is the subject of indoor air scientific research and is well documented in the journal Indoor Air. Operations and maintenance optimization No matter how sustainable a building may have been in its design and construction, it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly. Ensuring operations and maintenance(O&M;) personnel are part of the project's planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed at the onset of the project.WBDG Sustainable Committee. (August 18, 2009). Sustainable. Retrieved November 28, 2009, from http://www.wbdg.org/design/optimize_om.php Every aspect of green building is integrated into the O&M; phase of a building's life. The addition of new green technologies also falls on the O&M; staff. Although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design, construction and demolition phases of a building's life-cycle, it is in the O&M; phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place. O&M; staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency, resource conservation, ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices. Education of building operators and occupants is key to effective implementation of sustainable strategies in O&M; services. Waste reduction Green architecture also seeks to reduce waste of energy, water and materials used during construction. For example, in California nearly 60% of the state's waste comes from commercial buildingsKats, Greg; Alevantis Leon; Berman Adam; Mills Evan; Perlman, Jeff. The Cost and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings, October 2003 Retrieved:November 3rd, 2008. During the construction phase, one goal should be to reduce the amount of material going to landfills. Well- designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well, by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going to landfills. To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill, Neutral Alliance (a coalition of government, NGOs and the forest industry) created the website dontwastewood.com. The site includes a variety of resources for regulators, municipalities, developers, contractors, owner/operators and individuals/homeowners looking for information on wood recycling. When buildings reach the end of their useful life, they are typically demolished and hauled to landfills. Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered \\"waste\\" and reclaiming it into useful building material. Extending the useful life of a structure also reduces waste ‚Äì building materials such as wood that are light and easy to work with make renovations easier. To reduce the impact on wells or water treatment plants, several options exist. \\"Greywater\\", wastewater from sources such as dishwashing or washing machines, can be used for subsurface irrigation, or if treated, for non-potable purposes, e.g., to flush toilets and wash cars. Rainwater collectors are used for similar purposes. Centralized wastewater treatment systems can be costly and use a lot of energy. An alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer, which avoids these costs and shows other benefits. By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste, liquid fertilizer can be produced. This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in Lubeck Germany in the late 1990s. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting greenhouse gas emission. Producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process.Lange, Jorg; Grottker, Mathias; Otterpohl, Ralf. Water Science and Technology, Sustainable Water and Waste Management In Urban Areas, June 1998. Retrieved:April 30, 2008. Reduce impact onto electricity network Electricity networks are built based on peak demand (another name is peak load). Peak demand is measured in the units of watts (W). It shows how fast electrical energy is consumed. Residential electricity is often charged on electrical energy (kilowatt hour, kWh). Green buildings or sustainable buildings are often capable of saving electrical energy but not necessarily reducing peak demand. When sustainable building features are designed, constructed and operated efficiently, peak demand can be reduced so that there is less desire for electricity network expansion and there is less impact onto carbon emission and climate change. These sustainable features can be good orientation, sufficient indoor thermal mass, good insulation, photovoltaic panels, thermal or electrical energy storage systems, smart building (home) energy management systems. Cost and payoff The most criticized issue about constructing environmentally friendly buildings is the price. Photo-voltaics, new appliances, and modern technologies tend to cost more money. Most green buildings cost a premium of <2%, but yield 10 times as much over the entire life of the building.Kats, Greg, Leon Alevantis, Adam Berman, Evan Mills, Jeff Perlman. The Cost and Financial Benefits of Green Buildings, November 3rd, 2008. In regards to the financial benefits of green building, ‚ÄúOver 20 years, the financial payback typically exceeds the additional cost of greening by a factor of 4-6 times. And broader benefits, such as reductions in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other pollutants have large positive impacts on surrounding communities and on the planet.‚ÄùKats, Gregory.

In some cases, codes are written so local governments can adopt them as bylaws to reduce the local environmental impact of buildings. Green building rating systems such as BREEAM (United Kingdom), LEED (United States and Canada), DGNB (Germany), CASBEE (Japan), and VERDEGBCe (Spain), GRIHA (India) help consumers determine a structure‚Äôs level of environmental performance. They award credits for optional building features that support green design in categories such as location and maintenance of building site, conservation of water, energy, and building materials, and occupant comfort and health. The number of credits generally determines the level of achievement. Green building codes and standards, such as the International Code Council‚Äôs draft International Green Construction Code, are sets of rules created by standards development organizations that establish minimum requirements for elements of green building such as materials or heating and cooling. Some of the major building environmental assessment tools currently in use include: *United States: International Green Construction Code (IGCC) International frameworks and assessment tools IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Climate Change 2007, the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is the fourth in a series of such reports. The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change, its potential effects and options for adaptation and mitigation. UNEP and Climate change United Nations Environment Program UNEP works to facilitate the transition to low-carbon societies, support climate proofing efforts, improve understanding of climate change science, and raise public awareness about this global challenge. GHG Indicator The Greenhouse Gas Indicator: UNEP Guidelines for Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Businesses and Non-Commercial Organizations Agenda 21 Agenda 21 is a programme run by the United Nations (UN) related to sustainable development. It is a comprehensive blueprint of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the UN, governments, and major groups in every area in which humans impact on the environment. The number 21 refers to the 21st century. FIDIC's PSM The International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) Project Sustainability Management Guidelines were created in order to assist project engineers and other stakeholders in setting sustainable development goals for their projects that are recognized and accepted by as being in the interests of society as a whole. The process is also intended to allow the alignment of project goals with local conditions and priorities and to assist those involved in managing projects to measure and verify their progress. The Project Sustainability Management Guidelines are structured with Themes and Sub-Themes under the three main sustainability headings of Social, Environmental and Economic. For each individual Sub-Theme a core project indicator is defined along with guidance as to the relevance of that issue in the context of an individual project. The Sustainability Reporting Framework provides guidance for organizations to use as the basis for disclosure about their sustainability performance, and also provides stakeholders a universally applicable, comparable framework in which to understand disclosed information. The Reporting Framework contains the core product of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, as well as Protocols and Sector Supplements. The Guidelines are used as the basis for all reporting. They are the foundation upon which all other reporting guidance is based, and outline core content for reporting that is broadly relevant to all organizations regardless of size, sector, or location. The Guidelines contain principles and guidance as well as standard disclosures ‚Äì including indicators ‚Äì to outline a disclosure framework that organizations can voluntarily, flexibly, and incrementally, adopt. Protocols underpin each indicator in the Guidelines and include definitions for key terms in the indicator, compilation methodologies, intended scope of the indicator, and other technical references. Sector Supplements respond to the limits of a one-size-fits-all approach. Sector Supplements complement the use of the core Guidelines by capturing the unique set of sustainability issues faced by different sectors such as mining, automotive, banking, public agencies and others. IPD Environment Code The IPD Environment Code was launched in February 2008. The Code is intended as a good practice global standard for measuring the environmental performance of corporate buildings. Its aim is to accurately measure and manage the environmental impacts of corporate buildings and enable property executives to generate high quality, comparable performance information about their buildings anywhere in the world. The Code covers a wide range of building types (from offices to airports) and aims to inform and support the following; * Creating an environmental strategy * Inputting to real estate strategy * Communicating a commitment to environmental improvement * Creating performance targets * Environmental improvement plans * Performance assessment and measurement * Life cycle assessments * Acquisition and disposal of buildings * Supplier management * Information systems and data population * Compliance with regulations * Team and personal objectives IPD estimate that it will take approximately three years to gather significant data to develop a robust set of baseline data that could be used across a typical corporate estate. ISO 21931 ISO/TS 21931:2006, Sustainability in building construction‚ÄîFramework for methods of assessment for environmental performance of construction works‚ÄîPart 1: Buildings, is intended to provide a general framework for improving the quality and comparability of methods for assessing the environmental performance of buildings. It identifies and describes issues to be taken into account when using methods for the assessment of environmental performance for new or existing building properties in the design, construction, operation, refurbishment and deconstruction stages. It is not an assessment system in itself but is intended be used in conjunction with, and following the principles set out in, the ISO 14000 series of standards.  Development History  * In the 1960s, American architect Paul Soleri proposed a new concept of ecological architecture. * In 1969, American architect Ian McHarg wrote the book \\"Design Integrates Nature\\", which marked the official birth of ecological architecture. * In the 1970s, the energy crisis caused various building energy-saving technologies such as solar energy, geothermal energy, and wind energy to emerge, and energy-saving buildings became the forerunner of building development. * In 1980, the World Conservation Organization put forward the slogan \\"sustainable development\\" for the first time. At the same time, the energy-saving building system was gradually improved, and it was widely used in developed countries such as Germany, Britain, France and Canada. * In 1987, the United Nations Environment Program published the \\"Our Common Future\\" report, which established the idea of sustainable development. * In 1990, the world's first green building standard was released in the UK. * In 1992, because the \\"United Nations Conference on Environment and Development\\" promoted the idea of sustainable development, green buildings gradually became the direction of development. * In 1993, the United States created the Green Building Association. * In 1996, Hong Kong introduced green building standards. * In 1999, Taiwan introduced green building standards. * In 2000, Canada introduced green building standards. * In 2005, Singapore initiated the \\"BCA Green Building Mark\\" * In 2015, China implemented the \\"Green Building Evaluation Standards\\" Green building by country *Green building in Bangladesh *Green building in Germany *Green building in Israel *Green building in South Africa *Green building in the United Kingdom *Green building in India *Green building in the United States See also * Alternative natural materials * Arcology ‚Äî high density ecological structures * Autonomous building * Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability * Deconstruction (building) * Eco hotel * Environmental planning * Geo-exchange * Green architecture * Green building and wood * Green Building Council * Green home * Green library * Green technology * Glass in green buildings * Healthy building * Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design * List of low-energy building techniques * Low-energy house * National Green Building Standard * Natural building * Sustainable city * Sustainable habitat * Tropical green building * World Green Building Council * Zero-energy building ReferencesExternal links *Sustainable Architecture at the Open Directory Project *Prochorskaite A, Couch C, Malys N, Maliene V (2016) Housing Stakeholder Preferences for the ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù Features of Sustainable and Healthy Housing Design in the UK.

She served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Limerick City constituency from 2011 to 2020, and previously from 1998 to 2011 for the Limerick East constituency. Personal life O'Sullivan was born in Clonlara, County Clare, in 1950. She was educated at Villiers Secondary School, Limerick, where her father was a journalist. After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, she took a Higher Diploma in Education at University College Cork. After working as a teacher for a short period of time, she studied as a Montessori teacher while living in Canada. After returning to Ireland, in the late 1970s, O'Sullivan helped to run Limerick's Family planning clinic. A member of the Church of Ireland, she married a Roman Catholic, Paul O'Sullivan, with whom she has one daughter and one son. She chose to spend time at home while having her children and once they were in school she ran a playgroup in the mornings, spent time with the children in the afternoon and did political work in the evenings. Political career=Democratic Socialist: 1982‚Äì1990 O'Sullivan entered politics in 1982, by joining the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a small party founded by Limerick TD Jim Kemmy, who had previously been a member of the Labour Party. There had been no political tradition in her family‚Äîher parents had supported different parties‚Äîand her choice of party was based on her support for Kemmy's anti-nationalist stance on Northern Ireland, and his advocacy of family planning services and a pro-choice approach to abortion. O'Sullivan was elected to Limerick City Council in 1985, she also served as a member of the Mid-Western Health Board from 1991 to 2003. Labour: 1990s O'Sullivan joined the Labour Party when the DSP merged with Labour in 1990, having been one of the DSP's negotiators in the merger discussions. At the 1992 general election, as the running-mate of the DSP's founder Jim Kemmy, she narrowly missed winning a second seat for Labour in Limerick East. In 1993, she was elected to the 20th Seanad on the Administrative Panel, and became leader of the Labour group in Seanad √âireann. From 1993 to 1994, O'Sullivan was Mayor of Limerick, and her religion twice became an issue in 1994, when she was prevented from opening a Christian Brothers School and from reading a lesson at a mass for Limerick's civic week. However, her religious denomination was not the only issue. Family planning was deeply controversial in Ireland from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly in Limerick, where Kemmy had lost his D√°il seat at the November 1982 general election, after being denounced by the Catholic Church for his opposition to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. Those such as O'Sullivan who were involved in the family planning services which Kemmy had helped found were labelled \\"Kemmy's Femmies\\". O'Sullivan was unsuccessful again at the 1997 general election, but after Kemmy's death in September 1997, she was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the by-election in March 1998. She held the seat in a close three-way contest, becoming the first female TD from County Limerick since Kathleen O'Callaghan in 1921. Both the Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael candidates in the by-election were also women. Labour: 2000s O'Sullivan was re-elected at the 2002, 2007 and 2011 general elections, and at the 1999 local elections became Limerick's first alderwoman (as well as its last, since the title was abolished by the Local Government Act 2001). In the 28th D√°il, she was the Labour Party Spokesperson on Justice and Equality and a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. In the 29th D√°il, she was Vice-Chair of both the D√°il Select Committee on Education and Science and the Joint Committee on Education and Science, as well as her party's Spokesperson on Education and Science. After Labour's disappointing performance at the 2007 general election, Pat Rabbitte resigned as leader and the outgoing deputy leader, Liz McManus, did not seek re-election. Eamon Gilmore was elected unopposed as leader, and in a frontbench reshuffle on 16 September 2007 moved O'Sullivan to the high-profile role of Spokesperson for Health. O'Sullivan stood for the Deputy leadership, and was narrowly defeated by Dublin West TD Joan Burton, by 1480 votes to 1276. Government: 2011‚Äì2016 On 10 March 2011, she was appointed as Minister of State for Trade and Development. On 20 December 2011, she was appointed as Minister of State for Housing and Planning.O'Sullivan was described as a \\"Super junior\\" minister at this time, because unlike other Ministers of State, she attended cabinet meetings. In July 2014, she was appointed Minister for Education and Skills. In March 2015, the Government, with O'Sullivan the Minister responsible, confirmed it would lock away for 75 years any statements it received from victims of child sexual abuse (almost twice the normal length). This decision was criticised by survivors. Opposition: 2016‚Äì2020 O'Sullivan retained her seat in the D√°il, following the 2016 general election, though only six of her Labour colleagues did likewise and the party returned to the opposition benches. O'Sullivan retained her position as Minister for Education and Skills until talks on government formation had concluded and her successor, Richard Bruton, was appointed. She lost her seat at the 2020 general election.

Early life The son of Richard Patrick McCormick, a Rutgers professor and administrator, and Katheryne C. Levis, a University administrator, Richard Levis McCormick was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. After graduating from Piscataway Township High School in Piscataway, New Jersey, McCormick earned his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from Amherst College in American studies (1969) and subsequently a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in History (1976) from Yale University. Academic career=Rutgers faculty McCormick served on the Rutgers University History faculty from 1976 to 1992, including three years as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. He team-taught an American history course with his father, Richard P. McCormick. In 1985, he held a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship as well as a Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Fellowship. UNC-Chapel Hill McCormick served as vice chancellor and provost at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1992 to 1995. His tenure was marked by the settling of a controversy over a proposed Black Cultural Center. More than a dozen students were arrested in a sit-in protest demanding construction of the facility, which opponents viewed as an attempt to create a separatist facility. McCormick won campuswide support by emphasizing the academic aspects of the center and helped initiate a fundraising campaign to build it. The Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History opened in 2004. University of Washington Presidency McCormick served as President of the University of Washington from 1995 to 2002. Although hampered by declining state funding, McCormick promoted undergraduate research and helped boost UW‚Äôs six-year graduation rate from 67 percent in 1995 to 72 percent in 2000. He launched an annual faculty bus tour to encourage the university to adopt a statewide perspective. Research funding and private giving reached record levels in McCormick‚Äôs tenure, but he was unable to prevent passage of a 1998 statewide initiative, I-200 Initiative 200, ending the university‚Äôs affirmative action programs. When McCormick announced his intent to take a position at Rutgers, he became the first UW president in 50 years to leave for another university. McCormick's departure from the University of Washington was prompted, in part, by pressure from the UW Board of Regents regarding an affair McCormick had with a coworker during his presidency. Rutgers Presidency McCormick took office as Rutgers president in December 2002 and stepped down in June 2012. His tenure was highlighted by two far-reaching initiatives: the reorganization and strengthening of undergraduate education on the university's largest campus, New Brunswick, and the passage of state legislation to merge nearly all of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey into Rutgers. In 2004, McCormick launched a campuswide discussion of the university's responsibility to undergraduate students, insisting that they receive the full benefits of the university's mission as a research university. In 2006, the university's Board of Governors approved his plan to reorganize the undergraduate colleges on the New Brunswick campus into a School of Arts and Sciences and School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, eliminating contradictory admissions and curriculum standards among these undergraduate colleges and emphasizing faculty-student interaction. Some students and alumni criticized the plan, arguing that it sacrifices Rutgers' unique institutional history and culture. The plan went into effect during the 2007-2008 academic year. In January 2011, McCormick praised the recommendations of the New Jersey Higher Education Task Force, which proposed merging Rutgers with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and two other units of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. A year later, in January 2012, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and a medical-education advisory committee appointed by Christie endorsed the merger proposal but also called for the merger of Rutgers' Camden campus into Rowan University. The final bill maintained the Camden campus as part of Rutgers while increasing the number of UMDNJ units being absorbed into Rutgers to include all but University Hospital in Newark and the School of Osteopathic Medicine in Stratford. The legislation, signed by Gov. Christie and approved by the Rutgers governing boards in 2012, took effect July 1, 2013. McCormick's tenure was noted for his efforts to broaden and deepen the university's connections with New Jersey. He targeted research areas of particular interest to the state (transportation, nutrition, homeland security, climate change), and in 2008 announced Rutgers Against Hunger , an initiative to stock food banks in the state, provide consumer education on nutrition, and help community organizations fight hunger. In 2009 he launched Rutgers Day , an annual public event highlighting Rutgers academic, research, cultural, and recreational programs. In 2008, McCormick established the Rutgers Future Scholars Program in conjunction with a series of initiatives designed to increase the diversity of the university population. Each year, a new cohort of fifty rising eighth-grade students from each of the university‚Äôs host cities of Newark, Camden, New Brunswick, and Piscataway begins a five-year process of regular visits to campus, college preparation activities, and mentoring, with the guarantee of free tuition at Rutgers for all those who earn admission after high school. Of the first cohort of 183 students in the program, 163 enrolled in college in fall 2013, including 98 at Rutgers. During McCormick's presidency, the university's annual budget grew from $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion despite declining levels of state funding. He made new investments in Rutgers‚Äô campuses, responding to student demand for additional housing, classroom repairs, and renovated or expanded student-life facilities. The Rutgers School of Law‚ÄìCamden opened a new facility in 2008, and the Rutgers Business School‚ÄîNewark and New Brunswick moved into a new home at One Washington Park in Newark in 2009. In 2007 McCormick announced plans for redevelopment of the Livingston Campus in Piscataway, New Jersey, focused on professional education; a 2008 anonymous gift of $13 million, the second largest private gift in Rutgers‚Äô history, has been earmarked for a new business school facility on that campus. In 2006 he held an international design competition to ‚Äúgreen‚Äù the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Some detractors said the designs, including those of the winning firm, were too modern for the historic campus, but others praised the proposed use of open space and planned transportation improvements. McCormick suspended the greening project in 2009, citing budgetary problems: > \\"All of the other projects that we bring to you for your approval ‚Äî the > dining hall on [Livingston] campus, the proteomics building and the Nelson > [Biology Laboratories C-wing] all come with revenue streams‚Ä¶. There's no > revenue stream for the greening of College Avenue unless you charge students > for walking past bushes and trees‚Ä¶. I regret this, but we have no other > choice,\\" McCormick said.\\"U. trims back plans for greening project\\" .Colleen > Roache. Feb 17, 2010.

In 2010, McCormick launched a $1 billion university fundraising campaign titled Our Rutgers, Our Future: A Campaign for Excellence. Two-thirds of the campaign goal was raised during McCormick's tenure, the largest donation being a $27 million gift for endowed professorships. On May 31, 2011, McCormick submitted his formal resignation to the university Board of Governors, which took effect June 30, 2012. McCormick's successor effective September 1, 2012, Robert L. Barchi, was announced and appointed on April 11, 2012. McCormick has returned to teaching history in Rutgers' Graduate School of Education. He wrote a book titled Raised at Rutgers: A President's Story, which was published by the Rutgers University Press in October 2014. Personal life He is married to Joan Barry McCormick, a 1988 Rutgers alumna and professional fundraiser whose undergraduate degree is in journalism, with a master's degree in public administration from Kean University. McCormick has three children, Betsy, Michael, and Katie. Two of them are from his previous marriage to Suzanne Lebsock, a retired professor of history at Rutgers. He had been married to Lebsock since 1984.\\"U. President's wife files for divorce\\". Catherine Galioto. Nov 5, 2005.

He has won international acclaim for his investigative reporting and non-fiction works on the Northern Ireland conflict. Dillon‚Äôs bestselling trilogy, The Shankill Butchers, The Dirty War & God and the Gun, is considered the definitive account of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Dr. Conor Cruise O‚ÄôBrien, the renowned historian and scholar, described him as \\"our Virgil to that Inferno\\". The Irish Times hailed him as \\"one of the most creative writers of our time\\". Early life Martin Dillon was born in the Lower Falls area of West Belfast, Northern Ireland. He grew up with nine siblings in a traditional Catholic household. His mother, Maureen, looked after the children while his father, Gerard, worked as a watch maker and later telephone engineer to support his large family. Dillon attended the De La Salle Christian Brothers' St Finian's Primary School on the Falls Road. In 1961, aged twelve, he left Belfast to pursue a religious vocation at Montfort College Seminary in Romsey, Hampshire. The seminary was run by the Montfort Fathers, a French religious Order devoted to the teachings of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. After four years, he abandoned it and returned to Belfast to finish his studies at St Malachy's College and St Patrick's, Barnageeha. He attended Belfast College of Business Studies in 1970. Career=Early careerInvestigative journalism and first non-fiction book Martin Dillon began his distinguished career as a newspaper reporter in 1968. He trained with the Irish News, a daily newspaper with a mainly Irish Nationalist readership, and contributed to its weekly publication, The Irish weekly. He reported on a variety of events including those related to \\"the troubles\\" in Northern Ireland. In 1972, he joined the Belfast Telegraph. Mackay, 2017 stated \\"As an investigative journalist Dillon tried to reveal objectively the truth about the Northern Ireland Conflict. Under his forensic gaze, the cruelties and failings of all sides were exposed, whether they were Loyalist, Republican or British\\" Dillon valued his early years in journalism because of the challenges and unique experiences that later found expression in his non-fiction works. In 1973 Dillon published his first non-fiction book, \\"Political Murder in Northern Ireland\\"(co-authored with Denis Lehane). The content of the book is based on much of Dillon‚Äôs own journalistic research and reporting for the Irish News and Belfast Telegraph. Today the book is considered a classic since it is one of the first books about The Troubles. BBC yearsRadio broadcaster, producer/writer, creator of programs and TV shows= In 1973, Dillon joined BBC Northern Ireland‚Äôs Newsroom as a News Assistant. In 1975, he became a Radio Arts producer and later ran the General Programs Radio Department, which constituted the majority of the BBC‚Äôs radio Ulster output in N. Ireland. In that role, he created the Behind the Headlines and Talkback programs. Talkback broke the \\"normal rules of broadcasting\\", over 31 years ago. In 2016, Talkback celebrated its thirtieth anniversary. In 1985, while working as a producer of the Behind the Headlines, he persuaded SDLP leader, John Hume, and Provisional Sinn F√©in President, Gerry Adams, to debate their political positions live on the program. During the broadcast, John Hume agreed to meet the Provisional IRA's Army Council. It was a controversial decision by him, but also a defining moment that led to open a dialogue with the Provisionals. The debate proved to be a seminal element in the genesis of the Northern Ireland peace process. Dillon also introduced John Hume to UDA paramilitary leader, John McMichael, credited with running assassination teams in Northern Ireland. He was offered a contract to work as a producer/writer with BBC 2 award-winning documentary department, Timewatch. His role was to script and produce a major series on the Northern Ireland Troubles. After a year working with the Timewatch, he clashed with the BBC authorities and resigned, reaching a financial settlement. During his 18 years work for the BBC, Dillon created and produced some award-winning TV programs. \\"A brilliant producer (for BBC Northern Ireland radio and TV), Dillon recruited talented outsiders and created iconoclastic programs that brought people living in the most afflicted areas into furious dialogue on air with politicians, police chiefs, comedians and writers. He worked with Paul Muldoon, became friends with Denis Johnston and Se√°n √ì Faol√°in\\" (McKay, 2017). Reviewing Crossing the line \\"Brave chronicler of the Troubles who made a point of crossing the line. Martin Dillon was always determined to uncover the truth of our sordid war AS far as I‚Äôm concerned, Martin Dillon changed the way the Troubles were reported.\\" (Jordan, Sunday World, 17 September 2017) Throughout his broadcasting career, Dillon was known for his abrasive style and controversial programming. He fought against the BBC‚Äôs interpretation of balance in its news and current affairs output. His views brought him a lot of frustration and disillusionment with the BBC narrow interpretation of the concept of balance, which left the BBC‚Äôs Current Affairs department vulnerable to political manipulation in the divisive atmosphere of Northern Ireland. TV commentator, columnist, terrorism analyst and expert In 1992 Dillon left BBC to pursue his writing career. He subsequently became a terrorism analyst and commentator for Sky Television and other television and radio networks. In 1992, he presented a television documentary The Last Colony for Channel Four and RT√â. It examined the origins of The Troubles, focusing on the confusing nature and failure of much of British policymaking of the period, especially of the Tory government led by Prime Minister Edward Heath. The documentary also contained some sensational revelations, including Heath‚Äôs secret declaration that it was legal for British soldiers to shoot protesters on the streets of Northern Ireland because they were \\"enemies of the Crown\\". Later, it formed part of the evidence against Heath at the Bloody Sunday Tribunal in 2003. During that period Dillon published seven best-selling books on the Irish conflict and three plays for radio and television. He also contributed as a TV commentator and terrorism expert to several networks including BBC, RT√â, Sky TV and Channel Four. Notable Works The Shankill Butchers The Dirty war God and the Gun Literary works and themes In his bestselling trilogy The Shankill Butchers, The Dirty War and God and the Gun, Dillon offers a balanced and objective perspective of the conflict, the participants and their motives. As the Irish Times put it \\"Dillon is recommended reading for anyone wishing to understand the complexities of the British ‚Äì Irish politics\\". The Shankill Butchers, A Case Study of Mass Murder, 1989, is a study of Northern Ireland‚Äôs infamous Shankill butchers gang who preyed on Belfast Catholics. Dillon exposes the depravity of the UVF gang that was run by an aggressive psychopath, Lenny Murphy, with the help of one of his brothers. The gang performed unspeakable acts on helpless victims, killing them in a gruesome fashion. Dillon painstakingly interviewed countless civilians, paramilitaries and police officers in compiling the book. According to the Listener, \\"the great value of Martin Dillon‚Äôs carefully researched and readable work is that it enters a world that few journalists have been inclined or able to penetrate\\". The Dirty War, 1990, is a detailed account of the undercover struggle in which all sides fought a no-rules battle, using spies, informants, assassins, disinformation and terrorist agents. Dillon examines the roles played by the Provisional IRA, British Intelligence, including MI5 and Special Branch, British Military Intelligence, the Irish Government, and the British Army, and reveals disturbing facts about the way in which terrorists and the Intelligence agencies targeted, undermined and penetrated each other‚Äôs ranks. Within the pages of the book Dillon was one of the first to expose the IRA‚Äôs practice of executing and secretly burying some of its victims; a practice which subsequently led to public demands for the IRA to reveal the whereabouts of those it made \\"disappear\\". He also unraveled the use of State-sponsored terrorism and the phenomenon of \\"Rompering\\", a form of sadistic torture used by the paramilitaries. Killer in Clowntown  Joe Doherty the IRA and the Special Relationship, 1992, is the tale of Joe Doherty, the convicted IRA gunman who captured American popular opinion by frustrating the British Government‚Äôs attempts to have him extradited from New York to Northern Ireland to serve a 30-year prison sentence for murdering a British Special Air Services Officer. Dillon traces Doherty‚Äôs terror history, providing personal insights into legal events inside the US Attorney‚Äôs office in New York. He unveils proof of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's secret intervention in the case, including how she told the Americans overseeing the Doherty case that she considered his extradition to Britain a quid pro quo for her allowing U.S. jets to use British airspace on the way to bomb Libya. Dillon was asked by the Federal Court in New York to provide testimony about the inner workings of the IRA, based on his work The Dirty War He agreed on condition he would be judged a \\"friend of the court\\" witness and not one seen to be supporting one or the other side in the case. In the end, he was not called to give evidence. According to The Guardian, \\"Dillon‚Äôs book demands the attention of anyone concerned about civil liberties in the United Kingdom‚Ä¶a catalogue of cynicism, lies, harassment, torture and murder that makes the Cold war duplicity a la Deighton and Le Carre seem positively endearing\\". In Stone Cold: True Story of Michael Stone and the Milltown Massacre, 1992, Dillon portrays Michael Stone, a natural born killer, infamous for his murder spree during an IRA funeral in Belfast‚Äôs Milltown Cemetery in March 1988. Stone, armed to the teeth, fired into the crowd of mourners, killing three men and wounding several others. His targets had been the Provisional IRA leaders present at the graveside, in particular Gerry Adams and Martin Mc Guinness. Stone was captured and confessed to a list of other murders, which landed him a life sentence in the Maze Prison where he became a Loyalist icon. Drawing on conversations with Stone in prison, including correspondence with him, as well as on a network of contacts in the military and paramilitary world, Dillon provides a portrait of a charming, boastful, meticulous, sentimental and lethal killer. According to Time Out: \\"Dillon brings his customary expertise to this latest expose of Government complicity in sectarian murder, and delves into the byzantine world of terrorist organization with impressive results\\". In The Enemy Within: The IRA War Against the British, 1994, Dillon examines the IRA bombing campaign in Britain before and after the Second World War, and through to the 1970s and 80s. He analyzes the IRA's flirtation with Nazism and how √âire‚Äôs wartime neutrality conditioned subsequent British policy towards Ireland. Dillon applies his extensive knowledge on the subject to provide new evidence of the political and military mistakes, which he argues, made British cities the most vulnerable in Europe to terrorist attacks. In fact, Dillon reveals for the first time the existence of what the IRA called its \\"England Department.\\" He explains why the British Government held secret talks with the IRA/ Sinn F√©in amid the carnage of Warrington, and what was behind the IRA‚Äôs reluctance to denounce the Downing Street Declaration. It is his contention that the various Government agencies combating the IRA failed to eradicate the terrorist thread, leading to intrigue among them and to MI5 being given the sole responsibility for coordinating the war against the Provisionals. 25 years of Terror: The IRA‚Äôs War against the British, 1996, is the revised edition of The Enemy Within, 1994. Dillon provides the first comprehensive survey of the IRA in Britain. According to Sunday Telegraph, UK: \\"Dillon‚Äôs account is packed with new information and should be required reading. It is a serious study, well researched and competently written\\". The Serpent‚Äôs Tail, 1995, is Dillon‚Äôs first novel, based on a true-life story set against a background of ordinary family life in Catholic West Belfast. Dillon traces the steps of two young Belfast Catholics recruited as informers, who found themselves at the heart of a \\"sting\\" involving the IRA, the SAS and MI5. The film script of the novel won European Script Fund award in 1995. In God and the Gun ‚Äì The Church and Irish Terrorism, 1997, Dillon explores the nexus of religion and paramilitarism. Dillon interviewed paramilitaries and religious figures to discern whether this is a religious war or one of economics and class. The interviewees included the late Billy Wright, a.k.a. \\"King Rat\\", a notorious Protestant assassin killed by the IRA in prison in 1997, Protestant terrorist Pastor Kenny McClinton, and Fr. Pat Buckley who admitted breaking the seal of the confessional to save lives on both sides. According to Publishers Weekly \\"Dillon has written an eye-opening book about a sometimes-incomprehensible sectarian situation\\". In The Trigger Men: Assassins and Terror Bosses in the Ireland Conflict, 2003, Dillon delves into the dark and sinister world of Irish terrorism and counterterrorism. He analyzes the personalities of some of the most dangerous, professional and ruthless killers in Northern Ireland, their motivations and the bizarre crimes they committed. Their individual stories are told in gripping, unflinching detail. Dillon also exposes the ideology of the cult of the gunmen and the greed combined with hatred that motivated the assassins in their killing sprees. He presents penetrating insights into the mindset of terrorist Godfathers and their triggermen like the infamous Protestant assassin Billy Wright, the INLA leader Domenic \\"Mad Dog\\" McGlinchey, \\"Mad dog\\" Jonny Adair, the UDA hitman, Michael Stone, and British terrorist agent, Brian Nelson. Dillon co-authored with Rt. Hon. Roy Bradford Rogue Warrior of the SAS: A Biography of Col. \\"Paddy\\" Blair Mayne, 1987. Lt. Col. \\"Paddy\\" Blair Mayne is regarded as one of the greatest soldiers in the history of military special operations. He is the most decorated fighting soldier of WWII, receiving four DSOs, the Croix de Guerre, and the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur. He was one of the six founder members of the SAS and pioneered tactics used today by Special Forces units across the globe. His exploits against Rommel's Desert forces and against the Nazis in Italy, France and Germany were legendary. His courage, initiative and wildness made him a giant among his men. He was, however, denied the ultimate accolade of the Victoria Cross because of his unorthodox rules of war and his resentment of authority. In 2002, Dillon updated the new, revised edition Rogue Warrior of the SAS - the Blair Mayne Legend, 2003 for Mainstream publishing. Dillon added a postscript with new facts about Mayne's conflicted personal life, in particular, his sexuality, which was a topic purposely omitted in the first edition of the book. Drawing on Mayne's personal letters and family papers, SAS secret records (now declassified), his own war diaries and eyewitness accounts from many who served with him, Dillon presents a compelling and perceptive portrait of a very special warrior. The Assassination of Robert Maxwell: Israel‚Äôs Superspy, 2002, (co-authored with Gordon Thomas) is a biography of media mogul, Robert Maxwell, who played a crucial role for Israel's Mossad spy agency. The authors unveil explosive revelations about Maxwell‚Äôs links to global organized crime, and his schemes to access White House, 10 Downing Street, and the Kremlin, in order to obtain knowledge of highly guarded secrets for Israel. Drawing on private interviews with senior intelligence officers and other integral players, Dillon and Thomas examine the clues, contradictions and cover-up surrounding Maxwell's sudden and suspicious death. Dillon, using his sources within East European intelligence agencies and the FBI, charts Maxwell‚Äôs secret activities in Eastern Europe, especially his personal ties to KGB bosses during the Cold War. In his memoir Crossing the Line-My Life on the Edge, 2017, Dillon, according to Irish Times \\"details a life that‚Äôs involved many incredible moments: witnessing the horrors of the Troubles; encounters with major political figures and paramilitaries; rubbing shoulders with Irish literary greats; a successful broadcasting career, but one where he butted heads with BBC management; and having to leave Northern Ireland because of death threats. Dillon‚Äôs book is replete with such colourful stories involving the politicians, terrorists, artists and writers he met while covering the conflict in Northern Ireland\\". The Squad, 1976, is one of the first plays about the Troubles. It was produced on BBC Radio3 and BBC2 TV by Ronald Mason, the Head of BBC Radio 3 Drama department. \\"He has that unique knack of combining forensic historical fact- based research with the art of thriller-like writing. His books have accurately chartered the terror and the horror of recent Northern Irish history but always in a tone of compassion for the innocent victims caught up in conflict. Works like his 'The Shankill Butchers' and 'The Dirty War' stand the test of time and will be essential reading for generations to come for those trying to make sense out of the madness that was 'The Troubles'\\" (Henry McDonald; author, journalist and Ireland correspondent for The Guardian.) Personal life As a journalist and writer Dillon‚Äôs life has been intertwined with the history of the Troubles and its darkest days. Because of his investigative work in Northern Ireland, Dillon received numerous death threats. In 1988, he left the British Isles with his family and settled in France where he continued to write about the Irish conflict and publish bestselling books. After his divorce from his wife, Katherine Dillon (2000), from whom he has a daughter Nadia Katherine Dillon, born in 1988, he visited New York at the invitation of his publisher, and while there, he decided to make New York his home. He went on to write and broadcast for news outlets in the U.S. and Canada, appearing on CNN, ABC, NPR and NBC as a guest and a global expert on terrorism and organized crime. In 2003, he married, Violeta Kumurdjieva, a Bulgarian journalist and translator. In 2014, they moved from New York City to San Francisco Bay area, California, where Dillon continues to work on his journalism, television and book projects.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. This surah deals with the fundamentals of faith (Aqidah), Tawheed (Islamic monotheism), Risalah (Messengership), Resurrection and the supreme Judgement of God. The surah drives these themes home by drawing attention to God's creation of man through different stages in the mother's womb, His creation of the heavens and the earth, His sending down rains and growing plants, trees and fruits, and His providing of domestic animals with various benefits for man, all together with an emphasis on the fact that man shall die and shall be raised up on the Day of Resurrection. (See also: Islamic eschatology) The theme of Risalah is emphasized with reference to the accounts of some prophets of Islam such as Nuh (Noah), Hud, Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus), noting that all of them delivered the same message of monotheism, but were disbelieved and opposed by the people they preached to, and that all of them were helped and rescued by Allah. A reference is also made to the similar unbelief and opposition of the Meccan leaders to the message delivered to them by Muhammad. The Surah ends with another reference to the inevitability of the Day of Resurrection and pointing out that man will not have a second chance to return to the worldly life and make amends for his lapses and mistakes.√¨ Introduction Two verses of Al-Mu'minoon in Nasta ølƒ´q script. The Surah begins with an assertion, \\"Most certainly the Believers have attained true success\\", intending to put across a point that the criterion of success and failure which people who disbelieve in Islam, hold in mind is in fact erred because it is based on misconceptions and is transitory and limited in nature, in turn leading to eventual failure and not true success. On the contrary, those who follow the teachings of Islam taught by Muhammad, regarded by the disbelievers as failures are actually the ones who are truly successful. Because by their acceptance of the invitation to Islam, they are guaranteed of true success and everlasting bliss in this world as well as in the Hereafter. By rejecting the message of Islam, the non-believers have incurred a profound loss and would meet with the evil consequences both in this world and the next. This is the main theme of the Surah and the whole discourse, from the beginning to the end, is meant to impress the same.Towards Understanding the Quran, Surah 28 Qualities of the believers (1‚Äì11) The first eleven verses of this Surah hence mention the desired qualities of the believers, they are blessed and will attain victory: A brief translation of the first 11 verses is as follows:The Qur'an (Oxford World's Classics), M. A. S. Abdel Haleem (2008) (1) The believers have indeed attained true success! (2) Those who pray humbly, (3) who shun idle talk, (4) who pay the prescribed alms, (5) who guard their chastity (6) except with their spouses or their slaves ‚Äì‚Äìwith these they are not to blame, (7) but anyone who seeks more than this is exceeding the limits‚Äì‚Äì (8) who are faithful to their trusts and pledges (9) and who keep up their prayers, (10) will rightly be given (11) Paradise as their own, there to remain. Possess Al-Khushoo The first quality as described in verse 2 of this Surah is, \\"Those who are humble in their prayers\\"; the Arabic word used to describe the people is 'Khashi'oon' meaning those of who possess 'Al- Khushoo'. According to Tafsir ibn Kathir, a classical Tafsir (i.e. a commentary of the Quran written by Islamic scholar Ibn Kathir), the Arabic word 'Khushoo' encompasses the meanings of calmness, serenity, tranquility, dignity, and humility.\\",Tafsir ibn Kathir, Dar al-Sha'ab Edition, (6/414) while Ibn Abbas explains 'Khashi'oon' to mean, with fear and tranquility.At- Tabaree (19:9) Al-Khushoo is a necessary component of Salaah, however can be very easily lost. In a hadith, Muhammad said \\"The first thing to be lifted up (taken away) from this Ummah will be al-Khushoo; until you will see n o one who has al-Khushoo.\\"Saheeh at-Targheeb, hadith No: 543 To attain al-Khushoo one must forget everything about the world and concentrate in the prayer acts, reciting the Qur'an and thinking of the verses one reads and bearing death, grave and the torment in mind so that he never loses concentration. In his Tafseer, Ibn Kathir writes, \\"Khushoo is gained by the fear of Allah and the sense that He is always watching.\\" In another section he says, \\"The site of al-Khushoo is in the heart and heart is the king of the limbs, so if one intends to pray wholeheartedly the limbs will follow the heart as Allah says (in the Qur'an): 'And seek help in patience and Salaat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard, except for Khashi'oon.' The meaning is that the burden of prayer is heavy indeed; except for those who have Khushoo.\\" Regarding the same verse, i.e. 'And seek help in patience and Salaat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard, except for Khashi'oon.', Ibn Taymiyyah is of the opinion that \\"This (verse) implies condemnation of those who are not Khashi'oon... Condemnation only applies when something obligatory is not done, or when something forbidden is done. If those who do not have Khushoo are to be condemned, this indicates that Khushoo is obligatory.\\"Majmoo al-Fatawa (Compilation of FatwƒÅ), 22/553-558 In his book titled Towards Understanding the Qur'an, Islamic thinker and philosopher Abul Ala Maududi cites a notion that \\"Al-Khushoo of the heart is to fear and stand in awe of a powerful person, and al-Khushoo of the body is to bow one's head and lower one's gaze and voice in his presence. In Salaah one is required to show al-Khushoo, both of the heart and of the body, and this is the essence of this Islamic Prayer. It has been reported that when Muhammad once saw a person offering Salaah, as well as playing with his beard, he remarked: \\"Had he khushu in his heart, his body would have manifested it.\\" Maududi then continues, \\"Though al-Khushoo is actually a condition of the heart, as stated by the above tradition, it is manifested by the body as a matter of course. The Shariah has enjoined certain etiquette which, on the one hand, helps produce al-Khushoo in the heart, and on the other, helps sustain the physical act of the Prayer in spite of the fluctuating condition of the heart. According to this etiquette, one should neither turn to the right or left, nor raise one's head to look up: one may, however, look around from the corner of the eye, but as far as possible, one must fix the gaze on the place where the forehead would rest in prostration; one is also forbidden to shift about, incline side ways, fold the garments or shake off dust from them. It is also forbidden that while going down for prostration, one should clean the place where one would sit or perform prostration. Similarly it is disrespectful that one should stand stuffy erect, recite the verses of the Qur'an in a loud resounding voice, or sing them, or belch or yawn repeatedly and noisily. It has also not been approved that one should offer the Prayer in a hurry. The injunction is that each article of the Prayer should be performed in perfect peace and tranquility, and unless one article has been completely performed, the next should not be begun. If one feels hurt by something during the Prayer, one may cast it aside by one hand, but moving the hand repeatedly or using both the hands for the purpose is prohibited. with this etiquette of the body, it is also important that one should irrelevant things during the Prayer. If thoughts come to the mind intention, it is a natural human weakness, but one should try one's best and try to ensure with one's utmost that the mind and heart are wholly turned towards Allah, and the mind is in full harmony and tune with the tongue, and as soon as one becomes conscious of irrelevant thoughts one should immediately turn the attention to the Prayer\\". Turn away from Al-Lagw The next quality gathered from verse 3 is that the believers turn away from Al-Lagw. The Arabic word Al-Lagw, as explained by Ibn Kathir.The Success is for the Believers, Surah 23, Tafsir ibn Kathir in his Tafseer, refers to falsehood, which encompasses all acts of sin, including the greatestAbout Islam - The Muslim's Creed , Fatwa-Online.com of them i.e. Shirk in Islam, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit. In a Sahih hadith from the al-Tirmidhi collection of a·∏•adƒ´th, Muhammad is reported to have said: \\"Out of a person being a good Muslim is his leaving alone, what does not benefit him\\"; while in the Sahih al-Bukhari (the Sahih of Muhammad al-Bukhari) he is also reported to have said \\"Let he who truly believes in Allah and the Last Day speak good or be silent.\\". In his Musnad Ahmed, Imam Ahmed has reported,Musnad Ahmed \\"The faith of a man cannot be straight unless his heart is straight, and his heart cannot be straight, unless his tongue becomes straight.\\" It was from the manners of the Sahabah to speak very little, while Abu Dharr al-Ghifari said: \\"Adopt silence, this is the way of causing Shaytan to run away; it is a supporter to you in the matter of your religion.\\" Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud is reported to have said: \\"By the One other than whom there is no God on this earth there is no one more deserving of long imprisonment that the tongue.\\" In another place, Surah 2:83 mentions that the covenant taken by Musa (i.e. Moses) from Bani Israel had also included the condition that they should indulge in good and worthwhile conversation, while being kind to parents, kindred, orphans and those in need, practice regular charity and to worship God alone. While, Sura 104:1-19 condemns those who are scandal/gossip-mongers and backbiters in strong terms, describing their punishment as \\"Nay, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One; And what will explain to thee what the Consuming One is! (It is) the Fire of (the Wrath of) Allah kindled (to a blaze), Which rises above the hearts. Surely it shall be closed over upon them, In outstretched columns.\\", thus hinting that believers need to steer clear of such acts. Pay the Zakat Verse 4 says that the believers pay Zakat, i.e. poor-due that is paid on one's wealth. Commentators on the Qur'an, like Ibn Kathir are of the opinion that this verse could also be referring to the poor-due mentioned in Sura 6:141 which states \\"pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest.\\", as well as that it could be that what is meant here by Zakaat is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in Sura 91:9-10 which says \\"Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.\\" The commentators are hence of the opinion that probably both meanings are intended, purification of the soul as well as purification of one's wealth, because that is also part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. Surah 9:60 lists those who are eligible to receive Zakaat by saying \\"Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom\\", while Sura 17:26 commands the believers to \\"Render to the kindred their due rights, as (also) to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. \\" The believers are also advised to \\"listen and obey and spend in charity\\" for \\"the benefit of your own soul\\" and be from the ones who \\"achieve prosperity\\", as mentioned in Sura 64:16. Avoid Zina, i.e. guard their chastity Verses 5 through to 7 of this Surah says \\"And who guard their modesty; Save from their wives or the (slaves) that their right hands possess, for then they are not blameworthy, But whoso craveth beyond that, such are transgressors. Zina (extramarital sex) is one of the major sins in Islam concerning which stern warnings have been issued in the Qur'an as well as authentic a·∏•adƒ´th attributed to Muhammad. In Surah 17:32, God says \\"‚Ä¶come not near to Zina. Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way.\\" The Qur'an also says that Homosexuality too is Haraam (sinful) and it is against the natural inclination which God has placed in man, whereby the male is inclined towards female and vice versa. In an authentic hadith from the Tirmidhi collection, Muhammad is reported to have said: \\"There is nothing I fear for my Ummah more than the deed of the people of Lot.\\".Al-Tirmidhi: hadith no. 1457 Authenticated by Shaikh al-Albanee in Saheeh al-Jamee (1552) Surah 27:54-58 refers to the punishment that befell the people of Lut: \\"And (remember) Lut when he said to his people, 'Do you commit al-Fahishah (evil, great sin, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, sodomy) while you see (one another doing evil without any screen) Do you practice your lusts on men instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly.' There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: 'Drive out the family of Loot from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!' So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind. And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned.\\" Muhammad has also thus said: \\"Whoever of you finds (someone) doing the deed of the people of Lot, kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.\\"Al-Tirmidhi, hadith: 1456, Authenticated by Shaikh al-Albanee in Saheeh al-Jamee :6589 Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya is of the opinional-Jawaab al-Kafi, p.115 that: \\"Both of them - fornication and homosexuality - involve immorality that goes against the wisdom of Allah's creation and commandment. For homosexuality involves innumerable evil and harms, and the one to whom it is done would be better off being killed than having this done to him, because after that he will become so evil and so corrupt that there can be no hope of his being reformed, and all good is lost for him, and he will no longer feel any shame before Allah or before His creation‚Ä¶The scholars differed as to whether the one to whom it is done will ever enter Paradise. There are two opinions which I heard Shaikh al-Islam (rahimahullah) narrate.\\" Are faithful to their covenants The next verse, i.e. Sura 23:8 stresses on the quality trust that the believers' are to possess describing them as \\"Those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants\\". A similar message is found in Sura 4:58 where the Qur'an ordains God's command as, \\"Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due‚Ä¶\\" The believers in Islam are thus ordered fulfill the terms and conditions of the trusts which are placed in their charge. The Arabic word al-Amanah (or al-Amanat) includes all kinds of trusts which are placed in their charge including those placed by God as well as those placed by the society or individuals. Similarly, the Arabic term '\`ahd' encompasses all compacts, pledges, and promises made between God and man, and amongst men themselves. Muhammad would always impress the importance of the fulfillment of pledges in his addresses to the people. On one occasion he is reported to have said \\"The one, who does not fulfill the terms of his trust, has no Faith, and the one, who does not keep promises and pledges has no Islam.\\"\\". Muhammad, in Sahih Muslim is also reported to have said \\"The rights will be rendered back to those to whom they are due, and even the sheep that does not have horns will take revenge from the horned sheep.\\"Sahih Muslim, 4:1097 And on another occasion he is reported to have said \\"Certainly, al-Amanah (the trust or moral responsibilities, etc. and all the duties which Allah has ordained) descended from the Heaven and settled in the roots of the hearts of the faithful believers, and then the Qur'an was revealed, and the people read the Qur'an (and learnt al-Amanah from it) and also learnt it from the Sunnah. (i.e. Both the Qur'an and As-Sunnah strengthen the faithful believers' 'Amanah').\\"Sahih al-Bukhari (vol. 9, no. 381) Regarding the verse 8 from Surah Al-Mu‚Äôminoon, Tafsir ibn Kathir says \\"When they (the Believers) are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word.\\" =Four characteristics of a hypocrite= According to a tradition reported both by Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, Muhammad is reported to have said: \\"Four characteristics are such that if a person has all the four in him, he is beyond any doubt a hypocrite, and the one who has one of these, is a hypocrite to that extent till he gives it up: *(a) When something is placed in his trust, he commits breach of the trust, *(b) when he speaks, he tells a lie, *(c) when he makes a promise, he breaks it, and, *(d) when he has a quarrel with somebody, he exceeds all limits (of decency and morality)\\"'' Strictly guard their Salaat In the next verse, i.e. verse 9, Allah mentions preserving of Salaah (the formal Islamic prayer) as one of the important characteristics of successful believers. Verse 2 implied the believers' humility during act of performing Salaah, while verse 9 refers to the individual prayers offered in their own times. Believers are described as those strictly adhering to the prescribed times, performing them with due regard to their pre-requisites, conditions and articles with clean body and dress, and necessary ablutions. Believers are required to not regard their prayers as an unnecessary burden, completing the task mechanically, but are to understand their recital while being conscious that they are supplicating like humble servants. Prophet Muhammed is reported to have said \\"The first duty that Allah, the Supreme, has ordained upon my nation is that of offering Prayer, and indeed Prayer is the first thing that will be taken account of on the Day of Resurrection.\\" as well as \\"Whoever keeps the Prayer established, has kept his religion established - and whoever leaves Prayer has demolished religion (i.e. left the fold of Islam)\\".Kitaab-us-Salaat by Allama Maulana Syed Shah Turabul Haque Qadri[Narrated by Hazarath Jabir and reported by Muslim] While, the Qur'an makes it clear that the purpose for creation is to worship Allah alone, and that the most excellent way of praying is to offer Salaah standing before Allah in devout obedience. The Islamic Adhaan (call for prayer) which is recited at time of each prayer contains two verses (each recited twice) \\"Hayya‚Äôala-Salaah\\" and \\"Hayya‚Äôala-Falaah\\" which translate to \\"Come to Salaah\\" and \\"Come to success\\" respectively, indicating that by performing Salaah, one may attain eternal success. In a Hadith reference, Abdullah ibn Mas'ud narrates \\"I asked Allah's Messenger, Prophet Muhammed: \\"O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah?\\" He said: \\"Prayer at the appointed time.\\" I said: \\"Then what?\\" He said: \\"Kindness to parents.\\" I said: \\"Then what?\\" He said: \\"Jihad (struggle) in the way of Allah.\\"\\".Sahih Muslim, (vol.1, no.89)Sahih Bukhari, Book 4, Volume 52, Hadith 41 Prophet Muhammed is also reported to have likened the Salaah to five daily baths that cleanse a persons sins; Abu Huraira narrates that \\"I heard Allah's Apostle saying, \\"If there was a river at the door of anyone of you and he took a bath in it five times a day would you notice any dirt on him?\\" They said, \\"Not a trace of dirt would be left.\\" The Prophet added, \\"That is the example of the five prayers with which Allah blots out (annuls) evil deeds.\\"Sahih Bukhari, Book 10, Volume 1, Hadith 506 The Qur'an has also pointed out that believers perform Salaah only to earn the pleasure of Allah and not to impress anyone else, calling anyone who does so a hypocrite. Moreover, those who abandon Salaah are warned of dire consequences, while only those who humbly submit themselves to Allah alone are said to have ease in offering it. In Surah Al- Ma'arij, Allah uses the word halu‚Äôan to describe the restless and impatient nature of man, stating that whenever he is afflicted with trouble he lacks patience and trembles in despair. This occurs due to shortcomings in his faith, whereas when he is given in abundance he becomes ungrateful towards Allah. He is also arrogant and uncaring towards those less fortunate than him. The Qur'an then assures the observance of Salaah as way to preserve hope in times of grievance and humbleness as well as humility in periods of bountiful life. Salaah thus has the power to erase the roots of evil deeds which bring barriers in the society giving birth to racial as well as financial discriminations and sinful intentions. Good news of paradise for the believers After mentioning the characteristics of the successful believer, God gives them the good news of Firdaus (Ajma' (ÿπÿ¨ŸÖÿßÿ°)). Muhammad said: \\"If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Firdaus, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.\\"Fath al- Bari (13: 415) Abu Hurairah said: \\"The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: \\"There is not one among you who does not have two homes; a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: 'These are indeed the heirs.'\\"Ibn Maja (2): 1453 See also *Zina *Salaah *Zakaat *Jannah *Islamic eschatology References External links  Muminun ","title":"Al-Mu'minoon"},{"id":"1344472","text":"Nagoya Stock Exchange Nagoya Stock Exchange (ÂêçÂè§Â±ãË®ºÂà∏ÂèñÂºïÊâÄ Nagoya Sh≈çken Torihikijo, NSE) is a stock trading market in Nagoya, Japan.

He was ranked number 2 in the world in 1934 and 1936, and number 1 in the world in 1937. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1977, an organisation which considers that he is \\"most remembered for a gallant effort in defeat against Don Budge in the 1937 Interzone Final at Wimbledon\\". Cramm represented Germany during the rise of the Nazi party to power in the 1930s. The Nazi regime attempted to exploit his appearance and skill as a symbol of Aryan supremacy, but he refused to identify with Nazism. He was persecuted as a homosexual by the German government and was jailed briefly in 1938. Cramm figured briefly in the gossip columns as the sixth husband of Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heiress. Birth Castle Oelber, the family's summer estate and Castle Br√ºggen, where Cramm grew up. The third of the seven sons of Burchard Baron (Freiherr) von Cramm, by his marriage to Jutta Countess (Gr√§fin) von Steinberg, Cramm was born at the family estate, Castle Nettlingen, Lower Saxony, Germany and grew up in Castle Br√ºggen which also belonged to his family. A younger brother, Wilhelm-Ernst Freiherr von Cramm (1917‚Äì1996), was a German officer who was highly decorated during the Second World War, and who after the war was leader of the German Party, a conservative German political party. Tennis career In 1932, Cramm earned a place in the German Davis Cup team and won the first of four straight German national tennis championships. During this time he also teamed up with Hilde Krahwinkel to win the 1933 Mixed Doubles title at Wimbledon. Noted for his gentlemanly conduct and fair play, he gained the admiration and respect of his fellow tennis players. He earned his first individual Grand Slam title in 1934, winning the French Open. His victory made him a national hero in his native Germany; however, it was by chance that he won just after Adolf Hitler had come to power. The handsome, blond Gottfried von Cramm fitted perfectly the Aryan race image of a Nazi ideology that put pressure on all German athletes to be superior. However, Cramm steadfastly refused to be a tool for Nazi propaganda. Germany effectively lost its 1935 Davis Cup Interzone Final against the US when Cramm refused to take a match point in the deciding game, by notifying the umpire that the ball had tipped his racket, and thus calling a point against himself, although no one had witnessed the error.Paul Fein, Tennis Confidential: Today's Greatest Players, Matches, and Controversies, Brassey's, 2003 p.144. For three straight years Cramm was the men's singles runner-up at the Wimbledon Championships, losing memorable matches in the final to England's Fred Perry in 1935 and again in 1936. The following year he lost in the final to American Don Budge, both at Wimbledon and at the U.S. Open. In 1935, he was beaten in the French Open final by Perry, but turned the tables the following year and defeated Perry, gaining his second French championship. In an attempt to get Cramm to be more cooperative ideologically, the Nazi government punished his previous unwillingness by not allowing him to compete in the 1937 French championship, even though he was the defending champion. Despite his Grand Slam play, Gottfried von Cramm is most remembered in England for his deciding match against Don Budge during the 1937 Davis Cup. He was ahead 4‚Äì1 in the final set when Budge launched a comeback, eventually winning 8‚Äì6 in a match considered by many as the greatest battle in the annals of Davis Cup play and one of the pre-eminent matches in all of tennis history. In a later interview, Budge said that Cramm had received a phone call from Hitler minutes before the match started and had come out pale and serious and had played each point as though his life depended on winning.\\"Don Budge Describes his 1937 Davis Cup Semi-final Match Against Baron Gottfried von Cramm\\" Others say that Budge believed a tale invented by Teddy Tinling (at the time the \\"call boy\\" who ushered players onto the Centre Court at Wimbledon) that Hitler had telephoned Cramm before the match. Imprisonment on morals charges Despite his enormous popularity with the public, on 5 March 1938, Gottfried von Cramm was arrested by the German government and tried on the charge of a homosexual relationship with Manasse Herbst, a young Galician Jewish actor and singer, who had appeared in the 1926 silent film Der Sohn des Hannibal. After being hospitalized for a nervous collapse after his arrest, on 14 March he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment Cramm admitted the relationship, which had lasted from 1931 until 1934 and had begun shortly before he married his first wife. He was additionally charged with sending money to Herbst, who had moved to Palestine in 1936. According to a report on the trial in the New York Times of 15 May 1938, the judge stated that \\"Baron von Cramm had alleged that his wife, during their honeymoon, had become intimate with a French athlete. The court held that this experience had unsettled the young tennis star and had resulted in his seeking a perverse compensation for an unhappy married life.\\" Although Cramm had confessed to an affair with Herbst once he was arrested, he later changed his confession to one of \\"mutual masturbation\\", and his lawyer was able to convince the judge that Cramm had been forced into sending money to Herbst because Herbst was a \\"sneaky Jew.\\" Cramm's international tennis friends were outraged at his treatment. Don Budge collected the signatures of high-profile athletes and sent a protest letter to Hitler. His friend King Gustaf V of Sweden also pressured the German government to have him released. Cramm was released on parole after six months, and in May 1939 returned to competitive tennis. The extremely tense political climate caused problems when he went to play in England. Nevertheless, Cramm was allowed to compete at the Queen's Club tournament in London, where he won the event by beating American Bobby Riggs 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì1. Officials at Wimbledon reportedly refused to let him play in their tournament, using the excuse that he was a convicted criminal and therefore unfit; The New York Times, however, quoted Wimbledon sources as saying that Cramm would have been welcome to participate, had he submitted an entry. The U.S. rejected Cramm's temporary-visa application that same year, citing his morals-charge conviction, and preventing him from playing at the U.S. Open in September. A further humiliation was Germany's decision in 1940 to recall Cramm from an international tennis tournament in Rome before he had a chance to play. The New York Times reported that his abrupt departure \\"was attributed to the German authorities' desire to prevent the former champion from meeting Henner Henkel, Rolf Goepffert, and other German players...Berlin decided it would be embarrassing if Cramm beat his compatriots...\\" Wartime service and postwar career In May 1940, some months after the outbreak of the Second World War, Cramm was conscripted into military service as a member of the Hermann Goering Division. He saw action on the Eastern Front and was awarded the Iron Cross. Despite his noble background, Cramm was enlisted as a private soldier until being given a company to command. His company faced harsh conditions on the Eastern Front, and Cramm was flown out suffering from frostbite, with much of his company dead. Because of his previous conviction, he was dismissed from military service in 1942. While the war robbed Cramm of some of his best years as a tennis player, he won the German national championship in 1948 and again in 1949, when he was 40 years old. He went on playing Davis Cup tennis until retiring after the 1953 season and still holds the record for the most wins by any German team member. Following his retirement from active competition, Cramm served as an administrator in the German Tennis Federation and became successful in business as a cotton importer. In addition, he managed the landed estate he had inherited from his father in Wispenstein, in Lower Saxony. Marriages Gottfried von Cramm married: *Baroness Elisabeth \\"Lisa\\" von Dobeneck (1912‚Äì1975), a daughter of Robert, Baron von Dobeneck and his wife, the former Maria Hagen, a granddaughter of the Jewish banker Louis Hagen. They married on 1 September 1930 and divorced in 1937. Lisa von Cramm later married the German ice-hockey star Gustav Jaenecke. *Barbara Hutton, an American socialite and an heiress to the Woolworth five-and-dime fortune. The couple married in 1955 and divorced in 1959. He had married her in order to \\"help her through substance abuse and depression but was unable to help her in the end.\\" Death While on a business trip, Cramm and his driver were killed in an automobile accident near Cairo, Egypt, in 1976, when the baron's car collided with a truck. Two roads were named in his honor, the Gottfried-von- Cramm-Weg in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, where the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club is located, and a similarly named road in the small town of Merzig. Gottfried von Cramm was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1977. In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and a great player, included Gottfried von Cramm in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. Cramm was the subject of a radio play, titled Playing for His Life, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in June 2011. The play focused on the 1937 Interzone Davis Cup final and on Cramm's personal life.Playing for his life, Afternoon drama, BBC Radio 4, 2011-06-24. Retrieved 2014-02-04.

Most people build larger houses now and with other types of roofs, but the turf roof is still popular in some places. Johanna TG 326 was built in Sussex, England in 1884, but was sold to the village V√°gur in the Faroe Islands in 1894, where it was a fishing vessel until around 1972. The smack was restored in the 1980s and now gives pleasure trips.Johanna.fo, History The culture of the Faroe Islands has its roots in the Nordic culture. The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is Faroese. It is one of three insular Scandinavian languages descended from the Old Norse language spoken in Scandinavia in the Viking Age, the others being Icelandic and the extinct Norn, which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and Norwegian, but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling Danes outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), √¶vintyr (stories) and kv√¶√∞i (ballads, often set to music and the mediaeval chain dance). These were eventually written down in the 19th century mostly by Danish scholars. Music and dance Traditional Faroese music was primarily vocal, and was not accompanied by musical instruments. Only in T√≥rshavn instruments like fiddles were present in the older days. When trade grew in the 20th century the Faroese started to use imported musical instruments. Much of the imported music and instruments remained popular only in the capital and largest city, T√≥rshavn. Rural peoples remained true to traditions of the chain dance and ballads. The Faroese chain dance is a dance, which only survived in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its pagan origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing around in various wobbles within the circle. There are no musical instruments used along with the dance, the dancers are singing ballads of various lengths, in either Faroese language or Danish, the latter of which is pronounced in G√∏tudanskt. One man or woman leads the song by singing the first few words and then the others follow. The leader is called \\"skipari\\" (organizer). A ballad can be very long with a couple of hundred verses, which the skipari is expected to know by heart The following description is by V. U. Hammershaimb, F√¶r√∏sk Anthologi, 1891: Such is the importance of the dance as a cultural element that the Faroese refer to it as Faroese dance. However, it shall be stated that the dance hasn't the same popularity it once had. This especially applies to younger generations. Literature and art Listasavn F√∏roya (The National Art Museum of the Faroe Islands is in T√≥rshavn). Faroese literature in the traditional sense of the word has only really developed in the past 100‚Äì200 years. This is mainly because the Faroese language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890 (in 1854 Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb published a written standard for Modern Faroese that exists to this day. He produced orthography consistent with a continuous written tradition extending back to Old Norse).DenStoreDanske.dk, V.U. Hammershaimb (in Danish) The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. The most famous of these authors are J√∏rgen-Frantz Jacobsen (known for his sole novel Barbara) and William Heinesen. Both authors wrote in Danish. Other famous authors from the Faroes include He√∞in Br√∫ (The Old Man and His Sons) and J√≥anes Nielsen. Poets include the brothers Janus and Hans Andreas Djurhuus, and R√≥i Patursson. Both Heinesen and Patursson have been awarded The Nordic Council's Literature Prize. As with literature, painting only really took off in the 20th century in the Faroes. Famous Faroese painters include S√°muel Joensen-Mikines, Ing√°lvur av Reyni, Ruth Smith, Tr√≥ndur Patursson, Steffan Danielsen and Amariel Nor√∞oy among others.Art.fo, the Faroese National Art Museum Handcrafts TB Tv√∏royri is the oldest football club of the Faroe Islands, it was founded in 1892. √ìli Johannesen (in black/white) holds the record for most capped player of the Faroe Islands national football team.

There are 7 regattas held around the islands every summer, where boats in different sizes compete. Here is the largest boat type 10-mannaf√∏r. Lace knitting is a traditional handcraft of peoples of the Faroe Islands. The most distinguishing characteristic of Faroese lace shawls is the center back gusset shaping.

There have been rowing competitions a long time back, at least as far back as to the 1930s, and now the competitions are still in a regular routine, held in seven different places during the weekends of June and July. The races are always part of a regional festival, called a stevna, with many other activities as well. The first regatta is always held in Klaksv√≠k on Nor√∞oyastevna in the first Saturday of June, sometimes it can be in the last Saturday of May. The final regatta is always held in T√≥rshavn on the national day, or actually on the day before the national day, which is called √ìlavs√∏ka. The boat race on √ìlavs√∏ka is the only race which is not necessarily held on a Saturday, but on the 28 July, whatever the day of the week it is. The regattas in between the Nor√∞oyastevna and √ìlavs√∏ka are held in these locations: J√≥ans√∏ka is every even year held in V√°gur and every odd year in Tv√∏royri, both villages are in Su√∞uroy (South Island), and this is the only place which is not possible to drive by car from T√≥rshavn, people have to take the ferry Smyril to Su√∞uroy, which is a two-hour journey.

A serrated cutting edge has many small points of contact with the material being cut. By having less contact area than a smooth blade or other edge, the applied pressure at each point of contact is greater and the points of contact are at a sharper angle to the material being cut. This causes a cutting action that involves many small splits in the surface of the material being cut, which cumulatively serve to cut the material along the line of the blade. In nature, serration is commonly seen in the cutting edge on the teeth of some species, usually sharks. However, it also appears on non-cutting surfaces, for example in botany where a toothed leaf margin or other plant part, such as the edge of a carnation petal, is described as being serrated. A serrated leaf edge may reduce the force of wind and other natural elements. Probably the largest serrations on Earth occur on the skylines of mountains (the Spanish word sierra, as in Sierra Nevada, means a saw). These occur both due to the uneven action of landform edges pushing rock upwards, and the uneven action of erosion. Human uses of serration have copied, and gone beyond, those found in nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other serrated blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to cut cloth with a serrated edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing the average length of a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show serration in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made with serrated edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The step clamp and step block assembly in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.

ADSL allows the provision of voiceband services including plain old telephone service (POTS) and data services up to 56 kbit/s, and a variety of digital channels. In the direction from the network to the customer premises (downstream), the digital bearer channels may consist of full-duplex low-speed bearer channels and simpler high-speed bearer channels; in the other (upstream) direction, only low-speed bearer channels are provided. Description The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Telecommunications Committee created the first standardized ADSL specifications. They were published as ANSI T1.413-1995 and ANSI T1.413-1998 (sometimes called \\"issue 2\\") titled Network and Customer Installation Interfaces ‚Äî Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) Metallic Interface. It defines the minimum requirements for satisfactory performance of ADSL systems using the Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) line code. DMT divides the useful bandwidth of the standard two wire copper medium used in the public switched telephone network (PSTN), which is 0 to 1104 kHz, into 256 separate 4.3125 kHz wide frequency bands called sub-carriers. Up to 254 sub-carriers are used downstream; each of these 254 sub-carriers can support the modulation of 0 to 15 bits per baud. The baud is 4,000 symbols per second on each subcarrier. Thus the maximum theoretical downstream data rate of an ADSL system is 15.24 Mbit/s (254√ó15√ó4000). However, because the data is split up into packets (actually Reed‚ÄìSolomon encoded codewords) of 255 bytes, the maximum achievable downstream data rate is 8.128 Mbit/s (including other overheads). It is possible to interleave two Reed-Solomon codewords and obtain one logical codeword of 510 bytes. If this is done, then the maximum theoretical downstream speed goes back up to around 15 Mbit/s. In the upstream direction, a maximum of 30 sub-carriers can be used, again each frame modulated with up to 15 bits. Taken with the baud rate of 4,000 per second per subcarrier, the maximum throughput is just over 1.5 Mbit/s. In order to combine voice telephone service with downstream and upstream ADSL signals the bandwidth is split into discrete parts using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). In this case: 0‚Äì4kHz is for voice, 26‚Äì138 kHz is the upstream band and 138‚Äì1104 kHz is the downstream band.

It is the world's largest producer of platinum, with around 40% of world output, as well as being a major producer of diamonds, copper, nickel, iron ore and metallurgical and thermal coal. The company has operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. Anglo American has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company has a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. History=1917‚Äì1990 Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a Jewish German √©migr√©, founded the Anglo American Corporation (AAC) in 1917 in Johannesburg, South Africa, with financial backing from the American bank J.P. Morgan & Co. and ¬£1 million raised from UK and US sources to start the gold mining company; this fact is reflected in the company's name. The AAC became the majority stakeholder in the De Beers company in 1926, a company formerly controlled by Alfred Beit, also a Jewish German √©migr√©.Chilvers, Henry (1939). The Story of De Beers. Cassell. p. 227. During 1945, the AAC moved into the coal industry by acquiring Coal Estates. Twelve years later, Sir Ernest died in Johannesburg and was succeeded as head of the company by his son Harry, who also became chairman of De Beers. In the late 1940s and 1950s, the AAC focused on the development of the Free State goldfields (seven major mines simultaneously) and the Vaal Reefs mine. In 1961, the AAC expanded outside of southern Africa for the first time and became a major investor in the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company in Canada. In 1967, the company moved into the steel industry by acquiring Scaw Metals. From 1967 to 1975, it continued to grow and established a number of ventures, including the Mondi Group (timber, pulp and paper), Amgold (later AngloGold Ashanti) and then Amcoal (through the consolidation of several of its mining operations in South Africa; later known as Anglo Coal and in 2010 changed to Anglo Thermal). In 1982, Harry Oppenheimer retired as chairman of the AAC and was succeeded by Gavin Relly. Two years later, Oppenheimer retired from De Beers and passed the chairmanship to Julian Ogilvie Thompson, who in 1990 also became chairman and chief executive of the AAC. 1990‚Äì2010 Sculptures outside Anglo American offices in London On 24 May 1999, Anglo American Corporation merged with Minorco to form Anglo American plc, with its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Its gold mining operations were spun off into the separate AngloGold corporation, which in 2004 merged with the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation to form AngloGold Ashanti. Anglo American reduced its stake in AngloGold Ashanti to 16.6% in 2008. In 2000, Julian Ogilvie Thompson retired as chief executive of Anglo American and was succeeded by Tony Trahar. Ogilvie Thompson also retired as chairman in 2002 and was replaced by Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. In the same year, Anglo American acquired Tarmac, a supplier of building materials, and Shell Petroleum Company's Australian coal assets. In 2001, De Beers was privatised after being a listed company for more than 70 years. In 2002, South Africa's Mining Charter was approved, and Anglo American and other mining companies with operations in the country were mandated to transfer a percentage of their South African production to historically disadvantaged South Africans. From 2002 to July 2008 Anglo American carried out black community economic empowerment transactions (across all businesses with operations in South Africa) totalling R26 billion. Also, in 2002, Anglo Base Metals acquired the Disputada copper operations in Chile from ExxonMobil and opened a representative office in Beijing, China. In 2003, Anglo American acquired a majority stake in iron ore producer Kumba Resources. In 2007, Cynthia Carroll succeeded Tony Trahar, becoming the first non-South African and first female chief executive of Anglo American. The Mondi Group, a paper and packaging business, was also spun out in 2007. During the next two years, Anglo American opened a representative office in New Delhi, India, acquired control of the Michiquillay copper project in northern Peru and the MMX Minas-Rio and Amapa iron ore projects in Brazil, and later acquired stakes in the Pebble copper project in Alaska. Anglo American was also accused in 2007 of damaging environmental practices: in order to complete its planned Alaskan Pebble Mine in collaboration with Northern Dynasty Minerals, the company considered building a massive dam at the headwaters of the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery, which it would risk obliterating. Opponents also pointed to the use of cyanide, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage which can all have potentially devastating effects on the environment of the Bristol Bay area. Opponents of the Pebble Mine created Ballot Measure 4 to impose additional water quality standards on new large-scale mines in the state. However, in August 2007, Alaskans voted against the initiative. As of September 2008, the Pebble Limited Partnership had not yet put forward a project proposal and was working to prepare a prefeasibility study for the project in the second half of 2009. The mine proposal would still need to undergo environmental studies and the permitting process, including being subject to state and federal water protections. In December 2013, Anglo American withdrew from the Pebble Limited Partnership. 2010 to present In early November 2011, Anglo American entered into talks with the Oppenheimer family to divest the latter's remaining shares of De Beers, whereby Anglo American acquired an additional 40% stake for $5.1 billion, increasing their overall stake to 85%. This came at a time of increased labour strikes and international attention to Oppenheimer's involvement in conflict diamonds. Anglo American then sold a 24.5% share in its Chilean copper unit, Anglo American Sur, to Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation for $5.39 billion, paid with a promissory note due on 10 November 2011. With this deal, the Anglo American Sur complex was valued at $22 billion. In November 2012, Anglo American completed the sale of steel maker Scaw South Africa and its connected companies for a total of R3.4 billion in cash. In July 2014, Anglo American said it was disposing of its 50% shareholding in Lafarge Tarmac, a building materials joint venture, to cement maker Lafarge SA for a value of not less than ¬£885 million ($1.5 billion); the sale was subsequently completed in July 2015 for $1.6 billion. In October 2014, Anglo American's Minas-Rio iron ore project in Brazil began operating and shipping ore. In July 2015, Anglo American announced that it would cut 53,000 jobs (35% of their workforce) and that in the first half of 2015, they had a financial loss of US$3 billion. In early December 2015, the company announced that, as part of a restructure, it would be cutting a further 85,000 mining jobs, nearly two-thirds of its work force of 135,000, worldwide. It also announced the consolidation of six of its divisions into three businesses, while dividend payouts to investors were also suspended for a year. The company also had its Dawson, Foxleigh and Callide coal mines in Central Queensland, as well as its Dartbrook coal mine in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, put up for sale as its shares dropped to a record low on the London Stock Exchange, falling by more than 12 per cent. In March 2017, British Indian industrialist Anil Agarwal purchased 11% of the company through his family trust Volcan. In September, he took the holding to 20% through another purchase worth about $1.5 billion. In April 2017, the company sold its Eskom-linked thermal coal operations in South Africa for $166 million, marking an important step in the mining giant's strategic overhaul to sharpen its focus on three commodities. In October 2019, Anglo American announced a partnership with French energy company Engie to develop the world's largest hydrogen-powered mine haul truck, with testing expected to begin in 2020. In January 2020, Anglo American made a 5.5p per share offer to buy a polyhalite fertiliser project (in North Yorkshire, England) from Sirius Minerals for ¬£400m. In salvaging the financially troubled project, Anglo American envisages spending around ¬£230m to keep construction going through to at least 2022. The sale was approved by shareholders in March 2020. Operations Anglo American focuses on natural resources with six core businesses: Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil, coal (thermal and metallurgical),base metals (copper, nickel, niobium and phosphates), platinum, and diamonds, through De Beers, in which it owns an 85% share. In 2008, the company had 105,000 permanent employees and 39,000 contract employees in its managed operations across 45 countries. In 2008, Anglo American (excluding De Beers) spent $212 million on exploring 21 countries for resources including copper, nickel, niobium phosphates and zinc. The two main types of exploration for the company are greenfield and brownfield, with nearly 70% devoted to greenfield projects. Anglo American, along with De Beers, backed the manufacturing of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to help improve the sensitivity of exploration surveys. Anglo American established Boart Products South Africa Limited in 1936 (later named Boart International) to turn the company's stockpile of boart, or low-grade natural diamonds, into drilling products. This initiative resulted in the development of the first mechanically set diamond drill bit and later led to additional research into cutting and abrasive tools. In December 2010, following delays and high costs, Anglo American gained a key licence from the Brazilian government that would allow work to start on the Minas-Rio iron ore project. Production is initially expected to be 26.5 million tonnes per year; iron ore would be sent through a 525 km slurry pipeline to the Port of A√ßu. As of October 2014, Minas-Rio is operational and shipping ore. In November 2014, Anglo American Platinum awarded the design and construction of its Amandelbult Chrome Recovery Plant to Logiman PTY(Ltd). The project was completed on schedule and within budget according to AAP's CEO Mr. Chris Griffith and is now performing well above nameplate design capacity. The inclusion of the Mantserre community, by AAP and Logiman, in the construction as well as for the supply of equipment remains a highlight of the project. In July 2018, Anglo American announced that it would spend $5.3 billion on developing the Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which the company acquired in 1992, with the Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi funding 40% of the total cost. As part of the project, Anglo American also committed 650 million soles ($195 million) towards local community developments projects in Moquegua, where the Quellaveco mine is located.

It is located from Paris. Inhabitants of Montlh√©ry are known as Montlh√©riens. History Montlh√©ry lay on the strategically important road from Paris to Orl√©ans. Under the Merovingians, it was owned by the church in Reims and in 768 it was given to the abbey of St. Denis in Paris. It was the site of a number of battles between the lords of Montlh√©ry and the early Capetian monarchy. The Montlh√©ry noble house was related to the Montmorency family; Thibaud, the founder of the Montlh√©ry dynasty, was the brother of Bouchard II, the progenitor of the Montmorency house. Thibaud ruled from 970 to 1031 and was succeeded by his son Guy I, who ruled until 1095. Guy I's children married into other local noble families: his daughter Melisende married Hugh, count of Rethel, and another daughter Elizabeth married Joscelin of Courtenay. Through these marriages and subsequent Montlh√©ry participation on the First Crusade, Guy I was the ancestor of the ruling dynasties of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Edessa. Another daughter, Alice, married into the Le Puiset family, and a son, Guy, became count of Rochefort. Guy I was succeeded by Milo I, followed by Milo's sons Guy II and Milo II. In 1118, after many disputes with the rebellious lords, Louis VI of France ordered the castle to be dismantled and turned the town into a royal residence. Louis VI had himself been married to a granddaughter of Guy I, Lucienne of Rochefort, from 1104 to 1107. After being absorbed into the royal domain, Montlh√©ry became part of the territory governed by the viscount of Paris. In the early 13th century, the French king Philip II (Augustus) completely rebuilt the castle in the contemporary style, at a new site high above the town. During the Hundred Years' War, the town and the castle frequently passed between English and French forces. On 16 July 1465, Charles the Bold defeated Louis XI of France at the Battle of Montlh√©ry. The town was left in ruins by the Wars of Religion, but it was rebuilt in 1591 under Henry IV. In the 19th century, the tower was used for scientific experiments. In 1822, Fran√ßois Arago calculated the speed of sound there; a cannonball shot at the tower was observed from the Observatory of Villejuif. In 1823, Claude Chappe installed a relay for the Paris-Bayonne telegraph line. On 5 June 1874, Alfred Cornu tried to calculate the speed of light between the tower and the Observatory in Paris. During the Franco-Prussian War, the town was occupied and pillaged by the Prussians. It was occupied again by Germany in 1940 during the Second World War. Today Montlh√©ry is twinned with Stetten am kalten Markt, Germany.Partnerst√§dte Stetten am kalten Markt Ch√¢teau de Montlh√©ry Plan of the present castle The Ch√¢teau de Montlh√©ry, a 13th-century castle with its prominent keep, succeeded a castle built in the 11th century, and an earlier foundation, built from 991 to 1015.

It is sometimes referred to as the 'French Indianapolis', because it is laid out as a high speed oval. Many speed records were set there within months of its opening. Today the racetrack has fallen into disuse and is also used for other purposes including a variety of automobile meetups. Montlh√©ry was also a market town, which is remembered today in the Tomato Festival. The medieval tower is also a popular tourist attraction, which recently re-opened in 2005 after being closed for repairs.

He was one of the earliest developers of the keyboard toccata.  Life  Padovano was born in Padua -- hence his name -- but little is known about his early life. He first appears at St. Mark's in Venice on November 30, 1552, when he was hired as first organist at an annual salary of 40 ducats. He stayed at this post until 1565. St. Mark's at this time also began to employ a second organist (it was Claudio Merulo for the last eight years of Padovano's tenure), which allowed two simultaneous, spatially separated organs to perform in the huge space of the cathedral: this was a key development in music of the Venetian school, which was already using spatially separated choirs of voices. Merulo took over the job of first organist when Padovano left. In 1566, Padovano left Venice to go to the Habsburg court in Graz. Many Venetian musicians left their native area to seek their fortunes in Habsburg domains, which generally remained friendly to Venice. Padovano became the director of music at Graz in 1570, and died there five years later.  Music and influence  Although Padovano published a book of motets, a book of masses, and two books of madrigals, he is mainly remembered for his instrumental music. He was a notable early composer of ricercars, a predecessor of the fugue; many of the themes he used derived from plainchant, but he included considerable ornamentation in the melodic lines. In addition he often broke the theme up for motivic development in a surprisingly \\"modern\\" way, anticipating the developmental techniques of the common practice period. Probably his most famous compositions are his toccatas, which were perhaps the earliest examples of the toccata in its more modern sense as an improvisatory, highly ornamented piece. Usually he included imitative interpolations between improvisatory sections, and also meter changes from duple to triple, anticipating later music of the Venetian school. While in Bavaria he wrote an enormous mass for 24 voices, which makes use of three choirs of eight voices each. This composition was likely performed for the wedding of Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria to Renata of Lorraine. This piece has been recorded by the Huelgas Ensemble, led by Paul Van Nevel.

Opening narrationPlot Major Ivan Kuchenko (Martin Landau), a KGB agent who is attempting to defect, is trapped inside a hotel room in an unnamed, politically neutral country. Commissar Vassiloff (John van Dreelen), a hitman, and Boris (Robert Kelljan), his assistant, are watching Kuchenko from a room across the street. Vassiloff, who considers himself an artist, has an elaborate plan for Kuchenko's assassination. After Vassiloff tricks Kuchenko into drinking a sleeping drug, Kuchenko awakes to find a taped recording from Vassiloff in which he explains that he has booby-trapped an object in the room. If Kuchenko finds and disarms the object within three hours, he will be allowed to live; if he tries to leave the room before then or turn out the lights, he will be shot by Boris, an expert sniper. Vassiloff tells Boris he has hidden a lethal bomb in the telephone, but it will be triggered only by picking up an incoming call. Thus, when Kuchenko picks up the phone without it ringing, nothing happens. Kuchenko grows increasingly nervous and desperate as the ordeal continues, even begging Vassiloff to shoot him at one point. With ten minutes of time left, Vassiloff places a call to Kuchenko's room. Kuchenko puts his hand on the receiver, but hesitates. When Vassiloff tries to call him a second time, Kuchenko bolts out of the hotel room, narrowly escaping a spray of bullets from Boris. Later, Vassiloff and Boris enter the room to dispose of evidence. The telephone rings, and Boris and Vassiloff are both killed after Boris unthinkingly answers it. On the other end of the line is Ivan Kuchenko, calling from a phone booth at the airport. The operator tells him she is unable to reach his party, but Kuchenko states, \\"It‚Äôs alright, operator.

Since the beginning of 2007, the band consists of lead vocalist Stephen Christian, guitarists Joseph Milligan and Christian McAlhaney, bassist Deon Rexroat, and drummer Nathan Young. Members of Anberlin originally formed a band under the name SaGoh 24/7 in 1998, releasing two studio albums before disbanding, with the members having a change in musical direction and name. Anberlin was formed in 2002; within a year of forming, they had signed with semi-independent record label Tooth & Nail Records and released their debut album, Blueprints for the Black Market. In 2005, the band released their second album, Never Take Friendship Personal. The band's third album, Cities, was released in 2007, and became their first album to reach the top 20 of the Billboard 200, selling 34,000 copies in its debut week. Anberlin signed with major label Universal Republic in 2007 and in 2008 released New Surrender, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, with the first single, \\"Feel Good Drag\\", claiming No. 1 on the Alternative Songs chart, after 29 weeks in the chart. Prior to the release of their fifth studio album, Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place, Anberlin had sold over 1,000,000 albums. Their sixth studio album Vital was released October 16, 2012, and rereleased on Big3 Records under the title Devotion a year later, October 15, 2013. On January 16, 2014, it was announced that Anberlin would be disbanding in 2014 after recording their seventh and final studio album, Lowborn, on their original label, Tooth & Nail Records, and touring one last time. After performing concerts in late 2018, the group reunited to tour through 2019. In May 2020, Christian mentioned they were working on new material. History=SaGoh 24/7 and the origins of Anberlin (1998‚Äì2002) Lead singer Stephen Christian met bassist Deon Rexroat while they were both in high school, and they formed a punk band called SaGoh 24/7. Drummer Sean Hutson and guitarist Joseph Milligan joined the group as well. The band released two albums, Servants After God's Own Heart (1999), and Then I Corrupt Youth (2001), both under Rescue Records. After the albums sold only 1,300 units, Hutson left the band to start a family, and Nathan Young was brought in as a replacement. Christian, Milligan and Rexroat began working on a side project, marking the beginning of the end for SaGoh 24/7. The side project's sound transformed after a suggestion from Milligan to develop more of a rock sound for Anberlin. They used money left over from shows SaGoh had performed and teamed up with producer Matt Goldman to record five demos. The demos that were then posted on PureVolume (which was mp3.com at the time). On the advice of friends, including Chad Johnson, and Timmy McTague from Underoath, the band signed with Tooth & Nail Records. First two albums (2002‚Äì2005) Bassist Deon Rexroat performing at Purple Door in August 2007 Out of the five demos Anberlin recorded with Matt Goldman, three were eventually chosen to be reworked for the band's debut album, the lead single \\"Readyfuels\\", \\"Driving\\" (later renamed \\"Autobahn\\") and \\"Foreign Language\\". Another song, \\"Embrace the Dead\\", was also recorded as a demo track and is often mistaken as an Anberlin song, however, the song didn't make it onto the band's debut album as it didn't constitute the stylistic direction the band wanted to head in. After hearing demos from the band Acceptance, Anberlin chose to record their debut album with the same producer, Aaron Sprinkle, creating a relationship that would last the entire duration of their time with Tooth & Nail Records. Barely a year after their formation, their first album as a new band was entitled Blueprints for the Black Market (2003). It failed to chart, but spurred on by their debut single, \\"Readyfuels\\", the album sold over 60,000 units. They toured steadily with other bands in their label. Rhythm guitarist Joey Bruce was eventually ejected from the band. According to Christian, he was \\"all about sex and drugs\\", and was going in a different direction than the rest of the band. After several failed replacements, Nathan Strayer from The Mosaic took over rhythm guitar duties. Anberlin released their follow-up to Blueprints, Never Take Friendship Personal, in early 2005, again produced by Aaron Sprinkle. Charting at No. 144 on the Billboard 200, the album brought the band closer to the mainstream. NTFP was generally more well received by critics than Blueprints for the Black Market. Before its release, the band promoted the album by releasing a track per week on their PureVolume and MySpace website accounts, as well as on their own website. Two singles were released from the album: \\"A Day Late\\" and \\"Paperthin Hymn\\". Both were reasonably successful on alternative rock radio, with the latter peaking at the No. 38 position on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. Anberlin participated in a number of compilations during this time, recording covers of Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", Depeche Mode's \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" and the song \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\". Cities and Lost Songs (2005‚Äì2007) Performing in Las Cruces, NM at the 2007 Warped TourAnberlin's third album produced by Aaron Sprinkle was released in early 2007 under the title Cities. It sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard 200 chart, and, like their previous album, received fairly positive reviews from critics. Before the release of Cities, the band released Godspeed EP exclusively through the iTunes Store in late 2006 to give a preview to the new album. In support of the album, Anberlin held their first headlining tour, supported by Bayside, Meg & Dia and Jonezetta. In an interview about the album, Christian commented that the lyrics throughout the band's discography are progressively becoming more mature. \\"The first CD (Blueprints for the Black Market) was childish in the manner that it was Man vs. World in the lyrics. The second (Never Take Friendship Personal) was Man Vs. Man. Cities is more adult in the manner that it's Man Vs. Self. Cities was the most anticipated album on Jesus Freak Hideout's Most Anticipated Albums of 2007. Three to four weeks before the release of Cities, it was announced that guitarist Nathan Strayer amicably left the band to go back to the Mosaic and that Christian McAlhaney, formerly of the band Acceptance, would take over as the new guitarist.Kohli, Rohan. A compilation album of unreleased material, called Lost Songs, was released on November 20, 2007. It features B-sides, demos, covers, and acoustic versions of their previous songs as well as other tracks recorded at Sessions@AOL. Universal Republic signing and New Surrender (2007‚Äì2009) Performing at the Commodore Ballroom in May 2009The band signed to Universal Republic on August 16, 2007, and soon after began to write material for their major-label debut, entitled New Surrender, which was released on September 30, 2008. This was the band's first album to not be distributed through Tooth & Nail Records or produced by Aaron Sprinkle. The first song to be heard from the new album was tentatively titled \\"Bittersweet Memory\\" during its initial live performances; it was later renamed to \\"Breaking\\", with an acoustic remix of the song included on USB wristbands sold exclusively during the 2008 Warped Tour. On July 11, 2008, the band showcased a second new song called \\"Disappear\\" on their MySpace profile. The first actual single from the album was the re-recorded \\"Feel Good Drag\\" which was set to go to radio on August 18  eventually being released on August 26. The band booked eight weeks of recording sessions with noted producer Neal Avron (New Found Glory, Yellowcard, Fall Out Boy) in early February 2008. Stephen Christian stated in an interview, \\"We're very excited about working with Neal; I think our fans are going to be pleased when they hear the final result.\\" Christian also discussed the difficulties in writing this record. \\"When you try to write 29 songs lyrically you find yourself topically working in circles; I only go through so much in one year, but needlessly I have dedicated myself to begin searching books, art, and friends for new directions.\\" During the recording process, the band set up a live webcam in the studio so fans could watch them record the album via the band's MySpace profile. New Surrender was placed at the No. 2 spot on Jesus Freak Hideout's 25 Most Anticipated Albums of 2008. In the week of its release, the album sold 36,000 units, entering the Billboard 200 chart at No. 13. It also placed at No. 5 on the Top Current Rock chart, according to a Universal Republic press release. In support of the album, the band embarked on a fall headlining U.S. tour alongside Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Straylight Run, and There For Tomorrow. Kyle Flynn, formerly of the band Acceptance, joined the band while on tour doing keys, loops, acoustic guitar, and background vocals. The band then traveled to the United Kingdom where they supported Elliot Minor and played a handful of headlining shows with Furthest Drive Home and Data.Select.Party. Anberlin went into the studio to record several tracks, including a cover of the New Order song \\"True Faith\\", which was made available online. The band also recorded a cover of the Danzig song \\"Mother\\", which they performed during an interview with Billboard. After supporting Taking Back Sunday throughout May and June 2009, the band planned to start writing the follow-up to New Surrender in the summer, but the release date was undetermined, as the band needed to give the new material the proper time and effort. They also undertook an Australian tour in August, alongside The Academy Is.... A b-side from New Surrender, \\"A Perfect Tourniquet\\", was released on the soundtrack for the TV show 90210. The cover of New Order's \\"True Faith\\" was released to radio airplay on November 17, the same day as the Tooth & Nail released Blueprints for City Friendships: The Anberlin Anthology, which is a 33-song, three-album set including all the songs from their Tooth & Nail studio albums. Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place (2010‚Äì2011) In an interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in December 2009, it was revealed by lead singer Stephen Christian that the band were tentatively due to enter the studio in the beginning of 2010, with a release probable later in the year. He said \\"it looks like we are going to go to the studio in January, February or March, right around that time\\". Drummer Nathan Young stated that the album would be \\"less poppy\\" and \\"darker\\". Christian posted on his Twitter account in December 2009, that his choice for an album name was \\"a go\\" but did not reveal the name. The band entered Blackbird Studios, Nashville, to begin recording the album in March 2010. It was announced on March 3 that the band would be working with Grammy Award-winning producer, Brendan O'Brien. The tracking of the album was completed on April 9, with mixing commencing on April 13, 2010. In an April 2010 interview with MyMag, Christian stated that the album's release date is \\"looking like late July or early August\\" 2010. However, in a May 2010 interview with Spin Magazine, McAlhaney stated that the album would be released in September 2010. In early June 2010, the album's release date was confirmed to be September 21, 2010. The band also began exposing their new music, with videos of live performances of the album's songs appearing online. A press release revealed on June 17 that Anberlin's fifth studio album would be titled Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place, taking its title from a line in Dylan Thomas‚Äô \\"Poem on His Birthday\\". Along with the disclosure of a track listing, the press release also announced the album's lead single, \\"Impossible\\", which went to radio play on July 12, 2010. When asked about the possible impact of the new album, Stephen replied 'I feel like we're on the brink of something... either world domination or destruction, but either way we're on the brink'. Anberlin supported Thirty Seconds to Mars on their Closer to the Edge Tour with CB7 during April and May 2011. Vital and Devotion (2012‚Äì2013) In an interview with Common Revolt, Stephen Christian stated that the band had begun work on their next album. A few songs had been written, including one with the working title \\"Control\\" (later renamed Orpheum), and a song influenced by the events in Egypt (later confirmed to be \\"Someone Anyone\\"). The band announced via Facebook and e-mail in February 2012 that they would be returning to Aaron Sprinkle to record their upcoming album. The band recorded their first three albums with Sprinkle; not only is he a good friend of the band but also a fan favorite. The band will begin recording around the start of March, and are not expected to be finished until May. In a recent interview, Stephen Christian announced their new album is finally done. On June 11, during the Nashville show of their acoustic tour, Stephen Christian announced that the title of the new record would be Vital, calling the record \\"their most aggressive to date\\" and also announced a fall release date. On July 31, the band announced on their official website that Vital was to be released on October 16. The new album's opening track, \\"Self-Starter\\",' was streamed on Billboard.com for free listening on August 17., and the album's second single, \\"Someone Anyone\\" was released on August 22. Infectious Magazine reported on October 26, 2012 that the band had already \\"made a lot of headway writing for the next record\\". The band released \\"City Electric\\" on September 20, 2013. It is the first of three new and previously unreleased tracks from their rework of Vital, Devotion which was released on October 15, 2013.  Return to Tooth & Nail, Lowborn and breakup (2014)  On the January 16, 2014, the band posted a video in which the band confirmed that this year would be their last and that they will release their seventh, and final, studio album in mid-2014 on their original label, Tooth & Nail Records. They also stated that they will do their last set of tours this year to celebrate what the band has become. On May 6, 2014, Anberlin revealed the title of the final album, Lowborn, as well as the album artwork. The band played their final show on November 26, 2014, at the House of Blues in Orlando, Florida. On December 15, 2017, it was announced that the band's former rhythm guitarist Nathan Strayer had died. He was 34.Year In Review: The ones we lost accessdate July 22, 2018 Reunions (2018‚Äìpresent) On October 18, 2018, the band announced that they would reunite for one show on December 14 at the Yuengling Center in Tampa, Florida, as part of Underoath's Erase Me Tour. The band also performed a headlining show the day before at The Orpheum. In March 2019, it was announced that the band would perform a series of headlining shows across Australia in May 2019. In April 2019, the band announced a 22-stop U.S. tour. Young revealed the band had no plans to stage a comeback after the reunion shows. However, in May 2020, Stephen Christian mentioned they had changed their minds and had decided to work on new music. Origin of name Anberlin lead vocalist Stephen Christian has stated different origins of the band's name in various interviews, prevalent among which was his claim that he had long intended to name his first daughter Anberlin. Struggling to find a name for the band, Stephen suggested it; \\"We were all sitting around trying to come up with a name. None of us were married or had kids, but one day I was going to name my daughter Anberlin, so I figured we could name the band that until we thought of something better. So we chose Anberlin and no one has thought of anything better.\\" He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, \\"If I ever have a daughter and name her Anberlin, she'll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around.\\"Stavrinos, Nicole. Christian had also stated in another interview that the band's name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed \\"London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin.\\" Christian thought that \\"and Berlin\\" would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested \\"And Berlin,\\" which was then modified to \\"Anberlin.\\" Christian has since retracted those comments admitting that when the band first started, in interviews they \\"would take turn making stories about how it came to be\\" as a joke, as he believed the actual origin of the band name wasn't interesting enough. Christian said there was a story about how his grandfather had \\"saved a little girl from a World War II bombing... her name was Anberlin\\" and that they had hit a dog, which had the name Anberlin, with the stories getting more diverse, it was decided they reveal the true origin. He has said the \\"real\\" name came from the Radiohead song \\"Everything in Its Right Place\\", stating that \\"There are several stories that have circulated on the internet, but the actual story is when I was in college my favorite band was Radiohead; on one of their songs off the record Kid A there is a background noise on the song \\"Everything in Its Right Place\\" (about 2 minutes 31 seconds into the song). While Thom (Yorke) is singing try to say I always thought the background noise sounded like Anberlin, I always thought that Anberlin would have been a great band name and well...it was/is.\\" Status as a Christian musical group Over the years, many fans, critics, and other members of the media have consistently characterized Anberlin as a Christian band. However, Stephen Christian stated in an interview that their faith is more complicated than a simple label: \\"I think we're categorized like that a lot because we're on Tooth & Nail Records, which, years ago, was known as a Christian label and never lost that reputation. I don't care who listens to our records. If it helps people in whatever circumstances they're in, that's amazing, but I definitely don't classify us as a Christian band.\\" Elsewhere, Christian has remarked, \\"[My faith] affects every single aspect of my life, but I'm not a preacher, I'm an entertainer.\\" Despite these statements and others of the like, multiple sources list the band as part of the Christian rock genre, and some Anberlin song lyrics do contain Christian references. Furthermore, the band appears at Christian music festivals such as Parachute Music Festival and Cornerstone Festival, and their songs have been included on Christian rock compilation CDs and DVDs. They are also played on the Gospel Music Channel. Anberlin has also been repeatedly featured in Christian rock magazine HM (Hard Music, which was originally the fanzine Heaven's Metal). Christian submitted a letter to the magazine, criticizing the more overtly religious Christian punk band the Knights of the New Crusade for a promotional image that represented a \\"black mark on the face of Christianity\\". Christian has also said in an interview with Lightforce radio how the band tries to \\"step out of the bubble\\" and referred to themselves as being part of Christian music. He discussed in detail what Christians should do in their lives: love and embrace others as Jesus would as well as show God's grace to others. He mentioned as well how the band Fall Out Boy said in an interview that they did not really know much about Jesus until Anberlin toured with them. In an interview with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, \\"The thing is, some bands that are trying to get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions about it. I don‚Äôt really mind it, because I‚Äôm a Christian, and I‚Äôm okay talking about it. With the whole term 'Christian Band,' I don‚Äôt understand how a band can be Christian. We get the question, 'Is Anberlin a Christian band?' and it‚Äôs like, yeah, Anberlin is ‚Äî as humans\\".

A controlled-access highway, it connects Gaithersburg in Montgomery County and Laurel in Prince George's County, both of which are suburbs of Washington, D.C. The ICC was one of the most controversial Maryland road projects; opposition to the highway stalled the project for decades, and construction did not begin until 60 years after the highway's initial approval. The highway was originally proposed in 1950, was in length, and part of the Washington Outer Beltway. While other parts of the Outer Beltway were canceled, the ICC and the Fairfax County Parkway remained on master plans. The road's long history as an unbuilt proposed road stems from the controversy that has surrounded it over the years, including the cost of about $2.38 billion to complete the highway and related environmental mitigation. Proponents of the highway claimed that it would improve the flow of interregional traffic, relieve traffic congestion on local roads, spur economic development, and enhance access to Baltimore- Washington International Airport. Opponents of the highway claimed that the road would instead harm significant traffic flow characteristics, negatively harm the environment, and disrupt established communities through which it passes. They also argued that \\"environmental degradation would immediately occur from the construction (loss of forests, wetlands, and animal habitats), [and instill] long-term consequences (air pollution and carbon emissions from additional driving, more sprawl development, less money to fund mass transit projects, etc.).\\" Fulfilling a 2002 campaign promise, Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich pushed to begin construction of the road and conducted a formal groundbreaking in October 2006. With additional support from his successor, Governor Martin O'Malley, construction began on November 13, 2007. The first segment, from Interstate 370 (I-370) to MD 28, opened on February 23, 2011, while the extension to I-95 opened on November 22, 2011. The final segment to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) opened on November 7, 2014. MD 200 uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling. Route description MD 200 westbound in Redland MD 200 begins at a trumpet interchange with MD 200A (Metro Access Road), which heads south to provide access to Shady Grove Road and the Shady Grove station serving Washington Metro's Red Line, near Gaithersburg in Montgomery County; west of this interchange the freeway continues as I-370 towards MD 355 and I-270. Several new ramps and collector-distributor roads were built between this interchange and MD 355\\\\. MD 200 continues northeast from there as a six-lane freeway through Redland Station, turning east to pass over Shady Grove Road, and then under Redland Road, paralleling Mill Creek. This is the location of the eastbound toll gantry. MD 200 shortly curves to the east on the approach to the six-lane overpass for Olde Mill Run, which was built wide enough for a fourth lane in the eastbound direction. The Olde Mill Run overpass is the only section of MD 200 with full shoulders on each side. After the overpass, MD 200 turns southeast, passing under Needwood Road, before turning sharply back to the east as it passes under MD 115 (Muncaster Mill Road). The route, now running slightly to the southeast, begins the approach to MD 97 (Georgia Avenue). MD 200 eastbound in Redland past the western terminus at I-370 MD 200 then turns more eastward, running towards North Branch Stream Valley Park and passing over the north branch of Rock Creek and a second stream over a bridge. This is the location of the westbound toll gantry. The route enters the Norbeck area, and passes under Emory Lane. Just east of there is where a hybrid cloverleaf interchange with MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) is located. A park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses is located southwest of this interchange along MD 97\\\\. When the road opened in February 2011, it temporarily came to an end at a traffic light located just east of MD 97 at MD 28 (Norbeck Road). The route then curves southeastward, passing under MD 28 and Longmead Crossing Drive, running parallel to Wintergate Drive/Park Vista Drive. MD 200 then curves slightly more eastward toward Aspen Hill, where the freeway intersects MD 182 (Layhill Road), shortly after entering the Northwest Branch Recreational Park. The route travels through the park for a stretch, bridging the Northwest Branch Anacostia River three times (the second bridge also carries MD 200 over Bonifant Road), exits the park, and then turns eastward, passing under Notley Road. MD 200 then turns slightly to the northeast near Colesville and meets MD 650 at a single-point urban interchange. View west from the east end of MD 200 at US 1 in Laurel MD 200 then continues eastward, passes through Upper Paint Branch Park and bridges several creeks, including the namesake Paint Branch, and passes between several neighborhoods upon exiting the park. The route then passes under Old Columbia Pike with no access to this local road. Just beyond, MD 200 reaches a large interchange with US 29, combining cloverleaf and stack elements. This interchange also adds connections to Fairland Road with both MD 200 and US 29\\\\. The route continues eastward, featuring a partial interchange with Briggs Chaney Road (westbound exit and eastbound entrance), and then, just after crossing the border into Prince George's County, it passes over the Little Paint Branch just south of the Fairland Recreational Park. The route then passes under Old Gunpowder Road. The route then enters Calverton, where the expansive interchange with I-95 is located. The interchange, marked as Exit 31 on I-95, is mostly a cloverleaf hybrid, and features several collector- distributor roads built along I-95, stretching from Old Gunpowder Road south of the interchange to MD 198 north of it. The community of Konterra is planned for construction near this interchange. Beyond I-95, MD 200 narrows to four lanes. MD 200 curves sharply, first to the south then to the east, and meets a diamond-interchange providing access to Konterra Drive (MD 206). MD 200 then turns gradually to the southeast and ends at a traffic signal at US 1 (Baltimore Avenue) in Beltsville. MD 200 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length. Tolls Toll gantry along eastbound MD 200 between US 29 and I-95 in Calverton The Intercounty Connector uses all- electronic tolling, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling, which uses automatic license plate recognition. ICC users without E-ZPass are mailed a bill to pay the toll along with a 50% surcharge for non-E-ZPass use (minimum of $1). The tolls along the full length of the road (between I-370 and I-95) vary by time of day, ranging from $1.60 overnight to $3.20 in off-peak daytime, and $4 at rush hour (for E-ZPass users; for others toll rates will be approximately 50% higher). Tolls were waived along the road between February 23 and March 7, 2011, and again between November 22 and December 4, 2011. History=Washington Outer Beltway The Intercounty Connector can be traced to plans developed in the 1950s for the proposed Washington Outer Beltway. The National Capital Park and Planning Commission issued a Comprehensive Plan for the Nation's Capital and Its Environs in 1950. The comprehensive plan included three different circular roads in and around the District of Columbia. The original Outer Beltway had been planned to pass south of the corporate limits of the City of Rockville, as shown on a map published in the Washington Post in 1951 with the caption \\"Ring Road suggested by Bureau of Public Roads\\". In 1953, the portion of the Outer Beltway between Montgomery County and Prince George's County was included in the Master Plan of Highways of the Maryland‚ÄìNational Capital Park and Planning Commission. It was later included in the Commission's General Plan in 1957, and the Commission's On Wedges and Corridors plan in 1964. In the 1960s, an \\"outer circumferential highway\\" was proposed between outside the Capital Beltway. The original proposed routing of the Intercounty Connector was south and east of the current alignment. The new route was motivated in part by a desire to move the routing of the proposed bridge over the Potomac River upstream from the area of River Bend to Watkins Island. Virginia residents and the United States Department of the Interior objected to the proposed bridge over the Potomac River because they wanted to create state and federal parks along the river in order to protect sugar maple trees, vegetation, and bald eagles. Because of these concerns, the Maryland State Roads Commission moved the proposed Outer Beltway to a route north of Rockville and eliminated a new bridge crossing the Potomac River. The Montgomery County Planning Board accepted the state's newly proposed route in 1970, but the Montgomery County Council rejected it, and Prince George's County and Virginia dropped it from their plans. In 1975, the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments endorsed a request from the State Highway Administration \\"for federal support of a $1.1 million planning and engineering study of the first segment of the road\\" (then called the Outer Beltway), which was to \\"run from the Baltimore-Washington Parkway near Beltsville westward to a point near Interstate Rte 70S at Gaithersburg.\\" By 1976, Maryland's Secretary of Transportation no longer supported state financial support of the Outer Beltway, although Montgomery County still supported it in concept. Initial Intercounty Connector plan MD 200 westbound at US 29 in Fairland In 1980, the state of Maryland dropped the Washington Outer Beltway from its plans except for the Intercounty Connector. Meanwhile, the State Highway Administration was studying constructing a Intercounty Connector with a spur called the Rockville Facility. After six days of public workshops, the Maryland State Highway Administration released its first report about the Intercounty Connector and the Rockville Facility in January 1980. The majority of participants supported the highway, although almost everyone said they would prefer building more east‚Äìwest public transportation instead. In 1983, the federal National Capital Planning Commission formally requested that the eastern end of the Intercounty Connector be shortened by so that the eastern terminus of the road would be at I-95 rather than the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway. In 1984, Maryland Secretary of Transportation Lowell K. Bridwell designated land in Montgomery and Prince George's counties as the future site of the Intercounty Connector so that the right-of-way would be preserved, even though Montgomery County Executive Charles W. Gilchrist had voiced very critical comments about the Intercounty Connector as it was envisioned in 1983‚Äîat least in part because he felt that construction of the ICC by the year 2000 was \\"infeasible\\", and advocated construction of a \\"shorter and less- costly\\" east‚Äìwest highway instead. Prior to Governor Parris N. Glendening declaring the Intercounty Connector \\"dead\\" before leaving office in January 2003, two environmental impact studies had been conducted, the first being a draft document in 1983. In 1977, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center expressed concerns about the impact that the ICC would have on its experiments. An initial environmental study was undertaken in the late 1970s, and extended into the 1980s, with a draft published in 1983. A second study was initiated around 1992, and a draft environmental impact statement was issued in 1997. The final environmental impact statement was drafted by 1989 but did not receive federal approval, leading to the abandonment of the study until a new study began in 1992; the 1992‚Äì1997 study pointed to a similar conclusion, though it was never completed. By 1997, millions of dollars had been spent on planning and preliminary engineering, but the only segments of the road that had been built were I-370 between I-270 and the Shady Grove Metrorail station on WMATA's Red Line. Glendening rejects Transportation Solutions Group recommendations After the 1997 Intercounty Connector Draft Environmental Impact Statement process was put on hold by Governor Glendening, much controversy resulted between groups and persons in favor of the ICC and those opposed. The Intercounty Counnector became a political issue in 1998, an election year in Maryland. A blue-ribbon committee entitled the Transportation Solutions Group was formed in 1998 to tell the Governor's Smart Growth Sub- Cabinet about intermodal transportation that complied with state and regional goals. The Transportation Solutions Group, chaired by Thomas B. Deen, former executive director of the Transportation Research Board, met at a series of meetings over about 14 months in 1998 and 1999. Policy suggestions and recommendations made by the Transportation Solutions Group included that most of the group supports \\"providing high-speed bus transit, HOV and SOV access through a new east-west, value priced, limited-access parkway\\", with some opposition to the parkway and that the group had a divided opinion on a freeway, with most supporting it. The Transportation Solutions Group had initially voted to oppose the Intercounty Connector on its master planned route, but voted 10 in favor and 4 opposed in February 1999 to endorse a highway alternative with the condition that single-occupant vehicles be charged a toll. At its final meeting in June 1999, the Transportation Solutions Group held a public hearing in College Park and voted 12 to 4 in favor of a \\"parkway-like highway from I-270 to I-95, following the general path of the ICC.\\" The Transportation Solutions Group also made a recommendation that a system of high-occupancy toll lanes (with variable pricing) be implemented on major freeways of the region, including the Intercounty Connector, I-95, the Capital Beltway, I-270 and US 50. On September 22, 1999, Glendening chose to reject the Transportation Solutions Group recommendation, asserting that the project was \\"wrong\\", \\"inconsistent with Smart Growth doctrine\\", and an \\"environmental disaster\\". The Washington Post quoted Glendening quoted as saying, \\"It is a proposal that has fractured our communities. It has pitted neighbor against neighbor. And it has created political gridlock while traffic gridlock has only worsened.\\" Even though Glendening chose to ignore the Transportation Solutions Group's primary recommendation, its work was not entirely in vain, as its efforts were to be cited prominently some years later in the Intercounty Connector's Final Environmental Impact Statement . The concept of a regionwide network of HOT lanes (to be called \\"variably priced highway lanes\\") was further developed by the Transportation Planning Board, and a regional network (including the Intercounty Connector) was described in a report published in February 2008. After rejecting the Intercounty Connector, Glendening and opponents of the Intercounty Connector then examined the possibility of selling its right-of- way, but proponents of the Intercounty Connector would have been able to stop such a sale at the Board of Public Works, which must approve transactions involving the sale of state-owned real estate. Montgomery County steps in MD 200 westbound in Colesville In 1999, staff to the Montgomery County Planning Board said that the Intercounty Connector could be removed from master plans, but that such an effort would take \\"six or seven years\\" to accomplish. In November 1999, the Montgomery County Council discussed removing the Intercounty Connector from master plans, and while five of the nine members were opposed to the Intercounty Connector, the District 4 member, Marilyn Praisner, declined to agree to removal of the master-planned route, for fear that the so-called Northern Alignment (Corridor 2 in the 2005 Draft Environmental Impact Statement) would become a de facto Intercounty Connector in the future. The effort by Montgomery County politicians to remove the Intercounty Connector from its plans irritated powerful members of the Maryland General Assembly (notably Senate President Thomas V. \\"Mike\\" Miller), who discussed legislative measures that could be taken in the General Assembly to thwart such a move. In February 2000, an agreement between Montgomery County's politicians and members of the General Assembly reached an agreement \\"memorialized in two letters but not cast in stone\\" that the \\"... Council agreed not to take any action to kill the ICC during the next three years.\\" In 2000, Montgomery County Planning Board established the Transportation Policy Report and then the more-inclusive Transportation Policy Report II Task Force \\"... in an effort to establish a framework for future Master Plans and to help set priorities for future infrastructure.\\" The Transportation Policy Report II Task Force had 33 members, including persons in favor of the Intercounty Connector and those opposed. The Transportation Policy Report II Task Force listed the Intercounty Connector in its recommended network, following a caveat that \\"If they are found feasible and ultimately judged desirable to implement, the priority of implementation could be established at that time. When the Montgomery County Council was briefed on the report, discussions quickly shifted to the Intercounty Connector and the controversy associated with it. The Intercounty Connector's Final Environmental Impact Statement makes specific reference to the work done by the Transportation Policy Report II Task Force. The Maryland State Senate, in its 2002 session, passed Senate Joint Resolution 8, which asked Glendening to restart the Intercounty Connector Environmental Impact Statement that had been put on hold in 1997. The Maryland House of Delegates passed an accompanying resolution, House Joint Resolution 10 with essentially similar provisions. The Intercounty Connector study was not to be restarted until Glendening left office at the end of 2002. Revival Logo used for the Intercounty Connector for public relations In 2003, Governor Ehrlich followed through with his campaign promise to resurrect the Intercounty Connector study, and he was allowed a fast-track review process by the United States Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta. In addition to the election of Ehrlich, the Montgomery County Council that was seated at the end of 2002 had a 6‚Äì3 majority of members in favor of the project. Prior to the 2002 election, a majority had been skeptical, if not outright opposed, to the project. The Montgomery County Council and County Executive Douglas M. Duncan issued a resolution endorsing the Intercounty Connector in December 2002. On April 21, 2004, the Transportation Planning Board voted to include the Intercounty Connector in future networks of the Washington region's transportation system for purposes of forecasting changes in air quality. On November 17, 2004, the Transportation Planning Board endorsed regional transportation plans which included the Intercounty Connector, determining that the proposed plans met air quality goals and that funding for the project was adequate. On July 11, 2005, Governor Ehrlich announced the state's preference to build the Intercounty Connector along Corridor 1. Corridor 1 (approximately 80% of which is the Master Plan Alignment) has been on the books for decades; Corridor 2, also known as the Northern Alignment, was designed to reduce Corridor 1's impact on the environment. While the EPA gave Corridor 2 a higher environmental rating, it was eventually rejected by the state due to the increased number of homes and businesses that would have to be removed for its construction, because of negative environmental impacts on the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission's Rocky Gorge Reservoir on the Patuxent River (which is a source of drinking water for much of the WSSC service area), and because it was not consistent with several approved and adopted Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission master plans in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. On August 31, 2005, the Board of Public Works gave its approval to the Corridor 1 alternative, which allowed state funding of the project in accordance with Maryland's provisions (established by statute) for funding a \\"growth-related project\\" that is not entirely within Priority Funding Areas. In December 2005, controversy arose over the Intercounty Connector's proposed toll rate. At a proposed , an end-to-end driver would have to pay about $6 a day for a round-trip (about $1,500 per year). On May 30, 2006, the Federal Highway Administration gave approval to the Corridor 1 plan, meaning that Maryland had satisfied \\"all environmental, economic and community requirements and that it can build the highway\\". The Baltimore Business Journal wrote, \\"Federal approval for the $2.4 billion connector came after Ehrlich made a direct request to President George W. Bush, who named the Intercounty Connector as one of his priority projects. The president's direct attention prompted federal resource agencies to give the project a more timely environmental review.\\" As approved, the Intercounty Connector would be long, running from I-370 in Gaithersburg to I-95 in Beltsville. It would be a controlled access toll-highway with eight interchanges, and two park-and-ride lots would be built as well. The project included $370 million for mitigation and environmental stewardship activities in order to address the impact of communities, wetlands, streams, wildlife, forests, air quality, historic resources, and parklands. Construction Redland The SHA constructed the ICC using separate design-build contracts for five phases. * A. I-270/I-370 to east of MD 97 * B. East of MD 97 to west of US 29 * C. West of US 29 to east of I-95 interchange, and I-95 collector/distributor road improvements along I-95 from MD 212 to just north of the ICC * D. Collector/distributor road improvements along I-95 from just north of the ICC to north of MD 198 * E. East of I-95 interchange to US 1 The first of the five contracts was awarded on March 27, 2007. The contract, worth $478.7 million, was awarded to Intercounty Constructors, a joint venture of Granite Construction Company, Corman Construction Inc. and G.A. & F.C. Wagman, Inc. Construction on the section between I-370 and MD 97 began in November 2007. Contracts for three other phases are completed and the fifth phase involving collector-distributor lanes along I-95 has been completed. Requests for statements of qualification were issued for Phase A in December 2005, for Phase D in August 2006, and for Phase B in August 2007. The selection of the second of the five contracts was announced on November 20, 2007. The contract, worth $513.9 million, was awarded to IC3, a joint venture of Shirley Contracting Company, LLC; Clark Construction Group, LLC; Guy F. Atkinson Construction, LLC; Facchina Construction Company, Inc. and Trumbull Corporation. This work includes the ICC from a point west of US 29 to I-95, and interchanges with those routes. On September 4, 2008, The Washington Post reported that the Contract B construction contract had been awarded on July 22, 2008, to a joint venture of Kiewit, Corman Construction, and G.A. & F.C. Wagman, at a total cost of about $559.7 million‚Äîreportedly 22% higher than previous estimates. The Post story went on to say that a protest of this contract award was filed on July 30, 2008 by a joint venture that was not selected, though the bid price from the rejected group was lower. This protest may have delayed the start of construction on Contract B. On October 15, 2008, the Post reported that the protest was denied by state procurement officer Robert P. Gay and that the losing proposer would file an appeal with the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals. On September 12, 2008, the Post reported that Contract D ran into funding issues which had delayed its construction. Contract D is associated with the proposed new interchange of I-95 and Contee Road (not part of the ICC). SHA Former Administrator Neil J. Pedersen stated that the \\"service roads can be delayed until the I-95 interchange has been built at Contee Road.\\" Sign indicating that MD 200 ended at MD 28 (Norbeck Road)‚Äîsince November 22, 2011 this is no longer the case The first segment opened on February 23, 2011, ahead of its projected spring 2011 opening. No tolls were charged on the date of opening to March 6, 2011. On the opening morning, over 10,000 vehicles used the highway, and it went on to draw in 30,000 vehicles per day. During the first week of May, the tollway drew 11,490 vehicles per day, which is much less than the 21,000 projected (though by 2014, this section of highway was averaging almost 40,000 vehicles per day on average). As a result, the state launched a $1.4 million advertising campaign to promote the new highway. The second segment of the highway, from MD 97 to I-95 opened on November 22, 2011. The highway was opened between I-95 and US 1 on November 7, 2014. Funding The $2.56-billion project was funded from several sources, including $1.23 billion of Maryland Transportation Authority revenue bonds (50%), $0.75 billion of Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicle bonds (31%), $0.26 billion from the Maryland General Fund (11%); $0.18 billion from the Maryland Transportation Trust Fund (7%); and $0.18 billion from Special Federal Funds (1%). Opposition Route Marker for ICC MD 200 has gained opposition from several groups, including the Maryland General Assembly and the Prince George's County Council. Proponents of the highway have claimed that it will improve the flow of interregional traffic, relieving traffic congestion on local roads. Opponents of the highway have claimed that the road will (with a few limited exceptions) harm significant traffic flow characteristics (such as increasing drive times, congestion, and costs in the form of tolls), will harm the environment (with air, sea and land impacts), and will disrupt established communities through which it passes. Government Members of the Maryland General Assembly stated opposition in the Spring 2008 and Spring 2009 sessions, the 1998 session, and back to 1979, when a bill introduced in the General Assembly by Delegate Robin Ficker proposed to eliminate funding for a study of the ICC and the never-built Rockville Facility highway project. In 1980, a bill proposed by Delegate Idamae Garrott to forbid the Maryland Department of Transportation from even studying the matter of new highways running east and west between Montgomery and Prince George's Counties was tabled by the Montgomery County Delegation. In the 1998 session, House Bill 817 was introduced to prohibit MDOT from spending funds or granting approvals to the ICC project, and House Bill 905 was intended to stop the operation of a toll highway altogether. Both bills failed to pass. In 2004, House Bill 732 proposed a similar statement to House Bill 817, extended to include the MdTA. The 2007 Special Session saw the offering of House Bill 37 to prevent construction of the road. Both of these bills also failed to pass. In the 2008 session, two bills proposing to cancel or delay the project were introduced‚ÄîHouse Bill 1416 and House Bill 1471. House Bill 1471 proposed to eliminate funding for the road, and, if it had passed, would trigger \\"liquidated damage clauses that would require it to pay the contractors an estimated $80.0 million upon cancellation of the contracts,\\" according to the Fiscal Note prepared by the state's Department of Legislative Services. Both bills failed. In the 2009 session, a bill proposing to cancel funding for the ICC was pre-filed by Delegate Barbara A. Frush‚ÄîHouse Bill 27. This bill had not attracted any co-sponsors nor had it been scheduled for a hearing. A similar bill, Senate Bill 753, was filed in the Maryland Senate by Sen. E. J. Pipkin and others. The Maryland Politics Watch blog opined that Pipkin's co- sponsorship of SB 753 may be related to his possible desire to run again for the U.S. House of Representatives Maryland District 1 seat. Both bills failed in the 2009 session. House Bill 27 received an unfavorable report from the House of Delegates Appropriations Committee on March 28, 2009; and no action was taken on Senate Bill 753 prior to adjournment on April 13, 2009, though a hearing was scheduled on March 18, 2009 before the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee. The position of the County Council of Prince George's County in opposition to the ICC has been repeatedly cited by opposition groups, and its 2003 resolution on the subject, CR-32-2003, was adopted on June 10, 2003, where it called for alternatives to the road.Not directly available on the Web, but the resolution (in Microsoft Word format), can be found through a search of the Prince George's County Government Legislative Information System for Resolution CR-32-2003 In 2007, the Prince George's County Council passed resolution CR-59-2007,Also not directly available on the Web, but the resolution (in Microsoft Word format), can be found through a search of the Prince George's County Government Legislative Information System for Resolution CR-59-2007 which repeats much of what was stated in CR-32-2003, including the language endorsing the ICC in Prince George's County. Environmental groups MD 200 westbound past US 29 in Fairland In November 2006, environmental groups announced that they were preparing to file suit in order to delay or stop the project, and lawsuits aimed at halting construction were filed by environmental groups and affected residents, assisted in part by pro bono legal counsel from the Institute for Public Representation of the Georgetown University Law Center. One of those lawsuits was originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (possibly as part of a forum shopping effort to avoid having the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals hear the case on appeal ‚Äì though the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which would have heard any appeals from the D.C. federal court, had ruled against the Sierra Club and allied groupsThe City of Alexandria, Virginia had been the lead plaintiff in this case, but settled out of court on March 1, 1999, leaving the Sierra Club and several allied groups as the plaintiffs/appellees, see the settlement agreement here: . on similar legal issues in reversing a lower court on a case involving the proposal to reconstruct and widen the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in 1999) but Judge Gladys Kessler of the D.C. federal court ordered the matter transferred to federal court in Maryland on May 17, 2007 and the suits were consolidated. After hearings in October 2007, both lawsuits were dismissed in their entirety on November 8, 2007 by Judge Alexander Williams, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland in a 105-page memorandum opinion. The Baltimore Sun described the decision handed down by the court as a \\"victory for both Governor Martin O'Malley, who backs construction of the road, and a measure of vindication for former Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, who made it the top transportation priority of his administration.\\" After the opinion was released, environmental groups opposed to the ICC stated that they would \\"consider their legal options before deciding whether to continue their battle\\" and some homeowners near the selected route expressed disagreement with the ruling of the court. On January 7, 2008, it was announced that Environmental Defense and the Sierra Club would appeal Judge Williams' decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. In April 2008, persons and groups opposed to the ICC, including the Shady Grove Woods Homeowners Association, held an \\"Irish wake\\" to draw attention to the impact of the ICC. The Derwood event was attended by approximately 100 people, all of whom wore green t-shirts to show their support for the trees. The event's planners also named the event \\"O'Malley's March\\" after Governor Martin O'Malley's former rock band in the hopes that this would encourage him to cancel the project. An op-ed in The Diamondback was printed which raised objections to the ICC. In June 2004, protests against the ICC were held at Dr. Charles R. Drew Elementary School in Silver Spring, where the State Highway Administration was simultaneously holding a public ICC workshop. This event was more heavily attended than the Derwood event and featured multiple speeches by people opposing the highway, which included Phil Andrews, a Montgomery County Council member. The participants claimed that ICC construction should be halted because of air pollution impacts on pupils at the school; however, it was clear that Governor O'Malley had no plans to do so. In August 2008, The Baltimore Sun published a letter to the editor from the executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth calling on the Maryland Department of Transportation to \\"cancel the ICC.\\" In September 2008, The Sun's columnist Dan Rodricks wrote an anti-ICC opinion piece asserting that the ICC was the \\"Intercounty Anachronism\\". Rodricks' column was first rebutted by a letter to the editor by Montgomery County Councilmember Nancy Floreen (D-At Large) and then in a longer op-ed by SHA Administrator Neil Pedersen. Also in September 2008, The Gazette published an op-ed by state delegate Heather R. Mizeur (D-District 20) suggesting that the ICC be canceled. The Mizeur op-ed was rebutted in a response (also published by The Gazette) by Neil Pedersen in October 2008. In November 2008, it was announced that Environmental Defense had dropped its appeal with the Fourth Circuit of the decision handed down by Judge Williams of the U.S. District Court for Maryland about a year earlier. In exchange for dropping the suit, the State Highway Administration agreed to fund new emissions-reduction technology used by public school buses in Montgomery County; and the SHA will also \\"sponsor a three-year study that involves installing air quality monitors along a major highway selected for its similar characteristics to the ICC and I-95.\\" Press releases were issued by the State Highway Administration and Environmental Defense discussing the details of the legal settlement. Environmental mitigation A major component of the ICC is environmental mitigation and aesthetics. In addition to work taking place near and in the right-of-way of the ICC, there are over 50 \\"off-site environmental and community improvement projects\\" that will be funded as part of the ICC engineering and construction budget. In a letter to the editor of The Baltimore Sun, David Marks, a former official with the Maryland Department of Transportation, wrote that the SHA project team \\"...had the foresight to require substantial environmental improvements as part of the project, and they insisted on broad public input...\\" MD 200 eastbound past MD 206 in Konterra One component of the mitigation is the replacement of parkland taken for the ICC with new land. Replacement lands intended to compensate for these losses include a large parcel of land in the Boyds area of Montgomery County owned by the Eugene B. Casey Foundation. However, the trustees of the Casey Foundation did not agree to the purchase of this parcel, so the State Highway Administration acquired the land by condemnation and the matter was reported as resolved in June 2008. In July 2008, controversy was reported on a similar subject. A parcel of land near the intersection of MD 198 and Peach Orchard Road which had been condemned by the SHA in 1997 for possible use as the so-called Northern Alignment (Corridor 2) was conveyed to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission to compensate for parkland which will be taken by the ICC. The former owner, Winchester Homes, filed a lawsuit contending that the SHA must offer to sell this land back to Winchester, and in May 2008, Judge S. Michael Pincus of the Montgomery County Circuit Court ruled that \\"the SHA was contractually obligated to offer Winchester Homes the chance to buy back the property.\\" It was further reported that the state filed an appeal in June 2008. In the February 2008 edition of the Successes in Stewardship newsletter, the Federal Highway Administration stated: > Since environmental impacts were the major barrier to prior ICC planning > efforts, the third EIS team redefined the project-development approach to > explicitly include environmental stewardship as part of the project's stated > purpose and need. In order to fulfill the ICC's stated purpose \\"to help > restore the natural, human, and cultural environments in the project area > from the adverse effects of past development,\\" lead-agency staff used > context-sensitive design approaches to minimize or altogether avoid adverse > impacts to wetlands and streams in the development of project alternatives. At least one section of the ICC was re-routed from the master-planned route to reduce environmental impact, though the re-routing led to additional residences having to be condemned as a result. Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) that were in the path of the ICC were located with the aid of dogs trained to find them by scent and were moved to other locations in Montgomery County near Boyds and Brookeville. In a letter to the editor of The Gazette, SHA Administrator Neil Pedersen enumerated a list of environmental mitigation and community enhancements that SHA is funding as part of constructing the ICC. The ICC is likely to force changes to the 14th hole of the Cross Creek Golf Club, which straddles the border between Montgomery County and Prince George's County. However, it was reported that the 14th hole was surveyed incorrectly, and part of it was mistakenly located on land set aside for the ICC. In January 2009, it was reported that Eyes of Paint Branch (a group that has opposed the ICC) had recently demanded of the SHA that the contractors working to build the ICC comply with Montgomery County's regulations for the Upper Paint Branch Special Protection Area, which the State of Maryland has no legal obligation to follow. Construction of the ICC has forced the National Capital Trolley Museum to relocate its car barns, shops, visitors center, and part of its track a short distance to the north. In 2006, the museum's development director made a public plea for relocation help and coordination in a Washington Post op-ed column. The museum suspended operations for relocation in December 2008 and resumed trolley rides in January 2010. In August 2009, the SHA held a public forum at the new and relocated trolley museum to describe the environmental mitigation aspects of the ongoing ICC construction project. A major environmental concern along the entire ICC project is the impact of stormwater runoff on creeks and streams, during and after construction. Techniques and technologies to treat such water are known as best management practices (BMPs). State-of-the-art BMPs used along the ICC's construction project were described in an article in Land and Water magazine. Some of the methods being used to control runoff were described in a The Baltimore Sun \\"On the Outdoors\\" column, published after the writer toured several work areas along the ICC's right-of-way: > The ICC project employs teams of \\"stormbusters\\" to put down straw and grass > seed and erect plastic silt fences in construction areas before it rains to > prevent erosion. Solar-powered stream monitors give Baker and enforcement > personnel a real-time reading of water conditions. Paved storm-water ditches > in older neighborhoods abutting the highway will be replaced by grass-lined > swales that will filter and cool the water before it enters tributaries. The Sun column went on to describe financial incentives that will be paid to construction contractors that meet environmental goals and requirements. As part of construction work, several archaeological sites have been found in the path of the ICC, including a Native American site near Georgia Avenue and Norbeck Road that contains artifacts dating to the Stone Age. and near US 29, the 19th century homestead of a freed slave, Melinda Jackson, containing numerous artifacts. Associated construction projects=ICC Trail The ICC Trail is a combination multi-use trail and on road route along the general path of the ICC. It includes about 7 miles of trail and 11 miles along parallel roads. A bicycle trail had long been identified in County master plans as part of the proposed ICC, both in Montgomery County and Prince George's County. However, in 2004, the SHA announced that it was dropping the ICC bike trail from its own plans due to cost and environmental footprint. This move was unpopular, with comments sent to the state's ICC web page overwhelmingly in favor of a bike trail; the Montgomery County Council voted 8‚Äì0 in favor of the trail and the state said it would consider five unconnected segments that would run along 40 percent of the ICC. When the State Highway Administration published its final plan for the ICC in May 2006, it recommended seven miles of the 18-mile trail be built as part of the highway and the remaining 11 miles be constructed separate from the highway project. The state later agreed to build 11.4 miles of a trail in separate segments in Prince George's and Montgomery counties. In response, Montgomery County began the process of amending the ICC limited functional Master Plan to include the new design for the bike path in October of 2007. One proposal was to keep a mostly parallel route by utilizing county park lands for the trail, but the County Council voted against that because it would be too harmful to some county parkland. The amendment was approved in April 2009, and it proposed a bikeway near the Intercounty Connector as well as a plan that would divert bike traffic along New Hampshire Avenue, Route 29, East Randolph and Fairland roads. The council approved the options with the idea that one or both would be exercised. View of the ICC Trail at Muncaster Mill Road Construction of the ICC trail began with construction of the road. The westernmost segment, from Needwood Road to MD 28 (Norbeck Road), primarily following the MD 200 right-of-way except for a section which follows Emory Lane to Georgia Avenue, opened first on July 30, 2011 shortly after the first section of the ICC opened; this section was later extended to MD 182 (Layhill Road). The second segment, which runs from Notley Road to MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue), behind the southern sound wall of the highway, and the third segment, which runs alongside US 29 and Briggs Chaney Road, both opened in late 2011. A fourth section was completed in 2015, running along the easternmost section of MD 200 from Konterra Drive to US 1 (Baltimore Avenue). In 2009 work began on the ICC Connector, a shared use path along Needwood Road connecting the ICC Trail to the Shady Grove Metro. Future segments of the trail have been left to county governments to plan and build. Exit list Exit numbers and mile markers are a continuation of those along I-370.

Life He was born Jean Clopinel or Jean Chopinel at Meung-sur-Loire. Tradition asserts that he studied at the University of Paris. He was, like his contemporary, Rutebeuf, a defender of Guillaume de Saint-Amour and a bitter critic of the mendicant orders. Jean de Meung says that in his youth he composed songs that were sung in every public place and school in France. Most of his life seems to have been spent in Paris, where he possessed, in the Rue Saint-Jacques, a house with a tower, court and garden, which was described in 1305 as the house of the late Jean de Meung, and was then bestowed by a certain Adam d'Andely on the Dominicans. He was buried in the now-demolished church of Paris's Dominican monastery, which was also on Rue Saint-Jacques. Roman de la Rose In the enumeration of his own works he places first his continuation of the Roman de la Rose of Guillaume de Lorris. The date of this second part (lines 4,089‚Äì21,780) is generally fixed between 1268 and 1285 by a reference in the poem to the death of Manfred and Conradin, executed in 1268 by order of Charles of Anjou (d. 1285) who is described as the present king of Sicily. M. F. Guillon (Jean Clopinel, 1903), however, considering the poem primarily as a political satire, places it in the last five years of the 13th century. Jean de Meun doubtless edited the work of his predecessor, Guillaume de Lorris, before using it as the starting-point of his own vast poem, running to 19,000 lines. The continuation of Jean de Meun is a satire on the monastic orders, on celibacy, on the nobility, the papal see, the excessive pretensions of royalty, and especially on women and marriage. Guillaume had been the servant of love, and the exponent of the laws of \\"courtoisie\\"; Jean de Meun added an \\"art of love,\\" exposing with brutality the vices of women, their arts of deception, and the means by which men may outwit them. Jean de Meun embodied the mocking, sceptical spirit of the fabliaux. He did not share in current superstitions, he had no respect for established institutions, and he scorned the conventions of feudalism and romance. His poem shows in the highest degree, in spite of the looseness of its plan, the faculty of keen observation, of lucid reasoning and exposition, and it entitles him to be considered the greatest of French medieval poets. He handled the French language with an ease and precision unknown to his predecessors, and the length of his poem was no bar to its popularity in the 13th and 14th centuries. Part of its vogue was no doubt because the author, who had mastered practically all the scientific and literary knowledge of his contemporaries in France, had found room in his poem for a great amount of useful information and for numerous citations from classical authors. The book was attacked by Guillaume de Deguileville in his P√®lerinage de la vie humaine (), long a favorite work both in England and France, by Jean Gerson, and by Christine de Pisan in her √âp√Ætre au dieu d'amour. It also found energetic defenders. Part of Jean's poem was translated into Middle English verse by Chaucer. The whole poem was translated into Modern English verse by F. S. Ellis and later by Charles Dahlberg. Other works Jean de Meun translated in 1284 the treatise De re militari of Vegetius into French as Le livre de V√©g√®ce de l'art de chevalerie. He also produced a spirited version, the first in French, of the letters of Ab√©lard and H√©lo√Øse. A 14th-century manuscript of this translation in the Biblioth√®que Nationale has annotations by Petrarch. His translation of the De consolatione philosophiae of Boethius is preceded by a letter to Philip IV in which he enumerates his earlier works, two of which are lost: De spirituelle amiti√© from the De spirituals amicitia of Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1166), and the Livre des merveilles d'Hirlande from the Topographia Hibernica, or De Mirabilibus Hiberniae of Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald de Barri). His last poems are doubtless his Testament and Codicille. The Testament is written in quatrains in monorhyme, and contains advice to the different classes of the community.

In 1997, it did not take part in the General Election. In the run-up to the 2001 general election, responding to Chiam See Tong's call for a united front against the ruling People's Action Party, the party joined with the National Solidarity Party, the Singapore People's Party and the Singapore Malay National Organisation to form the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA). Although the party itself failed to win any seats since it was formed, the SDA did manage to win one seat at Potong Pasir, with Chiam See Tong of the Singapore People's Party as Member of Parliament and have another (Steve Chia of the National Solidarity Party) in parliament through the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme.

Originally it was an ironic term denoting a sentimental singing style made possible by the use of microphones. Some performers, such as Russ Columbo, did not accept the term: Frank Sinatra once said that he did not consider himself or Bing Crosby \\"crooners\\".CBS Special \\"Sinatra The Legend\\" recording of It Was A Very Good Year (1965) History Perry Como, October 1946 Gene Austin This dominant popular vocal style coincided with the advent of radio broadcasting and electrical recording. Before the advent of the microphone, popular singers like Al Jolson had to project to the rear seats of a theater, as did opera singers, which made for a very loud vocal style. The microphone made possible the more personal style. Al Bowlly, Gene Austin, Art Gillham and, by some historical accounts, Vaughn De LeathFather of Radio: The Autobiography of Lee de Forest, 1950, page 351.Irving Settel, A Pictorial History of Radio, p. 58, Grosset & Dunlap (1967). are often credited as inventors of the crooning style, but Rudy Vall√©e achieved more widespread popularity, beginning in 1928; he could be heard by anyone with a phonograph or a radio. His first film, The Vagabond Lover, was promoted with the line, \\"Men Hate Him! Women Love Him!\\" while his success brought press warnings of the \\"Vallee Peril\\": this \\"punk from Maine\\" with the \\"dripping voice\\" required mounted police to \\"beat back crowds of screaming and swooning females\\" at his vaudeville shows. By the early 1930s, the term \\"crooner\\" had taken on a pejorative connotation. Cardinal William O'Connell of Boston and the New York Singing Teachers Association (NYSTA) both publicly denounced the vocal form, O'Connell calling it \\"base\\", \\"degenerate\\", \\"defiling\\" and un-American, with the NYSTA adding \\"corrupt\\". Even The New York Times predicted that crooning would be just a passing fad. The newspaper wrote, \\"They sing like that because they can't help it. Their style is begging to go out of fashion‚Ä¶. Crooners will soon go the way of tandem bicycles, mah jongg and midget golf.\\" Voice range shifted from tenor (Vall√©e) to baritone (Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby). Still, a 1931 record by Dick Robertson, \\"Crosby, Columbo & Vallee\\", called upon men to fight \\"these public enemies\\" brought into homes via radio. Some female singers, such as Vaughn De Leath, Annette Hanshaw, Mildred Bailey (at the beginning of her career) and Helen Rowland have been cited in the category of crooners. Country crooners Due to the country songs popularized by Bing Crosby, the crooning style of singing became an enduring part of country music.Bing Crosby, \\"I'm an Old Cowhand,\\" original mono recordings from 1933-1944, ASV Mono, Living Era, 1995. Crosby achieved a million seller with his 1940 rendition of the song \\"San Antonio Rose\\", originally recorded by Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys. In 1942, Perry Como had a smash hit with \\"Deep in the Heart of Texas\\"; Crosby, who had an enormous influence on Como, covered this song and took it to the number 3 position in the US chart that same year. Eddy Arnold, Jim Reeves and Ray Price are especially well known for their country crooner standards. Dean Martin is associated with the country music he recorded in the period when he was working for Reprise Records, whilst his fellow Italian-American crooner Como recorded several albums with country producer Chet Atkins in Nashville. Regular, non-country crooners also scored hits with pop versions of country songs: Tony Bennett had a Billboard number 1 hit in 1951 with his rendition of Hank Williams' \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\"; Como had a number 1 hit in 1953 with his version of \\"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\\", a chart-topping country hit for its author Slim Willet and a number 4 country hit for Ray Price; Guy Mitchell scored a number 1 in 1959 with \\"Heartaches by the Number\\", a country hit for Ray Price; and Britain's Engelbert Humperdinck achieved a 1967 UK number 1 hit with \\"Release Me\\", another song already made famous by Price in 1954. In 1970, Price had a number 1 US country hit and a number 11 Hot 100 hit with the song \\"For the Good Times\\", written by Kris Kristofferson; subsequently, Como's rendition reached number 7 in 1973 on the UK Singles Chart.

The cars are a \\"follow-up\\" or supplemental stock to the A Division's R33s, which some of the cars closely resemble. A total of 424 cars were built, arranged in pairs. The order includes World's Fair cars comprising 390 cars, and Main Line cars comprising 34 cars.https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48294055022/in/album-72157709666433846/ The R36s entered service on October 24, 1963, and were overhauled in the mid-1980s. They were retired by 2003 with the delivery of the R142 and R142A cars. While most cars were reefed, some have been preserved, and others have been retained for other purposes. Description The R36s were numbered 9346‚Äì9769. They were the last entirely LAHT bodied (non-stainless steel) cars built for the New York City Subway. Cars 9346‚Äì9523 and 9558‚Äì9769 were specifically purchased for service on the IRT Flushing Line ( trains), which was the closest line to the 1964 New York World's Fair. The cars were also referred to as \\"World's Fair\\" cars, or R36WFs (R36 World's Fair), and featured three-piece curved \\"picture\\" windows, unlike other IRT cars at the time. While in regular service, five two-car consists of these cars were coupled to one single R33S car to make 11-car trains for the 7 and <7> routes. Cars 9524‚Äì9557 were purchased for service on all other IRT routes. The cars were also referred to as \\"Main Line\\" cars, or R36MLs (R36 Main Line) to distinguish them from the \\"World's Fair\\" cars. They were built from unfinished car body shells of the R33 order, and therefore featured sported drop-sash side windows. Though all cars were originally delivered without air conditioning, all cars in this series received air conditioning as part of a retrofitting program from 1976 until all retrofit work was completed in 1981. Although the R36s were later referred to as Redbirds, the cars were originally painted in different schemes when they were delivered. The \\"World's Fair\\" cars were painted in a light blue turquoise \\"Bluebird\\" scheme, while the \\"Main Line\\" cars were painted bright red like the R33s. These color schemes were used until 1977, when the cars were painted in the silver/blue MTA livery. Then, they were painted in a full white (roof, bonnets, sides were all painted white) \\"anti-graffiti\\" scheme from 1981 to 1982 to combat graffiti; since the white paint was a Teflon-based paint, the graffiti did not stick to it very well. The look was abandoned for the famous \\"Redbird\\" style, which was applied onto the cars when they were rebuilt. History=Early history In 1962, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) ordered 430 cars for the train. This route would run to the World's Fair grounds in Flushing Meadows in Queens. The first 40 cars were singles (R33S), with the rest being R36 cars; single cars were needed since the service runs 11-car trains, and R36 cars were built only in pairs. The first R36 cars (\\"World's Fair\\" cars 9558‚Äì9561) arrived in fall 1963, shortly after the R33S cars began arriving in September that year. The first train of R33S and \\"World's Fair\\" R36 cars was placed in service on the route on October 24, 1963. With the fair opening approaching on April 12, 1964, \\"World's Fair\\" R36 cars were built and delivered in larger quantities that fall. More \\"World's Fair\\" cars arrived throughout 1964, enough to displace the R12s, R14s, and R15s from the train by the close of 1964. The \\"Main Line\\" R36s entered service on the ' almost a year later, on July 24, 1964. The cars ran on the IRT main lines (Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue and Lexington Avenue) ‚Äì mainly on the ' and ' ‚Äì until their overhauls. Rebuilding By 1982, all cars had received air conditioning as part of a retrofitting program to replace the cars' original Axiflow ceiling fans. The \\"World's Fair\\" R36s were the first cars to be rebuilt in the NYCTA's General Overhaul Program (GOH) in the 1980s. This program improved car life by rebuilding older cars and keeping other cars in a state of good repair. A trial rebuild program was done on selected Westinghouse R36 cars in 1981‚Äì83. Beginning in late 1984, the other R36 cars were rebuilt at a rate of 200 cars per year, with the majority of them done in-house at the Coney Island Shop. Others were rebuilt by General Electric in Buffalo, New York, and by Amtrak at its Beech Grove, Indiana, and Wilmington, Delaware shops. The last remaining cars were sent out for rebuild in late 1985, and by 1986, all cars were back in service. After rebuilding, the R36 cars were repainted in a scheme involving a deep maroon red body, black front bonnets and anti-climbers, and a silver roof prior to returning to service. At first, the scheme was known as \\"Silver Fox\\", \\"Broad Street Red\\", or \\"Gunn Red\\" (after NYCT chief David L. Gunn) and was a graffiti-resistant red. By 1989, the Gunn Red would evolve into the \\"Redbird\\" scheme best known to many New Yorkers, with beige interiors, red exterior paint and interior doors and black, and silver exterior trim along with the car windows, roof, and undersides. In 1999, the R36 cars were the most reliable in the NYCT fleet, with a Mean Distance Between Failure (MDBF) rate of 194,150 miles, despite being 35 years old at the time. While in decent shape mechanically, rust holes and car body corrosion were beginning to form in the sides of most of the cars. From the 1990s until mid-2001, \\"World's Fair\\" cars 9478‚Äì9523 usually ran on the train based at Westchester Yard in the Bronx. Previously, some Westinghouse-equipped cars had been assigned to the and trains in the 1970s. The \\"Main Line\\" cars usually ran on the ' from 1984 to 1988, and were transferred to the ' from 1988 to 2001, when they were returned to the 7. During this time, some cars also provided occasional service on the 4 route, which occasionally uses equipment borrowed from the 6. Retirement In 1996, the New York City Transit Authority announced their plans to phase out the Redbirds with the R142 and R142A fleets. With the arrival of the R142As on the 6, the \\"Main Line\\" R36s were transferred over to the 7. While the Redbirds on the IRT Main Line were retired starting in early 2001, the service was still provided by R33S cars and R36s. In January 2002, a set of R62As arrived from the IRT mainline. As more R142s and R142As were delivered, R62As were gradually transferred from the and to the , in turn replacing the R33S cars and R36s. The last \\"Main Line\\" R36 pair, 9542‚Äì9543, ran on the 7, until its retirement in August 2003. The last train of \\"World's Fair\\" R36s, consisting of pairs 9564‚Äì9565, 9616‚Äì9617, 9582‚Äì9583, 9584‚Äì9585, and 9586‚Äì9587 finally ran along the on November 3, 2003, with R33S car 9309, marking the end of the Redbird cars and non-stainless steel cars in the subway. Most of the Redbirds (1,294) were stripped and then submerged off the coast of Delaware, New Jersey, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia as an artificial barrier and diving reefs, by Weeks Marine. Several other R36 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system. The full list includes: * \\"Main Line\\" pair 9542‚Äì9543 ‚Äì preserved by the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn since 2004.https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?30358https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?30494 This pair is currently stored at the 207th Street Yard, awaiting restoration. * \\"World's Fair\\" pair 9584‚Äì9585 ‚Äì part of the rail adhesion train.

These cars were stored for many years until being moved to the Concourse Yard in summer 2013. In September 2013, the pair was moved to 207th Street Yard and restored to operating status. The cars were initially displayed at the transit museum and finally participated on their first fan trip on June 8, 2014, on the 7 route, as part of the Train of Many Colors. \\"World's Fair\\" pair 9582‚Äì9583 also remains on MTA property. They were transferred to the Unionport Yard, along with pairs 9584‚Äì9585, and 9586‚Äì9587. However, these cars ended up being stored due to structural issues and are now awaiting scrapping. In addition to these cars, other cars were also stored around the system. \\"World's Fair\\" pair 9400‚Äì9401 was stored at the Corona Yard for preservation; however, the cars were never used and were scrapped on October 7, 2013. \\"World's Fair\\" pair 9564‚Äì9565 was set aside and transferred to Coney Island Yard in December 2004; car 9564 was planned to be repurposed into a visitor center at Queens Borough Hall in Kew Gardens, Queens, and the car 9565 was planned to be preserved in a museum in West Babylon, New York. However, R33 9075 was used at Queens Borough Hall instead of 9564, and 9565 never made it to the proposed museum; the cars were subsequently reefed in 2008. \\"World's Fair\\" pair 9588‚Äì9589 was stored at the Concourse Yard until 2008, when the pair was reefed.  In culture  Eight WH-powered \\"World's Fair\\" cars (9356‚Äì57, 9360‚Äì61, 9394‚Äì95, 9412‚Äì13) and two GE-powered cars (9712‚Äì13), in addition to one R33S (9327), were wrapped and painted in New York Mets colors on October 24, 2000, prior to Game 3 of the 2000 World Series between the Yankees and Mets. In addition, the \\"World's Fair\\" cars have made cameo roles in various TV shows and movies. Nicolas Cage rides a 7 train of \\"World's Fair\\" R36s in It Could Happen to You (1994).

The city stands on the Krynka River about from the oblast's administrative center, Donetsk. Its population is approximately . Yenakiieve is an important regional centre of coal mining, metallurgy, chemical production and manufacturing. The city's outdated industry has caused accidents like that of a gas explosion which occurred in June 2008 at one of Yenakiieve's coal mines. Yenakiieve was founded in 1898 when numerous workers' settlements around the Peter's Iron and Steel Works were united into a single settlement named after . Its first coal mines had dated from 1883. The settlement was incorporated as a city in 1925. By 1958, the city and factories had expanded significantly and overtook the out-lying villages of Simyukuo, Yevrah, and Tsiminyenny, all of which were resettled in their entirety when local livestock could not survive the expanding steel mills' runoff and pollution. One of the oldest metallurgical factories of Ukraine‚Äîthe Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works‚Äîoperates in Yenakiieve. The city is known as the birthplace of the former President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych (in office 2010‚Äì2014). History Permanent settlements on the territory of present-day Yenakiieve were founded in 1783. In 1858 Sofiyevsky coal mine was opened there. At the same time Petrovsky cast-iron plant was constructed (today Yenakiyeve Iron and Steel Works). In 1895 engineers F. Yenakiev and B. Yalovetsky and several Belgian businessmen founded a Russian-Belgian metallurgic society which by 1897 constructed a new Petrovsky cast-iron plant around the settlement Fyodorovka. Coal mines were opened around the plant. Settlements were formed near them and in 1898 they were united into one called Enakievsky after the founder of the Russian-Belgian metallurgic society. The writer A. I. Kuprin who worked at the plant in 1896 described workers‚Äô lives in the story ‚ÄúMolokh‚Äù. Before World War I several plants were built in Yenakiieve: coke chemical, brick, beer brewing and butter making. Petrovsky plant became one of the largest metallurgic plants (3rd place) in southern Russia. In 1913 it produced 349,200 tons of cast-iron and 316,400 tons of steel. As a result of ruin after World War I and Civil War of 1919‚Äì1921 Petrovsky plant was the only one producing steel. By 1925 the population in Yenakiieve was 34,000, it was referred to as a town. In 1928 the town was renamed into Rykovo, after Soviet party- and statesman Alexei Rykov. After Rykov was arrested in 1937 and the town was renamed as Ordzhonikidze after another Soviet leader Sergo Ordzhonikidze. The name Yenakiieve was returned to the town in 1943. By 1939 the population of the town was 88,200. During World War II Yenakiieve was under siege from Italian army auxiliary units that were seconded to the German Army. They were followed by German units. The city was attacked from 31 October 1941 and not freed until 3 September 1943. Street fighting was fierce between the end of November and beginning of December 1941. ‚ÄúRecruitment‚Äù of civilians (Ostarbeiter) began in December 1941. In 1950 about twelve Italian POWs (prisoners of war) were put on trial, over atrocities in Yenakiieve (including the destruction of a hospital). Apparently no convictions were registered, and by 1954 all Italian POWs were returned to Italy. In the 1950s several plants were put into operation: of ferro-concrete items, of construction material, of house building and automobile-repairing. On September 16, 1979, on the territory of Yenakiieve in the mine ‚ÄúYuny Communar‚Äù there was one of the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy‚Äîan object ‚ÄúKlivazh‚Äù. In 2002 the mine was closed as non-perspective and environmentalists worry about the danger of filling the mine with water. It might cause radioactive pollution of the underground water. That's why pumps continue to pump the water out of the abandoned mine.

It connects to, but is not considered a part of, the Mexico City Metro. Rather, it is operated by the Servicio de Transportes El√©ctricos (STE), the authority that operates Mexico City's electric trolleybus system and formerly operated the municipal electric tram system. History Many of Mexico City's original tram lines were abandoned in the 1960s and 1970s. The original Xochimilco tramline had been in operation since 1910, but the Xochimilco tramway's section between Avenida Tasque√±a and the city centre was replaced by a new metro line in 1970.Morrison, Allen (2003). The Tramways of Mexico City, Part 4. Retrieved 2010-05-05.May, Jack (1994). \\"Mexico Says S√≠ to LRT: Light Rail South of the Border\\". 1994 Light Rail Annual & User's Guide, pp. 2‚Äì5. Pasadena, CA (US): Pentrex. . With the subsequent Mexico City tramway closures that took effect in May 1979, the only tramlines left in operation were routes 53 and 54, running from Tasque√±a metro station to Tlalpan and Xochimilco, respectively.Modern Tramway, October 1979 issue, p. 364. UK: Ian Allan Publishing. . These shared a common routing between Tasque√±a and Huipulco, with the Tlalpan service branching off of the main line for only about to its terminus at Avenida San Fernando, in the historic centre of Tlalpan borough. On the common section, the tracks were located in the wide median of Calzada de Tlalpan. The tracks between Huipulco and Xochimilco were also in a separate right-of-way. The separation from street traffic, except at crossings, made routes 53 and 54 more like what later came to be called light rail unlike Mexico City's other tramlines which were closed by 1979, but these lines still lacked other light-rail attributes such a full stations. Thus the decision was made in the early 1980s to convert these lines to modern light rail transit. Both lines ceased operation in September 1984, for rebuilding as light rail. Changes to allow faster operation included replacing the simple tram stops with semi-enclosed estaciones (stations), which were spaced farther apart, fitted with high-level boarding platforms and set up as paid areas, so that all payment of fares would take place before boarding. In between the stations the work included installing new tracks set in concrete; putting fencing along the line's right- of-way and closing some street crossings; and installing overhead catenary designed for higher speeds.Saitta, Joseph P. (1987). \\"Down Mexico Way\\". Traction Yearbook '87, pp. 119‚Äì123. . The fleet of 1940s PCC streetcars was also replaced by a fleet of new articulated light rail cars built partially using components from the old cars, including their PCC bogies (trucks) and propulsion systems (see Rolling stock, below, for more details).\\"LRT Developments in Mexico\\". Mass Transit magazine, June 1989, pp. 20‚Äì21. Cygnus Publishing. ISSN 0364-3484. The section between Tasque√±a and Estadio Azteca (Aztec Stadium), just short of Huipulco junction (for the branch to Tlalpan), opened as light rail on 1 August 1986, but ran for only three days before poor reliability with the heavily rebuilt rail cars led to a decision to suspend service. Service resumed in November 1986. Right-of-way work then shifted to the line's outer section, between Estadio Azteca and Xochimilco, with similar upgrading for higher-speed operation. This section opened on 29 November 1988. The old tram line 54 had included a long loop through the historic centre of Xochimilco, along narrow city streets, but this was not included in the upgrading to light rail, and was permanently abandoned when closed in 1984. One of the Moyada-built cars that served the Tren Ligero line from 1986‚Äì91, seen at Tasque√±a terminal in 1990 The branch from Huipulco junction to Tlalpan was also rebuilt, but in a different manner, changed from private right-of-way to street running (without separation from other traffic) in the middle lanes of Calle Ferrocarril (now known as Renato Leduc) and also shortened by about at its outer end, no longer reaching Avenida San Fernando. Three high-platform stops were built, one being at the new terminus, which was referred to simply as \\"Tlalpan\\" on the rail cars' destination signs. Service to Tlalpan was reintroduced on 13 March 1990, now running only as a one-car shuttle to and from Estadio Azteca, no longer through to Tasque√±a.Modern Tramway, July 1990 issue, p. 244. UK: Ian Allan Publishing. . Patronage was low, and service was discontinued only one year later, in March 1991, after an accident damaged the one car (No. 000) normally assigned to the Tlalpan route. Service was reinstated on 13 December 1991, as STE began to place new cars into service on the Xochimilco line, but ceased again on 6 October 1992 and has never resumed. The overhead line voltage was 600 volts DC until around the end of 1995, when it was raised to 750 V.Webb, Mary; and Pattison, Tony (Eds.) (2003). Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2003-2004, p. 244. Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): Jane's Information Group. . Route The panorama of the line between La Noria and Huichapan The line runs between Metro Tasque√±a and the town of Xochimilco, south of Mexico City. It serves the Coyoac√°n, Tlalpan, and Xochimilco boroughs, giving residents a fast link to the urban south of Mexico City. For the northern stretch of its run, it travels along the central reservation of the Calzada de Tlalpan, as does Metro Line 2 south of Metro San Antonio Abad - for this reason, it is sometimes seen as a continuation of that line, albeit on a more modest scale. The light rail line has 18 stations: two terminals and 16 intermediate stations. Three of these stations were built later than the others; Huipulco, Perif√©rico and Huichapan stations opened in November 1993. The travel time from one end of the line to the other is approximately 37 minutes. Until 1995, the outer terminus was located just beyond Calle Francisco Goitia, at what is now named Francisco Goitia station; it was named \\"Xochimilco\\" station originally. In that year, the line was extended east by about to a new terminus at the western edge of Delegaci√≥n Xochimilco's centre, along a section of former tram line 54, closed in 1984. This new section was opened on 14 September 1995, and the new terminus was named Embarcadero. However, as the new terminus was now located closer to the centre of Xochimilco than was the actual station bearing that name, STE eventually renamed Embarcadero station as \\"Xochimilco\\", and the original \\"Xochimilco\\" station‚Äînow the line's penultimate station‚Äîbecame Francisco Goitia station. However, the partly single-track segment from Francisco Goitia to Xochimilco limited capacity on the line, and so the Xochimilco station was rebuilt to the west and equipped with two tracks and three loading platforms. The old Xochimilco station closed in November 2007 for the start of construction, and the new station opened on 14 December 2008. Rolling stock Concarril-built car number 020 approaching the platform at Estadio Azteca station The Xochimilco line's rolling stock currently consists of 24 articulated light rail vehicles (LRVs) built by Concarril or Bombardier/Siemens, between 1990 and 2014. Each car is about long and capable of carrying up to 300 passengers. The first 16 of these replaced older cars over the period 1991‚Äì95. The line's original fleet consisted of semi-new articulated LRVs built by Moyada (Motores y Adaptaciones Automotrices, S.A.), incorporating the bogies (trucks) and some other parts from STE's large fleet of withdrawn 1940s-vintage PCC streetcars. (STE originally intended to rebuild about 20 PCCs for the lines, a project well underway at STE's Tetepilco Depot when the workshop building collapsed during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, crushing the cars.). The prototype LRV was numbered 000, and the remainder 001-016. The Moyada cars had all-new bodies and were equipped with pantographs instead of trolley poles to collect current from the overhead wires. Unlike the old streetcars/trams, they were also bi-directional, having operating cabs at both ends and doors on both sides. Perhaps because of their vintage running gear or electrical components, these cars were found to be unreliable, even after the refurbishment of six in 1989‚Äì91. In 1989, STE placed an order with Concarril for 12 all-new LRVs with similar capacity, to the same design as LRVs Concarril had recently supplied to Guadalajara's light rail system. Numbered 017‚Äì028, the order's first cars arrived in January 1991 entered service on 6 December 1991, replacing all of the Moyada cars except on the Tlalpan shuttle service. When Tlalpan service was withdrawn again in October 1992, the Moyada cars were no longer used. However, in 1992‚Äì93 three Moyada cars (005, 010 and 016) were again fitted with all-new bodies, now to a design intended to resemble the Concarril cars, this work being undertaken by local firm Sintra S.A. The three \\"Sintra\\" cars, as they were known, the fleet's last to use PCC-type control systems, entered service on 1 June 1993. They were withdrawn in late 1995, and shortly afterward the voltage of the line was raised from 600 V DC to 750 V. The newer cars had already been able to operate at the higher voltage. Four additional LRVs of the same type as the Concarril units were purchased later, in 1995, numbered 029‚Äì032. These were built by Bombardier, which had acquired Concarril in 1992, but were built in the same factory (in Ciudad Sahag√∫n) and were nearly identical to STE's 12 Concarril cars. In the mid-2000s, four more cars were purchased later from Bombardier, numbered 033‚Äì036, and they entered service on the Xochimilco light rail line in September and October 2008, increasing the fleet size to 20 cars, numbered 017‚Äì036. On 30 August 2011, on its way to Huichapan station, car 031 was hit, while coming to a stop, at full speed by car 027. Twenty-nine people were injured. The two LRVs sustained heavy damage. One half of each two-section LRV was scrapped, and in 2013 STE hired Bombardier to supply two all-new half-car sections and to combine them with the undamaged halves of the two LRVs.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, September 2014, p. 399. LRTA Publishing (UK). . Cars 027 and 031 both returned to service in autumn 2014.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, May 2015, p. 207. LRTA Publishing (UK). . Meanwhile, another four new LRVs were purchased from Bombardier in 2013‚Äì14, which would be assigned STE fleet numbers 037‚Äì040. They were delivered in summer 2014 and entered service on 16 March 2015, increasing the size of the fleet to 24 cars (numbered 017‚Äì040). Stations Full STE network as of 2006.

He releases albums and performs on stage in Canada and France and tours in Canada and Europe. Early life Daniel Lavoie was born in Dunrea, Manitoba on March 17, 1949. He is bilingual in English and French, since his family was part of a small French-speaking community in the predominantly anglophone province. He is the eldest of six children. His father was a shopkeeper and his mother a housewife. Daniel took piano lessons with nuns as a little boy and continued his musical education in a French-language Jesuit boarding school, Coll√®ge de St-Boniface (now Universit√© de Saint-Boniface), in St. Boniface neighborhood of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Career=Music In 1967, Daniel Lavoie won the CBC's competition for singer-songwriters \\"Jeunesse Oblige\\". Soon after that he began touring Quebec's music clubs with groups (Spectre, then Dieu de l'amour vous aime). At that time he changed his name from G√©rald to Daniel. In 1973 Daniel Lavoie recorded his first single, \\"Marie connue\\", and in 1974, his second, \\"S'endormir pour une rose\\". His first album A court terme (1975) had moderate success. One of the songs from this albums, \\"J'ai quitt√© mon √Æle\\" became especially popular in France and also in Portugal and Brazil. In 2009 \\"J'ai quitt√© mon √Æle\\" was selected by CBC Radio listeners among the top 49 Canadian songs in all genres that best defined the country's image for Barack Obama, to be presented to him on an iPod for his inauguration. The second album, Berceuse pour un Lion (1977) was well received in Quebec and contained several hits (\\"Dans le temps des animaux\\", \\"La V√©rit√© sur la v√©rit√©\\", \\"Berceuse pour un lion\\"), but it was the third album, Nirvana bleu (1979) that brought Daniel Lavoie true recognition in Quebec. He toured all over Quebec and also performed in France (Th√©√¢tre Montparnasse in Paris in 1980). His popularity as a live performer was growing. In 1980 he received his first F√©lix Award for the best male singer of the year. Many more were to follow. In 1981, Daniel Lavoie released his first English-language album Cravings as well as his fourth French-language album Aigre doux. The year 1984 was a turning point in Daniel Lavoie's career with the release of his album Tension Attention (European title Ils s'aiment). One of the songs from this album, \\"Ils s'aiment\\" became especially popular and its single sold 2 million copies. It has been translated into several languages and covered by dozens of performers, among them Ana Belen (\\"Ellos se aman\\", in Spanish), Richard Cocciante (in Italian and Spanish), Diane Dufresne (in French), Paulo Gonzo (\\"Ridiculous Love\\", in English), Ramses Shaffy (\\"Regenboog\\", in Dutch). \\"Ils s'aiment\\" and \\"Tension Attention\\" brought Daniel Lavoie multiple awards both in Quebec and in France. The same year Daniel created his solo concert show H√¥tel des r√™ves which he presented both in Quebec and in Europe. Lavoie's next album, Vue sur la mer (1987) was another success. The release was followed by 5 nights engagement at the Olympia theatre in Paris, and later a 21-date tour throughout Europe. More awards followed, and in the spring of 1988 for three months Lavoie performed his show H√¥tel des r√™ves at the Th√©√¢tre Outremont in Montreal. The 1990 album Long Courrier (European title Chanson de la Terre) included \\"Qui sait\\", \\"Le pape du rap\\", and \\"Jours de plaine\\". A study conducted in the early 1990s placed Lavoie among most highly respected by their peers French-Canadian singer-songwriters.p. 108, 115: \\"Artists whose prestige scores exhibit low standard deviations (below 1.5), and therefore the highest degree of consensus, are either highly respected and mostly male songwriters in quadrant I or low-prestige interpreters in quadrant IV. The former include songwriters Beau Dommage, Claude Dubois, Daniel Lavoie, Felix Leclerc, Gilles Vignault, Laurence Jalbert, Luc de Larochelliere, Marie Philippe, Michel Rivard, Offenbach, Paul Piche, Richard Seguin, and Robert Charlebois.\\" In 1992 Lavoie participated in Catherine Lara's symphonic rock- musical Sand et les Romantiques, performing the part of Eug√®ne Delacroix. The same year he released another English-language album, Here in the heart. He also appeared in an episode of the American soap opera General Hospital as himself performing his own song \\"Weak for Love\\". Lavoie's next and final English-language album Woman to Man appeared in 1994. In 1995 Lavoie released a new album Ici (European title O√π la route m√®ne) which introduced new hits such as \\"O√π la route m√®ne\\", \\"Je pensais pas\\", and \\"Je suis une rivi√®re\\". Two albums for children followed: Le B√©b√© Dragon (1996) and Le B√©b√© Dragon vol. 2 (1997). Live album of Lavoie's best hits along with never-before performed pieces, Live au Divan Vert (European title Le meilleur de Daniel Lavoie) was recorded in 1997. In 1998 Lavoie was cast as priest Frollo in Richard Cocciante and Luc Plamondon's new musical Notre-Dame de Paris, which was based on the eponymous novel by Victor Hugo. The musical became very successful (\\"Notre-Dame De Paris\\" won world's best-selling artist/group for 1998 at the World Music Awards on May 5, 1999)Tesseyre, Cecile; Dezzani, Mark. Billboard ‚Äì The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment 111.26 (June 26, 1999): 8, 75. Albums were sold by the millions (certified triple- platinum by CRIA for sales of more than 300,000 copies), and for seven months Daniel sang the part of Frollo in front of sold-out crowds of the Palais des Congr√®s in Paris. After that he also participated in the show's tour in France, as well as the Quebec production and the English version in London, in 2000. The song \\"Belle\\", which he performed with Garou and Patrick Fiori became enormously popular (in 1998 3 million copies of this song were sold in Europe, where it was no. 1 for 30 weeks.) In 2002 Lavoie was cast in another musical in Paris, this time Le Petit Prince by Richard Cocciante and Elisabeth Anais, based on Antoine de St-Exup√©ry's book. He performed the part of the Pilot until April 2003. The new album Com√©dies humaines was released in 2004 and included hits like \\"Violoncelle\\" and \\"B√©nies Soient Les Femmes\\". A tour in France and Quebec followed. The same year Lavoie released a storybook for children illustrated by Oksana Kemarskaya Roul√© Boul√©: Je suis une boule qui roule, accompanied by an album of the same name that consisted of selections from the two B√©b√© dragon albums. In 2011 this work was selected along with several other books for use as elementary school teaching texts in Quebec and republished with a teaching aide within a series L'√©cole de La Montagne secr√®te. In February 2005 Lavoie participated in a stage revival of Nelligan, an opera by Andr√© Gagnon based on the works and biography of √âmile Nelligan, Quebec's late 19th-century poet. The show, in which Lavoie sang the part of the Old Nelligan was recorded in a live album. The album Docteur Tendresse appeared in 2007. It included songs like \\"Docteur Tendresse\\", \\"La voil√† notre arm√©e\\" (to the lyrics by Allain Leprest). In 2008 Lavoie accepted an invitation to participate in a project that united music with the poetry of Gaston Miron, Quebec's 20th-century poet : the album Douze homme rapaill√©s, a collection of musical settings of Miron's poems by Gilles B√©langer and performed by various Quebec's singers-songwriters. The second volume of this work came out in 2010 (Douze homme rapaill√©s ‚Äì volume 2). The rare stage performances of Douze homme rapaill√©s won both critical and popular acclaim. The third installment of the project, the disc La symphonie rapaill√©e presenting a selection of the songs from the previous two albums, this time accompanied by an orchestra, was released in April 2014. Beginning in December 2010 Lavoie participated in a series of the concert versions of Notre-Dame de Paris which reunited the original cast. These shows were presented in Kiev, Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Paris and Beirut. In 2011 Lavoie released J'√©coute la radio, an album of newly arranged hits plus a new song (J'√©coute la radio).

It originally aired on March 27, 1964 on CBS. Opening narrationPlot Sheriff Koch (Michael Constantine) cannot sleep the night before the execution of a man, as he feels conflicted about the situation. His wife Ella (Eve McVeagh) is no comfort as she snarls, \\"What time do they string him up; you know what I mean...what time does he get hung?\\" Her attitude represents the hateful sentiment of the town that looks forward to the fate of Jagger, a man who is to be hanged after being wrongfully convicted of killing a bigot in self-defense and who is unrepentant about the killing. On the day of his execution, the sun does not rise in the morning, and it seems that this is the only place in the world where this is true. There is still some dispute as to whether Jagger is guilty. The sheriff is conflicted, while the deputy is convinced Jagger is guilty; the latter accused of perjury by the town news reporter. At 9:00 AM, just before the hanging, it is still dark; the radio now reporting the darkness confined to this one small village. The sheriff admits he feels guilty because he didn't question the lack of autopsy of the victim, and didn't care that there were powder burns on the victim despite the deputy testifying that Jagger shot the victim from across a room. The sheriff wanted to be reelected, and as such went along with the status quo. However, Jagger is hanged anyway at 9:30, much to the delight of the town. The town clergyman, although a different faith and race than Jagger, steps in and says that he is thankful to him for having stood up for him in the past. The clergyman also reluctantly agrees to the execution, and the deputy says that for having gone along with the execution, that the clergyman has \\"seen the light\\". The clergyman replies that the sky is black because of all the hatred in the world, namely the hatred surrounding Jagger's execution. The sky becomes even darker after the execution. The deputy is convinced that the darkness is nothing more than fog, which will eventually lift, but neither the sheriff or reporter are convinced. Later, a radio broadcast reveals that the town is not the only place where this disturbance is happening. The sky has turned dark over North Vietnam, a section of the Berlin Wall, a political prison in Budapest, a section of Chicago, a street in Dallas, Birmingham, Alabama, a section of Shanghai and other places of hate around the world. Closing narrationCast *Michael Constantine as Sheriff Charlie Koch *Paul Fix as Colbey *George Lindsey as Deputy Pierce *Ivan Dixon as the Reverend Anderson *Terry Becker as Jagger *Eve McVeagh as Ella *Douglas Bank as Man *Russell Custer as Townsman *Elizabeth Harrower as Woman *Michael Jeffers as Deputy *Robert McCord as Townsman *Ward Wood as Man Production notes Serling wrote this script primarily as his personal reaction to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Indeed, mention is made in the story of \\"a street in Dallas, Texas\\" (where Kennedy was murdered as his motorcade traveled down Elm Street in Dallas' Dealey Plaza) as being enveloped by the strange darkness. The episode is similar to \\"Many, Many Monkeys\\", a script written for Twilight Zone by its producer, William Froug, but never shot. In that script an epidemic breaks out in which afflicted persons' eyes seal shut as folds of flesh grow over them. Though a nuclear explosion is initially blamed, one character proposes that it is a physical manifestation of hate that is blinding them. The network bought the script but then shelved it, finding its subject matter too disturbing, but it was eventually produced in 1989, during the first revival of Twilight Zone. Years earlier, Serling had written a teleplay for Playhouse 90 called \\"A Town Has Turned to Dust\\", about the 1870 lynching of an innocent Mexican man in a Southwestern town. This story was based on the Emmett Till case, and Serling had to deal with executive interference and network censors before the episode could air.Gould, Jack. \\"Prejudice Dissected\\", New York Times; June 20, 1958; pg. 47.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Dover and Deal from 1974 to 1983 and MP for Dover from 1970 to 1974 and 1983 to 1987. He was Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1983 until 1985. He was created a life peer as Baron Rees, of Goytre, in 1987. Early life and education Rees was born in Camberley, Surrey, the only son of Major-General Thomas Wynford Rees of the India Army, and Agatha Rosalie (n√©e Innes). His maternal grandfather was Sir Charles Alexander Innes, Governor of British Burma from 1927 to 1932. He was educated at Stowe School. He joined the Scots Guards in 1945 and three years later continued his education at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1953, he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple. He became a QC in 1969. Political career At the 1964 general election Rees stood as the Conservative candidate in the safe Labour seat of Abertillery, where he won only 14% of the votes, against the 86% won by the only other candidate, Labour's Reverend Llewellyn Williams. When Williams died in 1965, Rees was the Conservative candidate in the consequent by-election, losing by a similarly large margin. At the 1966 election, he stood in the more promising Labour-held seat of Liverpool West Derby, but lost again. He finally entered Parliament at the 1970 general election, when he won in Dover, with a majority of 1,649 over sitting Labour MP David Ennals. Parliament In Edward Heath's government, he served from 1972 to 1973 as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Solicitor General, Michael Havers. In 1979, when the Conservative Party entered government under Margaret Thatcher, he became Minister of State at the Treasury, working to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Geoffrey Howe, before becoming Minister for Trade in 1981. After the 1983 UK general election he was appointed to the cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, working to the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. He was made Privy Counsellor the same year. Unlike most other Chief Secretaries to the Treasury, Peter Rees never went further within the Cabinet, leaving the post in the September 1985 cabinet reshuffle. He retired from Parliament at the 1987 general election, aged 61, and on 16 November 1987 was created a life peer as Baron Rees, of Goytre in the County of Gwent and sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative. Personal life In 1969, he married Anthea Peronelle Wendell, daughter of Major Hugh John Maxwell-Hyslop, and former wife of Major Jack Wendell. They had no children. Rees died of a spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage at St Thomas' Hospital, London, following a short illness. He was buried at St Peter's Church, Goytre.

She studied with Alexander Tcherepnin, Otto Luening, and Jack Beeson. Her father Roland E. Kannenberg served as a Progressive in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1935 to 1939, and she sang at his rallies as a child. Music Her music features canonic structures and prominent, sometimes exclusive, glissandos, being \\"characterized by extremely strict, even rigid technical procedures (canonic structures), which are often worked out with unusual musical materials (glissandi)\\". Her music is postminimalist, marked by the tension \\"not only between material and technique (...an attempt to give structure to chaos), but even more so between what would have to be termed 'sober-technical' compositional principles and the genuine direct expressive power and emotionality of the music\\". As one interview describes: Mark Swed: ‚ÄúCoates is a master of microtones, of taking a listener to aural places you never knew could exist and finding the mystical spaces between tones.‚Äù [5] As is described by Kyle Gann' liner notes to one of her albums: In Kyle Gann's article \\"A Symphonist Stakes Her Claim\\",Gann, Kyle. Sunday, April 25, 1999. \\"A Symphonist Stakes Her Claim\\", The New York Times. Gloria Coates was crowned, \\"the greatest woman symphonist\\", for her passionate pursuit and persistence in a domain that is dominated by men. However, this ambitious pursuit to be a woman symphonist has not been a conscious effort to set herself apart from the other female composers, instead in an interview she commented that it came through a natural manifestation trying to convey something deep within her. \\"When I did, I thought, 'That's really gutsy of me to call it a symphony,'\\" she said from her home in Munich, \\"I always had an idea of symphonies being in the 19th century, somehow. I never set out to write a symphony as such. It has to do with the intensity of what I'm trying to say and the fact that it took 48 different instrumental lines to say it, and that the structures I was using had evolved over many years. I couldn't call it a little name.\\" Painting Besides composing, Gloria Coates also paints abstract expressionistic paintings that are often used as the covers for her albums. In her paintings, complementary colours such as red and green, yellow and blue, interact and mix with one another in the small strokes. The painterly manner, with layers of swirls of colours, is reminiscent of the style of Vincent van Gogh.

In 1959 he became the first recipient of the Calixa-Lavall√©e Award. Life and career Simoneau was born in Saint-Flavien, Quebec, and started his vocal studies in Quebec City at Levis College and Universit√© Laval. While studying in Montreal with Salvator Issaurel, he made his professional debut with Les Vari√©t√©s Lyriques in Montr√©al in 1941. He then left for New York City for complementary studies with Paul Althouse. In 1946 he appeared at the New York City Center as Lionel in Martha. That same year he married French-Canadian soprano Pierrette Alarie. Together they left for France. Simoneau made his debut in 1949 at the Op√©ra- Comique of Paris as Vincent in Gounod's opera Mireille and at the Paris Opera as Tamino in Die Zauberfl√∂te. He made his debut at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1950 singing Ottavio in Don Giovanni and Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte. The following year, 1951, he made his debut at the Glyndebourne Festival as Idamante in Idomeneo. His performances at these two festivals quickly established him as the outstanding Mozartian tenor of his time. He was invited to sing at the Salzburg Festival and the Edinburgh Festival, at the Vienna State Opera and at La Scala in Milan, while pursuing his career in France, in roles such as Nadir in Les p√™cheurs de perles, G√©rald in Lakm√©. He took part in the revival of opera such as Rameau's Les Indes galantes and Orph√©e in the French version for tenor of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. In France he was frequently singing opposite his wife, who was a light lyric coloratura soprano excelling in the same repertoire as her husband. In the 1950s he made several famous recordings, including one of the Mozart Requiem with Bruno Walter conducting. He also participated in two celebrated recordings with Philips Records, Georges Bizet's Les p√™cheurs de perles conducted by Jean Fournet, and Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orph√©e et Euridyce conducted by Hans Rosbaud, in which he gave what some critics feel are the definitive performances of the roles of Nadir and Orph√©e. Simoneau also sang the role of Belmonte in Sir Thomas Beecham's recording of Mozart's The Abduction from the Seraglio, and the role of Ferrando in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte opposite Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Nan Merriman, Rolando Panerai, Lisa Otto, Sesto Bruscantini, conducted by Herbert von Karajan, both considered classics. He also sang in Charles Munch's critically acclaimed 1959 recording of the Berlioz Requiem. Simoneau made his debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1954, he sang there until 1961, notably in La traviata opposite Maria Callas. His only Metropolitan Opera appearances were five performances of Don Ottavio during the 1963-64 season. Simoneau's final appearance was in Handel's Messiah in Montr√©al on November 24, 1970. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971, he was promoted to Companion in 1995. Simoneau was also made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 1997. After retiring, Simoneau and his wife became active as teachers, notably at the Banff Centre. They also founded the Canada Piccola Opera in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1982. He and his wife had two daughters, Isabelle and Chantal. L√©opold Simoneau died at his home on August 24, 2006, in Victoria, British Columbia, at the age of 90.

It is also the headquarters of the East Sikkim district. Gangtok is in the eastern Himalayan range, at an elevation of . The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as Bhutia, Lepchas and Indian Gorkhas. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild temperate climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry. Gangtok rose to prominence as a popular Buddhist pilgrimage site after the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in British India. After India won its independence from Britain in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital. Etymology The precise meaning of the name \\"Gangtok\\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \\"hill cut\\".  History  Like the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok. The earliest records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century. Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time. In 1894, Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from Tumlong to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim became a nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the Nathula and Jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient Silk Road near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business. The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). China's Ancient Tea Horse Road. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2 In 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum. Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.  Geography  Gangtok is located at (coordinates of Gangtok head post office). It is situated in the lower Himalayas at an elevation of . The town lies on one side of a hill, with \\"The Ridge\\", a promenade housing the Raj Bhawan, the governor's residence, at one end and the palace, situated at an altitude of about , at the other. The city is flanked on east and west by two streams, namely Roro Chu and Ranikhola, respectively. These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, the eastern and western parts. Both the streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the Teesta at Singtam. Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them. Banjhakri Falls - Gangtok Most of Sikkim, including Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks which contains foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598 m or 28,208 ft)‚Äîthe world's third-highest peak‚Äîis visible to the west of the city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city. There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, consisting of temperate, deciduous forests of poplar, birch, oak, and elm, as well as evergreen, coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone. Orchids are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboos are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, marigold, poinsettia, and others bloom, especially in November and December.  Climate  Gangtok features a monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen: Cwb). Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, temperate climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, monsoons, autumn, winter, and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of in summer to an average minimum of in winter. Summers (lasting from late April to June) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing . The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-monsoon in May, and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of . In winter temperature averages between and . Snowfall is rare, and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005 and 2020. Temperatures below freezing are also rare. During this season the weather can be unstable, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours. During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild. Owing to its elevation, Gangtok is often enveloped in fog during the monsoon and winter months.

MG Marg (Road) is one of the main shopping and cultural activity streets in Gangtok. Gangtok is the main base for Sikkim tourism. Summer and spring seasons are the most popular tourist seasons. Many of Gangtok's residents are employed directly and indirectly in the tourism industry, with many residents owning and working in hotels and restaurants. Mahatma Gandhi Marg (MG Marg) and Lal Market are prominent business areas and tourist spots in Gangtok. Ecotourism has emerged as an important economic activity in the region which includes trekking, mountaineering, river rafting and other nature oriented activities. An estimated 351,000 tourists visited Sikkim in 2007, generating revenue of about Rs 50 crores (Rs 500 millions). The Nathula Pass, located about from Gangtok, used to be the primary route of the wool, fur and spice trade with Tibet and spurred economic growth for Gangtok till the mid-20th century. In 1962, after the border was closed during the Sino-Indian War, Gangtok fell into recession. The pass was reopened in 2006 and trade through the pass is expected to boost the economy of Gangtok. The Sikkim government is keen to open a Lhasa‚ÄìGangtok bus service via Nathula pass. Sikkim's mountainous terrain results in the lack of train or air links, limiting the area's potential for rapid industrial development. The government is the largest employer in the city, both directly and as contractors. Gangtok's economy does not have a large manufacturing base, but has a thriving Cottage industry in watch-making, country-made alcohol and handicrafts. Among the handicrafts are the handmade paper industry made from various vegetable fibres or cotton rags. The main market in Gangtok provides many of the state's rural residents a place to offer their produce during the harvest seasons. The majority of the private business community is made up of Marwaris and Biharis. As part of Sikkim, Gangtok enjoys the status of being an income-tax free region as per the state's 1948 Income tax law. As Sikkim is a frontier state, the Indian army maintains a large presence in the vicinity of Gangtok. This leads to a population of semi-permanent residents who bring money into the local economy. The Sikkim government started India's first online lottery Playwin to boost government income, but this was later closed by a ruling from the Sikkim High Court. Agriculture is a large employer in Sikkim and in 2003 the Sikkim state government declared the goal of converting the whole sector to organic production.Paull, John (2017) \\"Four New Strategies to Grow the Organic Agriculture Sector\\" , Agrofor International Journal, 2(3):61-70. The goal of 100% organic was achieved in 2016. This achievement offers new export opportunities to grow the agriculture sector, to achieve premium prices and new opportunities for agritourism.  Civic administration  Whitehall.jpgThe \\"White Hall\\" complex on \\"The Ridge\\" houses the residences of the Chief Minister and Governor of Sikkim. Sikkim Assembly Gangtok.jpgSikkim Legislative Assembly in Gangtok. Fog is common in Gangtok. Gangtok is administered by the Gangtok Municipal Corporation (GMC) along with the various departments of the Government of Sikkim, particularly the Urban Development and Housing Department (UDHD) and the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED). These departments provide municipal functions such as garbage disposal, water supply, tax collection, license allotments, and civic infrastructure. An administrator appointed by the state government heads the UDHD. As the headquarters of East Sikkim district, Gangtok houses the offices of the district collector, an administrator appointed by the Union Government of India. Gangtok is also the seat of the Sikkim High Court, which is India's smallest High Court in terms of area and population of jurisdiction. Gangtok does not have its own police commissionerate like other major cities in India. Instead, it comes under the jurisdiction of the state police, which is headed by a Director General of Police, although an Inspector General of Police oversees the town. Sikkim is known for its very low crime rate. Rongyek jail in Gangtok is Sikkim's only central jail. Gangtok is within the Sikkim Lok Sabha constituency that elects a member to the Lok Sabha (Lower House) of the Indian Parliament. The city elects one member in the Sikkim state legislative assembly, the Vidhan Sabha. The Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) won both the parliamentary election in 2009 and the state assembly seat in the 2009 state assembly polls.  Utility services  Electricity is supplied by the power department of the Government of Sikkim. Gangtok has a nearly uninterrupted electricity supply due to Sikkim's numerous hydroelectric power stations. The rural roads around Gangtok are maintained by the Border Roads Organisation, a division of the Indian army. Several roads in Gangtok are reported to be in a poor condition, whereas building construction activities continue almost unrestrained in this city lacking proper land infrastructure. Most households are supplied by the central water system maintained and operated by the PHED. The main source of PHED water supply is the Rateychu River, located about from the city, at an altitude of . Its water treatment plant is located at Selep. The river Rateychu is snow-fed and has perennial streams. Since there is no habitation in the catchment area except for a small army settlement, there is little environmental degradation and the water is of very good quality. 40 seasonal local springs are used by the Rural Management and Development Department of Sikkim Government to supply water to outlying rural areas. Around 40% of the population has access to sewers. However, only the toilet waste is connected to the sewer while sullage is discharged into the drains. Without a proper sanitation system, the practice of disposing sewage through septic tanks and directly discharging into Jhoras and open drains is prevalent. The entire city drains into the two rivers, Ranikhola and Roro Chu, through numerous small streams and Jhoras. Ranikhola and Roro Chu rivers confluence with Teesta River, the major source of drinking water to the population downstream. The densely populated urban area of Gangtok does not have a combined drainage system to drain out the stormwater and wastewater from the buildings. The estimated solid waste generated in Gangtok city is approximately 45 tonnes. Only around 40% of this is collected by UDHD, while the remainder is indiscriminately thrown into Jhora, streets and valleys. The collected waste is disposed in a dump located about from the city. There is no waste collection from inaccessible areas where vehicles cannot reach, nor does any system of collection of waste exist in the adjoining rural areas. The city is under a statewide ban on the use of polythene bags.  Transport  Gangtok ropeway.jpgGangtok cable car RoadfromSiliguritiGangtok.jpgThe Teesta River runs along the National Highway 31A connecting Gangtok to Siliguri. Gangtok NH 31A by the night..jpgNational Highway 31A by the night.  Road  Taxis are the most widely available public transport within Gangtok. Most of the residents stay within a few kilometres of the town centre and many have their own vehicles such as two-wheelers and cars. The share of personal vehicles and taxis combined is 98% of Gangtok's total vehicles, a high percentage when compared to other Indian cities. City buses comprise less than one percent of vehicles. Those travelling longer distances generally make use of share-jeeps, a kind of public taxis. Four wheel drives are used to easily navigate the steep slopes of the roads. The long cable car with three stops connects lower Gangtok suburbs with Sikkim Legislative assembly in central Gangtok and the upper suburbs. Gangtok is connected to the rest of India by an all-weather metalled highway, National Highway 10, earlier known as National Highway 31A, which links Gangtok to Siliguri, located away in the neighbouring state of West Bengal. The highway also provides a link to the neighbouring hill station towns of Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which are the nearest urban areas. Regular jeep, van, and bus services link these towns to Gangtok. Gangtok is a linear city that has developed along the arterial roads, especially National Highway 31A. Most of the road length in Gangtok is of two lane undivided carriageway with footpath on one side of the road and drain on the other. The steep gradient of the different road stretches coupled with a spiral road configuration constrain the smooth flow of vehicular as well as pedestrian traffic.  Rail  The nearest railhead connected to the rest of India is the station of New Jalpaiguri (NJP) in Siliguri, situated via NH10 away from Gangtok. Work has commenced for a broad gauge railway link from Sevoke in West Bengal to Rangpo in Sikkim that is planned for extension to Gangtok.  Air  Runway at Pakyong Airport, is the first greenfield airport to be constructed in the Northeast India. Pakyong Airport is a greenfield airport near Gangtok, the state capital of Sikkim, India. The airport, spread over , is located at Pakyong town about 35 km (22 mi) south of Gangtok. At 4500 ft, Pakyong Airport is one of the five highest airports in India. It is also the first greenfield airport to be constructed in the Northeastern Region of India, the 100th operational airport in India, and the only airport in the state of Sikkim. The airport was inaugurated by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 24 September 2018 and the first commercial flight operations from the airport began on 4 October 2018 between Pakyong and Kolkata.

More people live in areas that depict slum-like characteristics but have not been notified as slums yet because they have developed on private land. Of the total urban population of Sikkim, Gangtok Municipal Corporation has a share of 55.5%. Including Gangtok, East District has a share of 88% of the total urban population. The quality of life, the pace of development and availability of basic infrastructure and employment prospects has been the major cause for rapid migration to the city. With this migration, the urban services are under pressure, intensified by the lack of availability of suitable land for infrastructure development. Ethnic Nepalis, who settled in the region during British rule, comprise the majority of Gangtok's residents. Lepchas, native to the land, and Bhutias also constitute a sizeable portion of the populace. Additionally, a large number of Tibetans have immigrated to the town. Immigrant resident communities not native to the region include the Marwaris, Biharis and Bengalis. Hinduism and Buddhism are the most significant religions in Gangtok. Gangtok also has a sizeable Christian population and a small Muslim minority.

The Rumtek Monastery on the outskirts of the town is one of Buddhism's most sacred monasteries. The monastery is the seat of the Kagyu order, one of the major Tibetan sects, and houses some of the world's most sacred and rare Tibetan Buddhist scriptures and religious objects in its reliquary. Constructed in the 1960s, the building is modeled after a similar monastery in Lhasa, Tibet. Rumtek was the focus of international media attention in 2000 after the seventeenth Karmapa, one of the four holiest lamas, fled Lhasa and sought refuge in the monastery.

The gens Flavia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Its members are first mentioned during the last three centuries of the Republic. The first of the Flavii to achieve prominence was Marcus Flavius, tribune of the plebs in 327 and 323 BC; however, no Flavius attained the consulship until Gaius Flavius Fimbria in 104 BC. The gens became illustrious during the first century AD, when the family of the Flavii Sabini claimed the imperial dignity.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 169 (\\"Flavia Gens\\"). Under the Empire, the number of persons bearing this nomen becomes very large, perhaps due to the great number of freedmen under the Flavian dynasty of emperors. It was a common practice for freedmen to assume the nomina of their patrons, and so countless persons who obtained the Roman franchise under the Flavian emperors adopted the name Flavius, which was then handed down to their descendants. During the later period of the Empire, the name Flavius frequently descended from one emperor to another, beginning with Constantius, the father of Constantine the Great. The name became so ubiquitous that it was sometimes treated as a praenomen, to the extent of being regularly abbreviated Fl., and it is even described as a praenomen in some sources, although it was never truly used as a personal name. The last emperor to take the name was eastern emperor Constantine IV, during the seventh century. After the name fell into disuse among the Byzantine emperors, it was used as a title of legitimacy among the barbarian rulers of former Roman provinces, such as Spain, where the Visigoths and their Spanish successors used the title \\"Emperor of All Spain\\", and the kings of the barbarian successor kingdoms of Italy, such as the Ostrogoths and the Lombards also used it, with a special meaning as the \\"protector\\" of the Italian peoples under Lombard rule. The vast majority of persons named Flavius during the later Empire could not have been descended from the Flavia gens; and indeed, the distinction between nomina and cognomina was all but lost, so that in many cases one cannot even determine with certainty whether it is a nomen or a cognomen. However, because it is impossible to determine which of these persons used Flavius as a gentile name, they have been listed below. Origin The Flavii of the Republic claimed Sabine ancestry, and may have been related to the Flavii who lived at Reate during the first century AD, from whom the emperor Vespasian descended; but the gentilicium is also found in other parts of Italy, such as Etruria and Lucania. The nomen Flavius is of Latin origin, and is derived from the surname Flavus, used by a number of gentes, and meaning \\"golden\\" or \\"golden-brown\\". It probably referred to the blond hair possessed by an early member of the family.Chase, pp. 110, 130.Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. flavus. In modern use, Flavius is a personal name, and widely used in romance languages, including Italian and Spanish Flavio (fem. Flavia), French Flavien (fem. Flavie), Portuguese Fl√°vio (fem. Fl√°via), and Romanian Flavius or Flaviu (fem. Flavia). Praenomina The early Flavii used the praenomina Marcus, Quintus, Gaius, and Lucius. Of these, only Gaius and Lucius are known from the family of the Fimbriae. The name Gnaeus occurs once, but as the son of a freedman of the family, and thus does not seem to be representative of the gens. The Flavii Sabini appear to have restricted themselves to the praenomen Titus alone, and distinguished their sons by the use of different surnames, usually by giving the younger sons surnames derived from their maternal ancestors. Branches and cognomina The Flavii of the Republic used the cognomina Fimbria, Gallus, Lucanus, and Pusio. Only the Fimbriae, whose surname refers to a fringe or border, represented a distinct family.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 150, 151 (\\"Fimbria\\").New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. fimbria. Gallus and Lucanus belong to a class of surnames derived from places of origin or association, referring to Gaul and Lucania, respectively, although Gallus, a very common surname, could also refer to a cockerel.Chase, pp. 113, 114.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. gallus. Pusio was originally a nickname indicating a little boy, and would have been bestowed on someone small or youthful.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. pusio. The Flavii Sabini, whose surname indicates Sabine ancestry, rose to prominence under the Empire. They were descended from Titus Flavius Petro, a soldier from Reate who fought under Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. Within two generations they had attained such respectability that two of his grandsons held the consulship in consecutive years, AD 51 and 52; the younger of these marched to Rome at the head of an army in the year of the four emperors, AD 69, and claimed the imperial dignity as the emperor Vespasian. However, within less than thirty years, the family was largely destroyed through the workings of Vespasian's son, the emperor Domitian.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 689, 690 (\\"Flavius Sabinus\\"). The Flavii Titiani may be descended from the Flavii Sabini through the consul Titus Flavius Clemens, a nephew of Vespasian; the first of this branch, Titus Flavius Titianus, who was governor of Egypt from AD 126 to 133, may have been his son. A family of the Flavii bearing the surname Valens lived at Hatria, and from there migrated to Rome in imperial times, where two of them served as prefects of different cohorts.Sorricchio, Hatria, p. 309. As an imperial title The emperor Claudius Gothicus claimed descent from the Flavian dynasty, and Constantine the Great in turn claimed descent from him via his father, Constantius Chlorus. As a result, Flavius was borne by all members of Constantine's dynasty.R√∂sch, Onoma Basileias, pp. 49, 50. Following its use by the Constantinian dynasty, the name assumed the attributes of an imperial title, much as Antoninus had been treated by the Severan dynasty, who followed the Antonines. It was borne by the Valentinian and Theodosian dynasties, and subsequently by barbarian rulers claiming to be their rightful successors.Bussell, The Roman Empire, pp. xi, xiii, xiv. From the sole rule of Honorius onward, the name was not used in official contexts during the fifth century, and the few surviving examples are of transcribed imperial letters, reflecting the entrenched association of the name with the imperial office in popular perception, rather than official nomenclature. Under Justinian I, the name once again became part of the imperial nomenclature; it remained so under his successors until the time of Justinian II.

He may have been born at Athens. His relationship to the other Flavii, or to Titus Flavius Clemens, the consul of AD 95, who may have been a convert to Christianity, is unknown; Clement's parents are thought to have been well-to-do pagans.

It is a regional campus of Indiana University. Located in the eastern Indiana and western Ohio region, IU East enrolls over 4,000 students across its 60 academic degree programs. IU East is a traditional campus that excels in innovative learning options and a virtual campus with select online degree completion programs. The campus includes five buildings on 174 acres. Established in 1971 by the Indiana University Board of Trustees, IU East offers bachelor's and master's degree programs and certificates in areas of Business and Economics, Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, Natural Science & Mathematics, Informatics, General Studies, Nursing and Health Sciences, and Social Work. The university's men's and women's athletics teams are called the Red Wolves. History Indiana University East grew out of an extension established at Earlham College that was operated cooperatively by Earlham and Indiana University. In 1967, the arrangement was expanded to include Purdue and Ball State Universities and the extension became the Eastern Indiana Center of Earlham College. In 1969, reflecting the community's response to this opportunity to take state university courses at home, Richmond citizens formed an association known as Eastern Indiana Community College, Inc., to raise funds for the construction of a new campus. Following a successful campaign in which they raised over $1 million, members of the community college organization, with the consent of the four educational institutions involved in the center, asked Indiana University to establish a regional campus in Richmond and to assume responsibility for the operation. The Indiana General Assembly approved this plan, and on July 1, 1971, the Eastern Indiana Center of Earlham College became Indiana University East, the sixth campus in the Indiana University regional system. On October 3, 1972, ground was broken at the new campus site north of Richmond. The first building, an all-purpose academic facility, was completed in late 1974 and dedicated February 23, 1975. IU East earned its first accreditation in 1975. The Indiana University East campus included 225 acres (0.911 km¬≤) of land, purchased with community donations, on the northern edge of Richmond, Indiana. Of those , are for IU East and 51 acres (0.21 km¬≤) are for other non-IU East post-secondary educational uses, such as Ivy Tech Community College.

The original village and priory have now been amalgamated with the main town of Eastbourne, and Langney was identified as a single self-contained polling ward within the borough of Eastbourne until 2002. The etymology of Langney is from the Anglo-Saxon root for Long (lang) and Island (ey). Other local place names contain the suffix 'ey' with this historic meaning because the sea level was rather higher in the pre-Conquest period and areas of higher land stood out as 'islands' or rather 'eys'. Pevensey shares the same etymology. Langney proper - the 'Long Island' - thus refers to the higher part i.e. where the shopping centre now is. Langney contains the Grade II Listed Langney Priory. The oldest part of this building dates to the twelfth century. It was built by Cluniac monks from the very much larger Priory of St Pancras at Lewes. This lesser building at Langney was thus a monastic grange of the senior house. Langney Priory which had been scheduled for demolition in the 1950shttps://www.historiclangneypriory.com/index.php is at 2019 undergoing redevelopment and can be visited at community open days. Since the boundary changes of 2002 the Langney village became part of St. Anthony's ward, Langney point became part of Sovereign ward and the remaining northern part of Langney became the new Langney ward. the Langney ward was held by the Liberal Democrats and represented by Cllrs Harun Miah, Alan Shuttleworth and Troy Tester at Eastbourne Borough Council and Cllr Alan Shuttleworth at East Sussex County Council. Langney has grown in recent years (especially since 1970) and is contiguous to Langney Point, which mainly comprises newer properties built on shingle. These properties extend down to the English Channel and the original Eastbourne \\"Promenade\\" has been extended eastwards to Langney Point. North of old Langney Village is naturally known as \\"North Langney\\" which, once again, consists mainly of newer housing, but there are a few older properties which have seen a considerable change to the local landscape from farmland to suburbia. Langney also has a popular shopping centre (built in 1973)‚Äîincluding small branches of Tesco and Boots‚Äîand has nine schools within its boundaries, the Bishop Bell Church Of England School ( Now called St Catherine's ) , the Causeway School, Langney Primary School, Tollgate Community Junior School, West Rise Community Infant School, West Rise Junior School, Shinewater Primary School, the Haven Voluntary Aided C E Methodist Primary School and Hazel Court Special School. Langney is mostly made up of housing estate, the main housing estates in Langney are Langney Estate, Kingsmere & Kings Park Estate, Painters Estate, the Birds Estate and Shinewater Estate. Langney Sports Club provides a centre for archery, snooker and darts as well as two bars. Adjacent to Langney Sports Club is the home ground of Eastbourne Borough, the largest football team in the town of Eastbourne. They play in the National League South.

Winter 2019. Downstream side of the dam. Circa 1925. Upstream side of the dam. Circa 1925. The Mountain Dell Dam provides a water equalizing and storage reservoir for Salt Lake City, Utah located east of the city in northeastern Salt Lake County, near Interstate 80 in Parley's Canyon. Designed by John S. Eastwood, and constructed between 1914 and 1925, the dam is an example of a mixed buttress dam and multiple arch dam construction. At the time the plans were made, the city was in need of a sufficient supply of water, especially during late summer and the middle of winter. With the completion of the dam, the city had an available storage capacity of , and distributing or equalizing capacity of compared to previously. The dam was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Mountain Dell Dam is listed as being in \\"poor\\" condition and is under repair.  Design  right Plans were made for three types of dam: * Arched solid dam, gravity type * Reinforced concrete dam of the Ambursen type * Multiple arch reinforced concrete dam of the Eastwood design After consideration, the multiple arch type was chosen. One of the factors influencing this decision was the bedrock condition at the site. The bedrock is a calcareous shale not entirely watertight and of a nature to decompose somewhat under exposure to air and water. The advantages of the multiple arch type in this connection were considered to be the practical elimination of upward pressure, the practical impossibility of overturning or sliding on its base and the ready facilities for internal inspection of the dam at any time.  Construction  right The dam was built in two stages, the first stage completed in 1917 with a height of 105 feet (32 m) above the foundation and the second stage, completed 1925, added 40 feet (12 m) to the height of the dam. The cost of the structure was considerably increased because of the necessity of going 43 feet (13 m) below ground level in the bottom of the canyon to secure the bedrock foundation. The spillway level is below the top of the dam, so that the maximum depth of the reservoir is 58 feet (18 m) to the crest of the spillway. The dam as planned and as constructed consists of 11 buttresses and 11 arches in the first stage and an additional 5 buttresses and 5 arches in the second stage. The maximum base width of the dam is 132 feet (40 m) from the face of the arch to the downstream end of the buttresses. The maximum thickness of the buttresses is 8 feet (2.4 m). The maximum thickness of the arch rings is 4.1 feet (1.2 m). The thickness at the present top of the dam is . The arch rings are 120 degree arcs of circles. The spacing between buttress centers is . The two sets of outlet gates each consist of two 24 inch (610 mm) pipes with a suitable grating entrance, and with a butterfly and a double-disc gate valve on each pipe. The total quantity of concrete in the dam is 8,271 cubic yards (6,323 m¬≥). The total cost of the dam was $90,000. The storage capacity at the present height is slightly over . The general design and supervision was handled under the direction of Sylvester Q. Cannon, City Engineer of Salt Lake City and John S. Eastwood acting as consulting engineer. Parrott Bros. Co. were the contractors. Condition As of 2019 Mountain Dell Dam was listed as being in \\"poor\\" condition, with increased hazard due to its proximity to highways and parks, with risk to life in the event of failure. A liner is being installed on the upstream face to control water intrusion that creates freeze/thaw damage. Until the deterioration is arrested, the reservoir may only be half full during the winter.https://www.ksl.com/article/46671175/historic-dam-east-of-salt-lake- city-1-of-5-in-poor-condition See also *American Water Landmark - (awarded 1981) ReferencesExternal links * Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Buttress dams Arch dams Dams on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Buildings and structures in Salt Lake County, Utah Dams completed in 1925 United States local public utility dams Historic American Engineering Record in Utah Wasatch Range National Register of Historic Places in Salt Lake County, Utah ","title":"Mountain Dell Dam"},{"id":"1344814","text":"FLAVIA is a hot beverage system that prepares single servings of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate drinks.

Historically, the Central District has been one of Seattle's most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhoods,Cluster 4 ‚ÄúCentral‚Äù: Tracts #77, 79, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91 , sngi.org (Seattle Neighborhood Group), undated. Accessed online 2009-10-19. and was once the center of Seattle's black community and a major hub of African-American businesses. Demographics The culture and demographics of the Central District have changed repeatedly throughout many years. It started out as a predominantly Jewish neighborhood.Seattle Segregation Maps 1920-2000, Seattle Civil Rights & Labor History Project. Accessed online 2009-10-19. Jewish residents built Temple De Hirsch on Union Street in 1907; Temple De Hirsch Sinai on the opposite corner of the same block is a successor to that congregation; the original Temple De Hirsch is largely demolished, though some fragments remain. Other former synagogues in the neighborhood are the former Sephardic Bikur Holim synagogue (now Tolliver Temple), Herzl Congregation synagogue (now Odessa Brown Clinic), and Chevra Bikur Cholim (now Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center). A few decades later, the Central District became a home to Japanese-Americans in Seattle. The blocks between 14th and 18th Avenues and Yesler Way and Jackson Street still retain a strong Japanese presence‚Äîthe Buddhist Church, Seattle Koyasan Church, Konko, Wisteria Park, Japanese Congregational Church, Keiro Nursing Home, and the Kawabe Memorial House. During World War II, presidential Executive Order 9066 made possible the removal of American citizens of Japanese descent from the West Coast. All Japanese residents were immediately taken out of their homes and sent to internment camps. This and many race-restricted covenants to the north and south paved the way for many African Americans to find a new home in the Central District as part of the Second Great Migration to the city in search of employment opportunities in the munitions plants during the war as well as taking advantage of the post-war economic expansion.Racial Restrictive Covenants, Seattle Civil Rights & Labor History Project. Accessed online 2009-10-19. By the 1970s, Central District became largely an African-American neighborhood and the center of the civil rights movement in Seattle. In 1970, Blacks made up nearly 80% of the neighborhood's population However, it also marked the neighborhood's decline into poverty and crime for another two decades. In the early 21st century, several demographic trends are changing the population of the Central District again. Low-income segments of the population are moving southward toward the Rainier Valley, while more affluent residents, who might otherwise have purchased homes on Capitol Hill, Madrona, Leschi, or Mt. Baker are moving into the Central District as real estate and rental property become more expensive in the former neighborhoods and commuting times and costs make suburban areas less attractive.Sonia Krishnan, City Centered in Seattle , Seattle Times Pacific NW Cover Story, November 16, 2008. Accessed online 2009-10-19. Due to this market pressure, housing in the Central District is mixed, with some homes on the verge of condemnation, and others having recently undergone extensive renovation. Many condemned houses are being replaced by multi-unit townhouses and condominiums. Easy access to Interstate 5, Interstate 90, and Downtown, as well as ample street parking, also make the Central District an attractive and convenient place to live. Despite the demographic shifts since the early 1970s, many locals still think of the Central District as a predominantly African-American area. One reason for this is that despite the decline in the African-American population,Seattle Times: \\"Seattle‚Äôs vanishing black community\\" By Tyrone Beason May 26, 2016 there is black history in the neighborhood. It is home to the Northwest African American Museum. During the early 1960s, the neighborhood was a hotbed for the Seattle civil rights movement.

Various forms of lustration were employed in post- communist Europe and, more recently, in Ukraine. Lustration map of Europe: green ‚àí some form of lustration; pink ‚Äì no lustration; grey ‚Äì not a former Warsaw Pact member Etymology Drawing of a relief from the Karnak temple in Egypt showing a pharaoh lustrating with incense Lustration in general is the process of making something clear or pure, usually by means of a propitiatory offering. The term is taken from the Roman lustratio purification rituals. Policies and laws After the fall of the various European Communist governments in 1989‚Äì1991, the term came to refer to government-sanctioned policies of \\"mass disqualification of those associated with the abuses under the prior regime\\". Procedures excluded participation of former communists, and especially of informants of the communist secret police, in successor political positions, or even in civil service positions. This exclusion formed part of the wider decommunization campaigns. In some countries, however, lustration laws did not lead to exclusion and disqualification. Lustration law in Hungary (1994‚Äì2003) was based on the exposure of compromised state officials, while lustration law in Poland (1999‚Äì2005) depended on confession. Lustration law \\"is a special public employment law that regulates the process of examining whether a person holding certain higher public positions worked or collaborated with the repressive apparatus of the communist regime\\". The \\"special\\" nature of lustration law refers to its transitional character. As of 1996, various lustration laws of varying scope were implemented in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), Germany, Poland, and Romania. As of 2019 lustration laws had not been passed in Belarus, nor in former Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan). Results Lustration can serve as a form of punishment by anti-communist politicians who were dissidents under a Communist-led government. Lustration laws are usually passed right before elections, and become tightened when right-wing governments are in power, and loosened while social democratic parties are in power. It is claimed that lustration systems based on dismissal or confession might be able to increase trust in government,Roman David, Lustration and Transitional Justice: Personnel Systems in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011, pp. 183, 209 while those based on confession might be able to promote social reconciliation. Examples=In Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic Unlike many neighbouring states, the new government in the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic did not adjudicate under court trials, but instead took a non-judicial approach to ensure changes would be implemented. According to a law passed on 4 October 1991, all employees of the StB, the Communist-era secret police, were blacklisted from designated public offices, including the upper levels of the civil service, the judiciary, procuracy, Security Information Service (BIS), army positions, management of state owned enterprises, the central bank, the railways, senior academic positions and the public electronic media. This law remained in place in the Czech Republic after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and expired in 2000. The lustration laws in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic were not intended to serve as justice, but to ensure that events such as the Communist coup of February 1948 did not happen again.Kieran Williams, \\"Lustration\\" , Central Europe Review In Germany Germany did not have a lustration process, but it has a federal agency, known as the Stasi Records Agency, dedicated to preserving and protecting the archives and investigating the past actions of the former East German secret police, the Stasi. The agency is subordinate to the Representative of the Federal Government for Culture (Bernd Neumann, CDU). As of 2012, it had 1,708 employees. In Poland The first lustration bill was passed by the Polish Parliament in 1992, but it was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland. Several other projects were then submitted and reviewed by a dedicated commission, resulting in a new lustration law passed in 1996.Mark S. Ellis, Purging the past: The Current State of Lustration Laws in the Former Communist Bloc (pdf), Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 59, No. 4, Accountability for International Crimes and Serious Violations of Fundamental Human Rights (Autumn, 1996), pp. 181‚Äì96 From 1997 to 2007 lustration was dealt with by the office of the Public Interest Spokesperson (), who analyzed lustration declarations and could initiate further proceedings. According to a new law which came into effect on 15 March 2007, lustration in Poland is now administered by the Institute of National Remembrance (; IPN).

It was based on the company's CRISP (C-language Reduced Instruction Set Processor) design, which in turn grew out of Bell Labs' C Machine design of the late 1980s. All were optimized for running the C programming language. The design concentrated on fast instruction decoding, indexed array access and procedure calls. Its processor was partially RISC- like. The project ended in 1994 because the Hobbit failed to achieve commercially viable sales.  History  CRISP was produced in 1987, largely for experimental purposes. Apple Computer approached AT&T; and paid them to develop a newer version of the CRISP suitable for low-power use in the Newton. The result was the Hobbit, which was initially produced as the 92010 in 1992 with a 3 kB instruction buffer and the 92020 in 1994 with 6 kB. Several support chips were also produced: * AT&T; 92011 System Management Unit * AT&T; 92012 PCMCIA Controller * AT&T; 92013 Peripheral Controller * AT&T; 92014 Display Controller However, the Hobbit-based Newton was never produced. According to Larry Tesler, \\"The Hobbit was rife with bugs, ill-suited for our purposes, and overpriced. We balked after AT&T; demanded not one but several million more dollars in development fees.\\" Apple dropped their interest in the Hobbit and moved on to help form Advanced RISC Machines, ARM, with a $2.5 million investment. When the company sold their stake in ARM years later, they netted $800 million. While Apple dropped the chip in favor of ARM, the Active Book Company (founded by Hermann Hauser, who also founded Acorn Computers), which had been using an ARM in its Active Book personal digital assistant (PDA), was later purchased by AT&T; and was subsumed by AT&T;'s EO Personal Communicator company, which produced an early PDA running PenPoint OS from the GO Corporation. Hobbit was also used in the earliest (unreleased) versions of the BeBox. In 1993, news that AT&T; was giving up on the Hobbit ended development with this microprocessor. With these exceptions there was almost no commercial use of the design, and production was ended in 1994.  Design  In a traditional RISC design, better referred to as load-store architecture, memory is accessed explicitly through commands that load data into registers and back out to memory. Instructions that manipulate those data generally work solely on the registers. This allows the processor to clearly separate the movement of data from the processing done on it, making it easier to tune the instruction pipelines and add superscalar support. However, programming languages do not actually operate in this fashion. Generally they use a stack containing local variables and other information for subroutines known as a stack frame or activation record. The compiler writes code to create activation records using the underlying processor's load-store design. The C Machine, and the CRISP and Hobbit that followed, directly supported the types of memory access that programming languages used and was optimized for running the C programming language. Instructions could access memory directly, including structures within memory such as stack frames and arrays. Although this \\"memory-data\\" model was typical of the earlier CISC designs, in the C Machine data access was handled entirely via a stack of 64 32-bit registers; the registers were not otherwise addressable (in contrast with the INMOS Transputer and other stack-based designs). Using a stack for data access can dramatically reduce code size as there is no need to specify the location of the data needed by the instructions. On such a stack machine, most instructions implicitly use the data on the top of the stack. Higher code density means less data movement on the memory bus, improving performance. One side effect of the Hobbit design was that it inspired designers of the Dis virtual machine (an offshoot of Plan 9 from Bell Labs) to use a memory-to- memory-based system that more closely matched the internal register-based workings of real-world processors. They found, as RISC designers would have expected, that without a load-store design it was difficult to improve the instruction pipeline and thereby operate at higher speeds. They felt that all future processors would thus move to a load-store design, and built Inferno to reflect this. In contrast, Java and .NET virtual machines are stack based, a side effect of being designed by language programmers as opposed to chip designers. Translating from a stack-based language to a register-based assembly language is a \\"heavyweight\\" operation; Java's virtual machine (VM) and compiler are many times larger and slower than the Dis VM and the Limbo (the most common language compiled for Dis) compiler. The VMs for Android (operating system) (Dalvik), Parrot and Lua are also register-based.

His brothers, Robert B. and Leon Harvey, joined shortly after. The company soon got into licensed characters, which by the 1950s, became the bulk of their output. The artist Warren Kremer is closely associated with the publisher. Harvey's mascot is \\"Joker\\", a harlequin jack-in-the-box character. History Richie Rich#1 (Nov. 1960). Cover art penciled by Warren Kremer Harvey Comics was founded by the Harvey brothers; Alfred, Leon and Robert, in the 1940s after first acquiring an existing - faltering - title from Brookwood Publications; Speed Comics. The title's headliners were Shock Gibson and Captain Freedom, a patriotic hero like The Shield. Harvey added more anthologies, including Champion Comics and Pocket Comics. From the new titles only one would stay around for a while: The Black Cat, a Hollywood starlet- superhero, which was published into the 1950s. Harvey began a shift to licensed characters when in 1942 took over as the radio hero Green Hornet's publisher from Holyoke after six issues. Harvey added additional titles such that most of their titles were licensed. Licensed characters included Joe Palooka, Blondie, Dick Tracy, and other newspaper strip characters. The company ultimately became best known for characters it published in comics from 1950s onward, particularly those it licensed from the animation company Famous Studios, a unit of Paramount Pictures, starting in 1951. These include Little Audrey, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Baby Huey, and Herman and Katnip. Harvey also licensed popular characters from newspaper comic strips, such as Mutt and Jeff and Sad Sack.Mike Kelley. Minor histories: Statements, Conversations, Proposals, The MIT Press, 2004, p. 19 n.4. , In addition, Harvey developed such original properties as Richie Rich, Little Dot and Little Lotta. While the company tried to diversify the comics it published, with brief forays in the 1950s and 1960s into superhero, suspense, horror, western and other forms in such imprints as Harvey Thriller and Thrill Adventure, children's comics were the bulk of its output. On July 27, 1958, Harvey purchased the October 1950‚ÄìDecember 1967 Famous Studio cartoons (including character rights and rights to the cartoon shorts, but excluding Popeye). The Famous cartoons were repackaged and distributed to television as Harveytoons, and Harvey continued production on new comics and a handful of new cartoons produced for television. Casper the Friendly Ghost, who had been Famous' most popular original character, now became Harvey's top draw. Associated characters such as Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost, The Ghostly Trio, Casper's horse Nightmare, Hot Stuff the Little Devil, and Wendy the Good Little Witch were added to the Harvey line. 1980s decline and sale By the early 1980s, Marvel Comics was in negotiations with Harvey Comics to assume publication of some of their characters. Harvey editor Sid Jacobson, along with the other Harvey staff, were interviewed by Mike Hobson, Marvel's group vice-president of publishing (de facto publisher). As part of the process, Jacobson created several new characters which were well received by Hobson and effectively sealed the deal. Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter appointed editor Tom DeFalco as executive editor to coordinate with the Harvey staff, who were hired by Marvel. On the day Marvel was set to take over the Harvey publications, Harvey Comics pulled out of the deal due to an internal disagreement among the two remaining Harvey brothers, Alfred and Leon. Harvey would cease publishing their comics in 1982. In summer 1984, Steve Geppi (owner of Diamond Comic Distributors and Geppi's Comic World) paid $50,000 for, among other properties, Harvey's entire archive of original art from the Harvey comic Sad Sack. Geppi made this agreement with Steve Harvey, who at the time was president of Harvey Publications, Inc., as well as president of Sad Sack, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Harvey Publications, Inc.\\"Newswatch: Geppi: I Had Legal Title to Both the Pre and Post-1955 Harvey Original Art,\\" The Comics Journal #229 (December 2000), pp. 7‚Äì8. In 1985 the Marvel imprint Star Comics published a title called Royal Roy. Harvey sued Star for copyright infringement, claiming that Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich.\\"Harvey Sues Marvel Star Comics, Charges Copyright Infringement\\", The Comics Journal #105 (Feb. 1986), pp. 23‚Äì24. (Veteran Harvey writer-artist Lennie Herman had created Royal Roy for Star Comics. Herman died in 1983\\"Harvey Veteran Lenny [sic] Herman Dies,\\" The Comics Journal #87 (December 1983), p. 21. before the first issue of Royal Roy was published.) The Royal Roy comic ended after six issues and the lawsuit was dropped. In 1986, Harvey resumed publication\\"From the Ashes: Charlton and Harvey to Resume Publishing This Spring,\\" The Comics Journal #97 (April 1985), pp. 15‚Äì16. under the leadership of Alan Harvey (Alfred's oldest son), focusing on a few core titles, digests, and reprints. In 1987, Harvey sued Columbia Pictures, for $50 million, claiming that the Ghostbusters logo used in the 1984 film was too reminiscent of Fatso from the Casper series. The court ruled in Columbia's favor,\\"Harvey Loses $50 Million Ghostbusters Suit to Columbia Pictures\\", The Comics Journal #117 (September 1987), p. 21. due to Harvey's failure to renew the copyrights on early Casper stories and the \\"limited ways to draw a figure of a cartoon ghost\\". Harvey Comics Entertainment In 1989, Harvey was sold to Jeffrey Montgomery's HMH Communications, located in Santa Monica, California. It was renamed Harvey Comics Entertainment (HCE), publishing reprints in the early 1990s as Harvey Classics. In 1993 the company created two imprints, Nemesis Comics and Ultracomics, to publish Ultraman comics, as well as a couple of other titles. In 1994 Marvel took over publishing and distribution for HCE. In addition, Montgomery himself began selling a package of older cartoons featuring the characters Harvey had purchased from Paramount to local stations. With Claster Television serving as his distributor, Montgomery launched Casper & Friends in 1990. After the rerun package was pulled in 1994, Montgomery teamed with Carbunkle Cartoons and Film Roman respectively for two new animated series based on Harvey properties. The first, produced by Carbunkle and launching in 1994, featured Baby Huey and the second, produced by Film Roman, was a new Richie Rich cartoon launched in 1996; a previous series had been done without Harvey's involvement other than licensing the character to Hanna-Barbera. During this period, Montgomery sold 20% of the company to MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Studios for $3 million. (Universal licensed the characters for use in its theme parks.) Montgomery also optioned Richie Rich and Casper for two feature films: Richie Rich was released in 1994 and was a financial flop, while Casper, which was released the following year, became a massive hit. Montgomery also struck a publishing and distribution deal with Marvel Comics, which led Marvel to publish Casper titles, including an adaptation of the 1995 live-action Casper movie. Two issues of an ongoing Casper title were published in May 1997, followed by the short-lived Casper and Friends Magazine (May‚ÄìJuly 1997). Sunland Entertainment Montgomery was ousted from HCE in 1997, and in 2001,Arnold, Mark. \\"Blood and Thunder: Harvey Seeks SWM W/$$$,\\" The Comics Journal #230 (February 2001), p. 3. the company sold its Harvey properties and rights to the Harvey name to Classic Media.

The rights to Sad Sack, Black Cat, and certain other Harvey characters are still owned by Alan Harvey, and have been published under the names of Lorne-Harvey Publications and Re- Collections. In late 2000, Alan Harvey sued Steve Geppi over his 1984 acquisition of the Sad Sack original art,Dean, Michael. \\"Newswatch: Sad Sack vs. Steve Geppi,\\" The Comics Journal #228 (November 2000), p. 35. charging that Geppi had plundered Harvey's warehouses.Dean, Michael. \\"Newswatch: Geppi Accused of Plundering Harvey Warehouse,\\" The Comics Journal #229 (December 2000), pp. 5‚Äì6. Geppi countersued, claiming that he had legal title to the original art. The suit was settled in late 2002; at the time of the settlement, the New York Supreme Court had dismissed Harvey's claims against Geppi. The settlement agreement allowed Geppi to keep the art, with no money changing hands.Dean, Michael. \\"Newswatch: Sad Sack Suit Against Geppi; Countersuit Settled,\\" The Comics Journal #249 (December 2002), p. 28.\\"Geppi and Harvey Settle Suit Over Sad Sack Art,\\" ICv2.com (June 19, 2002).  Distribution of cartoons  For years, the television distribution rights to the Harveytoons library were licensed to Worldvision Enterprises. Worldvision would hold distribution rights to many earlier Famous Studios cartoons (plus most of the cartoons by Fleischer Studios) for a short time, until being absorbed by the television division of Paramount Pictures, which originally distributed the cartoons. Universal Studios, which owns the pre-1950 Paramount sound features through its television division, once held video rights to the Harvey-owned cartoons, until 2001 when Classic Media obtained the animated catalog. In 2016, the Harvey Comics properties returned to Universal when they acquired Classic Media's parent company, DreamWorks Animation. In 2018, Netflix began airing Harvey Street Kids (later renamed Harvey Girls Forever!), produced by DreamWorks Animation and based on Harvey Comics characters, the series ended in 2020.

The translation can differ depending on context, in reference to the self it can mean \\"world weariness\\", in reference to the world it can mean \\"the pain of the world\\".

Suze is a mediator, whose role is to help ghosts finish their business on earth so they can pass on to the afterlife. To this end, she can see, touch, communicate with, hit, punch, and 'kick ghost butt' when she must. The series begins just after Suze's widowed mother marries Andy Ackerman, so Suze has moved to Carmel, California, to live in an old house complete with three stepbrothers. To make matters worse, her bedroom is haunted by an attractive male ghost named Jesse de Silva, who died 150 years earlier. Suze remembers that back in New York, a fortune teller had told her that she was a mediator (which proved correct) and that she would only fall in love once, but it would last for an eternity. Her one love for eternity just might be Jesse. But does he love her back? The first four books were originally released under the pseudonym Jenny Carroll (this was when Cabot was working with different publishing houses).

Since the 1990s, there have been multiple proposals to improve the links from Chicago, Illinois to major destinations including Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland, Kansas City, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Milwaukee, Madison, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. In addition, lines would connect through to major cities in Canada. Eastern routes would blend into the Ohio Hub network. In addition to providing better connections between Midwestern cities, the projects are intended to reduce or eliminate the operating subsidies that American passenger train routes currently require. Midwest High Speed Rail logo If implemented, the plans would return some of the nation's fastest trains to Chicago as it had in the 1930s and 1940s when the Twin Zephyrs, Twin Cities 400, and Hiawatha were based in the city. Chicago continues to be the nation's largest rail hub, and remains unsurpassed in the nation in the total number of passenger and freight trains that converge on the city. Presently, Chicago is a major hub for Amtrak, with 15 different lines terminating at Union Station. Most existing passenger trains in the region operate at speeds of about , although a few travel faster. The various plans have suggested speeds ranging from for the core routes, as well as improved speeds for secondary routes. The Chicago‚ÄìSt. Louis rail line between is being upgraded so passenger trains will be able to reach top speeds of between Carlinville, Illinois, and Joliet, Illinois, work which is expected to be completed in 2017. Early studies and ISTEA corridors Renewed interest in high-speed rail occurred by the year 1990 when the Minnesota‚ÄìWisconsin‚ÄìIllinois Tri-State Rail Study was underway. A Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee‚ÄìMadison‚ÄìLa Crosse‚ÄìRochester‚ÄìTwin Cities \\"southern corridor\\" (a variation of the former Hiawatha routing) and a Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee‚ÄìGreen Bay‚ÄìWausau‚ÄìEau Claire‚ÄìTwin Cities \\"northern corridor\\" were described in a preliminary report in December of that year. A final report was released in May 1991 and recommended TGV-class service since it provided the greatest benefit to riders and others in the corridor, though a slower (and less expensive) \\"Amtrak upgrade\\" option was also deemed reasonable for capital- constrained investments. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was passed on December 18, 1991, and requested designation of up to five corridors. A core of what would become the Chicago Hub Network was the first of these five to be announced by Secretary of Transportation Andrew Card on October 15, 1992, who designated Chicago-based routes to Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Detroit. Midwest Regional Rail Initiative In 2004, the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative plan was released, focusing on upgrading existing Amtrak routes. The plan had been in development since 1996, led by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Trains would travel at about on the primary routes, but on secondary lines. Existing trains run at speeds of about . Raising the speed would significantly reduce trip times. A trip between Milwaukee and Chicago would be reduced from about 90 minutes to just over an hour. The trip from the Twin Cities to Chicago would drop from 8 hours to 5¬Ω hours. Travelers between Chicago and Cincinnati would see the biggest gains, cutting travel time in half to just 4 hours. If implemented, planners would expect 13.6 million annual riders by the year 2025. The frequency of train trips would also be increased: areas that currently only see one train in each direction every day would be upgraded to four or six trips each way. The total investment required for the system, paying for infrastructure as well as rolling stock, was estimated at $7.7 billion in 2002 dollars. $1.1 billion of that would go toward purchasing 63 new train sets. Plans at the time called for phased construction taking about a decade. This plan is expected to use diesel-powered trains, which is one reason for the relatively low top speed in comparison to high-speed lines in Europe and elsewhere. The practical limit for diesel-powered train service is about . Higher speeds require electrification, which can double the cost of building a rail line, though trains on such lines benefit from higher efficiency leading to lower fuel costs, and the ability to accelerate and decelerate more rapidly which boosts rail line capacity. 2009 Midwest High Speed Rail Association proposal For 2009, the Midwest High Speed Rail Association (MHSRA) and other organizations requested new studies of possible rail routes in the Midwest, this time with service as the goal. These routes were identified:Midwest High Speed Rail Association: 220-mph High Speed Lines *Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee‚ÄìMadison‚ÄìRochester‚ÄìMinneapolis/St. Paul-St. Cloud-Fargo- Bismarck *Chicago‚ÄìChampaign‚ÄìSpringfield‚ÄìSt. Louis *Chicago‚ÄìGary‚ÄìLafayette‚ÄìIndianapolis‚ÄìCincinnati **Cincinnati‚ÄìDayton‚ÄìColumbus‚ÄìCleveland *Chicago‚ÄìGary‚ÄìFort Wayne‚ÄìToledo‚ÄìDetroit *Chicago‚ÄìGary‚ÄìFort Wayne‚ÄìToledo‚ÄìCleveland-Erie-Buffalo **Cleveland‚ÄìPittsburgh The MHSRA funded a study of the link from Chicago to St. Louis,Chicago to St. Louis 220 mph High Speed Rail Alternative Corridor Study while the Southeast Minnesota Rail Alliance funded a study of the route to Minneapolis/St. Paul‚Äîthe third in a series previously funded by the Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota Departments of Transportation.Tri-State II Rail StudyTri-State III Rail Study 2009 SNCF proposal In late 2009, the French national rail company SNCF released studies of several rail corridors in the United States in California, Florida, Texas, and the Midwest.SNCF: Midwest France has a population distribution similar to that in the Midwest, so their experiences with TGV trains and other high-speed systems could conceivably be duplicated in the U.S. The following routes were identified for a first phase of implementation: *Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee‚ÄìMadison‚ÄìEau Claire‚ÄìMinneapolis/St. Paul *Chicago‚ÄìBloomington/Normal‚ÄìSpringfield‚ÄìSt. Louis *Chicago‚ÄìGary‚ÄìLafayette‚ÄìIndianapolis‚ÄìCincinnati *Chicago‚ÄìGary‚ÄìFort Wayne‚ÄìToledo‚ÄìDetroit *Chicago‚ÄìGary‚ÄìFort Wayne‚ÄìToledo‚ÄìCleveland These routes were designed to allow them to overlay the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative plan. Like the MHSRA plan, the SNCF core routes would operate at up to 220 mph. The total cost was projected at $68.5 billion in 2009 dollars, with 54% of that projected to need public financing if a public-private partnership was pursued. The public funds could be recovered from revenues in about 15 years. Upgrades underway Some construction has begun in Illinois and Michigan, primarily as testbeds for the upgraded signaling and control systems required for higher-speed rail. In Michigan, this work has already resulted in speeds up to for Amtrak's Wolverine and Blue Water services. Similar work on the Chicago‚ÄìSaint Louis line in Illinois was met with considerable technical difficulties in 2005, though work continued. In September 2008, the federal government provided $297,000 to fund a study of the plan; Amtrak and state governments matched these funds for a total of $594,000. Planners anticipate 13.6 million riders over the entire network by the year 2025. The Chicago to Milwaukee Hiawatha Service was planned to be expanded to Madison, Wisconsin, but the project was then nixed in 2011 by then Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. In 2009, the Spanish manufacturer Talgo had agreed to open a plant in Wisconsin in order to build 110-mph trains for the Hiawatha route and other improved corridors;Doyle enters Midwest pact to pursue high-speed rail funds however, due to the cancellation of construction in Wisconsin, Talgo has scaled back plans from a manufacturing plant to a maintenance facility, leading the City of Milwaukee to consider legal action against the state.Talgo pulling out of Milwaukee in 2012 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 In 2009, the federal government allocated $8 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to be divided up among rail projects around the country. States in the Midwest made 24 applications to the government, and on January 28, 2010, the White House announced that the Chicago network would receive money for three of its requests, and two other grants were made to Midwestern states. The Chicago-based routes receiving funding were: *$1.131 billion for Chicago‚ÄìSt. Louis‚ÄìKansas City ($1.1 billion for Chicago‚ÄìSt. Louis, $31 million for St. Louis‚ÄìKansas City) *$823 million for Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee‚ÄìMadison‚ÄìMinneapolis/St. Paul ($810 million for Milwaukee‚ÄìMadison, $12 million for Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee, remaining $600,000 to study possible alignments to the Twin Cities.) *$244 million for Chicago‚ÄìPontiac‚ÄìDetroit An additional $400 million was released for the 3C corridor in Ohio connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati, and $17 million was allocated to Iowa. Many of the corridors receiving funding at this time were originally designated as high-speed rail corridors following the 1991 ISTEA legislation. 2010 In October 2010, the Chicago Hub received more money from the FY 2010 High Speed Rail Allocation. The major grants were: *$230 million for Chicago‚ÄìQuad Cities‚ÄìIowa City *$161 million for Chicago‚ÄìDetroit Following the 2010 gubernatorial elections in Wisconsin and Ohio, both newly elected governors repeated their intentions of shutting down the projects in these two states and returning the money to the federal government. Following the return of funds, the federal government redirected the $145 million intended for Wisconsin and Ohio to the State of Washington's high-speed rail corridor, and to Connecticut to modernize the New Haven- Springfield Line. Chicago-St. Louis rail line upgrades Before the upgrades, Amtrak passenger trains had a top speed of 79 MPH on the line between Chicago and St. Louis, and freight trains had a top speed of 60 MPH. In the fall of 2012, the section of the Chicago-St. Louis line between Pontiac, Illinois, and Dwight, Illinois, began Amtrak service at 110 MPH, as a demonstration section. In 2014 construction began to upgrade the entire rail line between Carlinville, Illinois, and Joliet, Illinois, so that Amtrak could run its passenger trains at 110 MPH. In addition, freight trains will be able to operate at 70 MPH. The entire cost of the high-speed rail program was estimated at $1.8 billion, with the federal government committing $1.6 billion of that, later lowered to $1.4 billion. It is estimated that $1.2 billion will be spent on the program by the end of 2016. Part of the project was expected to be completed in 2019, and Amtrak trains will be able to move as fast as 90-mph sometime in 2020 after Positive Train Control is in place, with no target date for 110-mph trains yet.

It is a multiple star approximately away with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.33. The main components are an O8 giant star and a B-class main sequence star, separated by about 4\\". Nomenclature œÜ2 Orionis Lambda Orionis is the star's Bayer designation. The traditional name Meissa derives from the Arabic Al-Maisan which means 'The Shining One'. Al-Maisan was originally used for Gamma Geminorum, but was mistakenly applied to Lambda Orionis and the name stuck. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Meissa for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The original Arabic name for this star, Al Hakah (the source for another name for it, Heka) refers to the Arabic lunar mansion that includes this star and the two of Phi Orionis (Al Ha·∏≥ Ωah, 'a White Spot').

It is an enormous star with about 28 times the mass of the Sun and 10 times the Sun's radius. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of around 35,000 K, giving it the characteristic blue glow of a hot O-type star. Meissa is a soft X-ray source with a luminosity of 1032 erg s‚àí1 and peak emission in the energy range of 0.2‚Äì0.3 keV, which suggests the X-rays are probably being generated by the stellar wind. Meissa is actually a double star with a companion at an angular separation of 4.41 arcseconds along a position angle of 43.12¬∞ (as of 1937). This fainter component is of magnitude 5.61 and it has a stellar classification of B0.5 V, making it a B-type main sequence star. There is an outlying component, Meissa C, which is an F-type main sequence star with a classification of F8 V. This star in turn may have a very low mass companion that is probably a brown dwarf. Ring WISE infrared view of the ring around Meissa, which is the faint \\"white\\" star north of the small bright red nebula. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA) Meissa is surrounded by a ring of nebulosity about 12 degrees across. It is thought to be the remains of a supernova explosion, now ionized by the ultraviolet radiation from Meissa itself and some of the surrounding hot stars. Cluster This star is the dominant member of a 5-million-year-old star-forming region known as the Œª Orionis cluster, or Collinder 69. The intense ultraviolet energy being radiated by this star is creating the Sh2-264 H II region in the neighboring volume of space, which in turn is surrounded by an expanding ring of cool gas that has an age of about 2‚Äì6 million years. The expansion of this gaseous ring may be explained by a former binary companion of Meissa that became a Type II supernova. Such an event would also explain the star's peculiar velocity with respect to the center of the expanding ring, as the explosion and resulting mass loss could have kicked Meissa out of the system. A potential candidate for the supernova remnant is the neutron star Geminga. However, the last is unlikely given the distance between Geminga and the cluster.

Borotsik sought the provincial PC party's nomination for Brandon West in the buildup to the 1986 provincial election, but lost to Jim McCrae.Paul Samyn, \\"Just say 'aahh'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 April 1996, B1. Borotsik was an employee of the shopping centre firm Bramalea Limited during the 1980s. He was transferred from Brandon to Calgary in 1985, and again to the firm's head office in Toronto one year later. He remained the city for three years, and became director of 32 centres. Finding it difficult to adjust to life in Toronto, he returned to Brandon in 1989. He ran for mayor in that year's municipal election, and won an upset victory over four-term incumbent Ken Burgess.Bill Redekop, \\"The right stuff\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 July 1996, B1.

Member of Parliament ;First term (1997‚Äì2000) Borotsik sought and won the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada's nomination for Brandon-Souris in the 1997 federal election. The party had been reduced to only two seats in the previous election, and was trying to rebuild its support base. Borotsik was a strong supporter of party leader Jean Charest, and was considered a star candidate. He indicated that he opposed the ideology of the rival, right-wing Reform Party of Canada, which he described as a \\"flash-in- the-pan regional party\\" with no national perspective.Bill Redekop, \\"The right stuff\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 July 1996, B1. He was narrowly elected over the Reform candidate, while pushing Liberal incumbent Glen McKinnon into third place. The Liberals under Jean Chr√©tien were re-elected to a second consecutive majority government in the 1997 election, while the Progressive Conservatives won twenty seats for a fifth-place finish. Borotsik was his party's only elected representative from western Canada. He served critic for agriculture, the Canadian Wheat Board and western economic diversification, and had unofficial duties for the western provinces.Paul Samyn, \\"Manitoba MPs a rainbow\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 September 1997, A8. Charest resigned as party leader in 1998, despite requests from Borotsik and other MPs that he remain in the position.Edison Stewart, \\"Tory MPs want leader to stay\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 March 1998, A6. Borotsik was subsequently chosen as national caucus chairman,\\"Canada's harried Tories pick temporary leader\\", Reuters News, 1 April 1998. Borotsik was initially considered as a prominent candidate to replace Charest as interim leader, but this position went to Elsie Wayne instead. See Paul Samyn, \\"Brandon's former mayor willing to steer the Tory ship\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 March 1998, A1. and endorsed Joe Clark's successful bid to succeed Charest as leader.Graham Fraser, \\"Clark launches bid for a comeback\\", Globe and Mail, 26 June 1998, A4.

Borotsik opposed the Canadian gun registry, which he described as unworkable.Rosemary Spiers, \\"Gun lobby off mark over gun registration\\", Toronto Star, 24 September 1998, A23. He endorsed a 1998 bill that reversed Louis Riel's conviction for treason, and recognized him as a Father of Confederation.Graham Fraser, \\"MPs unite to reverse Riel's conviction\\", Globe and Mail, 15 May 1998, A11. Later, he broke with his party's official position to support the Chr√©tien government's Clarity Bill.Paul Samyn, \\"Chr√©tien repays Clark for attacks\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 November 2000, A19. There was speculation that Borotsik would seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 2000, but he declined.Kim Guttormson, \\"Ex- premier not gone yet, not forgotten by contenders either\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 September 1999, A1. ;Second term (2000‚Äì04) Borotsik was narrowly re- elected in the 2000 federal election over a candidate of the Canadian Alliance, as the Liberals won a third consecutive majority government nationally. The Progressive Conservatives fell to twelve seats and remained the fifth-largest party in parliament, but avoided the loss of official party status that some had feared. Borotsik was subsequently named as party whip and Critic for Agriculture, Indian Affairs and the Canadian Wheat Board.\\"Tory Leader Joe Clark announces caucus critics for Commons return\\", Canadian Press, 16 January 2001, 14:56.

Prentice was defeated by Peter MacKay on the final ballot of the party's 2003 leadership convention; Borotsik resigned as party whip, but remained Agriculture Critic.Allison Lawlor, \\"MacKay backs free trade\\", Globe and Mail, 2 June 2003. During this period, Borotsik surprised some political observers by declaring his support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. He also endorsed the principles of public health care and employment insurance, and became associated with the Red Tory wing of his party.Brian Laghi, Kim Lunman and Campbell Clark, \\"Liberals could lose same-sex free vote\\", Globe and Mail, 14 August 2003, A1; Bill Curry and Sean Gordon, \\"Senior Tories vow to vote against deal: But most on side, MP says\\", National Post, 17 October 2003, A4. MacKay and Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper announced plans to merge their parties in late 2003. Borotsik strongly opposed this decision, and said that he would not be a candidate for the merged party if Stephen Harper was chosen as its leader.Campbell Clark, \\"MacKay faces criticism\\", Globe and Mail, 16 October 2003, A1; Brian Laghi, \\"Tory MP says no to running for Harper\\", Globe and Mail, 19 November 2003, A5.

Borotsik ultimately chose to sit with the merged Conservative Party of Canada until the next election, but made no secret of his opposition to Stephen Harper and the new party's social conservatism. He turned down an offer to become Agriculture Critic, and did not stand in the 2004 campaign.Paul Samyn, \\"Borotsik turns down job as chief agriculture critic\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 January 2004, A5. Just before election day, he publicly endorsed the Liberals.John Kernaghan, \\"Tory trio backs Grit hopeful for Haldimand-Norfolk\\", Hamilton Spectator, 15 June 2004, A8.

Member of the provincial legislature Stuart Murray announced his resignation as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 2005. Some considered Borotsik as a possible replacement, but he quickly ruled himself out as a candidate.Mia Rabson, \\"Murray not in House, likely stepping down today\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 November 2005, B3. In June 2006, however, he announced that he would run for the party in the next provincial campaign.Martin Cash, \\"Borotsik to run for Conservatives\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 June 2006, A7. He was narrowly elected in the 2007 election, defeating New Democratic Party cabinet minister Scott Smith by 56 votes in Brandon West. Borotsik provoked some controversy when he announced that he favoured an end to Manitoba's tuition freeze; the party's official policy was to keep the freeze in place.Mia Rabson, \\"Tory university plank shouted down\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 May 2007, A11. The New Democratic Party was re-elected to a third consecutive majority government in the 2007 election, and Borotsik entered the legislature as a member of the Official Opposition.\\"The swing's the thing\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 May 2007, A4.

Young was the designer of Bell Helicopter's first helicopter, the Model 30, and inventor of the stabilizer bar used on many of Bell's early helicopter designs. He founded the \\"Institute for the Study of Consciousness\\" in Berkeley in 1972. Young advocated process philosophy, an attempt to integrate the realm of human thought and experience with the realm of science so that the concept of universe is not limited to that which can be physically measured. Young's theory embraces evolution and the concept of the great chain of being. He has influenced such thinkers as Stanislav Grof and Laban Coblentz. Biography Young controlling a model helicopter he built in 1941, photograph by Joseph Janney Steinmetz Arthur was the son of Eliza Coxe (1875‚Äì1950) and Philadelphia landscape painter Charles Morris Young (1869‚Äì1964). He was interested in developing a comprehensive theory of reality from an early age. He felt that to acquire the intellectual tools needed for such rigorous study, he should first develop an understanding of mathematics and engineering. With this decision he was following a career path similar to that of philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, who was a mathematician before he developed the first process philosophy. Thus after graduation from Princeton University in 1927 Young searched for a suitable invention to develop. In 1928 he returned to his father's farm in Radnor, Pennsylvania, to begin twelve solitary years of efforts to develop the helicopter into a useful device. Young's private experiments with helicopter design had mostly involved small scale models. After twelve years on his own using the models, he took his results and models to the Bell Aircraft Company in Buffalo, New York, in 1941, and the company agreed to build full-scale prototypes. While war was looming for the USA in late 1941 he was issued the key rotor stabilizer bar (also known as a flybar) patent, assigned it to Bell and moved to Buffalo to work with them. In June 1942 he moved his five-person team to Gardenville, New York, a hamlet on the north border of West Seneca, New York, where they could work in relative secrecy. The first test flight of the prototype Model 30 occurred in July 1943, and on March 8, 1946 the company received Helicopter Type Certificate H-1 for the world's first commercial helicopter, the Bell Model 47. This was the \\"whirlybird\\" featured in the M*A*S*H movie and television series and was so successful that it continued to be manufactured through 1974. A design as well as a utilitarian success, it was added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art of New York City in 1984. Young had become profoundly disturbed by the development of nuclear weapons at the end of the Second World War and decided that humanity needed a new philosophical paradigm. In August 1946 Young recorded in his notes the idea of the psychopter‚Äî the helicopter as the \\"winged self\\", a metaphor for the human spirit.A.M. Young, The Bell Notes, p. 67, 106 By October 1947 Young felt his work at Bell was complete, and he turned to the next phase of his career as a philosopher of mind (or soul). In 1949, the Franklin Institute awarded him the Edward Longstreth Medal. In 1952, Young and his wife Ruth organized the Foundation for the Study of Consciousness in Philadelphia, the forerunner of the Institute for the Study of Consciousness.

Ingredients  Panipuri consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp crepe), filled with a mixture of flavored water (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion or chickpeas. Fuchka (or fuska or puska) differs from Panipuri in content and taste. It uses a mixture of boiled yellow peas and spiced mashed potatoes as the filling with sliced onion mixture as the toppings. It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy.  Names  Panipuri's name varies depending on the region. In Haryana it is known as paani patashi; in Madhya Pradesh fulki; in Uttar Pradesh pani ke batashe/padake ; in Assam phuska/puska; Pakodi in parts of Gujarat, Gup-chup in parts of Odisha, Phuchka in Bengal, Bihar, Nepal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. It is popular by the name of Gol Gappa (/g…ô älÀàg åp…ô/) in some parts of Northern India (particularly Delhi). On 10 March 2005, \\"Pani Puri\\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.  History  Chaat is considered as a predecessor of Pani puri. According to culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, Chaat originated in northern India (now Uttar Pradesh) during the mahabharata era. According to this claim, Draupadi in the Mahabharata impressed her mother-in-law Kunti by being able to turn dough for just one puri and some potatoes into pani puri to feed her five husbands. Food historian Pushpesh Pant opines that Pani puri originated in north India (around modern-day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) about 100 to 125 years ago. He also noted that it was possibly originated from Raj- Kachori. Someone made a smaller Puri and made a Pani puri from it. Pani puri spread to rest of the India with migration in 20th century.

Saint Paul's Bay is the largest town in the Northern Region and the seat of the Northern Regional Committee along with being the most populous town in Malta. Its name refers to the shipwreck of Saint Paul as documented in the Acts of the Apostles on St. Paul's Islands near St Paul's Bay, on his voyage from Caesarea to Rome, which laid the foundations of Christianity on the island. Burmarrad, Wardija, Qawra, Buƒ°ibba, Xemxija, and San Martin, as well as part of Bidnija and Mistra, form part of St. Paul's Bay Local Council. The area of the locality is . The population in 2018 was 23,112. This goes up to about 60,000 between June and September with Maltese residents and tourists lodging in hotels, especially in Buƒ°ibba and Qawra. Heading north is Mistra Bay, its headland and St Paul's Island. Going west and crossing the island towards ƒ†nejna Bay and Golden Bay is the scenic Wardija Ridge. History Archaeological remains have been found in the limits of St. Paul's Bay, which go back to around 4000 BC. Among the remains there are the megalithic temples of Buƒ°ibba and Xemxija. In addition, Cart Ruts were found on the Wardija Ridge at Busewdien,Dillon, Paddy Walking in Malta Cicerone Press (1 October 2004) p.107 while Punic tombs and other Bronze Age remains were also found. During the Roman period, St. Paul's Bay became an important harbour. Remains of a Roman road, baths and beehives, have been found at Xemxija, while Roman anchors were found on the seabed. By the late Middle Ages, St. Paul's Bay was abandoned since the area was unsafe due to corsair raids. The local militia maintained several watch posts in the area. One of these, known as Ta' Tabibu farmhouse, still survives today and is considered to be the oldest building in St. Paul's Bay. A building of a church was also noted at the arrival of the Order of St John in 1530. A number of fortifications were built in the area during the rule of the Order of Saint John. The first of these was the Wignacourt Tower, built in 1610, which is now the oldest surviving watchtower in Malta. Qawra Tower was built by Grand Master Lascaris in 1638. In 1715, batteries were built around these two towers, while two batteries and a redoubt were built in other parts of the St. Paul's Bay coastline. Of these, only Arrias Battery survives today, since Dellia Battery and Perellos Redoubt were demolished in the 20th century. The bay was one of the landing places during the French invasion of Malta in June 1798. After the Maltese uprising against the French, St. Paul's Bay became the main harbour of Malta since the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett were still under French control. In the 19th century, several villas were built in St. Paul's Bay. These were requisitioned by the British military in World War II and the bay became a rest camp. After the Italian armistice of 1943, 76 ships of the Regia Marina were anchored at St. Paul's Bay after surrendering to the British. After the war, the area began to be further developed. Today, St. Paul's Bay, Qawra, Buƒ°ibba, Xemxija and Burmarrad form a large cluster of buildings. The area is a popular entertainment spot. Sports * Sirens F.C. football club * Sirens A.S.C.

Early life Pantridge was born in Hillsborough, County Down, Northern Ireland, on 3 October 1916. He was educated at Friends' School Lisburn and Queen's University of Belfast, graduating in medicine in 1939. Military service During World War II he served in the British Army. He was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps as a lieutenant on 12 April 1940. He was given the service number 128673. He was awarded the Military Cross during the Fall of Singapore, when he became a POW. He served much of his captivity as a slave labourer on the Burma Railway. When he was freed at the war's end, Pantridge was emaciated and had contracted cardiac beriberi; he suffered from ill-health related to the disease for the rest of his life. Medical career After Pantridge's liberation he worked as a lecturer in the pathology department at Queen's University, and then won a scholarship to the University of Michigan, where he studied under Dr. F.N. Wilson, a cardiologist and authority on electrocardiography. He returned to Northern Ireland in 1950, and was appointed as cardiac consultant to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast and professor at Queen's University, where he remained until his retirement in 1982. There he established a specialist cardiology unit whose work became known around the world. By 1957 Pantridge and his colleague, Dr John Geddes, had introduced the modern system of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for the early treatment of cardiac arrest. Further study led Frank Pantridge to the realization that many deaths resulted from ventricular fibrillation which needed to be treated before the patient was admitted to hospital. This led to his introduction of the mobile coronary care unit (MCCU), an ambulance with specialist equipment and staff to provide pre- hospital care. To extend the usefulness of early treatment, Pantridge went on to develop the portable defibrillator, and in 1965 installed his first version in a Belfast ambulance. It weighed 70 kg and operated from car batteries, but by 1968 he had designed an instrument weighing only 3 kg, incorporating a miniature capacitor manufactured for NASA. His work was backed up by clinical investigations and epidemiological studies in scientific papers, including an influential 1967 The Lancet article. With these developments, the Belfast treatment system, often known as the \\"Pantridge Plan\\", became adopted throughout the world by emergency medical services. The portable defibrillator became recognised as a key tool in first aid, and Pantridge's refinement of the automated external defibrillator (AED) allowed it to be used safely by members of the public. Although he was known worldwide as the \\"Father of Emergency Medicine\\",UK Daily Telegraph obituary 29 December 2004. Frank Pantridge was less acclaimed in his own country, and was saddened that it took until 1990 for all front-line ambulances in the UK to be fitted with defibrillators.

The citation read: In June 1969, he was appointed Officer of the Order of St. John (OStJ). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours.

Background  The general agreement of scholars is that this surah was revealed shortly before or after the Battle of the Trench in 5 AH. The surah begins with various explanations and decrees on or relating to corrupt sexual acts, family law, and specifications on the giving of testimony. Foremost amongst these rulings is God's punishment for adultery. This section ends with the pronouncement that good men and women should be paired together, as should corrupt men and corrupt women. This discussion turns into reflections on privacy and modesty, namely of hosts and women. Contained herein are several regulations and explanations of modesty, most directly lines traditionally used to argue for the wearing of hijab. After these prohibitions are cast for women, the text turns towards men, asking them not to oppress slavegirls into prostitution, and to marry those women who need husbands, despite their poverty. Exegesis=24:2-4 Unlawful sexual intercourse Most of the rules related to fornication, adultery and false accusations from a husband to his wife or from members of the community to chaste women, can be found in chapter 24, which) starts by giving very specific rules about punishment for unlawful sexual intercourse (zinƒÅ æ): Tafsir Ibn Kathir says in relation to the witnessing of their punishment: \\"This is more humiliating for the people who are guilty of illegal sex, if they are flogged in front of the people. This is because it is more effective as a deterrent and it conveys the sense of scandal and rebuke\\". In Tafsir Ibn Kathir, the prescribed punishment for making false accusations against chaste men or women is to flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. 24:35 \\"the Light Verse\\" \\"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.\\" calligraphy under dome of Hagia Sophia, in Istanbul. After a second statement of the Quran's status as a clear sign from Allah, the famed Ayat an-Nur appears. This is often referred to as \\"the Light Verse\\", or \\"the Parable of Light\\", a mystical group of lines that has been the subject of much scholarship and reflection. :\\"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His light is as if there were a niche and within it a lamp: the lamp enclosed in glass: the glass as it were a brilliant star: lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it: Light upon Light! Allah doth guide whom He will to His light: Allah doth set forth parables for men: and God doth know all things.\\" 24:36-44 believers will be rewarded The Quran here briefly returns to a slightly more literal form of speech as it reassures believers that their remembrance will be rewarded, as the forgetfulness of the sinners will be punished. In keeping with the Light Verse, the unbelievers too are explained in metaphor, returning to the deeply symbolic tone above: \\"And as for the unbelievers, their works are as a mirage in a spacious plain, in which a thirsty man thinks there to be water, until when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing; there indeed he finds God and He pays him his account in full; and God is swift in the reckoning; or they are as shadows upon a sea obscured, covered by a billow above which is a billow above which are clouds; shadows piled one upon the other; when he puts forth his hand, wellnigh he cannot see it. And whoever God assigns no light, no light has he.\\" (Lines 39-40) The Quran explains that the Earth itself is evidence of God's reality and power. He controls the clouds, the winds, the hail, and the mountains. It is also explained in this surah that God created all creatures from water, including animals with four feet, animals with two feet, and animals without any feet. 24:45 Birth and social status The Quran confirms that God has sent down signs (ayat) to make His reality clear, and that understanding that reality is as a \\"straight path\\", that if one is truly following, one can never be led astray. God keeps His word, and will continue to reward those who believe and keep to their religion, as He has rewarded others in the past for doing the same. The Book urges the believer not to fret, and not to accuse people of sin merely for the conditions of their birth or social status. For example, in many tribal cultures a blind person or their parents were believed to be wicked, hence the gods or the spirits have blinded them. The Quran urges one not to think in this manner, and instead remember that all things are signs from God, and thus all believers should be of good nature to others, and wish them blessings from God. If that is done, the signs become clear and \\"haply you will understand\\". As the believer must greet others well, so must they ask for leave from them before departing. However, the surah ends, God knows the hidden reasons people do as they do, \\"God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously\\", for when all returns to Him, they will testify against themselves to Him.

The significant issues, divine laws, and directly follows the following order in the surah:-Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik (translator), Al-Qur'an, the Guidance for Mankind - English with Arabic Text (Hardcover) # The Quran is the rule, the criterion i.e Al-Furqan to distinguish between the right and the wrong. # Transgressors are the individuals who dismiss Reality, distrust the Rasool, and preclude the Day of Judgment and hereafter. # Upon the arrival of Judgment Day, those False-deities worshiped by the mushriks will declare no divinity and consider the mushrikis answerable for their shirk, on the Judgement Day. # The disbelievers will lament not opting the Righteous Path upon the arrival of Judgment Day. # Sequential, gradual, and bit-by-bit disclosure of the Quran is a pearl of wisdom. # Allah's decree is commanded to make Jihad against unbelief in the Quran. # Qualities of genuine devotees are portrayed. Toward the finish of the Surah, a description of the character of a true believer is given at the start of Surah Al-Mu'minoon. According to Abul A'la Maududi : Here is the criterion for distinguishing the genuine from the counterfeit. This is the noble character of those people who have believed in and followed the teachings of the Holy Prophet and this is the kind of people that he is trying to train. You may yourselves compare and contrast this type of people with those Arabs, who have not as yet accepted the Message, and who are upholding \\"ignorance\\" and exerting their utmost to defeat the Truth. Now you may judge for yourselves as to which you would like to choose.\\" Though this question was not posed in so many words, it was placed before everyone in Arabia in a tangible shape. It may be noted that during the next few years, the practical answer given to this question by the whole nation, with the exception of a small minority, was that they chose Islam.Abul A'la Maududi - Tafhim-ul-Quran  See also  * List of Islamic texts NotesReferences External links  Furqan ","title":"Al-Furqan"},{"id":"1345015","text":"Anstey is a large village in Leicestershire, England, located north west of Leicester in the borough of Charnwood. Its population was 6,528 at the 2011 census. This figure is expected to increase due to the building of a new housing development off Groby Road. The village is separated from Leicester by the Rothley Brook, Castle Hill Park and the A46, and it borders the villages of Glenfield, Groby, Newtown Linford, Cropston and Thurcaston as well as the suburb of Beaumont Leys and Anstey Heights. To the north-west lies Bradgate Park. Anstey is known as the Gateway to Charnwood Forest. It is a combination of traditional English village (with two village greens - the top green and bottom green) and an industrial town (with several 19th-century hosiery factories, many of which are now being turned into apartments) which is made up mostly of a number of small estates, both council and private which are intertwined, often with no clear border. History Anstey dates back to Angle origins, when it was known as Hanstige (later Anstige), meaning a narrow forest track (specifically the meaning is either 'one-way' or 'steep road'Courtney). Anstey was positioned between Charnwood Forest and Leicester Forest.Andover - Anston  British History Online Whilst developing the site for the new Co-op store in 2002 archaeologists were called in and found remains dating back to the 12th century. A plaque recording this has been placed on the wall of the new shop. The place-name of Anstey is first recorded in Domesday Book when it was held by one of the county's largest landholders, Hugh de Grandmesnil, castellan of Leicester. At the time it was a small farming community.Lowe, p. 1 Anstey appears to have had its origins in two distinct settlement foci, each associated with a separate manor, one associated with Leicester Abbey and one with the Ferrers of Groby. It is believed that Anstey once had a sizable military force - in 1431 William Porter \\"furnished XIX hommes and IX archers\\".Leicestershire Villages - Anstey - Anstey History When Bonnie Prince Charlie's army moved south during the 1745 rebellion, although the main body of troops were turned back at Derby, a foraging party reached the commons of Anstey. Local industry included hosiery from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century, leading to a rise in population to around 600 by 1800.Lowe, p. 10 By 1845 there were 300 people employed as framework knitters in the village.Lowe, p. 11 A decline in the industry in the middle of the nineteenth century saw a fall in the village's population, although hosiery manufacture continued in the village until the mid-twentieth century.Lowe, p. 15 Boot and shoe manufacture became a more important part of the village's work between 1860 and 1900, and the first employer in Leicestershire described as a \\"boot and shoe manufacturer\\" appeared in Anstey in 1863.Bailey, Brian J. (1977) Portrait of Leicestershire, Robert Hale Limited, London, , p. 205 The village's population rose to over 2,500 by 1900, with a corresponding rise in house-building. Anstey became an independent parish in 1866, having previously been a chapelry of Thurcaston. A number of related industries developed in the village, including tanning and box-making, the latter still present in the village.Lowe, p. 19 One of the largest companies in the village was the Anstey Wallpaper Company, which occupied a site east of Cropston Road now filled with houses and the new Co-op store. Nearly all the local factories have now either been demolished or converted into flats. By 1971, the population of the village had risen to almost 6,000.Lowe, p. 20 The village is still the home of Ulverscroft Large Print Books Ltd., known for their large-print editions of popular books, published since 1964.Cottin, Lou (1976) \\"Growing Older: Easier Reading\\", Telegraph- Herald, 24 October 1976, p. 16, retrieved 2011-06-04 The most notable family of Anstey was the Martin family, who lived in the village from the 13th century until 1892. Two members of the family held the position of Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire, and the local high school is named after them. They lived at Anstey Pastures (now demolished),Burke, John & Burke, John Bernard (1847) A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain & Ireland, Vol. II: M-Z, Henry Colburn, London, p. 833 before moving to The Brand in 1892. Famous past Anstey residents include Ned Ludd (Ludlam), the machine-wrecker whose name was appropriated by the Luddites - whose name was adopted in a recent household development in the village: Ned Ludd Close, and snooker player and commentator Willie Thorne, who started playing snooker at the village's Conservative club.BBC - Leicester Sense of Place - Looking for your landmarks Footballer Derek Dougan lived in the village during his time at Leicester City. According to legend, the last wolf to be killed in England was shot in a forest \\"near Anstige in Wolfdale\\".Anstey lies about four miles to the north-west of Leicester, and has a population of over 6,000. The Saxons, who settled here between the 5th and 8th centuries, knew it as Hanstige, meaning 'the high path'. In 1086 the Domesday Book recorded it as An... Wolfdale was a nearby district towards Newtown Linford, and the name has survived in a slightly altered form with Wooldale Close, one of the streets in the village. Religion St. Mary's parish church, Anstey Anstey Methodist Church There are Church of England, United Reformed Church and Methodist churches in the village. The parish church of St. Mary is on Bradgate Road, just out of The Nook, has the remains of a 15th-century preaching cross and was previously part of the Parish of Thurcaston. The United Reformed Church is further up Bradgate Road. The Methodist Church is situated near The Nook on Cropston Road, and is a medium-sized church serving the community, being part of the Leicester West Circuit of the Oxford and Leicester District of the Methodist Church. An earlier Methodist church was located on the opposite side of the road to the current church, until it was demolished in the 1980s. Education The earliest purpose-built school for children in Anstey was on Bradgate Road, built in 1873 and now a Grade II listed building that has been converted to flats; For many years after later schools were built this continued to serve as the village's infant school. There was also an Adult School & Institute on Church Lane, the building now occupied by a printing company.Friendly Societies, Industrial and Provident Societies, and Trade Unions, House of Commons, 1928, p. 4 There are currently three schools in Anstey: * Latimer Primary School, Latimer Street - original building from 1896 * Woolden Hill Primary School, Netherfield Road - opened 1977 * The Martin High School, Anstey, Link Road - opened 1957, now a secondary academy for 11- to 16-year-olds College students go to The Cedars Academy at Birstall. They may also go to English Martyrs RC School on Anstey Lane, Brookvale High School in Groby, or Rawlins Community College in Quorn (Out of catchment area).  The Martin High School  In March 2008, The Martin High was placed 10th best school in the country and 3rd best in the county for pupils' progress between the ages of 11 and 14. The Village Anstey retains some of the charm of a traditional village particularly on the area immediately north of the village centre, but due to its industrial background there are many small terraced houses as well as some pre-fabricated post war council houses in the 'Dutch barn' style. The large houses towards the top of Bradgate Road change into terraced houses in the old industrial area, and then modern suburbia out towards Link Road, where the Anstey Martin school can be found. Just off the Nook is Latimer primary school, named after Bishop Latimer. King William's Bridge, Anstey Packhorse Bridge, Anstey The Rothley Brook flows through the village on its way to the River Soar, and there are two ancient bridges (the Packhorse Bridge and King William's Bridge) and an old water mill. The packhorse bridge is on the route of the original road from Leicester. King William's Bridge is so named because when King William III planned to visit the Grey family at Bradgate in 1696, the existing crossings of the Rothley Brook were found to be too narrow for the Royal coach, so a new bridge had to be constructed. Anstey also has a GP surgery, dentist, funeral directors and opticians, and several fast food outlets and restaurants. Around The Nook there are a number of different shops, a post office, as well as pubs - The Coach and Horses, The Crown and The Old Hare and Hounds as well as a Conservative club. The Working men's club closed in 2009 and The Plough pub in 2012. In the past Anstey had two cinemas, the Savoy on Cropston Road which was later used as a petrol station/garage before being converted into a pub/restaurant and eventually a furnishings shop, and another on Ellis Street, which now sells wine. Local Newspaper For many years, the village had its own newspaper, Anstey Scene, which was a quarterly with news about local events and council meetings. Other local publications included the Anstey Directory with advertisements for local businesses, including from the Birstall and Glenfield areas, and The Anstey Clarion, a monthly which took reader submitted articles. All of these have now ceased to publish. There is, however, a publication entitled Your Local which is published monthly. Local Area Nearby Glenfield is the home of Leicestershire County Council, and all the shops and facilities of the city can be found about four miles (6 km) away in Leicester. Castle Hill Park lies to the East of the village, connecting Anstey to Beaumont Leys and with the A46 Leicester Western Bypass running through it. Bradgate Park, childhood home of Lady Jane Grey, stretches above the village, between the two neighbouring villages of Newtown Linford and Cropston. For transport, Anstey is served by regular bus services to Leicester and the Beaumont Shopping Centre (about a mile away in Beaumont Leys), and less regular services to Loughborough. By road, Anstey is just off the A46 Leicester Western Bypass, which provides a fast link to the M1 southbound to London, with the A50 providing access to the M1 North. Sport Anstey is home to Anstey Nomads Football Club who play in the East Midlands Counties League. Prior to the Second World War there were two separate teams - the Methodist and St. Marys Parish Church football teams. However, following the War in 1947 the two were joined under one banner and became Anstey Nomads. The ground which is owned by the club is situated on Cropston Road, Anstey. In addition to the Anstey Nomads there is the youth football team - the Anstey Swifts. There also is the Anstey Town Football Team who were until recently (May 2009) based in nearby Thurcaston. There are also Rugby Union (Anstey RFC, formed 1980, who play on the Link Road playing fields) and Cricket teams, who play in the local leagues. Anstey and Glenfield CC play in the Leicestershire and Rutland Cricket League at Gynsill Lane playing field on the Anstey/Glenfield border, they have two senior teams playing in Division 6 and Division 8, one friendly XI playing numerous Sunday friendlies as of 2016. Anstey Narborians play on the recreation ground at Stadon Road, in the Leicestershire League. Anstey has three recreation grounds - the main park (\\"The Reccy\\") off Stadon Road which has facilities including floodlit multi play/tennis court area, swings, slides, football pitch and a small area for younger children. From May 2009 it has a kicking wall and shelter to the side of the Jubilee Hall (APC office) built by Anstey Parish council. There is a less well equipped one near Link Road which is occasionally used by the Anstey RFC. Millfield Close also has a small area with play equipment on, which is rented from Charnwood Borough Council. Ley lines Standing stone, Anstey Anstey and surrounding area have been mentioned in several texts about ley lines. Anstey has a standing stone and a place called The Leys, which marks the route of the Bradgate Ley, which runs between a notch in the hill near Old John in Bradgate Park, and Oadby.Timpson, John (2000) Timpson's Leylines, Cassell & Co., , p.159  Shopping  Anstey has a variety of different shops and services, making it the commercial centre for the majority of local villages. The largest shops include Potters Carpets & Kitchens, who decided to remain in the village despite the arson attack on their old building, which remains to be a major source of income for the village, and a large Co-op store on Cropston Road. There were once several petrol stations in the village, although these have all now closed down. Two neighbouring petrol stations on Cropston Road are now occupied by Broughton's Interiors and a car dealer.  Transport  Anstey is served by frequent buses on First Leicester service 74 with some infrequent buses running on Centrebus service 154 and Roberts Travel service 120. The nearest network railway station is at Leicester.

Many of these verses are very short. The chapter is named from the word Ash-Shu'ara in ayat 224.http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=26&verse;=224 The chapter talks about various prophets and their tribes. Also how the disbelievers were destroyed after threatening prophets with death. It also talks about the mercy of God (Allah). This surah starts with the story of Moses, followed by that of Abraham. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca. The topic and the style appear, and the traditions affirm, that it was uncovered during the center Makkan period. As indicated by Ibn Abbas, Surah Ta-Ha was uncovered first, at that point Surah Al-Waqiah, and afterward Surah Ash-Shu'ara.Ruh al-Ma'ani, Vol. xx, p. 64 Principal Subjects The significant issues, divine laws, and direction revealed in the surah can be listed as follows:- # God's address to Muhammad that he ought not fuss himself to death with distress for the individuals' disbelief. # Story of Moses, Pharoah, and redemption of the offspring of Israel. # Story of Ibrahim and his contentions against idol worshippers. # The way that the idolaters and their false-deities will both be toppled into hellfire. # Accounts of Prophets Noah, Lot, Hud, Saleh, Shuaib and their people. # Qur'an is uncovered in the Arabic language # Satan plunge on those corrupt delinquents who tune in to gossip and are liars. Notable verses=26:214 Warning Verse=Exegesis The foundation of the chapter 26 is that the disbelievers of Makkah were in constant refusal to acknowledge the message of Islam given by Muhammad, stating that he did not provide evidence to support his claim to prophethood. They would mark him as a poet or a magician, mock his message and disparage his Mission. This situation was making incredible anguish and despondency for Muhammad. The Chapter starts with uplifting statements to Muhammad, inferring, : For what reason do you fuss for their sake? If these individuals have not had believed in you, its because they are stubborn, not the lack of signs for them. They won't yield to common sense they need to see a Sign which makes them bow their heads in inquietude. When this Sign appears at the appropriate time of time, they will themselves understand that what was being introduced to them was the Truth.http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=26&verse;=3 After this discourse, up to verse 191, very much the same topic has been introduced persistently, and it is stated: : The entire earth possesses large amounts of such Signs as can bring a truth-searcher to The Reality, yet the obstinate and misguided individuals have never accepted significantly in the wake of seeing the Signs, regardless of whether these were the Indications of the natural phenomena or the miracles of the Prophets. These pathetic individuals have determinedly clung to their wrong statements of faith till the Divine scourge really overwhelmed them.\\"http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=26&verse;=191 Hadith about Ash-Shu'ara The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.≈ûatibi, El-muvafakat ·∏§adƒ´th (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\" or \\"report\\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.  Summary  Sura 27 tells stories of the prophets Musa (Moses), Sulayman (Solomon), Saleh, and Lut (Lot) to emphasize the message of tawhid (monotheism) in Arabian and Israelite prophets. The miracles of Moses, described in the Book of Exodus, are mentioned in opposition to the arrogance and kufr (disbelief) of the Pharaoh. The story of Solomon is most detailed: Solomon converted Queen Bilqis of Saba' (Sheba) to the \\"true religion\\" after a hoopoe reported to him that she was a sun-worshipping queen. This sura was likely revealed to address the role of the \\"Children of Israel\\" among the believers in Mecca, to emphasize and commend the piety of past prophets, and to distinguish the present Qur'anic message from past traditions.  Significance of title  The sura's name is taken from the ants whose conversations were understood by Solomon. Similar to Sura 13 (The Thunder) or Sura 29 (The Spider), The Ants has no thematic significance in the Sura beyond it being a familiar phrase amongst believers, a reminder of the sura's story of Solomon. Ants do hold a privileged status among animals in Islam on account of the story of Solomon. Hadith literature tells of Muhammad forbidding Muslims to kill the ant, bee, hoopoe, or shrike; it is no coincidence that they are all featured in Sura 27 and that Sura 16 is entitled The Bee. One interpretation for the ant's theological significance coincides with its role historically. As written in the 1993 edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Since early antiquity, ants have been an object of admiration on account of ... the feverish activity with which they provide for their 27th chapter (surah) of the Qur'an with 93 verses (ayat) sustenance and the perfect organisation of their societies.\\" This perfect organization under one cause correlates well with the Islamic idea of obedience, or ibadah.  Main concepts  Chapter heading for sura 27 (Surat al-Naml), Walters Art Museum manuscript * Tawhid was preached by many Israelite prophets as well as Arabian prophets prior to Qur'anic revelation. * \\"Truly, this Qur'an explains to the Children of Israel most of what they differ about, and it is guidance and grace for those who believe.\\" * God has no equal as a creator; all those who associate others with God are guilty of shirk. * Earthly knowledge is nothing compared to God; only those with open ears and eyes will turn to God. * Disbelievers of the message of God will have no hope come Judgement Day. * The revelation is a clear warning. Sura 27 reiterates that all humanity must turn to God without delay.  Chronology  Sura 27 is agreed to be a Meccan Sura from the middle of the Meccan period. Tafsƒ´r al-JalƒÅlayn notes that some exceptions exist: ayat 52-55 are from the Medinan period; aya 85 was revealed during the Hijra to Medina.  N√∂ldeke's Chronology  Orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke's chronology places Sura 27 as 68th out of 114. He places it amongst the 21 suras of the Second Meccan Period (See Muhammad in Mecca). (The Meccan period is estimated to be from 610-622 CE.) N√∂ldeke estimates Sura 27 to be preceded by Sura 17 Al-Isra and followed by Sura 18 al-Kahf. All three suras use allusions to Judaism and the stories of Moses in particular.  Egyptian Chronology  Standard Islamic Egyptian chronology places Sura 27 as 48th out of 114. In this order, it comes before Sura 28 al-Qasas and after Sura 26 al-Shu'ara, following its order in the standard 'Uthmanic Qur'an (see History of the Qur'an). Amongst all three suras and all suras numbered between 19 and 32, the account of revelation begins with \\"mysterious letters,\\" the meaning of which is speculated among some and among others remains unknown; they are speculated to have been variant Arabic dialects. Sura 27 begins with the words \\"Ta Sin.\\" As evident in Tafsƒ´r al- JalƒÅlayn, these words are sometimes interpreted as mysteries of God ‚Äì signs to believe.  Structure  Sura 27, as a mid-Meccan Period sura, can be interpreted multiple ways in terms of structure. Thematically speaking, the sura progresses across several subjects: # Declaration of Qur'an ‚Äì (In Sura 27:1, the Qur'an refers to itself consciously as a scripture, meant to make all clear.) # Moses's Signs are ignored by the Pharaoh # Solomon realizes God's blessings and dedicates himself to God's service. # The Queen of Sheba deals well with Solomon and acts generously with him. # The Queen of Sheba, one from disbelievers, converts and devotes herself to tawhid. # The people of Thamud disregard the warnings of Salih; Lot is likewise rejected by his people. The disbelievers are thus destroyed for scheming. # Declaration of God's universality, omniscience, and omnipotence ‚Äì The Sura's phrasing condemns forgetting God's omnipotence. # Declaration of Abandonment of Disbelievers ‚Äì Prophet is to wash his hands of them. # Foretelling of Judgement (see Islamic view of the Last Judgment) and Indication of Signs. # Reiteration of Qur'an's purpose as a Warning.  Straight-forward interpretation  According to a chronological reading of the text, the Sura ends on a bold note of warning. This is a perfectly valid reading of the text. Tafsƒ´r al-JalƒÅlayn concurs with this reading, suggesting in reference to ayat 91-93 that the prophet's duty is only to warn; the powerful, imminent tone expressed supports the conclusion that the final point of the Sura is the focal point.  Ring structure  Another valid reading of the text utilizes ring structure (see Chiastic structure). Favored in prominent modern scholar of Qur'anic studies Carl Ernst's interpretations of certain middle to late Meccan period suras, it can be applied to Sura 27 as well. In ring structure, the focal point of the piece is found in the center, surrounded front and back by parallel statements. (Such parallel statements could elaborate on one another, contrast each other, or affirm one another. Multiple interpretations exist.) One could interpret Sura 27 as follows: * 1. Declaration of Qur'an * 10. Reiteration of Qur'an's purpose as a Warning. * 2. Moses's Signs are Ignored by Pharaoh * 9. Foretelling of Judgement and Indication of Signs. * 3. Solomon realizes God's blessings and dedicates himself as a Believer. * 4. The Queen of Sheba deals well with Solomon and acts generously with him. * 5. The Queen of Sheba, one from disbelievers, converts and devotes herself to tawhid. :Note: Combining the story of Solomon as a whole reveals allows one to view the story holistically as a motif for tawhid and the believers. * 6. The people of Thamud and of Lot reject their prophets and are destroyed. * 8.

In 1982, Forbes magazine estimated Ray Hunt's family's total net worth to be $200 million. Ray made a huge oil find in Yemen in 1984. It took two years for Hunt, partnering with other companies, to lay a pipeline and build a refinery for the oil. In 2006 Forbes estimated that Ray's family's net worth increased from $200 million to $4.6 billion. In September 2007, Hunt struck an oil deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government in the disputed territories of Ninewa near the Dohuk Governorate with an estimated value of $8 to $14.5 billion. The federal Iraqi Oil minister has denounced this deal as illegal, because under current Iraqi law only the central government is authorized to enter into contracts, though the Kurdistan Region believes it has a constitutional right to do so. The Kurds refuse to share details about the deal but insist that they will share profits. Likewise, Hunt Oil has refused to answer questions about the deal from US government officials who called for details when the deal became public. A U.S. Congressional committee concluded that George W. Bush administration officials knew that Hunt oil was planning to sign the oil deal with the regional Kurdistan Regional Government that ran counter to American policy and undercut Iraq's central government. The issue is still open and the State Department's Office of Inspector General is reviewing the issue. In November 2009, native Peruvians under the coalition of the Native Federation of the Rio Madre de Dios, (FENAMAD), issued an eviction notice to Ray Hunt and the Hunt Oil Company from the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve. In the letter FENAMAD wrote, \\"Having peacefully exhausted all protest, without receiving any answer, we hereby communicate to you that we have agreed to a fifteen-day period for you to definitively withdraw from the Amarakaeria Communal Reserve since you do not have the indigenous community's consent.\\" A press release issued by Amazon Watch stated that \\"The Reserve was first established in 2002 after years of indigenous petitioning to protect the rainforest area of the vast Madre de Dios and Karene watersheds and to provide protected zones for the Harakmbut indigenous peoples to live, fish, and hunt. The area in dispute, besides being a declared nature reserve, crosses the headwaters of several important river basins, and lies in the buffer zones of Manu and Bahuaja Sonene National Parks, two of the most biodiverse national parks in the world.\\" He is the former owner of the Southwest Media Corporation of Texas which published D Magazine, Houston City Magazine, Texas Homes and Sport Magazine.

He had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Natural horsemanship Hunt was widely regarded as one of the original proponents of what became known as natural horsemanship. His views about horse-human relations were embraced by inspirational writers about human relations. Lance Secretan wrote that \\"We may respect a leader, but the ones we love are servant-leaders.\\" pages 142-143 In the beginning, Hunt said,\\"I was working in the mind of a lot of people who didnt want to believe the horse had a mind.

While Dorrance avoided media attention and clinics, by the mid 1970s Hunt was giving clinics far and wide. Ray Hunt is famous for starting each clinic with the statement \\"I'm here for the horse, to help him get a better deal.\\" He also liked to say \\"make the wrong thing difficult and the right thing easy.\\" page 32 His philosophy has been interpreted as \\"If you get bucked off or kicked or bitten, you obviously did something wrong . . . The horse, on the other hand, is never wrong\\". The idea that \\"the horse is never wrong\\" is often misunderstood by people who think Ray was talking about the horse's behaviour, he was rather meaning the horse's reaction to human behaviour. The horse always interprets human actions in the moment, they don't think about the past or future in the way that people do. So, their reactions to what is happening in the moment is always pure, they reflect what the human did with the utmost integrity. If we want to change the horse, we should first change ourselves.

Autocars Co. Ltd. () of Haifa, Israel, was founded in 1957 as Israel's first car manufacturer (there was an earlier manufacturer who assembled American cars in Haifa bay, Kaiser-Frazer). Autocars Ltd made fiberglass-shelled cars that were made popular in Israel during the 1960s and 1970s, perhaps because government agencies were forced to buy them. This released onto the market thousands of low-priced second hand vehicles. Although their style and finish left something to be desired, Autocar's use of Ford and Triumph engines made them reliable cars which kept their value for years. The manufacturing of these cars ceased during the 1980s, and Israel's only remaining car making company today is AIL. Autocars manufactured its own car models under the Sabra (Hebrew: ◊¶◊ë◊®◊î) brand. The line included a station wagon, pick-up and the Sabra Sport, a sport car derived from Reliant;. From 1960, the sport model was produced under the Sabra brand, and the station wagon, sedan and pick-up models were produced under the Sussita brand name (Sussita (◊°◊ï◊°◊ô◊™◊ê), Sussita 12 and Sussita 13/60 models). Following an agreement with the Greek automotive manufacturer Attica, a small number of Sussita 12 sedans (Carmel) were produced in Greece. Apart from its own brand, Autocars also assembled other car manufacturers models, such as Reliant Rigal, and Triumph 1300 / 1500. These models were built using complete kits received from the brands owners.  Autocars Models (for the Israeli market)  Sussita (A.K.A \\"Cube\\") - manufactured from 1960 till 1966. 2 doors station wagon and pick-up versions. Designed with the help of the British Reliant company. The car was built using various Ford's parts, mainly the Ford Anglia engine. Carmel - manufactured from 1962 till 1964. A clone of the British three wheeler Reliant Regal, that was modified to have 4 wheels. The model had many problems, and was discontinued. The Carmel label was later given to next generations of the Sussita sedans. Sussita 12 - manufactured from 1964 till 1970. Body versions:2 doors station wagon, 2 doors sedan (A.K.A Carmel), 4 doors sedan (A.K.A Gilboa) and pick-up versions. Till 1968 the Sussita 12 used the Ford Anglia engines, where the Gilboa had an optional 1500cc Ford's engine. From 1968 to 1970 the station wagon and sedans (Carmel and Gilboa), used the Triumph Herald 12/50 engine. Sussita 13/60 - manufactured from 1970 till 1975. 2 doors station wagon, 2 doors sedan (A.K.A Carmel Ducas), and pick-up versions. 4 doors sedan was not produced. The Sussita 13/60 was built on the British Triumph Herald's chassis, and used the Herald 13/60 engine and gearbox. Autocars assembled several car models of other manufactures, using complete kits received from them. For example: Triumph 1300 / Triumph 1500 - British Triumph cars from kits in the late 1960s. The Triumph lineup included the Triumph 1300, although originally only with a 1500 engine as the 1300 was considered too close to the 1.3 litre Hino Contessa. Hino Contesa 900 / Hino Contesa 1300 - Assembled from original kits received from Hino Japan. The franchise, to assemble the Contessa, moved in 1969 from Eilin to Autocars, after the Israeli government forced the merger of the two companies. The contract was discontinued when Toyota had taken over Hino. Autocars went bankruptcy in 1970. Its assembly lines were bought by Rom Carmel Industries. Rom Carmel continued to manufacture the Sussita 13/60, till 1975. Rom Carmel manufactured their own models: Rom Carmel 1300, and Rom Carmel 1301, till 1980.  Sabra  Autocars Sabra The name \\"Sabra\\" was chosen because it means both \\"born in Israel\\" and cactus, which was its logo. In 1960, Yitzhak Shubinsky launched an Israeli-made car at the autoshow in New York City. It was a very small, underpowered pick-up truck. At the show Shubinsky realized that it was a futile attempt, and set forth on a new project. He bought the rights to use an Ashley body on a Leslie Ballamy chassis. He reached an agreement with Reliant (who had helped producing the \\"Carmel\\" and the \\"Sussita\\") to combine engine, body and chassis into a convertible sports-car. The engine was a Ford 1703 cc. Reliant was authorized to deliver the first 100 cars to the United States market. In 1961, at the New York Autoshow, the first Sabras were introduced. Reliant produced the first 100 cars. Their VIN-plates read \\"AUTOCARS COMPANY LIMITED HAIFA ISRAEL\\", though they were actually made in the United Kingdom. The rest of the cars were produced in Israel, but only 41 of those were exported to the USA. One of these was entered into the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1963 but did not finish due to a drive shaft failure. Between 1964‚Äì68, some 81 cars ‚Äì a quarter of the Israeli production ‚Äì were exported to Belgium. Production stopped with the Six-Day War. Orders already placed were honoured, but delivery was delayed until 1968‚Äì69. Worldwide, over 100 Sabra cars are still traceable, over twenty of them in Belgium. The Sabra can also be seen on a record cover of the Israeli band ◊¶◊û◊ì ◊ì◊®◊ï◊ù.  Folklore  A common Israeli folklore states that camels found the fibreglass used in the cars' body appetizing, and would often gnaw or eat away parts of the car, explaining why these cars are often seen with chunks missing from their exterior. Some consider this implausible, however, because of the tiny population of camels still found in Israel in the 1960s. However, these cars were routinely assigned to military officers, who often parked them in locations frequented by camels.

Girard was the author of nearly thirty books, with his writings spanning many academic domains. Although the reception of his work is different in each of these areas, there is a growing body of secondary literature on his work and his influence on disciplines such as literary criticism, critical theory, anthropology, theology, psychology, mythology, sociology, economics, cultural studies, and philosophy. Contribution to Philosophy Girard's main contribution to philosophy, and in turn to other disciplines, was in the field of epistemological and ethical systems of desire. Girard believed that human development occurs initially through a process of observational mimicry, where the infant develops desire through a process of learning to copy adult behaviour, fundamentally linking acquisition of identity, knowledge and material wealth to the development of a desire to have something others possess. All conflict, competition and rivalry therefore originate in mimetic desire (mimetic rivalry), which eventually reaches destructive stages of conflict both between individuals and social groups that requires them to blame someone or something in order to defuse conflict through the scapegoat mechanism. Unable to assume responsibility or engage in self-reflection to recognize their own part in the conflict, humans individually and cross-tribally unite, to defuse conflict, by murdering the king or whoever appears to have the least support in the conflict, and then recognizing when the person has died how much less stress they have, and the unification leads to them eventually thinking of the deposed dead king as a god, i.e. deification or sanctification. Or, guilt is ascribed to an innocent third-party, whose murder permits the creation of a common unifying mythological underlay necessary for the foundation of human culture. For Girard, religion and mythology were therefore necessary steps in human evolution to control the violence that arises from mimetic rivalry and unequal distribution of desirable things. Religion directed the scapegoat impulse on imaginary concepts, such as Satan or demons, the absence of which would see an increase in human conflict, according to Girard. His ideas ran sharply contrary to the post-modernism in vogue through most of his life, and his views of human nature were pessimistic in contrast with the mainstream currents of his time. Girard saw religion as an essential instrument of cohesion, believing that the primary purpose of sacred texts was to end the practice of human sacrifice through ritualistically surrogating for the behaviour triggered by scapegoat mechanism, adopting and expanding many of Nietzsche's ideas. Girard was professor at Johns Hopkins University from 1957 to 1981, and subsequently at Stanford University where he was named special fellow of the Hoover Institution, a conservative think-tank based at Stanford. For his contributions, in 2005 Rene Girard was named as one of the 40 \\"Les immortals\\" members of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. \\"There are many features of Girard‚Äôs theory that can be criticised,\\" the philosopher Roger Scruton comments on the legacy of his work:  Early life and career  Girard was born in Avignon on 25 December 1923. He studied medieval history at the √âcole des Chartes, Paris, where the subject of his thesis was \\"Private life in Avignon in the second half of the fifteenth century\\" (\\"\\").An excerpt from this thesis was reprinted in the Ren√© Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne (2008). In 1947, Girard went to Indiana University on a one-year fellowship. He was to spend most of his career in the United States. He received his PhD in 1950 and stayed at Indiana University until 1953. The subject of his PhD at Indiana University was \\"American Opinion of France, 1940‚Äì1943\\". Although his research was in history, he was also assigned to teach French literature, the field in which he would first make his reputation as a literary critic by publishing influential essays on such authors as Albert Camus and Marcel Proust. Girard occupied positions at Duke University and Bryn Mawr College from 1953 to 1957, after which he moved to Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where he became a full professor in 1961. In that year, he also published his first book: (Deceit, Desire and the Novel, 1966). For several years, he moved back and forth between the State University of New York at Buffalo and Johns Hopkins University. Books he published in this period include (1972; Violence and the Sacred, 1977) and (1978; Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, 1987). In 1981, Girard became Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization at Stanford University, where he stayed until his retirement in 1995. During this period, he published (1982), (1985), A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare (1991) and (1994). In 1985, he received his first honorary degree from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands; several others followed. In 1990, a group of scholars founded the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&R;) with a goal to \\"explore, criticize, and develop the mimetic model of the relationship between violence and religion in the genesis and maintenance of culture.\\"'The rationale for and goals of \\"The Bulletin of the Colloquium on Violence & Religion\\"' COV&R-Bulletin; No. 1 (September 1991)\\"Constitution and By-Laws of the Colloquium on Violence and Religion\\" COV&R-Bulletin; No. 6 (March 1994) This organization organizes a yearly conference devoted to topics related to mimetic theory, scapegoating, violence, and religion. Girard was Honorary Chair of COV&R.; Co-founder and first president of the COV&R; was the Roman Catholic theologian Raymund Schwager. Ren√© Girard's work has inspired interdisciplinary research projects and experimental research such as the Mimetic Theory project sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation.. On 17 March 2005, Girard was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. On 4 November 2015, he died at his residence in Stanford, California, following a long illness. Girard's thought= Mimetic desire  After almost a decade of teaching French literature in the United States, Girard began to develop a new way of speaking about literary texts. Beyond the \\"uniqueness\\" of individual works, he looked for their common structural properties, having observed that characters in great fiction evolved in a system of relationships otherwise common to the wider generality of novels. But there was a distinction to be made: So there did indeed exist \\"psychological laws\\" as Proust calls them.For example in Time Regained (, volume 7 of Remembrance of Things Past): \\"It is the feeling for the general in the potential writer, which selects material suitable to a work of art because of its generality. He only pays attention to others, however dull and tiresome, because in repeating what their kind say like parrots, they are for that very reason prophetic birds, spokesmen of a psychological law.\\" In French: \\"....\\" These laws and this system are the consequences of a fundamental reality grasped by the novelists, which Girard called mimetic desire, \\"the mimetic character of desire.\\" This is the content of his first book, Deceit, Desire and the Novel (1961). We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous, our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another person‚Äîthe model‚Äîfor this same object. This means that the relationship between the subject and the object is not direct: there is always a triangular relationship of subject, model, and object. Through the object, one is drawn to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator: it is in fact the model who is sought. Girard calls desire \\"metaphysical\\" in the measure that, as soon as a desire is something more than a simple need or appetite, \\"all desire is a desire to be\\", it is an aspiration, the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator. Mediation is external when the mediator of the desire is socially beyond the reach of the subject or, for example, a fictional character, as in the case of Amadis de Gaula and Don Quixote. The hero lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic. Mediation is internal when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as the rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky, which are particularly studied in this book. Through their characters, our own behaviour is displayed. Everyone holds firmly to the illusion of the authenticity of one's own desires; the novelists implacably expose all the diversity of lies, dissimulations, maneuvers, and the snobbery of the Proustian heroes; these are all but \\"tricks of desire\\", which prevent one from facing the truth: envy and jealousy. These characters, desiring the being of the mediator, project upon him superhuman virtues while at the same time depreciating themselves, making him a god while making themselves slaves, in the measure that the mediator is an obstacle to them. Some, pursuing this logic, come to seek the failures that are the signs of the proximity of the ideal to which they aspire. This can manifest as a heightened experience of the universal pseudo-masochism inherent in seeking the unattainable, which can, of course, turn into sadism should the actor play this part in reverse. This fundamental focus on mimetic desire would be pursued by Girard throughout the rest of his career. The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories, but today there is independent support for his claims coming from empirical research in psychology and neuroscience (see below). Farneti (2013) also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts, using the case study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girard's theory. He posits that intensified conflict is a product of the imitative behaviors of Israelis and Palestinians, entitling them \\"Siamese twins\\".Roberto Farneti, Mimetic politics (Michigan State University Press 2015), pp. 34-38, 58-65, 69-71. The idea that desire to possess endless material wealth was harmful to society was not new. From the New Testament verses about the love of money being the root of all evil, to Hegelian and Marxist critique that saw material wealth and capital as the mechanism of alienation of the human being both from their own humanity and their community, to Bertrand Russell's famous speech on accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, desire has been understood as a destructive force in all of literature - with the theft of Helen by Paris a frequent topic of discussion by Girard. What Girard contributed to this concept is the idea that what is desired fundamentally is not the object itself, but the ontological state of the subject which possesses it, where mimicry is the aim of the competition. What Paris wanted, then, was not Helen, but to be a great king like Agamemnon. A person who desires seeks to be like the subject he imitates, through the medium of object that is possessed by the person he immitates. Girard writes: This was, and remains, a pessimistic view of human life, as it posits a paradox in the very act of seeking to unify and have peace, since the erasure of differences between people through mimicry is what creates conflict, not the differentiation itself.  Fundamental anthropology  Since the mimetic rivalry that develops from the struggle for the possession of the objects is contagious, it leads to the threat of violence. Girard himself says, \\"If there is a normal order in societies, it must be the fruit of an anterior crisis.\\" Turning his interest towards the anthropological domain, Girard began to study anthropological literature and proposed his second great hypothesis: the scapegoat mechanism, which is at the origin of archaic religion and which he sets forth in his second book Violence and the Sacred (1972), a work on fundamental anthropology.Thomas Ryba (ed.), Ren√© Girard and Creative Reconciliation, Lexington Books, 2014, p. 19. If two individuals desire the same thing, there will soon be a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At this stage of the crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually over the course of the repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence. Although explorers and anthropologists have not been able to witness events similar to these, which go back to the earliest times, indirect evidence for them abounds, such as the universality of ritual sacrifice and the innumerable myths that have been collected from the most varied peoples. If Girard's theory is true, then we will find in myths the culpability of the victim-god, depictions of the selection of the victim, and his power to beget the order that governs the group. Girard found these elements in numerous myths, beginning with that of Oedipus which he analyzed in this and later books. On this question he opposes Claude L√©vi-Strauss. The phrase \\"scapegoat mechanism\\" was not coined by Girard himself; it had been used earlier by Kenneth Burke in Permanence and Change (1935) and A Grammar of Motives (1940). However, Girard took this concept from Burke and developed it much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture. In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978), Girard develops the implications of this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions. The social position of king, for instance, begins as the victim of the scapegoat mechanism, though his sacrifice is deferred and he becomes responsible for the wellbeing of the whole society. According to Girard, just as the theory of natural selection of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life, the victimization process is the rational principle that explains the origin of the infinite diversity of cultural forms. The analogy with Charles Darwin also extends to the scientific status of the theory, as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally, given the extreme amounts of time necessary for the production of the phenomena in question, but which imposes itself by its great explanatory power.  Origin of language  According to Girard, the origin of language is also related to scapegoating. After the first victim, after the murder of the first scapegoat, there were the first prohibitions and rituals, but these came into being before representation and language, hence before culture. And that means that \\"people\\" (perhaps not human beings) \\"will not start fighting again.\\" Girard says: According to Girard, the substitution of an immolated victim for the first, is \\"the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids.\\". Girard also says this is the first time that one thing represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one. This substitution is the beginning of representation and language, but also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: \\"It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, how should I say, from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation.\\" Unlike Eric Gans, Girard does not think that there is an original scene during which there is \\"a sudden shift from non- representation to representation,\\". or a sudden shift from animality to humanity. According to the French sociologist Camille Tarot, it is hard to understand how the process of representation (symbolicity, language...) actually occurs and he has called this a black box in Girard's theory.. Girard also says:  Judeo-Christian scriptures  Biblical text as a science of man = In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, Girard discusses for the first time Christianity and the Bible. The Gospels ostensibly present themselves as a typical mythical account, with a victim-god lynched by a unanimous crowd, an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice ‚Äî a material re-presentation in this case ‚Äî in the Eucharist. The parallel is perfect except for one detail: the truth of the innocence of the victim is proclaimed by the text and the writer. The mythical account is usually built on the lie of the guilt of the victim in as much as it is an account of the event seen from the viewpoint of the anonymous lynchers. This ignorance is indispensable to the efficacy of the sacrificial violence. The evangelical \\"good news\\" clearly affirms the innocence of the victim, thus becoming, by attacking ignorance, the germ of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which rests the equilibrium of societies. Already the Old Testament shows this turning inside-out of the mythic accounts with regard to the innocence of the victims (Abel, Joseph, Job‚Ä¶), and the Hebrews were conscious of the uniqueness of their religious tradition. Girard draws special attention to passages in the book of Isaiah, which describe the suffering of the Servant of Yahweh at the hands of the entire community, and which emphasize his innocence (Isaiah 53, 2-9). > By oppression and judgement he was taken away; And as for his generation, > who considered That he was cut off from out of the land of the living, > Stricken for the transgression of my people? And they made his grave with > the wicked And with a rich man in his death, Although he had done no > violence, And there was no deceit in his mouth. (Isaiah 53, 8-9) With the Gospels, it is with full clarity that are unveiled these \\"things hidden since the foundation of the world\\" (Matthew 13:35), the foundation of social order on murder, described in all its repulsive ugliness in the account of the Passion. This revelation is even clearer because the text is a work on desire and violence, from the serpent setting alight the desire of Eve in paradise to the prodigious strength of the mimetism that brings about the denial of Peter during the Passion (Mark 14: 66‚Äì72; Luke 22:54‚Äì62). Girard reinterprets certain biblical expressions in light of his theories; for instance, he sees \\"scandal\\" (skandalon, literally, a \\"snare\\", or an \\"impediment placed in the way and causing one to stumble or fall\\".) as signifying mimetic rivalry, as in Peter's denial of Jesus.. No one escapes responsibility, neither the envious nor the envied: \\"Woe to the man through whom scandal comes\\" (Matthew 18:7). = Christian society = The evangelical revelation contains the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it put an end to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, since in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole. Does the retreat of the sacrificial order mean less violence? Not at all; rather, it deprives modern societies of most of the capacity of sacrificial violence to establish temporary order. The \\"innocence\\" of the time of the ignorance is no more. On the other hand, Christianity, following the example of Judaism, has desacralized the world, making possible a utilitarian relationship with nature. Increasingly threatened by the resurgence of mimetic crises on a grand scale, the contemporary world is on one hand more quickly caught up by its guilt, and on the other hand has developed such a great technical power of destruction that it is condemned to both more and more responsibility and less and less innocence. So, for example, while empathy for victims manifests progress in the moral conscience of society, it nonetheless also takes the form of a competition among victims that threatens an escalation of violence. Girard is critical of the optimism of humanist observers, who believe in the natural goodness of man and the progressive improvement of his historical conditions (views themselves based in a misunderstanding of the Christian revelation). Rather, the current nuclear stalemate between the great powers reveals that man's capacity for violence is greater than ever before, and peace is only a product of this possibility to unleash apocalyptic destruction.  Influence = Psychology and neuroscience  Jean-Michel Oughourlian in his book A mime named desire (Un mime nomm√© d√©sir - Grasset 1982) has used Girard's theories in psychopathology. Hysteria and obsession are explained through mimetic rivalry and the priority of desire. Girard's work is also attracting increasing interest from empirical researchers investigating human imitation (among them Andrew Meltzoff and Vittorio Gallese). Recently, empirical studies into the mechanism of desire have suggested some intriguing correlations with Girard's theory on the subject. For instance, clinical psychologist Scott R. Garrels wrote: Economics and globalization The mimetic theory has also been applied in the study of economics, most notably in (1982) by Michel Aglietta and Andr√© Orl√©an. Orl√©an was also a contributor to the volume Ren√© Girard in Les cahiers de l'Herne (\\"\\").. According to the philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg: In an interview with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the Ren√© Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orl√©an (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: \\"Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him to do the same for you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity.\\". Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development‚Äî\\"economic rationality\\"‚Äîis required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by \\"economic rationality.\\" This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing. Literature Girard's influence extends beyond philosophy and social science, and includes the literary realm. A prominent example of a fiction writer influenced by Girard is J. M. Coetzee, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. Critics have noted that mimetic desire and scapegoating are recurring themes in Coetzee's novels Elizabeth Costello and Disgrace. In the latter work, the book's protagonist also gives a speech about the history of scapegoating with noticeable similarities to Girard's view of the same subject. Coetzee has also frequently cited Girard in his non-fiction essays, on subjects ranging from advertising to the Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.Andy Lamey, \\"Sympathy and Scapegoating in J. M. Coetzee,\\" in J. M. Coetzee and Ethics: Philosophical Perspectives on Literature, Anton Leist and Peter Singer eds. (New York: Columbia University Press 2010). For Girard's influence on Coetzee, see pages 181-5. Theology Theologians who describe themselves as indebted to Girard include James Alison (who focuses on mimetic desire's implications for the doctrine of original sin), Raymund Schwager (who builds a dramatic narrative around both the scapegoat mechanism and the theo-drama of fellow Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar), and Bishop Robert Barron (who has remarked that Girard will be appreciated as a 21st-Century Church Father in the future.)  Criticism = Originality  Some critics have pointed out that while Girard may be the first to have suggested that all desire is mimetic, he is by no means the first to have noticed that some desire is mimetic ‚Äì Gabriel Tarde's book Les lois de l'imitation (The Laws of Imitation) appeared in 1890. Building on Tarde, crowd psychology, Nietzsche, and more generally on a modernist tradition of the \\"mimetic unconscious\\" that had hypnosis as its via regia, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that for the modernists not only desire but all affects turn out to be contagious and mimetic.Nidesh Lawtoo, The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious, East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2013. Ren√© PommierRen√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare, Paris: Kim√©, 2010, p. 42 mentions La Rochefoucauld, a seventeenth-century thinker who already wrote that \\"Nothing is so infectious as example\\" and that \\"There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of.\\"La Rochefoucauld, \\"Maxims,\\" maxims 230, 136. St√©phane Vinolo sees Baruch Spinoza and Thomas Hobbes as important precursors. Hobbes: \\"if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies.\\"Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, I,13, World's classic, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 83. Quoted by S.Vinolo in S.Vinolo , pp. 33‚Äì34 Spinoza: \\"By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is like ourselves, and which we have not regarded with any emotion, to be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion. Part. III Prop. XXVII : \\"\\" quoted by St√©phane Vinolo, , L'Harmattan, Paris, 2005, p. 20 . English translation H. M. Elwes's 1883 English translation The Ethics ‚Äì Part III On the Origin and Nature of the Emotions Proof‚Ä¶ If we conceive anyone similar to ourselves as affected by any emotion, this conception will express a modification of our body similar to that emotion.\\"H. M. Elwes's 1883 English translation The Ethics ‚Äì Part III On the Origin and Nature of the Emotions. Wolfgang Palaver (de) adds Alexis de Tocqueville to the list. \\"Two hundred years after Hobbes, the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville mentioned the dangers coming along with equality, too. Like Hobbes, he refers to the increase of mimetic desire coming along with equality.\\"Wolfgang Palaver: Traduit de l'anglais par Paul Dumouchel. In Paul Dumouchel (Directeur), Paris: L'Harmattan, 2000, pp. 89‚Äì110. English version Palaver has in mind passages like this one, from Tocqueville's Democracy in America: \\"They have swept away the privileges of some of their fellow creatures which stood in their way, but they have opened the door to universal competition; the barrier has changed its shape rather than its position.\\" Maurizio Meloni highlights the similarities between Girard, Jacques Lacan and Sigmund Freud.M Meloni: A Triangle of Thoughts: Girard, Freud, Lacan, Psychomedia Meloni claims that these similarities arise because the projects undertaken by the three men‚Äînamely, to understand the role of mythology in structuring the human psyche and culture‚Äîwere very similar. What is more, both Girard and Lacan read these myths through the lens of structural anthropology so it is not surprising that their intellectual systems came to resemble one another so strongly. Meloni writes that Girard and Lacan were \\"moved by similar preoccupations and are fascinated by and attracted to the same kind of issues: the constituent character of the other in the structure of desire, the role of jealousy and rivalry in the construction of the social bond, the proliferation of triangles within apparently dual relations, doubles and mirrors, imitation and the Imaginary, and the crisis of modern society within which the 'rite of Oedipus' is situated.\\" At times, Girard acknowledges his indebtedness to such precursors, including Tocqueville.Ren√© Girard. 1965. Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure Translated by Y. Freccero, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1965 p. 120 At other times, however, Girard makes stronger claims to originality, as when he says that mimetic rivalry \\"is responsible for the frequency and intensity of human conflicts, but strangely, no one ever speaks of it.\\"Ren√© Girard. 2001. Celui par qui le scandale arrive: Entretiens avec Maria Stella Barberi. Paris: Descl√©e de Brouwer. p. 19: \\"D√®s que nous d√©sirons ce que d√©sire un mod√®le assez proche de nous dans le temps et dans l'espace, pour que l'objet convoit√© par lui passe √† notre port√©e, nous nous effor√ßons de lui enlever cet objet  et la rivalit√© entre lui et nous est in√©vitable. C'est la rivalit√© mim√©tique. Elle peut atteindre un niveau d'intensit√© extraordinaire. Elle est responsable de la fr√©quence et de l'intensit√© des conflits humains, mais chose √©trange, personne ne parle jamais d'elle.\\"  Use of evidence  Girard has presented his view as being scientifically grounded: \\"Our theory should be approached, then, as one approaches any scientific hypothesis.\\"Ren√© Girard, Violence and the Sacred, translated by Patrick Gregory, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977, p. 316. Ren√© Pommier has written a book about Girard with the ironic title Girard Ablaze Rather Than Enlightened in which he asserts that Girard's readings of myths and Bible stories‚Äîthe basis of some of his most important claims‚Äîare often tendentious. Girard notes, for example, that the disciples actively turn against Jesus.Ren√© Girard, Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987, p. 167. Since Peter warms himself by a fire, and fires always create community, and communities breed mimetic desire, this means that Peter becomes actively hostile to Jesus, seeking his death.Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, pp. 98-102. According to Pommier, Girard claims that the Gospels present the Crucifixion as a purely human affair, with no indication of Christ dying for the sins of mankind, a claim contradicted by Mark 10:45, Matthew 20:28.Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, pp. 115-16. The same goes for readings of literary texts, says Pommier. For example, Moli√®re's Don Juan only pursues one love object for mediated reasons,Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, p. 25. not all of them, as Girard claims.Ren√© Girard. 1965. Deceit, Desire and the Novel: Self and Other in Literary Structure Translated by Y. Freccero, The Johns Hopkins University Press,Baltimore, 1965 p. 51 Or again, Sancho Panza wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote, but because he has been promised one.Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, p. 27. And Pavel Pavlovitch, in Dostoevsky's Eternal Husband, has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, p. 45. Accordingly, a number of scholars have suggested that Girard's writings are metaphysics rather than science. Theorist of history Hayden White did so in an article titled \\"Ethnological 'Lie' and Mystical 'Truth'\\";Hayden White, \\"Ethnological 'Lie' and Mythical 'Truth'\\", Diacritics 8 (1978): 2-9, p. 7. Belgian anthropologist Luc de Heusch made a similar claim in his piece \\"\\" (\\"The Gospel according to Saint Girard\\");Luc de Heusch: \\"L'Evangile selon Saint-Girard\\" Le Monde, 25 June 1982, p. 19. and Jean Greisch sees Girard's thought as more or less a kind of Gnosis.Jean Greisch \\"\\" in Paris, Beauchesne, 1981.  Non-mimetic desires  Ren√© Pommier has pointed out a number of problems with the Girardian claim that all desire is mimetic. First, it is very hard to explain the existence of taboo desires, such as homosexuality in repressive societies, on that basis.Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, p. 38. In Girard's defence on the other hand, Jean-Michel Oughourlian exemplifies the situation by noting that \\"one homosexual admitted to me that he just wanted to be somebody else.\\" Second, every situation presents large numbers of potential mediators, which means that the individual has to make a choice among them; either authentic choice is possible, then, or else the theory leads to a regress.Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, pp. 33-34. Third, Girard leaves no room for innovation: Surely somebody has to be the first to desire a new object, even if everyone else follows that trend-setter.Ren√© Pommier, \\"Ren√© Girard, Un allum√© qui se prend pour un phare,\\" Paris: Kim√©, 2010, p. 18. It is not clear that the first objection really provides a challenge to Girard's theory, as even in repressive societies men are still desired (albeit by women). However, such a response leaves unexplained why homosexuals would imitate the desires of heterosexual members of the opposite sex.Ren√© Girard's philosophy of romance is compared with Plato‚Äôs, Iain King's, and Arthur Schopenhauer‚Äôs in When Romance and Philosophy Meet (link to blog) retrieved 2013-12-02. One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow, which Girard clearly affirms. However, original sin, according to Girard's interpretation, explains only our propensity to imitate, not the specific content of our imitated desires.Girard, Ren√© [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Iep.utm.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-23. Thus, the doctrine of original sin does not solve the problem of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.  Beneficial imitation  In the early part of Girard's career, there seemed no place for beneficial imitation. Jean- Michel Oughourlian objected that \\"imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don't believe that I am the other, I don't want to take his place. ‚Ä¶This imitation can lead me to become sensitive to social and political problems.\\"Jean-Michel Oughourlian: Gen√®se du d√©sir. Paris: Carnets Nord, 2007, . The French sentence goes: \\"L'imitation peut alors demeurer enti√®rement paisible et b√©n√©fique; je ne me prends pas pour l'autre, je ne veux pas prendre sa place [‚Ä¶] Cette imitation [‚Ä¶] me conduira peut-√™tre √† me sensibiliser aux probl√®mes sociaux et politiques‚Ä¶ Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard's theories fixated on violence, he was creating a \\"scapegoat\\" himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis. Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard's theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis. More recently, Girard has made room for positive imitation.Ren√© Girard, The Girard Reader, Trans. Yvonne Freccero, Ed. James G. Williams, New York: Crossroad Herder, 1996, pp. 63‚Äì64, 269. But as Adams implies, it is not clear how the revised theory accords with earlier claims about the origin of culture. If beneficial imitation is possible, then it is no longer necessary for cultures to be born by means of scapegoating; they could just as well be born through healthy emulation. Nidesh Lawtoo further develops the healthy side of mimetic contagion by drawing on a Nietzschean philosophical tradition that privileges \\"laughter\\" and other gay forms of \\"sovereign communication\\" in the formation of \\"community.\\"Nidesh Lawtoo. The Phantom of the Ego: Modernism and the Mimetic Unconscious. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2007, pp. 284-304  Anthropology  Various anthropologists have contested Girard's claims. Elizabeth Traube, for example, reminds us that there are other ways of making sense of the data that Girard borrows from Evans-Pritchard and company‚Äîways that are more consistent with the practices of the given culture. By applying a one-size-fits-all approach, Girard \\"loses ‚Ä¶ the ability to tell us anything about cultural products themselves, for the simple reason that he has annihilated the cultures which produced them.\\"Elizabeth Traube, \\"Incest and Mythology: Anthropological and Girardian Perspectives, \\" The Berkshire Review 14 (1979): 37‚Äì54, pp. 49‚Äì50)  Religion  One of the main sources of criticism of Girard's work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-√†-vis other religions leaves something to be desired.E.g. see the criticisms in Violence and Truth: On the Work of Ren√© Girard, Paul Dumouchel ed., Stanford University Press, 1988 There are also those who find the interpretation of the Christ event‚Äîas a purely human event, having nothing to do with redemption from sin‚Äîan unconvincing one, given what the Gospels themselves say. Yet, Roger Scruton notes, Girard's account has a divine Jesus: \\"that Jesus was the first scapegoat to understand the need for his death and to forgive those who inflicted it ‚Ä¶ Girard argues, Jesus gave the best evidence ‚Ä¶ of his divine nature.\\"  Honours and awards  * Honorary degrees at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (the Netherlands, 1985), UFSIA in Antwerp (Belgium, 1995), the Universit√† degli Studi di Padova (Italy, 2001, honorary degree in \\"Arts\\"),: Honoris causa degrees the faculty of theology at the University of Innsbruck (Austria), the Universit√© de Montr√©al (Canada, 2004),Marie-Claude Bourdon: iForum vol. 38 num. 28 (19 April 2004) and the University of St Andrews (UK, 2008)University of St Andrews: Honorary degrees - June 2008. * The Prix M√©dicis essai for Shakespeare, les feux de l'envie (A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare, 1991) * The prix Aujourd'hui for Les origines de la culture (2004) * Guggenheim Fellow (1959 and 1966)John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation: Fellows page: G * Election to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise (2005) * Awarded the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize by the University of T√ºbingen (2006) * Awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic, Commander by Number, by the Spanish head of state, H.M.

First announced by UNESCO on 17 November 1999, it was formally recognized by the United Nations General Assembly with the adoption of UN resolution 56/262 Multilingualism in 2002. Mother Language Day is part of a broader initiative \\"to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by peoples of the world\\" as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 May 2007 in UN resolution 61/266, which also established 2008 as the International Year of Languages. The idea to celebrate International Mother Language Day was the initiative of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh 21 February is the anniversary of the day when Bangladeshis fought for recognition for the Bangla language.  History  Procession march held on 21 February 1952 in Dhaka 21 February was declared to be the International Mother Language Day by UNESCO in 1999. It has been observed throughout the world since 21 February 2000. The declaration came up in tribute to the Language Movement done by the Bangladeshis (then the East Pakistanis). When Pakistan was created in 1947, it had two geographically separate parts: East Pakistan (currently known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (currently known as Pakistan). The two parts were very different to each other in sense of culture, language, etc. The two parts were also separated by India in between. In 1948, the then Government of Pakistan declared Urdu to be the sole national language of Pakistan even though Bengali or Bangla was spoken by the majority of people combining East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (now Pakistan) The East Pakistan people protested, since the majority of the population was from East Pakistan and their mother language was Bangla. They demanded Bangla to be at least one of the national languages, in addition to Urdu. The demand was raised first by Dhirendranath Datta from East Pakistan on 23 February 1948, in the constituent Assembly of Pakistan. To demolish the protest, the government of Pakistan outlawed public meeting and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka, with the support of the general public, arranged massive rallies and meetings. On 21 February 1952, police opened fire on rallies. Salam, Barkat, Rafiq, Jabbar and Shafiur died, with hundreds of others injured. This is a rare incident in history, where people sacrificed their lives for their mother tongue. Since then Bangladeshis celebrate the International Mother Language Day as one of their tragic days. They visit the Shaheed Minar, a monument built in memory of the martyrs and its replicas to express their deep sorrow, respect and gratefulness to them. International Mother Language Day is a national holiday in Bangladesh. The resolution was suggested by Rafiqul Islam and Abdus Salam, Bengalis living in Vancouver, Canada. They wrote a letter to Kofi Annan on 9 January 1998 asking him to take a step for saving the world's languages from extinction by declaring an International Mother Language Day. Rafiq proposed the date as 21 February to commemorate the 1952 killings in Dhaka during the Language Movement. Rafiqul Islam's proposal was introduced in the Bangladesh parliament and in due course (at the behest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina) a formal proposal was submitted to UNESCO by the Government of Bangladesh. The process of shepherding the proposal through UNESCO's regulatory system was undertaken by Syed Muazzem Ali, then Bangladesh ambassador to France and Permanent Representative to UNESCO, and Tozammel Tony Huq, his predecessor, who was then a Special Adviser to UNESCO Secretary General Federico Mayor. Finally on 17 November 1999 the 30th General Assembly of UNESCO unanimously resolved that \\"21st February be proclaimed International Mother Language Day throughout the world to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives on this very day in 1952.\\"Roger Gwynn, Tony: the Life of Tozammel Huq MBE, Acre Press, 2019  Timeline  Dedication of the International Mother Language Day Monument in Ashfield Park, Sydney, February 19, 2006 Commemorating IMLD in Canada * 1952: Bengali Language Movement * 1955: Language Movement Day first observed in Bangladesh * 1999: UNESCO proclaims 21 February (Ekushey February) as International Mother Language Day * 2000: Inaugural celebration of International Mother Language Day * 2002: Linguistic-diversity theme, featuring 3,000 endangered languages (motto: In the galaxy of languages, every word is a star.) * 2004: Children-learning theme; the UNESCO observance included \\"a unique exhibition of children‚Äôs exercise books from around the world illustrating the process by which children learn and master the use of written literacy skills in the classroom\\". * 2005: Braille and sign languages * 2006: Languages and cyberspace * 2007: Multilingual education * 2008: International Year of Languages * 2010: International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures * 2011: Information and communication technologies * 2012: Mother-tongue instruction and inclusive education * 2013: Books for mother-tongue education * 2014: Local languages for global citizenship: spotlight on science * 2015: Inclusion in and through education: language counts (with an event in Paris) * 2016: Quality education, language(s) of instruction and learning outcomes * 2017: Sustainable futures through multilingual education * 2018: Our languages, our assets. * 2019: International Year of Indigenous Languages2019 - International Year of Indigenous Languages UNESCO * 2020: Safeguarding linguistic diversity  Observances  UNESCO chooses a theme for each International Mother Language Day, and sponsors related events at its Paris headquarters.

He was one of the earliest composers of the ricercar, the predecessor to the fugue, and he was also a skilled composer of chansons. Life Buus was probably born in Ghent around 1500, though details of his early life, as is the case with most Renaissance composers, are scanty. Possibly he either studied or had his early career in France, and he maintained some connections there throughout his life. In 1538 he published his first chansons, in Lyon by the printer Jacques Moderne. Three years later he went to Venice and auditioned for the post of second organist at St. Mark's, winning the job, and working alongside the existing organist, Frate Giovanni Armonio. This was during the tenure of Adrian Willaert, who built the musical forces at St. Mark's into one of the most impressive in Europe, second only in quality to the papal chapel in Rome. Buus stayed at St. Mark's until 1550, when he departed for France, ostensibly because he was unable to pay his debts; however it has been suggested that he left because he had become a Protestant. In 1543 he had dedicated a volume of chansons to the Calvinist Duchess of Ferrara, and in 1550 he sent a book of Protestant chansons spirituelles to the Protestant Archduke Ferdinand II in Vienna. Late in 1550 he went to Vienna to work at the Habsburg court, and he remained there for the rest of his life, ignoring entreaties from Venice to return. Music and influence Buus was influential in the development of the instrumental ricercar; he wrote the longest ever composed, one of which has no less than 98 points of imitation. Another has 358 breves (equivalent to 716 bars of 4/4; at the typical tactus of the time - 60 to 80 minims, i.e. half-notes, to the minute - the piece would take 15-20 minutes to play). They are elaborately contrapuntal, making use of all the standard devices of Franco-Flemish polyphony, including augmentation, diminution, inversion, and so forth. He also wrote sacred vocal music, including motets and chansons spirituelles, a specifically Protestant form, although these were not for performance in Catholic Venice. The motets are similar in style to those of Nicolas Gombert, with dense textures, pervasive imitation, and free treatment of the source material.

It contains butalbital, a barbiturate and paracetamol (acetaminophen), an analgesic. Versions also containing caffeine are sold under the brand name Fioricet among others. It is taken by mouth. The combination is also sold with codeine. The most common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, trouble breathing, and abdominal pain. Other severe side effects may include liver problems, confusion, addiction, and allergic reactions. Frequent use may result in medication overuse headache. Barbiturate withdrawal may occur if rapidly stopped following long term use. Use is not generally recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 187th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. In the United States it is a schedule III controlled substance in some states but not federally. It is banned in a number of European countries. Medical uses Butalbital/acetaminophen is indicated for the treatment of tension headaches. It is also commonly prescribed for migraines, although it is not approved by the FDA for this. The usual adult dose is one to two tablets every four hours as needed, not to exceed six tablets in a twenty-four-hour period. Side effects Commonly reported side effects include euphoria, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness or sedation, intoxication, nausea, vomiting, dependence, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Prolonged use can cause rebound headaches.A Hidden Cause of Headache Pain - New York Times Rarely, use of barbiturates can lead to Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome. Overdose Butalbital exerts its toxicity through excessive sedation, resulting in respiratory depression and ultimately death via hypoxia. Nonlethal overdoses may also result in coma and death. There is no specific antidote to barbiturate overdose; treatment is supportive, generally including the administration of intravenous saline, naloxone, thiamine, glucose, sodium bicarbonate to alkalize the urine and increase rate of excretion, and activated charcoal via nasogastric tube. Acetaminophen exerts its toxicity through the production of a toxic metabolite that can cause liver damage at doses as low as four grams. Larger doses can precipitate acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, or gastrointestinal bleeding; death has been known to occur with ingestion of ten to fifteen grams. The specific antidote to acetaminophen overdose is N-acetylcysteine. Mechanism of action Butalbital exerts a generalized depressant effect on the central nervous system and, in very high doses, has peripheral effects. Acetaminophen has analgesic and antipyretic effects mediated by a metabolite that acts at cannabinoid receptors. Caffeine is thought to produce constriction of cerebral blood vessels and serves to counteract the sedative effect of butalbital. Butalbital has a half-life of about 35 hours. Acetaminophen has a half-life of about 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver damage and after an overdose. Caffeine has a half- life of about 2.5 to 4.5 hours. Formulation Fiorcet historically contained 50 mg of butalbital, 40 mg of caffeine, and 325 mg of acetaminophen per dose. However, in accordance with FDA guidelines advising manufacturers to limit doses of acetaminophen in prescription drugs, the acetaminophen content was lowered to 300 mg as of 2014. Fioricet is also available in a formulation containing 30 mg of codeine per dose.

He was born in Bethnal Green, London, the youngest in a Jewish family with ten children; his parents had left Russia many years before he was born. He appeared in a variety of stage, film, television and radio productions throughout his career. Early life After leaving primary school in Bethnal Green at the age of 14, he worked as a tailor's apprentice, a messenger boy and a shop-window display fitter, before taking to the stage. Stage career Bass's acting career began at Unity Theatre, London in the late 1930s, appearing in Plant in the Sun alongside Paul Robeson, and as the pantomime King in Babes In the Wood. After the outbreak of the Second World War, Bass joined the Middlesex Regiment as a despatch rider. Despite being kept busy with his duties, he found time to become involved in concert parties, as well as taking part in documentaries for the Army Film Unit. His stage career included plays by Shakespeare and Shaw. During the 1950s he continued to direct shows at Unity, and on one occasion appeared in court (along with Vida Hope) charged with putting on a play without a licence.Colin Chambers The Story of Unity Theatre, London (1990) His stage work also included an adaptation of Gogol's short story \\"The Bespoke Overcoat\\", transposed to the East End of London, which was filmed by Jack Clayton in 1956, and won the Oscar for best short. Bass also took over from Chaim Topol in the role of Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof on the West End stageGreen, Stanley, Encyclopedia Of The Musical Theatre, Da Capo Press 1980, p. 121 Film appearances Bass first appeared on film in wartime documentaries.Alfie Bass biography accessed 26 Jun 2007 He also appeared in a number of feature films including The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), Hell Drivers (1957), A Tale of Two Cities (1958) and Alfie (1966) starring Michael Caine and Shelley Winters. In the latter he played Harry Clamacraft, a man Alfie meets and befriends in a sanatorium. He starred in Roman Polanski's vampire film The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967) (British title The Dance of the Vampires) as innkeeper Yoine Shagal with his daughter Sarah played by Sharon Tate. In the course of the film, he and his daughter become vampires. When a maid tries to scare him off with a crucifix, he responds with \\"Oy, have you got the wrong vampire!\\". Bass also appeared in the \\"Pride\\" segment of The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins (1971) and had a leading role in the 1977 sex comedy Come Play with Me. He has had many cameo roles, such as the Indian restaurant doorman in the Beatles' film Help! (1965), as Clouseau's seafaring informant in Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978), and in Moonraker (1979), in which he was cast as a heavy smoking hard drinker. Bass had a small part in I Was Monty's Double as a non-speaking passenger on a train. In his book British Film Character Actors (1982), Terence Pettigrew remembers, \\"there was a time when no British film seemed complete without Alfie Bass popping up in some guise or other. Basically playing the same character, he has hopped chirpily from drama to comedy and into costume pieces and back like an energised sparrow. To all of these, he has added an engaging warmth and sanguinity\\". Television and radio Bass appeared as a poacher rescued by Robin in the first episode of The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Richard Greene. He also appeared in a later episode during season two titled \\"The Goldmaker's Return\\" as Lepidus, the roguish alchemist, rescued from the Sheriff by Little John (Archie Duncan). He appeared in The Army Game (1957‚Äì61), a British TV comedy series, as Private Montague 'Excused Boots' Bisley, and its sequel Bootsie and Snudge from 1960‚Äì63 (there was also a one series revival in colour in 1974) working at a Gentleman's Club with Bill Fraser as 'Claude Snudge' and Clive Dunn as 'Henry Beerbohm Johnson'. Bass played the character in another spin- off, Foreign Affairs in 1964. Bass also played Lemuel \\"Lemmy\\" Barnet in the third and fourth series of the landmark 1950s science fiction radio series Journey into Space. He continued working throughout the 1970s and '80s, in the TV series Till Death Us Do Part and Are You Being Served? as Mr. Goldberg, the second in a series of replacements for Arthur Brough's Mr. Grainger character (the first being James Hayter's Mr. Tebbs). As in the Mr. Goldberg role, he often emphasised his Jewish background in on-screen characterisations. He played a memorable Silas Wegg in the BBC's 1976 adaptation of Dickens's Our Mutual Friend. He played Isaac Rag in a scene-stealing recurring character role in the 1979-1980 Dick Turpin series and as Morrie Levin, a shrewd accountant in the Minder episode The Sun Also Rises (1982). Bass appeared in a 1979 episode of the ITV Drama series Danger UXB: Just Like a Woman, as a family man with an unexploded bomb in his back garden. He also guest starred in two episodes of the British comedy television The Goodies, in which he appeared as the \\"Town Planner\\" in Camelot, and as the Giant in The Goodies and the Beanstalk. He was a subject of the television programme This Is Your Life in March 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Music In 1955 he recorded the novelty song \\"Pity the Downtrodden Landlord\\".

Examples of genuine semi-automatic revolvers are extremely uncommon, and the term is more often applied to break-open revolvers with automatic systems for ejecting spent casings on opening.  History  An automatic revolver was communicated to Moses Poole, a patent agent, in 1841. The exact identity of the inventor of this weapon is unknown but in all likelihood it was a Frenchman by the name of Philippe Mathieu, who patented, amongst several different types of revolver, an almost identical design two years prior. Another automatic revolver was communicated to British patent agent William Edward Newton by the Americans Mershon and Hollingsworth in 1854. Both of these weapons used clockwork as the power for achieving automatic operation. In 1863 a gas piston-operated revolver was designed by a Spanish gunsmith by the name of Orbea. The Webley- Fosbery Automatic Revolver was designed in 1895 and would go on to become the first commercial and best known automatic revolver.  Description  A standard revolver is a manually operated weapon, using the action of cocking the hammer to advance the cylinder in a single-action, or the action of pulling the trigger to advance the cylinder and cock the hammer in a double- action. The idea behind an automatic revolver is to automate both actions, removing the need to manually cock the hammer between shots while retaining the lighter trigger pull of the single-action. This is accomplished by use of a reciprocating slide on the upper part of the frame, the motion of which is used to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer in much the same way as is used in the majority of semi-automatic pistol designs.  Examples  * The Norwegian Landstad revolver, designed and introduced in 1900. Its very unusual design featured a flat cylinder with two chambers, in which the bottom chamber was loaded from a sideways-inserted magazine that also functioned as the left grip plate. During firing, the revolver's reciprocating bolt would extract and eject the round from the top chamber after firing, load a round into the bottom chamber, and then rotate the cylinder. The revolver would then be ready to fire again. It was chambered for the 7.5mm Nagant cartridge, which at the time was also used in both the Norwegian and Swedish versions of the Belgian Nagant M1895 revolver. * The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver was the first commercial example, introduced in 1901. It was recoil-operated, and the cylinder and barrel recoiled backwards to cock the hammer and revolve the cylinder. It was distinctive in that cam grooves were milled on the outside of the cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamber‚Äîhalf a turn as the cylinder moved back, and half a turn as it moved forward. .38 caliber versions held 8 shots, .455 caliber versions 6. Around 4,750 were made in total. * The Union Automatic Revolver of American origin. Only around 65 examples made. * The Zulaica Automatic Revolver M. Zulaica y Cia., Eibar, Spain. began manufacturing 'Velo-Dog' type pocket revolvers in the early 1900s. In 1905, Zulaica patented an unusual .22LR automatic revolver design, but few were ever manufactured and even fewer have survived. Zulaica started manufacturing 'Eibar' type automatic pistols under French army contracts in 1915 and 1916, and continued to market them commercially up to the 1920s. * In 1997, the Mateba company developed a type of recoil-operated automatic revolver, the Mateba Unica auto-revolver, which uses recoil energy to auto- rotate a revolver cylinder holding 6 or 7 cartridges, depending on the model. The company has made several versions of its \\"autorevolver\\", including longer barreled and even rifle-like variations, usually chambered for .357 Magnum ammunition, but also available in larger calibers like .44 Magnum and .454 Casull.

History A Hawks game in 2008 thumb Fukuoka Dome is the home stadium of Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and, together with Hilton Fukuoka Sea Hawk Hotel, is part of the Hawks Town entertainment complex. It is located near Momochi Beach, about 15 minutes walk from Tojinmachi subway station. In 2006, the stadium received an upgrade to its mono-color main scoreboard \\"Hawks Vision.\\" Sharing the same nickname as its predecessor and measured at 10 m (32.76 ft) high and 53 m (173.86 ft) wide, it was one of the largest high-definition electronic scoreboards at the time, equivalent to a 2,123-inch wide-screen display. In 2010, with further addition of two 5.7 m (120.65 ft) √ó 33 m (108.27 ft) displays, the stadium boasted the largest total viewing area of HD display in all baseball stadia (total area 905.2sqm or 9,743.49sqft).

(An indoor baseball stadium in Japan which actually has a floating field is Sapporo Dome, which also hosts football games for Consadole Sapporo, a J. League club. However, this stadium does not have such a field.) In 2009, the older AstroTurf field was replaced with the now more common FieldTurf brand surface to reduce injuries; the Hawks players had seen far more injuries than any other team in Japan. Concerts Michael Jackson performed at the stadium four times at his solo career. The first two times, Jackson performed two sold-out concerts during his Dangerous World Tour, on September 10 & 11, 1993, for a total audience of 70,000 fans (35,000 per show). The second and last two times were in 1996, during his subsequent tour, HIStory World Tour, on December 26 and 28, also on two sold-out concerts for 80,000 people (40,000 fans per show). Whitney Houston performed at the stadium on September 22, 1993 during The Bodyguard World Tour. Madonna performed three times at the stadium.

It is bordered on the south by Maspeth, on the north by Astoria, on the west by Sunnyside, and on the east by Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and East Elmhurst. Some areas are widely residential and very quiet, while other parts, especially the ones around Roosevelt Avenue, are busier. In the 19th century the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However, with large-scale residential development in the 1860s, Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens, being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s, many Asian American families moved into the area, with the population being 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years. Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink, the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city's most popular Thai, Filipino, and South American eateries. Woodside is located in Queens Community District 2 and its ZIP Code is 11377.

Modern Woodside is shown as \\"Woodside\\" and \\"North Woodside.\\" thumbDetail from Map of Newtown, Long Island. Designed to exhibit the localities referred to in the \\"Annals of Newtown.\\" Compiled by J. Riker, Jr. 1852. This map shows the area that would become Woodside, bounded in the west by Middletown and Dutch Kills (shown as \\"Kills\\" in the detail), in the south by English Kills and Maspeth, and in the east by the Village of Newtown (shown as \\"Vill\\" in the detail). Woodside's northern boundary is approximately the top border of the map. The \\"Great Chestnut Tree\\" was actually located on the west side of the road where it is shown. For two centuries following the arrival of settlers from England and the Netherlands, the area where the village of Woodside would be established was sparsely populated. The land was fertile, but also wet. Its Native American inhabitants called it a place of \\"bad waters\\" and it was known to early European settlers as a place of \\"marshes, muddy flats and bogs,\\" where \\"wooded swamps\\" and \\"flaggy pools\\" were fed by flowing springs.\\" Until drained in the nineteenth century, one of these wet woodlands was called Wolf Swamp after the predators that infested it. This swamp was not the only place where settlers might fear for the safety of their livestock, and even themselves. One of the oldest recorded locations in Woodside was called Rattlesnake Spring on the property of a Captain Bryan Newton. The vicinity came to be called Snake Woods and one source maintains that \\"during New York‚Äôs colonial period, the area was known as 'suicide‚Äôs paradise,' as it was largely snake-infested swamps and wolf-ridden woodlands.\\" Woodside was settled by farmers in the early 18th century. In time, inhabitants learned how to farm the land profitably. The marsh grasses proved to be good for grazing and grains, fruits, and vegetables could be grown on the surrounding dry land. By the middle of the 18th century, the area's farmers had drained some of its marshes and cut back some of its woods to expand its arable land and eliminate natural predators. Agricultural produce found markets in New York City, and at the beginning of the 19th century the area came to be \\"abundantly conspicuous in the wealth of the farmers and in the beauty of the villas.\\" A late 19th- century historian described one of the area's 19th-century farms as a pleasing mix of woodlot, tilled acreage, grazing land, orchard, and pleasure garden. He believed \\"it would probably have been hard to find anywhere in the vicinity of New York a more picturesque locality.\\" Another observer of this time praised Woodside's \\"pure atmosphere and delightful scenery.\\" In the 19th century, the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. Some idea of the bucolic nature of the place that would become Woodside can be seen in descriptions of an ancient central landmark, a great chestnut tree. The tree was hundreds of years old when it finally came down in the last decade of the 19th century. It stood on high ground near a junction of three dirt roads and \\"was of great diameter, some 8 or 10 feet\\"‚Äîperhaps 30 feet in circumference. Its size and central location made it a natural a meeting place, a surface on which to tack public notices, and strategic point of considerable military significance during the Revolutionary War. A 19th- century antiquarian wrote of the great tree as it stood during the American Revolution and in doing so named the families of the local landowners: > Around the roots of the old tree were the huts and stables of the cavalry: > with a number of settler's huts ranged in woods... Great festivities too > were constant in the spacious rooms of the old Moore house, during the > winter months when the snow was deeper and the frost more cold than now-a- > days.

Woodside was first developed on a large scale beginning in 1867 by speculative residential neighborhood builder Benjamin W. Hitchcock, who also founded Corona and Ozone Park, and John Andrew Kelly. The neighborhood's location about three miles from Hunter's Point on the Long Island Rail Road line made it an ideal location for a new suburban community. In 1874, the New York Times described Woodside: =Agriculture= By the middle of the 19th century, drainage and improved agricultural techniques had increased the proportion of Woodside's arable land to some two-thirds of the total. Flowers and dairy products were added to the fruits and vegetables which farmers took to city markets. These landowners also reaped benefits from improved transportation. Mid-century construction of a plank road from Newtown to Williamsburg and a later one from Newtown to Hunters Point made access to East River ferries quicker and easier. In 1860 a corporation presided over by a local resident, John C. Jackson, built a gravel-topped toll road between Flushing and the ferry at Hunters Point. The Plank Road disappeared during construction projects of the later 19th century but Northern Boulevard tracks closely resemble the route of Jackson Avenue. =Residential estates= thumbleftA decayed tintype, showing Hillside Manor in the 1870s. The house, sited on high point not far from the Great Chestnut Tree in Woodside, lay on nine acres of land with gardens laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted. Owned by Louis Windmuller, German immigrant, New York merchant, financier, and philanthropist, the estate was one of the last in Woodside to be sold for development. In 1936 the City acquired most of the property for a park to be called Windmuller Park and in 1942 the heirs sold the remainder to a developer for construction of garden apartments. The improvements in transportation that initially benefited agriculture eventually produced its decline. As it became quicker and more convenient for residents to travel from their homes to other parts of Queens, to Brooklyn, and to Manhattan, the area came to be seen as both desirable and affordable for the construction of housing for city- dwellers and increases in land values enticed farm owners to sell out. John Sackett came of a family of religious dissenters that had settled in Queens late in the 17th century. In 1802 he inherited a farm of 115 acres including much of what is now Woodside and in 1826 his heirs sold much of the property to John A. Kelly, the son of a German immigrant, and his sister-in-law (also of German descent), Catherine B. (Friedle) Buddy. As other well-to-do merchants had done in other areas of Queens, Kelly and Buddy bought farm property for use as a rural estate where they planned to live in the warmer months of the year. Not long after, a friend of Kelly's, William Schroeder, bought another parcel of the Sackett property for the same purpose. Like Kelly, he came of a family that had emigrated from Germany and, like Kelly, he had achieved wealth as a merchant in Charleston, South Carolina. Unlike Kelly, however, he did not move North, but kept the estate for use during summer vacations. After Kelly and Schroeder had moved in, two other well-to-do men of German extraction made country retreats for themselves in Woodside. They were Gustav Sussdorf and Louis Windmuller. Like Kelly and Schroeder, Sussdorf was a Charleston merchant. In 1859 he sold his fancy goods business and moved to New York. Not long after, he bought a farm owned by the family of Thomas Cumberson who had died in 1849. It is quite possible that he learned of the place through acquaintance with Schroeder or, more likely, Kelly. Windmuller was of a younger generation than Kelly, Schroeder, and Sussdorf. He emigrated to New York in the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848. Only 18 years old and penniless, he found success as a commission agent, bringing goods to clients in the U.S. from Germany and other European countries. In 1867 he had accumulated enough savings to buy property adjoining Sussdorf's. The land had formerly belonged to the Morrell family, but had been acquired by a speculator, Antonie J.D. Mecke, and became available to Windmuller on Mecke's going bankrupt. =Residential development= thumbA photograph of the area from a book published in 1899. This photograph is entitled \\"Pastoral scene at Winfield, on the road from Long Island City to Flushing.\\" Founded in 1854, Winfield is a neighborhood in eastern Woodside. The place known as \\"suicide's paradise\\" lay on the west side of the neighborhood. The photo shows that Woodside retained some portion of its rural character even at the end of the 19th century. As farms gave way to country estates, so country estates would, in turn, give way to residential development, as, in the decades after 1850, the land was broken into small lots for construction of single-family houses. As before, this new shift was brought about largely by improvement in transportation resources. In 1854, the first steam-powered passenger rail service came to the area. In that year a passenger depot of the Flushing Rail Road from Long Island City to Flushing opened for operation near the southern boundary of what would become the village of Woodside. The line gave access to New York City via the Hunters Point Ferry and to Brooklyn via horse-drawn omnibus. In 1861 a second line opened running directly through what would shortly become the village of Woodside. This was a segment of the Long Island Rail Road which operated between Hunters Point and Jamaica, replacing an earlier segment which passed through Brooklyn to the ferry dock in Williamsburg. In 1869, another line, the Flushing and North Side Railroad, traversed the same path through Woodside. And soon after, in 1874, a short spur, the Flushing and Woodside Rail Road opened its station in the village. The construction of this rail service led directly to the division of property near train stations into small lots for construction of houses for working- class families. The area that would become Woodside was not the first community to grow out of Queens farmland. Before the end of the 1850s Woodhaven, Astoria, Maspeth, Corona, Hunters Point, and Winfield all attracted land speculators. Woodside's developers were, however, among the first to divide properties into lots for construction of small homes for working-class families. In doing so they were the first to use a set of new sales techniques to lure buyers. And they were the first to apply a name to a locale which emphasized its real or supposed virtues. A late 19th century author said \\"Woodside\\" was an appropriate name for the community these land speculators created. He maintained that others, created later, were \\"without the slightest significance, historic or otherwise, and of the kind apparently chosen by boarding school girls to roll romantically from the tongue.\\". These included Ozone Park, Corona, Winfield, Glendale, Laurel Hill, Elmhurst, and Linden Hill. The real estate promoters who created Woodside were mostly of German extraction. Members of the Kelly family were first, followed by Alpheus P. Riker, Henry G. Schmidt, John A. Mecke, and Emil Cuntz. The Kelly family developed the property where they resided while the others bought land specifically to divide it into building lots. Riker came from a German family that had settled in Queens while it was still part of New Netherland. =Benjamin W. Hitchcock= thumbA 1905 postcard photo of a trolley line in Woodside. This postcard shows the abrupt turn in the trolley line in Woodside at Woodside and Kelly Avenues. The photographer is standing on Woodside, looking north on Kelly. The house at left is a typical Hitchcock four-room dwelling. The Kelly family was linked to A. P. Riker's by marriage. Riker, a customs officer, was John A. Kelly's son-in-law. Members of the Kelly family were publishers and it may not be a coincidence that the agent with whom the Kellys contracted for development of Woodside farmland was a publisher of sheet music, periodicals, and \\"subscription books\\" named Benjamin W. Hitchcock. Hitchcock had a flair for publicity and innovative sales techniques. Once the area had been surveyed and 972 plots laid out, he organized excursions from the city, hired brass bands to play, and gave prospects free lunch. The first sales event took place on February 18, 1869. Hitchcock priced empty lots at $300. Employing an innovative sales technique, he sold them on the installment plan. Purchasers made a down payment and owed $10 a month until the note was paid off. He took a 25% commission on each sale. To entice purchasers he sold lottery tickets with first option on choice lots as one set of prizes. Other prizes included option to purchase one of five houses already built on the property. It may have been he or perhaps Kelly who gave the name \\"Woodside\\" to the area. A member of the Kelly Family, John A. F. Kelly, had used it in occasional pieces he had written for a local newspaper during the 1850s and 1860s. In 1899 one of the original purchasers told a reporter than he had bought a lot with a tiny house on it, only 20' wide by 16' deep. The price was $480 and he paid $125 down and $10 a month until he'd paid off the note. Hitchcock had an instinct for spectacle akin to P.T. Barnum's. After his success with Woodside he undertook similar real estate promotions in other parts of Queens including hamlets that he dubbed Corona and Ozone Park. When the economy soured and that business declined, he ran a theater, got involved in machine politics, and sponsored some beauty contests including one, the \\"Congress of Beauty and Culture,\\" which was censured for its overall sleaze and the swindling of its participants. While the other major landowners of Woodside used agents to develop their holdings, A. P. Riker set up a real estate office in the center of the village from which he managed his own property and handled real estate transactions for others. He was also a partner in local businesses: a grocery store in 1876 and, in 1878, a fruit and vegetable canning business which employed 100 workers. The developers who followed Hitchcock's lead in Woodside were less flamboyant though similarly successful. In 1863 John Mecke bought farmland from a family, the Moores, who had lived for more than a century and a half on what would become the northern part of what would become Woodside. He intended to subdivide, but became insolvent and, in 1867, died. His heirs sold the property to two carpenters, Henry G. Schmidt and Emil Cuntz, who, in 1871, deeded their property to an organization known as the Bricklayers' Cooperative Building Association. This organization seems not to have been what its name suggests since it was a New York corporation headed by Charles Merweg who gave his occupation as \\"speculator in real estate.\\" In any event, the Association erected a housing development in north Woodside which it called Charlotteville. The name was later given the more common spelling of Charlottesville. In 1886 another speculator, Effingham H. Nichols, divided property in the eastern part of the village and called it Woodside Heights. Other 19th-century developers included Charles F. Ehrhardt who sold lots in the northern part of the village and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company which converted two properties on the west side into salable lots. These and other real estate developers profited from their sale of lots to home buyers, but the growth of Woodside's housing market was hardly a smooth upward trajectory and, some 40 years after Hitchcock's first lottery, the village was far from completely saturated with homes. A minutely detailed property atlas from 1909 shows buildings on considerably less than half of the village's surveyed lots. In fact, although affordable by standards of the time, Woodside's small single family houses on their small lots were too expensive for growing numbers of laborers who crowded the tenement apartments of Manhattan and nearby Brooklyn. In the years before the Panic of 1907 and again after its close, the wage-earners in many of these low-income families, having been able to improve their skills and obtain higher-paying jobs, began pressing for construction of housing that was better than the tenements but still within their means. Although real estate developers had previously thought Woodside to be too remote and rural in character for marketing of low cost rental units, some changed circumstances convinced them to meet this need by putting up higher-density apartment buildings in the village. =Other factors= thumbleftThis sheet from a 1909 atlas of Queens was used for fire insurance purposes. This map shows streets, lots, and structures within Ward 2, encompassing the village of Woodside. As the key (shown here) indicates, it also gives elevation above high water, location of hydrants, rail and trolley lines, width of streets, and other data. Chief among these circumstances were continued improvements to the public transportation network. This network continued to expand and Woodside evolved as a hub for railroad (the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line electrified in 1908), elevated rapid transit (the joint IRT/BRT Corona and Woodside Line, 1917), and electrified trolleys (Newtown Railway Company, 1895, and New York and Queens County Line, 1896). With the incorporation of Queens into New York City in 1898 and subsequent passage of legislation mandating a five-cent citywide transit fare in 1904, Woodside residents had both abundant and inexpensive options for rapid public transportation. In fact the real cost of the five- cent fare declined dramatically during the inflation years of World War I and the 1920s, and it remained in place, despite further inflation, until 1948. The construction of bridge and tunnel connections to Manhattan‚Äîthe Queensboro Bridge in 1909 and the Steinway Tunnel in 1915‚Äîenabled the working members of a tenement-dwelling immigrant family to rent a garden apartment in Woodside while having jobs in the central city. The commute was cheap and short, and during rush hours, the five-cent trip took as little as eight minutes to Times Square. Although other areas of Queens benefited from the expansion of cheap transit, Woodside was, back then, the only village in Queens with both railroad and rapid transit stations in addition to trolley lines. A second circumstance aiding the influx of upwardly-mobile low-income residents was a dramatic increase in local employment prospects. Although cheap, fast, and convenient transit made it possible for workers from Queens to have other- borough jobs, intra-borough employment opportunities were increasingly a realistic option. The waterside regions of Queens had long had substantial industries and businesses that benefited from access to water-borne transport. These commercial establishments multiplied as rail transportation became increasingly available and, in a virtuous growth cycle, as more prospective employees moved into the borough. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Woodside residents could find employment to the east in Brooklyn, to the north in College Point, and, especially, to the west. Hunters Point, Sunnyside, and other west-Queens communities possessed foundries, rail yards, chemical works, and numerous factories, including the famous Steinway Piano factory. When, in 1870, these communities formed themselves into Long Island City opportunities for employment grew rapidly, so much so that by the turn of the 20th century, the city could boast that it had the highest concentration of industry in all the United States. There were jobs within Woodside as well. The village had long had the city's largest cemetery, Calvary, as a stimulus to local business. It also possessed a brewery, a major florist, and many local retail establishments. In 1875, the Bulova Watch Company established its headquarters there. Along with good transportation and access to jobs, Woodside possessed many local amenities. It was an attractive place with plentiful open spaces, many trees and wooded areas, healthful air, and an overall pleasant ambiance; one news article in 1926 described this as \\"sylvan beauty\\", As it had in the other villages, the creation of the Borough of Queens in 1898 brought improvements in local government and increased spending on police, roads, schools, and public spaces, to Woodside. However, Woodside had provided fire protection, sewers, and street lights earlier on, and its transit facilities gave way to a wide variety of retail options. One newspaper article published in 1926 singled out its school, P.S.11, as \\"one of the leading public schools in Queens.\\" As in nearby communities of the time, religious observance played an important role in the lives of Woodside residents, and its churches both reflected this importance and signaled welcome to prospective newcomers. Its first church, St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal, showed the dominant faith of the area's oldest and most prominent residents. It was established in 1874 by the families of landowners who had farmed there from its earliest settlement as well as by the estate-owning Germanic families that had moved in during the middle decades of the 19th century, including the longstanding Rapelye, Hicks, and Rikers families and the newly arrived Sussdorf, Windmuller, and Kelly families. Two years later, residents from among the still newer owners of small houses set up a Baptist church. St. Paul's originally had a small congregation of only 50, with twice that in 1900; the Baptist church had about the same. St. Sebastian, Woodside's first Roman Catholic church, served a considerably larger population upon its 1896 foundation. That year, the families of working-class residents, mainly of German descent, convinced the bishop of the Brooklyn Diocese that they should not have to travel to other villages to attend Mass. The number of church members, originally 300, quickly grew and was reported to be 1,000 in 1902. In addition to its other advantages, prospective home buyers were enticed by Woodside's places of entertainment. One of its first businesses was a brewery, which had long possessed rooms where men could gather and drink. In the second half of the 19th century it became renowned for its beer gardens and dance halls. One early resident, Julius Adams, bought a tiny house on one of Hitchcock's small lots. At first he earned his living as a shoemaker, and, succeeding in that business, expanded into others. In 1881 he built Sanger Hall‚Äîa German-style beer hall, a dance hall, and performance space for German singing societies and theatrical entertainments‚Äîand as the Hall thrived, he added dining rooms and even a bowling alley. In 1889, another resident built Heimann's Hall, a beer garden, dancing pavilion, and dining hall. Early in the 20th century a movie theater joined the options for local leisure-time activity. 20th century thumbleftExtract from a news article about an 1897 murder in Woodside. This extract from a news article summarizes a sensational murder committed in a rented Woodside cottage on June 23, 1897. The victim, his murderer, and the murderer's accomplice were all German, but none were Woodside residents. The case is considered a landmark not in American jurisprudence but in the history of yellow journalism. As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, Woodside's plentiful advantages convinced real estate developers to invest substantially in high-occupancy housing and duplex homes to complement the single-family units which had dominated the area. Three representative examples are Woodside Apartments built in 1913, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's project of 1922, and the projects of the Woodside Development Corporation in 1923. Located near the rail and rapid transit stations, the Woodside Apartments was a row of four-story, semi- detached buildings. There were four apartments on a floor, most of them having four rooms. Rents initially ranged from $18 to $20 a month. Located just as close to the trains, but on the other side of the village, the Metropolitan Life apartment project was more ambitious. Consisting of ten five-story buildings, the project had space for four hundred families. The Woodside Development Corporation built four-story apartments with stores on the ground floor and both two- and one-family houses on two large plots of land near the center of the village. When a citywide aerial survey was taken in 1924, Woodside was shown to have quite a few other multifamily apartment buildings and duplexes along with its many small single-family homes. During the 1930s and into the post-war era, Woodside residential development continued to grow, although more slowly than in the boom years following World War I. Empty lots continued to be filled with one- and two-family houses, compact apartment buildings continued to be constructed, and larger, elevator-style high-rises were put up. In 1936, a last large tract of undeveloped land was made available for construction of garden apartments when a portion of the 10-acre Windmuller Estate was sold to developers. A community profile, published in 1943, characterized Woodside (along with Winfield, its neighbor to the south) as \\"a district of small homes and middle incomes.\\" The area still had few apartment buildings and very little industry. Although the rapid population growth of the 1920s had fallen off in the 1930s, the authors of the profile expected improved transit (the IND Queens Boulevard Line which opened in 1933) and a new shopping center to draw larger numbers of new residents. The number of single-family houses is given as 2,159, double-family houses as 1,711, and larger residential buildings as 868. Woodside Houses In 1949, construction was completed on the Woodside Houses, a public housing complex built and operated by the New York City Housing Authority. The complex consists of 20 six-story buildings with 1,358 apartments. It is located in western Woodside, bordering Astoria, between 49th and 51st Streets, 31st Avenue and Newtown Road. 21st century At the turn of the 21st century, Woodside was finally seen to be built up. The neighborhood nonetheless continued to be seen as an attractive place to live‚Äîcharacterized by \\"wide avenues, leafy streets and a mix of private homes, small apartment buildings and the occasional towering co-op.\\" The population was about 1,800 in 1880; 3,900 in 1900; 15,000 in 1920; and 41,000 in 1930. By 1963 it had grown to about 55,600, and by 2000, the population had risen to 90,000. In 2008 the chairman of the local Community Board said that large apartment buildings were replacing smaller ones and single-family homes were being converted into multifamily rental properties. At the same time, real estate brokers told a news reporter that interest remained strong among families looking for affordable housing near Manhattan. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Woodside was 45,099, an increase of 1,253 (2.9%) from the 43,846 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 22.5% (10,140) White, 1.3% (592) African American, 0.2% (76) Native American, 39.9% (17,990) Asian, 0.0% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.5% (221) from other races, and 2.2% (975) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.5% (15,100) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community Board 2, which comprises Woodside and Sunnyside, had 135,972 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.4 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 17% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, 39% between 25‚Äì44, and 24% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 12% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 2 was $67,359. In 2018, an estimated 20% of Woodside and Sunnyside residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty residents (5%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in Woodside and Sunnyside, about equal to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Woodside and Sunnyside is considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. Culture=Background The character of Woodside's population, in terms of national origin, has changed radically over time. Its first inhabitants were Native Americans, probably of the Mespeatches, who gave their name to the town of Maspeth. The first European landowners were mainly Dutch and English and their laborers mainly British, African (slaves), and American Indian. During the nineteenth century, Germans largely took over from these first settlers. In addition to the major Germanic landowners already mentioned (the Kellys‚Äîwhose name was originally K√∂lle‚ÄîRiker, Schroeder, Schmidt, Sussdorf, and Windmuller), the first purchasers of Hitchcock's little plots were largely of German extraction. They included men with names like Eberhardt, Groeber, and Schlepergrel. Beginning at the close of the 19th century and through most of the 20th, growing numbers of Irish residents arrived and Woodside eventually became Irish enough to earn the nickname \\"Irishtown.\\" A major turning point in the transition from German to Irish occurred in 1901 when the Greater New York Irish Athletic Association formally opened a large athletic complex called Celtic Park on the border between Woodside and Laurel Hill, its neighbor to the south. A second turning point was the death of Louis Windmuller, the last of the German estate owners. Prominent in local as well as city and national affairs, he was called the \\"grand old man\\" or \\"patriarch\\" of Woodside. Although the estate did not go out of his heirs' hands until the close of the Depression and beginning of World War II, his passing nonetheless helps mark Woodside's transition from country village to suburban bedroom community. With large-scale residential development in the 1860s, Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens. In the early 1930s, the area was approximately 80% Irish. A subsequent influx of Irish occurred during the 1980s and into the early 1990s when many Irish immigrated to New York due to poor economic conditions in Ireland. Many of these \\"new Irish\\" settled in Woodside, where the men found work as construction workers or bartenders while the women worked as waitresses, nannies or domestics. Toward the end of the 20th century, Irish dominance gradually yielded to a mixture of other nationalities, but even as the neighborhood has seen growth in ethnic diversity today, the area still retains a strong Irish American presence, and there continue to be a number of Irish pubs and restaurants scattered across Woodside. After World War II, families in the area were primarily of Irish, Italian, and Jewish descent. Gradually, Dominicans and other nationalities began to make an appearance in the community, beginning in the late 1960s. A trend of diversity began then, and has continued since. This diversity has been remarked upon by many observers and can be shown in residents' places of worship. For example, the Winfield Reformed Church began in 1880 as a Dutch Calvinist church and in 1969 became the first Taiwanese congregation in America. Others of Woodside's places of worship now include ones that are Hindu, Thai Buddhist, Romanian Orthodox, Filipino, Korean, China Chinese , and Bahrainian. Woodside has a strong Muslim community and is home of a large, multipurpose organization, the Islamic Institute of New York. Among St. Sebastian Mass-goers, a priest reports that are about 45% are Hispanic (particularly from Colombia and Mexico), 25% Irish, 25% Filipino, and 5% Korean. In 1999, Woodsiders came from 49 countries and spoke 34 different languages. In the early 1990s, many Asian American families moved into the area, particularly east of the 61st Street ‚Äì Woodside subway station. In 2000, Woodside's population was 30% Asian American. Woodside has a large population of Thai Americans, Korean Americans, Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans (see Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Manila), each with their own respective ethnic enclave. There are also South Asian Americans, particularly Indian Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, Nepalese Americans, and Pakistani Americans, as well as a large Dominican and Latino population. Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink, the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city's most popular Thai, Filipino, Colombian, and Ecuadorian eateries. Woodside's diversity lends itself to a number of festivals and street fairs. It commemorates Saint Patrick's Day with a parade prior to the famous celebration in Manhattan. Woodside also hosts several events in the summer, including an Independence Day street fair. Little Manila Little Manila on Roosevelt Avenue A \\"Little Manila\\" stretches from 63rd-71st Streets on Roosevelt Avenue, where many Filipino-owned businesses have flocked to serve Woodside's large Filipino American community; the neighborhood is known for its concentration of Filipinos. Of the 85,000 residents of Woodside, about 13,000, or 15% of Woodside's population, are of Filipino background. Filipino restaurants dominate the area, as well as several freight and remittance centers scattered throughout the neighborhood. Other Filipino-owned businesses including professional services (medical, dental, optical), driving schools, beauty salons, immigration services, and video rental places providing the latest movies from the Philippines dot the community. This area attracts many local Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike and from neighboring places of Long Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. In February 2008, the Bayanihan Filipino Community Center opened its doors in Woodside, a project spearheaded by the Philippine Forum. The Philippine Forum also hosts the annual Bayanihan Cultural Festival at the Hart Playground in September in commemoration of Filipino American History Month.  St. Patrick's Day Parade  The Green Man, St. Pat's for All Parade Woodside hosts New York City's only Saint Patrick's Day parade that invites members of New York City's LGBTQ Irish community to march; it is called the St. Pat's for All Parade. The parade was founded by LGBTQ+ rights activist Brendan Fay after the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization (ILGO) was repeatedly denied permission to march in the Manhattan St. Patrick's Day parade by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. The parade runds from Sunnyside to Woodside, with its starting point in 43rd Street and Skillman Avenue. = History of St. Pat's for All = 219x219px In 1991, the recently established gay and lesbian Irish organization ILGO was denied permission to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade on Fifth Avenue. When New York City Mayor Dinkins intervened on their behalf, ILGO members were allowed to march for that one time, but their presence was received with hostility from other marchers as well as the spectators, who openly hurled abuse at them and doused with beer.Mulligan, Adrian. \\"Parading Possibility : \\"St. Pat's for All\\" and the Re-imagining of Irishness.\\" Which Direction Ireland?: Proceedings of the 2006 ACIS Mid- Atlantic Regional Conference. 2007. In the years that followed, ILGO members would be denied permission to march, respond by protesting at the parade, and get arrested. Two court rulings then further endorsed the exclusion of LGTBQ marchers: in 1993, Federal Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rules that the Ancient Order of Hibernians can ban LGTBQ marchers from the St. Patrick's' Parade in Manhattan; in 1995, the U.S Supreme Court rules in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston that private citizens organizing a public demonstration may not be compelled by the state to include groups who impart a message the organizers do not want to be presented by their demonstration. In the wake of these court rulings, Brendan Fay founds the Lavender and Green Alliance (LAG), which organizes an inclusive event \\"open to anybody who wished to celebrate the spirit of Irishness and their connections to Ireland\\" and name it \\"St. Pat's for All.\\" The slogan of the parade,\\"Cherishing All the Children of the Nation Equally,\\" originates from the 1916 Easter Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The first parade was held on March 5, 2000. The creation of the St. Pats for all parade provided a welcoming community for LGBT+ people of Irish descent and association. People of various cultures and backgrounds attend this parade for significant Senior participants at the Queens 2018 Pride Parade reasons. In the inaugural year of 2000, the parade attracted over 70 groups of people, including the Korean community honoring the important role that Irish nuns had played in their education, Chilean folk musicians honoring Bernardo O' Higgins, the founding father and first president of Chile, and the son of an Irish immigrant, children and their puppets, the Sunny Side Drum Corps, and LGBT organizations. Many never imagined being a part of a tradition that didn't allow anything that distracted the Catholic expression. Woodside parade stands out because it welcomes anyone who wearing of green regardless of race, creed or sexual orientation. ‚ÄúThe St. Patrick‚Äôs parade is the most significant expression of Irish culture and celebration in this city, and the parade in Queens, for many of us, was a first-time experience. It was the first parade since the first St. Patrick‚Äôs parade in New York City, which was in 1762, [that] was open and welcoming to all.‚Äù The parade has attracted such politicians as former New York City mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg; Jason West, mayor of New Paltz, New York; former congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district; and former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. St. Pat's for All Parade celebrated its 20th anniversary on March 3, 2019.

He served as a Private 1st Class in the 102nd Field Signal Company and lost his life during the final days of the war in 1918. In 1933 the Board of Alderman named this site Vincent Daniels Square, ‚Äúto pay tribute to a son of Queens County who made the supreme sacrifice in the World War. Structures Former trolley car barnAs in other parts of New York City, centuries of tumultuous change have not totally obliterated old landmarks. Within Woodside, the double-decker station of the Long Island Rail Road (built in 1869) and the IRT Flushing Line (built in 1917) both remain, and were renovated in 1999. A trolley barn at Northern Boulevard and 51st Street has been preserved as the Tower Square Shopping Center. The New York and Queens Railroad Company built the barn in 1896. A transportation hub like the LIRR/IRT stations, it was the largest car barn in Queens. Woodside also possesses an ancient tree, not the great chestnut (which was gone by the end of the 19th century) but a large copper beech of somewhere between 150 and 300 years' age. Documents in the archive of the Queens Historical Society suggest that it might have been planted during the time of the Revolutionary War. Among the oldest of Woodside's historic landmarks are its cemeteries. Calvary Cemetery was founded in 1845 by trustees of Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral for Roman Catholic burials and was later expanded by the addition of three sections comprising New Calvary. Calvary and New Calvary's combined contain over three million burials. Located on 54th Street between 31st & 32nd Avenues, the Moore-Jackson Cemetery is much older and smaller than Calvary. Established in 1733, it is one of the oldest cemeteries in New York. Only fifteen graves remain visible, the earliest dated 1769.Bulova Corporation headquarters in WoodsideThe Bulova Corporation has its headquarters in northern Woodside along Interstate 278. The headquarters opened in 1875. Although few have been documented, some of Woodside's old buildings still remain in place. Of those for which information is available, Woodside's first church, St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal, holds pride of place. It was damaged by fire in 2007 but still stands in its original location. An article published on the Forgotten NY weblog in 2005 lists this and other interesting structures from 19th century Woodside which have survived. All are located close to the center of town. They include the Hook and Ladder Company (1884), the home of Otto Groeber and his family (1870), the Woodside Pavilion (1877), and Meyer's Hotel (1882). Another article on this blog shows structures from the early 20th century that are still standing. In addition, the Winfield Reformed Church is located in Woodside. Transportation 61st Street‚ÄìWoodside station The IRT Flushing Line () of the New York City Subway has stations at 52nd (local), 61st (express) and 69th Streets (local) on Roosevelt Avenue; the IND Queens Boulevard Line local services () make stops at Northern Boulevard and 65th Street along Broadway. The Woodside station of the LIRR is connected to the 61st Street subway station. The buses connect Woodside to the rest of Queens; the Q32 and Q60 run to Manhattan, and the Q70 SBS and the Q47 go to LaGuardia Airport via Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (I-278) is a major highway passing through the area, serving Woodside via exits 39 through 43, as is the Long Island Expressway (I-495) via exit 18.

Large old trees of Ramna Park.Traveler's tree at Ramna Park . Ramna Park ( R√¥mna Uddan) is a large park and recreation area situated at the heart of Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. This forested park with pond near its center is one of the most beautiful areas in Dhaka. Islamabad's diplomatic district is named Ramna as a tribute to Ramna Park. This dates from when Bangladesh was East Pakistan and the newly established capital of Pakistan, Islamabad, was divided into various sectors named after various provinces such as Shalimar depicting Punjab and Ramna Bengal. History=17th century The history of Ramna starts about 1610 CE during Mughal rule, when the city of Dhaka was founded by Subehdar Islam Khan under Emperor Jahangir. At that time two beautiful residential areas were developed in the northern suburb of Dhaka city. New residential houses, gardens, mosques, tombs and temples were built in this area during that period. After the fall of the Mughal rule, Ramna gradually lost much of its glory. Ramna was then a barren area with bushes, abandoned or dilapidated buildings, tombs and old temples. 19th century Ramna area began to regain its glory since 1825, when Mr. Dowes, a British collector of Dhaka initiated a series of steps for development of the city. Engaging convicts, he cleared up the bushes and demolished most tombs and monuments except the Ramna Kali Mandir. The old mosque and tomb that now stand by the western side of old High Court building were spared. The renovated area was given the name of Ramna Green and was fenced by a boundary for using it as a race course. In 1908 he began the work of a garden that took 20 years to take a shape. The Nawabs of Dhaka developed the racecourse area as a beautiful garden and named a part of it as Shahbagh, the royal garden. The Nawabs also set up a zoo at Ramna. In 1851, the European civil servants established the Dhaka Club on the northern corner of the racecourse and after the Partition a good number of beautiful residential houses were built at Minto road area for the High Court judges and top bureaucrats. 20th century After creation of Pakistan in 1947, Ramna area continued to occupy an important place in the history of Dhaka city. A new road from Shahbagh to the Eden Building was constructed, and the eastern side of the road was developed as the Ramna Park. A miniature zoo with a few animals and different kinds of birds was left there, at the northeastern side of the present Supreme Court of Bangladesh building and was later moved to the present location at Mirpur. Ramna Park was officially inaugurated in 1949 with an area of of land with 71 species of plants. The large open spaces on the southwest facing the lake were used for holding National Fairs and Exhibitions. In 1960, Queen Elizabeth II was accorded a rousing civic reception at the Ramna Park with display of local fireworks. A raised concrete platform was built for the Queen, the remnants of which can still be seen in the park close to the lake. Walkway through the park. The present landscape of Ramna Park was designed in 1952 by the Public Works Department of Bangladesh (former C&B; Department). The lake was excavated deeper and extended in length. Walkways and garden paths were built in phases as, sections were regraded and replanted. Irrigation of the rare variety of tree saplings was done by tree wells, with deep vertical tubes/watering pipes to encourage roots to grow deeply. A bud-shaped water tower to supply them was built on the park's northern side. On the night of 25 March 1971, the Pakistani Army launched its violent campaign against the civilian population of Dhaka. The Ramna Kali Mandir and the neighbouring Maa Anandamoyee Ashram were demolished and more than 200 Hindus who had taken refuge inside were massacred. Present day park Ramna Park now protects an area of , of which the lake covers . Ramna Park now grows 71 species of flowering trees shrubs, perennials, and annuals, 36 species fruit bearing plant, 33 species medicinal plant and 41 species of forestry and 11 other species.

It is a musical instrument that uses electronic synthesizers to produce sound and is controlled through the use of an arm resembling the neck of a guitar in form and in use. Its name comes from the words synthesizer and axe, a slang term meaning guitar. The system was developed as a joint venture funded by Richard Branson's Virgin Group. The SynthAxe itself has no internal sound source; it is purely a controller and needs synthesizers to produce sound. The neck of the instrument is angled upwards from the body, and there are two independent sets of strings. The fretboard is continuously scanned and sends signals to synthesizers which produce the sound. The left set determine the pitch played, through contact with the frets on the neck and by sensing the side-to-side bending of the string. The right set of strings are velocity sensitive; these strings can be plucked, strummed or damped in the same manner as a guitar. A keyboard made up of nine keys can also be used to trigger notes instead of the strings. Design of the key toggles was done by the late David Fowler, at the time trading under BJ Hopkins Injection and toolmaking, in Littleworth, Oxford. An electronic tremolo bar (the 'electronic wang arm') can be used for standard whammy bar effects, or can be redefined to produce different MIDI output such as filter cutoffs or volume. When originally produced, the SynthAxe was priced at ¬£10,000 (approximately $13,000) and eventually sold for about ¬£6,000.00. The instrument was built from aerospace and military grade hardware, and was such a sophisticated and expensive piece of machinery that few were sold, making it difficult to keep the company afloat. In or around 1986, Virgin Games took over the distribution but let it go after a couple of years. Fewer than 100 SynthAxes were made,http://www.alendi.co.uk/synthaxe.html and it is difficult to locate used units. Most musicians who desire a MIDI guitar controller often use other alternatives, such as Roland or Axon systems that can convert a guitar's output to MIDI via 13-pin cables and outboard devices or older systems such as the Roland GR-500. Notable users Prominent players of the SynthAxe included Allan Holdsworth, who used it extensively on his albums Atavachron (1986), Sand (1987) and Flat Tire: Music for a Non-Existent Movie (2001); Chuck Hammer, who worked with both Lou Reed and David Bowie, and was the earliest guitarist to use the SynthAxe in the United States; and Lee Ritenour, who used the SynthAxe on his album Earth Run (1986), the cover of which features the instrument. Gary Moore featured the SynthAxe in the music video for few seconds for his 1985 single with Phil Lynott, \\"Out in the Fields.\\" Christopher Currell used it to control the Synclavier on Michael Jackson's Bad tour Bela Fleck and the Flecktones drummer Future Man also uses a highly customised version of the SynthAxe that he purchased in its original form from Ritenour.Futureman's Synthaxe Drumitar flecktones.com.

The parish is in the City of Chelmsford and Chelmsford Parliament constituency. The village is approximately northeast from the county town of Chelmsford.  History  Boreham is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Borham, thought to mean 'village on a hill'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.53. Local legend holds that highwayman Dick Turpin rode down the route than now forms part of the A12 on his famous ride from London to York, although historians now believe the ride never occurred. Boreham House In the 1930s Boreham House and its surrounding land of was bought by car magnate Henry Ford. In addition to using the house as a school for training Ford tractor mechanics, the company's British chairman, Lord Perry, established Fordson Estates Limited there, and founded the Henry Ford Institute of Agricultural Engineering, an agricultural college. The house also served as the temporary home for the National College of Agricultural Engineering in 1962. This moved to Silsoe, Bedfordshire as Silsoe College later joining with Cranfield University. The Silsoe campus closed at the end of 2007. In 1952 a Ham class minesweeper, HMS Boreham, was named after the village. Boreham remained relatively small until the mid-1970s when a programme of house and shop building increased its size significantly. Boreham contains one of England's few remaining independent family-run gunsmiths, which was established in 1795.  Geography and administration  In addition to being a village, Boreham is a civil parish which has a parish council The parish is bounded at its south by the River Chelmer. The village, which lies on a Roman road (now a modern trunk road, the A12), has a Norman church, and a public house (The Cock Inn) that dates from the 15th century. The surrounding countryside is slightly hilly and is used to grow crops such as wheat, sugar beet and peas. The Great Eastern Main Line from Chelmsford to Colchester runs past the village. In the 1970s a bypass was built along the northern edge of the village, along the same route as the A12 and the nearby railway line. The parish includes the hamlet of Russell Green at the north. Boreham parish has a population of approximately 4,000 people, and covers about of land.  Landmarks = New Hall School  New Hall School One mile to the northwest of the village is New Hall School, once a palace of Henry VIII known as The Palace of Beaulieu. The estate on which it was built ‚Äì the manor of Walhfare in Boreham ‚Äì was granted to the Canons of Waltham Abbey in 1062. After a number of changes of possession, in 1491 it was granted by the Crown to the Earl of Ormond. By this time it had a house called New Hall. In 1517 New Hall was sold by Thomas Boleyn to Henry VIII of England. The king rebuilt the house in brick at a cost of ¬£17,000. He gave his new palace the name 'Beaulieu', though the name change did not outlast the century. New Hall was later the estate of the Tyrell family and latterly the Hoare banking family. In 1727, Benjamin Hoare commissioned architect Henry Flitcroft to build a new home nearby known as Boreham House, a stately home; the early Georgian mansion is now a Grade I listed building.  Boreham airfield and circuit  Essex Air Ambulance operations at Boreham airfield A forest near the village was felled in 1943 to build a military airfield, and the three runways of RAF Boreham opened in 1944. It hosted elements of the US Army Air Forces 394th Medium Bomb Group (flying B-26 Marauder bombers) and later the 315th Troop Carrier Group flying C-47s. After the Second World War the three runways were adapted into a roughly triangular motor racing circuit Boreham Circuit, which held competitive meetings between 1949 and 1952. It was bought by Ford in 1955 for use as a development test track. Ford Motorsport moved to Boreham in 1963, and although some of the track was removed for gravel quarrying in 1996 the remaining track surface continues to be used for testing. Essex Police Air Support Unit have been based at the airfield and in 1990 began using Boreham airfield as a control centre for its fleet of helicopters. From 1997 to 2010, Essex Air Ambulance was also based at the site.  Boreham Interchange  To the west of Boreham lies the A12 Boreham Interchange, at which is a service facility with a BP petrol station, a McDonald's restaurant, and a Premier Inn motel. On the opposite side of the A12 is another Premier Inn and The Grange public house.

New York Mets The 200-pound Wigginton was selected by the New York Mets in the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. Wigginton was called up to the Mets major league roster for the first time in as a third baseman and had a promising partial rookie season with the Mets, batting .302 with a .354 on-base percentage (OBP) and .526 slugging percentage (SLG) in 116 at-bats.

He hit very well during the early stages of the 2010 season, batting .272 through his first 60 games and ranking eighth in the American League with 13 home runs. Wigginton was elected to his 1st All Star Game in 2010, being the lone Oriole representative. Wigginton had started the season without a starting position in Baltimore. However, hot streaks at the plate eventually prompted the saying \\"gettin' Wiggy with it,\\" a spoof of the song \\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It.\\" He split games between third base and first base following the trade of Miguel Tejada. Colorado Rockies On December 7, 2010, Wigginton signed a two-year deal with the Colorado Rockies with an option for a third year.

Philadelphia Phillies With the Phillies in 2012 On November 20, 2011, the Rockies traded Wigginton to the Philadelphia Phillies for a player to be named later or cash. On October 29, 2012, the Phillies declined his 2013 club option worth $4 million; he was paid a $500,000 buyout and became a free agent. In his lone season with the Phillies, he hit .235/.314/.375 in 125 games with 11 HRs. St. Louis Cardinals On December 14, 2012, the St. Louis Cardinals signed Wigginton to a two-year contract. According to Ken Rosenthal of FoxSports.com, the deal was worth $5 million over the two seasons. He was signed to serve as a utility infielder and outfielder. He performed poorly off the bench, hitting .158 in 47 games and 57 at-bats. On July 9, 2013 he was given his unconditional release. Miami Marlins Wigginton signed a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins on January 24, 2014. He was released on March 25. Scouting report Wigginton showed slightly below-average power for a major league third baseman in his early career but displayed increased power as his career went on, ultimately averaging 20 home runs per 162 games played. He cut down on his strikeouts in 2004 and increased his number of walks, but his plate discipline was still no better than average. He hit fastballs well but struggled a little bit with good breaking balls. Wigginton had about average speed; he stole 12 bases in 2003 but never duplicated that (even in the minor leagues). On the field, he was slightly below average at third base. He also played second base, primarily in the earlier part of his career, but was similarly limited defensively at that position. He also played first and the outfield corners and was decent at first but has struggled in very limited playing time in the outfield. Through the end of his major league career in July 2013, Wigginton had played in 1,362 major league games and hit .261 (1,170-for-4,479) with a .323 OBP, .435 SLG, 169 home runs, 245 doubles, 594 RBI and 42 stolen bases. Personal life On December 20, 2006, Wigginton was forced to handle the delivery of his son Cannon at home when his wife Angela went into labor unexpectedly. Following the instructions of an operator on 9-1-1, he delivered the baby in a bedroom closet of their North Carolina home and tied off the umbilical cord with one of his shoelaces.\\"Devil Ray performs under pressure\\", Marc Topkin, The St. Petersburg Times, published February 17, 2007, accessed February 20, 2007.

Located immediately northeast of Center City, its borders are somewhat disputed today due to many factors, but are roughly defined by the triangle created by the Delaware River, Frankford Avenue, and York Street. Some newer residents expand the area to Lehigh Avenue, while some older residents shrink the area to Norris Street. It is served by the Market‚ÄìFrankford Line rapid transit subway/elevated line of the SEPTA system. Fishtown is known as a working class Irish Catholic neighborhood. Recently, however, the neighborhood has seen a large influx of young urban professionals and gentrification. The name Fishtown derives from one of the original occupation of its residents. Early settlers were fishermen and over time they controlled the fishing rights to both sides of the Delaware River from Cape May to the falls at Trenton, NJ. The apocryphal local legend traces the name of Fishtown to Charles Dickens, who purportedly visited the neighborhood in March 1842, but records show this to be false, as it was named Fishtown prior to his visit, at least as early as 1808 as evidenced in a newspaper article in \\"The Tickler\\" an early 19th Century Philadelphia newspaper. History The area was originally inhabited by members of the Turtle Clan of the Lenape Indian tribe (whom the Europeans named the Delaware Indian Tribe). The first European settlers were a group of six Swedish farming families, later replaced by British landed gentry, then British shipbuilders and German fishermen. Fishtown was originally a small section of the town of Old Kensington, close to the Delaware River and just a few blocks long, roughly from Palmer Street north to Gunnar's Run, from the Delaware River to Moyer Street. The original town of Kensington was only 191.5 acres of land and originally called the Fairman Estate. Today's Penn Treaty Park sits where the Fairman Mansion once stood (actually Fairman Mansion sat in the middle of Beach Street, curb to curb, right north of Columbia Avenue). Palmer Cemetery gatehouse Kensington was founded by Captain Anthony Palmer, an Englishman by way of Barbados. Using proceeds from the sale of the Hope Farm estate (present day Port Richmond), which included three slaves named Abraham, Hannibal, and Phillis, Palmer purchased the Fairman Estate in 1729 and laid out his town and sold parcels to the local fishermen and shipbuilders. Anthony Palmer eventually became active in the provincial council and became acting Governor of Pennsylvania in 1747‚Äì1748. Palmer died in 1749 and was buried in Christ Church Cemetery in Philadelphia. (The Kensington Burial Grounds in Fishtown, also known as Palmer Cemetery, was founded around 1732 and is still an active burial ground, situated on land deeded to the community by the Palmer Family after Anthony Palmer's death. It is believed that the cemetery was in use from about the time Palmer started to lay out the town of Kensington, but the actual date of the first burial is unknown.) Within a few generations there was another influx of German immigrants, then still later in the late 19th century Polish and Irish Catholic immigrants. The community has two Roman Catholic Churches, St. Laurentius, built by the Polish immigrants, and the Holy Name of Jesus, built predominantly by Irish immigrants. Holy Name continues to serve as the parish church, however St. Laurentius has been closed and is now to be turned into apartments. 1500 block of E. Berks Street, a typical residential street in Fishtown, in 2007. The neighborhood has been working class for centuries; poverty grew after jobs left during the deindustrialization era, which afflicted many \\"rust belt\\" cities, Fishtown's workers continued to maintain a stable working-class community. Most long-time residents trace their ancestry to Irish, German, and Polish Catholic immigrants. In an analysis of 2013 data, Fishtown was the third most segregated white neighborhood in Philadelphia (after Girard Estates and Bridesburg), with 96% white residents. Since 2005 Fishtown has experienced moderate gentrification characterized by significant rises in housing prices and the opening of upscale art, entertainment, and dining establishments. An influx of artists and professionals has joined the ranks of police officers, fire fighters, nurses, carpenters, electricians, stonemasons, plumbers, sheet- metal workers, and teamsters. The neighborhood was chosen by the state of Pennsylvania to be the site of the SugarHouse Casino gaming complex on Delaware Avenue near Frankford Avenue. This choice deeply divided the neighborhood, causing conflict between those who believe it will bring jobs and economic development and those who believe it will lead to increased crime, addiction, and other social problems which negatively impact quality of life. A Community Benefits Agreement was reached between SugarHouse Casino and the membership of Fishtown Action and the New Kensington CDC, which will provide money for community projects that would not otherwise be available to the residents. Landmarks Green Tree Tavern The George Chandler School, Green Tree Tavern, and Penn Treaty Junior High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Borders Fishtown is the easternmost triangle of the larger surrounding Kensington District, created out of Northern Liberties Township in 1820. The Kensington District, when created, had a northern border of Norris Street, an eastern border of the Delaware River, a southern border of the Cohocksink Creek, and a western border of 6th Street. The Kensington District is not to be confused with the Kensington neighborhood of today. There has never been an official designation of this area as \\"Fishtown.\\" Locals who lived in the eastern part of the Kensington district, namely those in Philadelphia's 18th Political Ward, referred to it as Lower Kensington, as seen in early buildings and churches, until the late 1800s. Fishtown stuck as the nickname because of the shipping and fishing industries along the Delaware River. By the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the 20th century, the area was no longer being called Kensington or Lower Kensington. With the Eastern border locked as the Delaware River, the Southern border has become where Laurel Street, Frankford Avenue and Delaware Avenue meet. The Western border follows Frankford Avenue to York Street. The northern border is disputed by different peoples as either Norris Street, York Street, or Lehigh Avenue. There are three main reasons for the northern border confusion: Girard Avenue at dusk, facing northeast * Political Border (Norris Street) ** The northern border of the Kensington District, founded in 1820, was Norris Street. ** In 1854, with the consolidation of Philadelphia County and City, the northern border of Philadelphia's 18th Ward was drawn as Norris Street. ** Norris Street is the catchment border between Adaire elementary school and Hackett elementary school. * Political, Religious, and Industrial Border (York Street) ** In 1852, the Kensington District expanded from Norris Street, north on West Street (now Belgrade Street) to York Street, then east to River. ** In 1905, with the large influx of Roman Catholic immigrants to the area, a new Roman Catholic parish, Holy Name of Jesus, was created within what was St. Anne's Parish. Its northern border was designated, and remains, York Street. ** York Street is used as the northern border by the Fishtown Neighbors Association. * Current Gentrification and Real Estate Market Border (Lehigh Avenue) ** With a recent development boom in the area created in the triangle south of York Street, developers and realtors have made it fashionable to \\"extend\\" the name of Fishtown to any surrounding area. ** Lehigh Avenue is a large arterial road less conducive to pedestrian traffic. The road, along with the overpass parallel to it, form a traffic barrier between Fishtown and Port Richmond, and a clear point of transition between the neighborhoods.

Eastwood's papers are held at the Water Resources Collections and Archives, University of California, Riverside.Inventory of the John S. Eastwood Papers, 1884-1979  Early life  Mountain Dell Dam Born to Dutch parents in 1857 in Minnesota,John Samuel Eastwood from the University of California, Riverside Water Resources Collections and Archives Eastwood attended the University of Minnesota as a civil engineering student; prior to graduation in 1880 he headed west to work on railroad construction projects in the Pacific Northwest, including on the Northern Pacific Railroad.Structural Art: John S. Eastwood and the Multiple Arch Dam, Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineering In 1883, he moved to Fresno, California and established an office as civil engineer and surveyor. He became Fresno's first City Engineer in 1885, but apparently was not well suited for office‚Äìbureaucratic life and soon resigned. For the remainder of his career he focused on work within the private sector or as a consulting engineer. Early in 1895, he became chief engineer of the San Joaquin Electric Company, and was responsible for the design and construction of one of California's early hydroelectric plants. As described by George Low in the April 1896 Journal of Electricity, Eastwood employed the nascent technology of long-distance alternating current power transmission in creating a hydroelectric power system for the Fresno area. Unfortunately, the financial capabilities of the company proved insufficient to meet the great cost of constructing the dam in the remote reaches of the mountains, and, as a result, Eastwood was forced to rely on an undammed, natural supply of water to drive the turbines and generators. It was this inability to impound and store runoff that led to the demise of the San Joaquin Electric Company in 1899 after a long drought dried up the North Fork of the San Joaquin River and brought the company's power production to a standstill.  Big Creek Complex  Shortly thereafter, Eastwood became engaged with the Pacific Light and Power Company as engineer in charge of designing a large hydroelectric project on the South Fork of the San Joaquin River. This has since become known as the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project, presently operated by the Southern California Edison Company. The Pacific Light and Power Company was controlled by the famous financier and electric railroad magnate Henry Huntington. Eastwood had great hopes for the Big Creek project, and he planned it to include storage dams to ensure that a drought could not stop its power production. Hume Lake Dam, completed 1909, displaying its reinforced concrete 50-foot (15 m)-span arches resting on inclined vertical buttresses Although Big Creek was for the most part designed prior to 1907, financial difficulties associated with the Panic of 1907 delayed Huntington's ability to initiate construction for several years. While designing the Big Creek project, Eastwood had devised an inexpensive type of reinforced concrete dam design which minimized the amount of material required and, consequently, reduced construction costs. In 1908, while waiting for work on Big Creek to begin, he designed and built the Hume Lake Dam for the Hume- Bennett Lumber Company. This structure is located in the Sierra Nevada about forty-five miles south of Big Creek. The first of its kind, its completion in 1909 demonstrated the practicality of the multiple-arch design. Shortly thereafter, Eastwood received the contract for the design of a multiple-arch dam to supersede the 1884 Big Bear Valley Arch Dam near San Bernardino in Southern California. Eastwood envisaged the use of multiple-arch dams in the construction of the Big Creek project, but these hopes were dashed when, in November 1910, he was dismissed from all association with the project. Although he was awarded 5,400 shares of stock in the newly formed Pacific Light and Power Corporation (which was legally distinct from the earlier PL&P; Company), this financial interest soon disappeared when in the summer of 1912 Huntington, as majority stockholder, assessed all owners of Pacific Light and Power Corporation stock $5 per share to help pay for the construction of Big Creek. Unable to pay the assessment ($27,000) on his stock, Eastwood was forced to relinquish his stake in the PL&P; Corporation. Following this abrupt separation from the Big Creek project at the age of 53, Eastwood was left with only modest financial holdings and, as a means of survival, he began actively pursuing a career devoted to the design of multiple arch dams.  Multiple arch dams  In the early 20th century, Salt Lake City regularly experienced severe water shortages in mid-winter and late summer. To alleviate this, bonds were floated in 1914 to finance the construction of three storage dams, the largest being Mountain Dell Dam in Parley's Canyon, ten miles east of the city, that was built in two stages from 1914 to 1925. Earlier, Eastwood had built four dams in California and his reputation as dam designer was growing. He had written several articles in Western Engineering describing his Big Bear Valley Dam, Los Verjeles Dam (in Yuba County, California) and Kennedy Dam (in Jackson, California), and had also published a four-page promotional \\"supplement\\" distribution with copies of the March 1915 Western Engineering. Following the initial construction of Mountain Dell Dam, Eastwood continued his career in water resource development and dam design, becoming involved in projects in California, Idaho, Arizona, Mexico, and British Columbia. He was not an armchair engineer, and he spent much of his life in the field working on practical problems of water control. He worked as a practicing engineer until the end of his life, when, in August 1924, at the age of 67, he drowned while swimming in the Kings River east of Fresno. The Eastwood powerhouse at Shaver Lake, California was named after him. Built in 1987, the 200 MW pumped storage hydroelectric plant is located underground and was carved out of solid granite.

The film is a semi-autobiographical account of his childhood growing up in Baltimore in the 1950s. It is the fourth of Levinson's tetralogy \\"Baltimore Films\\", set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: Diner (1982), Tin Men (1987) and Avalon (1990). Plot summary In the fall of 1954, the Kurtzmans, a Jewish family, live in Forest Park, a suburban neighborhood in the northwest section of Baltimore. Nate, the father, runs a burlesque theatre, and engages in a numbers racket. His wife Ada stays home and takes care of the household. Van, the older son, attends the University of Baltimore, while Ben is finishing his final year in high school. Ben meets Sylvia, an African-American girl, who begins attending his school after the district has been integrated. Ben immediately starts to develop feelings towards Sylvia, and introduces himself. The two become close based on a mutual love for Little Richard, James Brown, jazz, and black comedians. Sylvia's father, an affluent doctor, disapproves of their relationship and forbids them to see one another. On Halloween, Ben dresses up as Adolf Hitler, which offends his parents greatly. Van and his friends head over to a party in a predominantly bourgeois, gentile section of town. Van is attracted to a mysterious blonde woman. A fight between one of Van's buddies and a gentile erupts and Trey, one of the party-goers, drunkenly crashes his car into the house. Van must leave the mystery woman. Trey goes to court for the car crash. Van and his friends are there as witnesses. After the court session expires, Van asks several of the other party attendants about the blonde woman he met. Trey discovers that the girl Van has fallen in love with is Dubbie, Trey's own girlfriend. Meanwhile, Nate's burlesque theatre has problems. In order to boost returns on the numbers game, an additional bonus number is added which will increase the pay-off. Little Melvin, a local drug dealer, makes a large bet, defies expectations and hits the number. Unable to pay on such big win, Nate is forced to cut Melvin a 'slice of the pie'. When Nate offers Melvin the numbers business instead, Melvin claims that Nate is trying to \\"Jew\\" him out of his money and a fight breaks out between their bodyguards. Sylvia gives Ben two tickets to see James Brown & The Famous Flames in concert. At the concert Ben and his friend are the only white patrons in the audience. Van and his friends head out to a gathering, where he again runs into Dubbie and learns of her relationship with Trey. Little Melvin then spots Nate's car off of Pennsylvania Avenue in the African-American neighborhood where James Brown is in concert and after seeing Ben and his friend inside, he deduces that one of them must be Nate's son. After the concert, Melvin abducts Ben, Sylvia, and their friends from the concert in a payback to Nate's racket. Van has word that Trey is in surgery after a car accident. He and Dubbie go see him in Virginia. Nate and his associates at the nightclub are charged and booked with prostitution and racketeering. Before leaving for prison, he manages to attend Ben and Sylvia's high school graduation. She is attending Spelman College in Atlanta; he is staying to attend the University of Maryland. Ben's family is attending a Jewish ceremony as the father walks out of the synagogue and blows a kiss to his wife.

The programme is normally broadcast live and unedited on Thursday mornings at 9a.m., lasting around 42 minutes, and is then available online. He begins each episode with a short summary of the week's topic, then introduces the three guests. He guides the discussion along a generally chronological route, then either concludes the programme himself or invites summation remarks from one of the specialists. History In Our Time was conceived for Bragg in 1998 after he was forced to quit his decade-long role as presenter for Start the Week due to a perceived conflict of interest arising from his appointment as a Labour life peer. He was offered the Thursday \\"death-slot\\" and decided he would \\"do what [he] always wanted to do,\\" and \\"hastily battered out a simple idea\\" with producer Olivia Seligman expecting the show would only last a few months. By September 1999, he had taken a time slot that was previously attracting an audience of 600,000 and grown it to 1.5 million. By 2000, the half-hour show was expanded to 45 minutes and to include three guest speakers. In 2004, the programme was made available as a podcast from the BBC website and iTunes for one week after broadcast. Until July 2014, listeners could also sign up for weekly email newsletters from Bragg, where he mentioned any additional information relating to the programme, along with snippets from his own personal and intellectual life. In 2009, selected transcripts of episodes from the programme were compiled in the book In Our Time: A Companion to the Radio 4 series, edited by Bragg. Since 2010, every episode of the programme has been available from its website as streaming audio, making it one of the first BBC programmes to have its entire archive released. Since 2011, the entire archive has been available to download as individual podcasts. Cultural impact The programme is considered one of the BBC's most successful projects, acknowledged to have \\"transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time\\". Frequent contributors to the programme since 1998 include A. C. Grayling, Angie Hobbs, Ian Stewart, Simon Schaffer, Martin Palmer, John Mullan, Steve Jones and Carolin Crawford. In 2005, listeners were invited to vote in a popularity contest for the \\"greatest philosopher in history\\" with the winner selected as the subject of the final programme before the summer break. With 30,000 votes cast, the contest was won by Karl Marx with 27.9% of the votes. Other shortlisted figures were David Hume (12.7%), Ludwig Wittgenstein (6.8%), Friedrich Nietzsche (6.5%), Plato (5.6%), Immanuel Kant (5.6%), Thomas Aquinas (4.8%), Socrates (4.8%), Aristotle (4.5%) and Karl Popper (4.2%).In Our Time's Greatest Philosopher Result from the BBC Radio 4 website The poll was controversial but led to widespread reporting, and a boost in the programme's overall listenership, as various UK celebrities and news outlets championed their favourites.

LIMF features live art, new circus, clown, object and physical theatre at various central London venues. It was established in 1977 by Joseph Seelig and Nola Rae and it is the longest running event of its kind in the world. 'The aesthetic outlook of the London International Mime Festival, founded in 1977, remains evergreen, varied and vital. The works of physical/ visual theatre programmed by its astute co- directors enliven the typically bone-chilling post-holiday doldrums.'

Universal Parks & Resorts is best known for attractions and lands based on famous classic and modern pop culture properties (movies, television, literature, cartoons, comics, video games, music, etc.) from not only NBCUniversal, but also third-party companies, for all of its parks. It started as a touring attraction in the 1910s at the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City near Los Angeles, California, and in 1964 turned into a Universal Studios Hollywood theme park destination, where guests can look behind the scenes of motion pictures and television programs, produced by Universal Pictures and occasionally others, and ride the attraction based on the world's favorite feature films and television shows. The popularity of Universal Studios Hollywood had led Universal to build parks in Florida and overseas. In 2017, approximately 49,458,000 guests visited Universal Studios theme parks, making it the third-largest amusement park operator in the world. It is a major competitor of Cedar Fair, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, Six Flags, and Merlin Entertainments. In August 2020, a report released by Deutsche Bank revealed that the Universal Orlando theme park had surpassed Disney World in total attendance. Current theme parks=Universal Studios Hollywood Universal Studios Hollywood became the first Universal Studios theme park when it opened its doors on July 15, 1964, long after it was originated as a studio tour in 1915, after the Universal original founder, Carl Laemmle, opened Universal City, California near Los Angeles. In May 1993, Universal CityWalk opened outside the gates of the theme park, featuring 65 entertainment-themed restaurants, nightclubs, shops, and entertainment spots. It also contains the Cinemark Universal CityWalk Cinemas, offering 19 screens including an IMAX Theatre and stadium- style seating. Approximately 415 acres (1.7 km¬≤) is within and around the surrounding area of Universal City, including its theme park and the film studio adjacent nearby. Universal Orlando Resort Universal Orlando Resort (formerly called Universal Studios Escape) opened to the public on June 7, 1990, in Orlando, Florida, starting at Universal Studios Florida. It features themed areas and attractions based on the film industry. On May 28, 1999, Universal Orlando had expanded into a vacation resort, with the opening of Islands of Adventure theme park, featuring various themed islands which emphasized adventures and characters embodied in the attractions. Simultaneously, Universal CityWalk was added to accommodate the guests within the resort leading to the two parks. Loews Portofino Bay Hotel at Universal Orlando hotel opened at Universal Orlando Resort in September 1999, followed by Hard Rock Hotel in December 2000, Loews Royal Pacific Resort in February 2001, Cabana Bay Beach Resort on March 31, 2014, Loews Sapphire Falls Resort on July 7, 2016, and Universal's Aventura Hotel on August 16, 2018. In 1998, Universal Orlando acquired Wet 'n Wild water park (founded in 1977 by Seaworld founder George Millay) and was the company's main water park until it closed on December 31, 2016, where it was replaced by another water park Volcano Bay, which opened on May 25, 2017. The new water park consists of 18 attractions, including slides, two lazy rivers and raft rides. It is also Universal's first park to be not be based on various famous propertie. The park includes two volcano themed rides: the Ko'okiri Body Plunge, a 70-degree-angle, 125-foot water slide; and the Krakatau Aqua Coaster, a canoe ride traveling among the peaks and valleys of the central volcano in the park. The park also gives each visitor a wristband when they buy their ticket. The wristband allows guests to check in for rides and circumvents having to stand in line. In August 2019, Universal announced its third theme park called ‚ÄúEpic Universe‚Äú, which is to include lands and attractions based on Nintendo, Universal Monsters, and DreamWorks Animation, among others, and is scheduled to open around 2024. Universal Studios Japan After almost three years of construction, Universal Studios Japan opened on March 31, 2001, in the Konohana-ku district of Osaka, Japan, and was the first Universal Studios theme park to open outside of the U.S. It was also the first Universal theme park to operate within the Asian region. The park incorporates attractions from both Universal Orlando and Hollywood and features a CityWalk district, a shopping mall with multiple official Universal hotels and many restaurants and shops, including stores selling Universal Studios merchandise and Osaka souvenirs. The theme park occupies an area of 108 acres and is the most visited amusement park in Japan after its rival Tokyo Disney Resort. Universal Studios Singapore Construction of the Singapore park began within Resorts World Sentosa on Sentosa, Singapore on April 19, 2008. Universal Studios Singapore was given a soft opening on March 18, 2010 and later a wide opening on May 28, 2011. It was the second Universal Studios theme park to operate on Asia and also the first in Southeast Asia. Like other Universal theme parks, it features attractions from various Universal and other studio companies' properties, including Jurassic Park, Madagascar, Shrek, The Mummy, Waterworld, Transformers, and others. The land it currently sits on is 20 hectares (49 acres) in size, which occupies the easternmost part of the 49-hectare (120-acre) Resorts World Sentosa, and is marketed as a \\"one-of-its-kind theme park in Asia\\". However, it has no Universal CityWalk District since it already has a resort shopping mall and restaurants adjacent near the park. Unlike other Universal theme parks, Universal Studios Singapore is owned by Genting Group with the licensing approval from Universal Parks & Resorts. Steven Spielberg's relationship with Universal Parks & Resorts Director Steven Spielberg has a long-time collaboration with Universal Parks & Resorts due to his relationship with Universal Studios while working as a Universal intern staff in the late 1960s as well as the films he directed or produced for the studio, such as Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Back to the Future, The Land Before Time, Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. In March 1987, Spielberg signed on to be a creative consultant for Universal theme parks when the Music Corporation of America (MCA)‚Äîthen owner of Universal Studios‚Äîwas planning to build its first full-fledged theme park in Orlando in an effort to compete with Walt Disney World. Universal Parks Chairman and CEO Thomas L. Williams stated in regards to praising the Universal Creative team and a few popular people for the new Florida park: Since 1987, Spielberg has consulted on a dozen attractions, included E.T. Adventure, Jaws, Jurassic Park: The Ride, and The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. In exchange, he receives 2% of all park ticket revenue and a portion of park concession receipts generated by Universal theme parks in Florida, Japan, and Singapore in perpetuity, valued at up to $30 to 50 million a year; the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park in Los Angeles is not covered under the Spielberg deal. The director also got the opportunity to trigger a June 2017 exit deal clause and collect a lump sum payment equal to the value of the contracts. Comcast, the current parent company of Universal, acknowledged that this payment could already be worth as much as $535 million. Some analysts predicted that the one-time payment could ultimately be $1 billion. The deal also prevents any film Spielberg worked as a director to go to any rival theme park but Universal; the exception is the Indiana Jones movies, which Spielberg directed, but with the story entirely created, written, and held by his long-time friend George Lucas, who regularly worked with Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products as their creative consultant in attractions like Star Tours, Captain EO, Indiana Jones Adventure, and ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter. Future theme parks=Universal Beijing Resort Universal Beijing Resort is the upcoming Universal theme park that will open in May 2021 in Beijing, China. It will feature rides and attractions themed primarily to Universal-owned movies, TV shows, animation, and music, and as well as licensed properties from other companies (e.g. Warner Bros., etc.). The project was announced on October 13, 2014, with more than 20 billion RMB being invested into the project. It will be jointly owned by Beijing Shouhuan Cultural Tourism Investment Co., Ltd. (BSH Investment), a consortium of four state-owned companies, and Universal Parks & Resorts. As of 2020, the park is currently in construction. Universal Studios Moscow Universal Studios Moscow is an upcoming indoor theme park and entertainment complex opening in 2022. Universal's Epic Universe Universal 's Epic Universe is a upcoming theme park coming to Universal Orlando Resort in 2024. It will have a Super Nintendo World section in the park.

It is owned and operated by La Caixa banking group's investment vehicle Criteria, but as of 2005 the Universal name has been dropped from the branding, and the resort was once again named 'PortAventura' (the space in the name is deliberately left out for trademark reasons).

It draws its name from Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, home of Marshall College from 1836 until its merger with Franklin College (Lancaster, Pennsylvania) in 1853, and also home to the seminary of the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS) from 1837 until its relocation to Lancaster in 1871.  History  Although the seminary existed prior to 1844, Mercersburg Theology began in earnest in that year with the hiring of Philip Schaff to join John Williamson Nevin on staff at the seminary. Schaff sparked off controversy with his inaugural address, which was later published as Principle of Protestantism. This led to a series of articles written against Professor Schaff‚Äôs view by fellow RCUS pastor Joseph Berg. Several other magazines attacked Schaff and Nevin over their controversial position concerning the relation of the Reformed churches to the Roman Catholic Church. The RCUS was divided on the issue, as the Philadelphia Classis condemned Schaff‚Äôs theology, while the East Pennsylvania Classis defended it. The Synod took up the issue in 1845 and cleared Schaff and Principle of Protestantism by a vote of 37 to 3. This marked the only time Schaff was brought before the Synod on heresy charges; the Synod ruled that further complaints had to be registered with the Board of Visitors (trustees) of the Mercersburg Seminary, which never allowed any more complaints to go before the Synod for trial. The controversy did not end with the clearing of Professor Schaff, however. Professor Nevin published The Mystical Presence, a book about the Lord's Supper, in 1846. Nevin argued for an objective efficacy in the sacrament and that the atonement is brought about by the person of Christ, rather than his work. This brought about many reactions both from inside and outside the church, with the most famous critiques made by Joseph Berg and later by Professor Charles Hodge of Princeton Seminary, the latter a confessional Presbyterian. Spokesmen for both sides in the debate claimed fidelity to, and continuation of, the Reformed tradition. Nevin and Schaff advanced the movement further when they began the Mercersburg Review periodical in 1849. The publication provoked the departure of several prominent RCUS ministers and churches, including Joseph Berg in 1851, as well as the Germantown Reformed Church and its pastor Jacob Helfenstein, and the entire North Carolina Classis, all in 1853. During the 1850s the RCUS also fought over the use of a liturgy. In general the Mercersburg men favored the new liturgy, which they helped write with Nevin on the committee, and the \\"Old Reformed Party\\" (the opponents), rejected it as innovative and as contrary to Reformed doctrine. The controversy, which came perilously close to causing a schism between the factions, continued until 1878, when the General Synod established a peace commission. The General Synod of 1884 approved a liturgy that was approved by the required number of Classes (first-level judicatories, equivalent to presbyteries). The controversy between the two parties ended in a compromise liturgy, and with each side having its own educational institutions: Mercersburg Seminary and Franklin and Marshall College for the Mercersburg Movement, and Ursinus College for the Old Reformed Party.Good, J.I.: \\"The History of the Reformed Church in the United States in the Nineteenth Century\\", The James I Good Collection, 2004 In 1866 Samuel Miller wrote a defense of Mercersburg theology over and against Modernist theology, which he saw as a threat. He argued that Mercersburg theology assumes certain innate truths which apply to all people at all times in all places, while Modernist theology was rationalistic and depended on empirical and rationalist evidences to rest its foundational beliefs upon, which inevitably leads to infidelity. By the early 20th century, though, much of the controversy had been rendered moot by three factors. First, the rise of the strongly Protestant neo-orthodox movement among scholars and some RCUS clergy gained ascendence over the romanticism and metaphysics on which Mercersburg was largely based. Second, the resistance to at least modest liturgical innovations by some Old Reformed parishes gradually disappeared under the influence of the ecumenical liturgical movement. Finally, the RCUS' merger with the Evangelical Synod of North America in 1934 brought a significant pietist constituency to the new denomination, as well as a more mediating approach to doctrine, thereby reducing the polemical style of past generations. The seminary continues to this day (under the name Lancaster Theological Seminary), and its theology and influence still continue today, albeit in moderation, in congregations of the United Church of Christ descended from Reformed congregations which carried out the party's platform.  Theology  John Nevin summarized the Mercersburg Theology, or Movement, by saying, \\"Its cardinal principle is the fact of the Incarnation.\\" He explained that by adding, \\"Christ saves the world, not ultimately by what He teaches or by what He does, but by what He is in the constitution of His own person.\\"Nevin, John: \\"Letter to Dr. Henry Harbaugh\\", pg. 498. Catholic and Reformed Selected Theological Writings of John Williamson Nevin, 1978 Nevin's most popular work was The Mystical Presence, a study of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Another significant aspect of the Mercersburg Theology is the view of history and theology found in Philip Schaff's Principle of Protestantism. In this work, Schaff takes a Hegelian model of history and applies it to the history of theology. Theology must come to one final synthesis, as Schaff expressed in his remark that \\"the Reformation must be regarded as still incomplete. It needs yet its concluding act to unite what has fallen asunder, to bring the subjective to a reconciliation with the objective.\\"Schaff, Philip: \\"The Principle of Protestantism, pg. 225-226. Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2004. By this, he proposes a reunion of the subjective doctrines of Protestantism with the objective character of the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, an outworking of this belief is a generous ecumenism extended toward all, especially toward Roman Catholics. Another contributor to the Hegelian approach of Mercersburg Theology was Friederich Augustus Rauch, especially through his work Psychology.Joseph Henry Dubbs, The Reformed Church in Pennsylvania, Lancaster, PA: Pennsylvania German Society, 1902: 295-312. A more objective liturgy was advocated by both of these founding principles of Mercersburg Theology, and all the major adherents of the movement favored an altar-based liturgy as opposed to pulpit-centered worship, i.e., centered on a lengthy sermon. This included more formal prayers, an altar rather than a table for the Lord's Supper, and a sacramental sensibility. These changes represent a movement in the direction of Lutheranism. The Merscersburg Society was founded in 1983 to maintain the sacramental and ecclesial approach of the theology. It publishes The New Mercersburg Review and holds an annual summer convocation. In 2012 Wipf and Stock began publishing critical, annotated editions of major works of Schaff, Nevin and their associates in The Mercersburg Theology Study Series. Seven volumes had been published by 2017.  Characteristic  Most distinctive is the idealist hermeneutic which stood (and stands) in contrast to the common sense realism of Hodge and subsequent American Reformed theology, i.e. Nevin starts with the whole before the parts, and the whole is indeed greater than the sum of the parts. Within this hermeneutical context, Mercersburg also prioritizes the Incarnation as a theological lens which - as one might suppose - has vast theological implications. The result is a thoroughgoing ecclesiology and sacramentology that opposes a number of theological dualisms and heavily forensic soteriologies.

It consists of 60 verses (ƒÅyƒÅt). The term R√ªm originated in the word \\"Romans\\" and in the time of Prophet Muhammad referred to the Byzantine Greeks (Eastern Roman Empire), hence the title is sometimes also translated as \\"The Greeks\\" or \\"The Byzantines\\". Chronology Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. Parts of Q30:38-50 are preserved in the ·π¢an‚ÄòƒÅ‚Äô1 lower text.Behnam Sadeghi & Mohsen Goudarzi, \\"Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran\\", Der Islam, 87 (2012), 37. According to Theodor N√∂ldeke, ar-R≈´m was the second-to-last Meccan surah and the eighty-fourth surah chronologically; however, he argues its 17th ayah was revealed during the Medinan period. While the first ayah of the surah refers to the defeat of the Byzantine Empire at the hands of the Sasanian Empire near Damascus in the spring of 614, N√∂ldeke notes that this does not necessarily indicate 614 was the year in which the surah was revealed. According to al-Tabari, it refers to the Battle of Adhri'at in 614, but this battle is ignored in other sources. Content The surah begins by noting the recent defeat of the Byzantines by the Persians at the Battle of Antioch. This defeat posed a significant theological and sociological problem for the early Muslim community because the Byzantines were Christians and considered monotheists while the state that defeated them were considered dualists because the official religion was Zoroastrianism. This chapter is in part a response to the non-Muslim Meccans, who took this victory as a sign that the traditional polytheistic practices would win out over monotheism.Ma·∏•allƒ´, JalƒÅl al-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad ibn A·∏•mad, Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´, and ·π¢afƒ´ al- Ra·∏•mƒÅn MubƒÅrakf≈´rƒ´. 2002. Tafsƒ´r al-JalƒÅlayn. RiyƒÅ·∏ç: DƒÅr al-SalƒÅm. In the third and fourth ayatayn, the Muslim community is promised that the Byzantines will reverse their defeat into a victory \\"in a few years' time\\".Abdel Haleem, M. A. 2004. The Qur ºan. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 257. Muslims believe this prophecy was fulfilled with Heraclius' campaign of 622, the Roman victory over Persians and cite it as an example of the miraculous nature of the Quran. Literary units In his tafsir, entitled \\"In the Shade of the Qur'an\\", Sayyid Qutb divides the surah into two halves, verses 1-32 and verses 33-60.Qutb, Sayyid. In the shade of the Quran. Vol. 13. Alexandria, Va.: Al Saadawi Publications, 1997. Each section begins with an assertion of God's grace and mercy and ends with encouragement for Muhammad and his community. First Section: \\"Signs to Reflect Upon\\" * \\"The Natural Bond of Faith\\" Notes the Byzantine defeat and prophesies a coming victory promised by God * \\"To Whom Power Belongs\\" Declares the truth of the universe * \\"Invitation to Reflect\\" Reminds the believers of the fates of other disobedient communities * \\"Two Divergent Wars\\" Describes the Last Judgment * \\"Scene of God's Glory,\\" \\"The Cycle of Life and Death,\\" and \\"Man and the Universe\\" Offers praise for God and all His powers and signs * \\"Analogy Drawn from Human Life\\" Uses a metaphor about slavery to condemn the sin of shirk * \\" Concluding Directive to Prophet\\" Urges the listeners to turn to the truth and resist dividing into sects Second Section: \\"Bringing Life out of the Dead\\" * \\"Vacillating Conditions\\" Reassures the Muslim community of God's mercy and grace for true believers and offers suggestions for behavior like giving to the needy or avoiding usury * \\"Corruption and Pollution\\" Reminds people of the promise of resurrection at the Last Judgment and the fates of polytheist communities * \\"Aspects of God's Grace\\" Emphasizes resurrection as one of signs of God's mercy and grace when believers lose hope * \\"The Different Stages of Man's Life\\" Describes the weakness and folly of man and the fate of evildoers at the Last Judgment * \\"No Change of Position\\" Decries the nonbelievers who refuse to listen to Muhammad but asserts that God leads astray who he wills * Urges Muhammad and his community to persevere Major themes The main theme of this surah is the contrast between monotheism and polytheism. In addition to making logical arguments against ascribing partners to God, several verses outline the differing fate for idolaters and believers. The unity of God is also emphasized with descriptions of the glory of God through illustrations of His wondrous signs and His miraculous creation. Sample verse Surah 30 includes a verse comparing the association of partners with God, which is the sin of shirk, to the relationship between a master and his slaves.

The name was used for many different theatres and music halls, of which the London Hippodrome is one of only a few survivors. Hippodrome is an archaic word referring to places that host horse races and other forms of equestrian entertainment. History=Hippodrome The London Hippodrome was opened in 1900. It was designed by Frank Matcham for Moss Empires chaired by Edward Moss and built for ¬£250,000 as a hippodrome for circus and variety performances. The venue gave its first show on 15 January 1900,London Hippodrome (Special feature, September 2003, Arthur Lloyd) accessed 18 October 2007. a music hall revue entitled \\"Giddy Ostend\\" with Little Tich. The conductor was Georges Jacobi.Silk Programme for the Hippodrome (1900) ‚Äì Victoria and Albert Museum Collection Entry to the venue was through a bar, dressed as a ship's saloon. The performance space featured both a proscenium stage and an arena that sank into a 230 ft, 100,000 gallon water tank (about 400 tons, when full) for aquatic spectacles. The tank featured eight central fountains, and a circle of fountains around the side. Entrances at the side of the auditorium could also be flooded, and used for the entry of boats.Theatre Programme for 30 July 1900, see Arthur Lloyd site. Shows included equestrian acts, elephants and polar bears, and acrobats would dive from a minstrels' gallery above a sliding roof, in the centre of the proscenium arch. The auditorium featured cantilevered galleries, removing the columns that often obstructed views in London theatres, the whole was covered by a painted glass retractable roof, that could be illuminated at night. The building included the headquarters of Moss Empires.Hip events (History section) accessed 18 October 2007. Theatre 1909‚Äì1951 In 1909, it was reconstructed by Matcham as a music-hall and variety theatre with 1340 seats in stalls, mezzanine, gallery, and upper gallery levels. It was here that Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake received its English premi√®re by the Ballets Russes in 1910. The Albert de Courville revues were performed here from December 1912. The Hippodrome hosted the first official jazz gig in the United Kingdom, by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, in 1919. Its reputation was for revue and musical comedy, among them The Five O'Clock Girl, the West End production of Vincent Youmans' hit Broadway musical Hit The Deck (1928) and also Mr. Cinders, both in 1929; Ivor Novello's Perchance to Dream in 1945 with Margaret Rutherford; and the revue High Spirits in 1953 with Cyril Ritchard and Diana Churchill. Julie Andrews made her stage debut here at the age of 12. From 1949 to 1951 it was the London equivalent of the Folies Berg√®re. The Talk of the Town The original interior was demolished in 1958, and Bernard Delfont had the Hippodrome converted into the nightclub The Talk of the Town. It featured appearances by many of the popular artistes of the time,Performers at The Talk of the Town. including Diana Ross & The Supremes, Judy Garland, accessed 18 October 2007 Eartha Kitt, Shirley Bassey,Shirley Bassey Live at Talk of the Town (#38 1970).

Tony Bennett set his 1972 series for Thames Television, Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town, there. This form of entertainment, in its turn, fell out of public favour, and the venue closed in 1982. In 2009, the Hippodrome was named by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of 12 venues which had made the most important contributions to jazz music in the United Kingdom.\\"Buckingham Palace hits right note with jazz fans\\" , London Evening Standard (3 August 2009). The musical drama End of the Rainbow, nominated for a number of Olivier Awards in 2011 during its London run and Tony Awards in 2012 while on Broadway, is set at the Talk of The Town during a Judy Garland engagement there near the end of her life. The London Hippodrome Renovated yet again, the building was reopened as a nightclub/restaurant called The London Hippodrome by nightclub tycoon Peter Stringfellow in 1983. Some years later, Stringfellow sold it to a chain company called European Leisure. Under the stewardship of David Chipping the club went on to win many BEDA and DI awards, regularly attracting crowds in excess of 2,000. Following its sale to Luminar the club soon went out of fashion; it was not until April 2004 that the Hippodrome regained its standing, when it was transformed into Cirque at the Hippodrome. The interior was taken back to hues of reds and golds, and burlesque was the theme. Cirque at the Hippodrome won the BEDA award for best UK nightclub in 2004. It was revealed in October 2005 that the club had lost its public drinks licence and would no longer be able to serve alcohol, as the local police did not want what they called \\"vertical drinking\\" (the majority of patrons standing rather than sitting) in Leicester Square. The police also shut down most of the venues in the local area. Following this, in December 2005, the club was eventually forced to close, following reports of violence involving rival gangs after they had left the building of the Hippodrome, which reflected on its closure later in Westminster licensing court. The Hippodrome Events Space & Theatre  In January 2006, entrepreneur Charmaine Haig took over the lease of the Hippodrome building on a short term before a casino licence application could be secured for future use. Haig initially maintained and managed the empty venue on her own, and then changed the venue's name back to the London Hippodrome from its previous name of Cirque. Shortly afterward, Haig's in-house events company, Hip Events, began running private events in the venue, but once again using the space to its full capacity as a variety venue with album launches, dance shows, gala dinners, awards ceremonies and Leicester Square film premiere after parties. In 2008, Haig and her business partner acquired a theatre licence for the venue and subsequently turned the venue back into a theatre. The adult cabaret show La Clique was found at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2008; by the beginning of October 2008, the show previewed at the London Hippodrome with great success, and stayed running until the end of Haig's Hippodrome lease in June 2009. During this time, the show La Clique at the Hippodrome won an Olivier Award in 2009, in the \\"Best Entertainment\\" category. The Hippodrome Casino In 2009, the lease on the Hippodrome was acquired by Leicester-born father and son entrepreneurs Jimmy and Simon Thomas, who began an extensive restoration programme taking the Hippodrome back to Matcham's original designs for use as a casino and entertainment venue. During the planning stage, the adjacent Cranbourn Mansions building became available and plans were redrafted to incorporate this former gentlemen's apartment block into the design, doubling the eventual floorspace and linked using a new structure sited within the existing light well between the two buildings. Investment in the building reportedly came to over ¬£40 million, the funds being raised by the Thomas family from the sale of a number of bingo halls prior to the UK smoking ban, which made it illegal to smoke within an enclosed workplace, on 1 July 2007. The Hippodrome Casino was opened on 13 July 2012 by Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who described it as \\"yet another ringing endorsement of London as a great place to invest\\". The venue on opening included four floors of gaming, including a Gold Room casino sited in the original basement with access directly into Chinatown to the rear of the building, Heliot restaurant, six bars, a smoking terrace and The Matcham Room cabaret theatre. The restoration and construction of the casino was followed on the blog of LBC presenter Steve Allen. In January 2013 the casino was awarded Best Land-based Casino at the Totally Gaming Awards, which also gave Jimmy Thomas a Life Achievement award for his contribution to the gaming and entertainment industries. The Matcham Room at the Hippodrome Casino is currently the home of nationally renowned Boom & Bang Circus (created and produced by Bioux \\"Boom\\" Hayes and Kitty Bang Bang) and Soho Burlesque featuring co producer Miss Polly Rae (Hurly Burly Show by William Baker) and London's burlesque elite. It is also the London residency of the internationally renowned The Definitive Rat Pack On 4 March 2013, Simon Thomas announced the opening of Pokerstars LIVE, a collaboration between the Hippodrome and Pokerstars, the world's largest online poker website.

Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries An early use of the word was in self-denigration: on 31 August 1869, Swiss philosopher Henri-Fr√©d√©ric Amiel wrote in his diary: It soon acquired its usual meaning where a claimed skeptic is accused of excessive sureness in turning initial doubts into certainties. In 1908 Henry Louis Mencken wrote on Friedrich Nietzsche's criticism of philosopher David Strauss that: Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Frederick L. Will used the term \\"pseudo-skepticism\\" in 1942. Alasdair MacIntyre writes: Notre Dame Professor of English, John E. Sitter used the term in 1977 in a discussion of Alexander Pope: \\"Pope's intent, I believe, is to chasten the reader's skepticism ‚Äî the pseudo-skepticism of the overly confident 'you' ... \\"John E.

He argued that scientific skepticism is agnostic to new ideas, making no claims about them but waiting for them to satisfy a burden of proof before granting them validity. Pseudoskepticism, by contrast, involves \\"negative hypotheses\\"‚Äîtheoretical assertions that some belief, theory, or claim is factually wrong‚Äîwithout satisfying the burden of proof that such negative theoretical assertions would require.\\"Marcello Truzzi: Helped form the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal\\", The San Diego Union Tribune, February 15, 2003\\"Marla vs. Pollock: Who‚Äôs the Fraudiest?\\" LA Weekly, October 10, 2007\\"The plain truth about legal truth\\" Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, January 1, 2003 In 1987, while working as a professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University, Truzzi gave the following description of pseudoskeptics in the journal Zetetic Scholar (which he founded): Truzzi attributed the following characteristics to pseudoskeptics: #Denying, when only doubt has been established #Double standards in the application of criticism #The tendency to discredit rather than investigate #Presenting insufficient evidence or proof #Assuming criticism requires no burden of proof #Making unsubstantiated counter-claims #Counter-claims based on plausibility rather than empirical evidence #Suggesting that unconvincing evidence provides grounds for completely dismissing a claim He characterized true skepticism as: #Acceptance of doubt when neither assertion nor denial has been established #No burden of proof to take an agnostic position #Agreement that the corpus of established knowledge must be based on what is proved, but recognising its incompleteness #Even-handedness in requirement for proofs, whatever their implication #Accepting that a failure of a proof in itself proves nothing #Continuing examination of the results of experiments even when flaws are found  Subsequent usage  Psychiatrist Richard Kluft noted that pseudoskepticism can inhibit research progress: Susan Blackmore, who lost her initial belief in parapsychology and in 1991 became a CSICOP fellow, later described what she termed the \\"worst kind of pseudoskepticism\\": Hugo Anthony Meynell from the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary, labels the \\"extreme position that all significant evidence supporting paranormal phenomena is a result of deception or lies\\" as pseudoskepticism.Michael Stoeber, Hugo Anthony Meynell, Critical Reflections on the Paranormal, SUNY Press, 1996, , page 16 While Truzzi's characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views whom he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as \\"skeptics\\" despite cherry picking evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of AIDS denial are indulging in \\"bogus scepticism\\" when they argue in this way.Richard Wilson, \\"Against the Evidence\\", New Statesman, 18 September 2008 Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it \\"centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position\\".Richard C.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it has been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.

In the 1730s the Christian translator, George Sale entitled the chapter AdorationGeorge Sale translation  Revelation history  According to the Islamic tradition, the chapter was revealed during the Meccan phase of Muhammad's prophethood. Some scholars argue, based on attaching occasions of revelations, that several verses (some say verses 16‚Äì20, some say only 18‚Äì20, some say only 16) are from Medinan phase, but the arguments are not widely accepted. For example, Mahmud al-Alusi opines that the close connection between these verses and the preceding ones means that they are likely from the same period. The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 75th chapter by the order of revelation (after Al-Mu'minoon), while the N√∂ldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor N√∂ldeke) puts it as the 70th.  Content  The first half of the chapter covers some of Islam's theological concepts, including revelation, God, creation of human beings, resurrection and the judgment day. The second half discusses the contrast between those who \\"fall prostate\\" before God and those who \\"turns away\\" from God's sign. The chapter then mentions the Children of Israel as an example of people who follow God's guidance through Moses.

In humans, clusterin is encoded by the CLU gene on chromosome 8. CLU is a molecular chaperone responsible for aiding protein folding of secreted proteins, and its three isoforms have been differentially implicated in pro- or antiapoptotic processes. Through this function, CLU is involved in many diseases related to oxidative stress, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, inflammatory diseases, and aging. Structure The CLU gene contains nine exons and expresses three isoforms alternatively-spliced at the first exon. The encoded protein isoforms all localize to different subcellular compartments: one isoform localizes to the nucleus; a second isoform localizes to the cytoplasm; and the third is secreted from the cell. They also perform opposing functions: the nuclear CLU binds Ku70 to release BAX and induce apoptosis, whereas the cytosolic and secretory isoforms inhibit apoptosis. The nuclear isoform encodes a 49 kDa protein, while the secretory isoform, which is the main gene transcript, encodes a 75‚Äì80 kDa protein after maturation (glycosylation, secretion, and dimerization). The mature protein is a 449-residue, heterodimeric, disulfide-linked glycoprotein composed of two subunits of 40 kDa Œ±- and Œ≤-chains.  Function  Clusterin was first identified in ram rete testis fluid where it showed signs of clustering with rat sertoli cells and erythrocytes, hence its name. CLU is a member of the small heat shock protein family and, thus, a molecular chaperone. Unlike most other chaperone proteins, which aid intracellular proteins, CLU is a Golgi chaperone that facilitates the folding of secreted proteins in an ATP- independent way. The gene is highly conserved in species, and the protein is widely distributed in many tissues and organs, where it participates in a number of biological processes, including lipid transport, membrane recycling, cell adhesion, programmed cell death, and complement-mediated cell lysis. Overexpression of the secretory CLU isoform protects the cell from apoptosis induced by cellular stress, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or androgen/estrogen depletion. CLU promotes cell survival by a number of means, including inhibition of BAX on the mitochondrial membrane, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway, modulation of extracellularular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling and matrix metallopeptidase-9 expression, promotion of angiogenesis, and mediation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Œ∫B) pathway. Meanwhile, its downregulation allows for p53 activation, which then skews the proapoptotic:antiapoptotic ratio of present Bcl-2 family members, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. p53 may also transcriptionally repress secretory CLU to further promote the proapoptotic cascade.  Clinical associations  Two independent genome- wide association studies found a statistical association between a SNP within the clusterin gene and the risk of having Alzheimer's disease. Further studies have suggested that people who already have Alzheimer's disease have more clusterin in their blood, and that clusterin levels in blood correlate with faster cognitive decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, but have not found that clusterin levels predicted the onset of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, CLU is involved in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease. CLU may promote tumorigenesis by facilitating BAX-KLU70 binding and, consequently, preventing BAX from localizing to the outer mitochondrial membrane to stimulate cell death. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, CLU functions to regulate ERK 1/2 signaling and matrix metallopeptidase-9 expression to promote tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. In epithelial ovarian cancer, CLU has been observed to promote angiogenesis and chemoresistance. Other pathways CLU participates in to downplay apoptosis in tumor cells include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and NF-Œ∫B pathway. Unlike most other cancers, which feature upregulated CLU levels to enhance tumor cell survival, testicular seminoma features downregulated CLU levels, allowing for increased sensitivity to chemotherapy treatments. Other cancers CLU has been implicated in include breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma. As evident by its key roles in cancer development, CLU can serve as a therapeutic target for fighting tumor growth and chemoresistance. Studies revealed that inhibition of CLU resulted in increased effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents to kill tumor cells. In particular, custirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide that blocks the CLU mRNA transcript, enhanced heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor activity by suppressing the heat-shock response in castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and is currently in phase III trials. CLU activity is also involved in infectious diseases, such as hepatitis C. CLU is induced by the stress of hepatitis C viral infection, which disrupts glucose regulation. The chaperone protein then aids hepatitis C viral assembly by stabilizing its core and NS5A units. CLU expression in the kidney also plays a role in renal diseases, such as nephropathic cystinosis, which is a major cause of Fanconi syndrome. In addition to the above diseases, CLU has been linked to other conditions resulting from oxidative damage, including aging, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction.  Interactions  CLU has been shown to interact with Ku70.

It was opened in 1967, with a concert conducted by Benjamin Britten. The QEH was built along with the smaller Purcell Room as part of Southbank Centre arts complex. It stands alongside the Royal Festival Hall, which was built for the Festival of Britain of 1951, and the Hayward Gallery which opened in 1968. Queen Elizabeth Hall - auditorium building with later added restaurant on walkway History The QEH stands on the site of a former shot tower, built as part of a lead works in 1826 and retained for the Festival of Britain. The QEH and the Purcell Room were built together by Higgs and HillCrown Works Vauxhall Civic Society and opened in March 1967. The venue was closed for two years of renovations in September 2015, and reopened in April 2018. Description Queen Elizabeth Hall from across the river Thames in 2009 The QEH has over 900 seats and the Purcell Room in the same building has 360 seats. The two auditoriums were designed by a team led by Hubert Bennett, head of the architects department of the Greater London Council, with Jack Whittle, F.G. West and Geoffrey Horsefall. They form part of the Southbank Centre arts complex along with the larger Royal Festival Hall (RFH) and an art gallery, the Hayward Gallery (opened in October 1968). The sculpture Zemran in stainless steel (by William Pye, 1972) stands on the riverside terrace of the QEH.  Architecture = Introduction  The design of the QEH was intended to show to a high degree the separate masses and elements of the building, to avoid competing with the scale and presence of the RFH. The QEH uses minimal decoration and was designed to allow circulation at multiple levels around the building. The focus is primarily on the internal spaces, which as originally designed had very limited fenestration except for the (deeply inset) sweep along the river frontage of the foyer building. The original arrangements provided for circulation above and below the foyer (no longer allowed for security reasons, although the roof terrace has been opened for the Summer of Fun festival in 2011), right around the sides and rear of the two auditoriums, and also a bridge link to the Hayward Gallery. The powerful forms and austere materials are an example of brutalist architecture, and the design also highlights the plasticity of concrete.  Foyer  The foyer in 2011 The foyer is at first-floor level, and the foyer building is supported on octagonal reinforced concrete columns, with an undercroft below, and is vee-shaped. The two arms of the vee-shape are linked to the QEH auditorium by cast concrete tubes, reminiscent of a spaceship's docking arrangement. The provision of only two entrances to the auditorium causes congestion and slow exit for audiences. This is also a consequence of the decision to place all the foyer facilities on a single level, even though there is a significant descent to the auditorium entrance level, and steps are required up to the Purcell Room level. The foyer is an irregular shape to accommodate the angle between the axes of Waterloo Bridge and the north-east side of the RFH. A notable feature of the QEH is the interior of the foyer building, with its intimate scale and subtle use of materials, and the terrace overlooking Queen's Walk. The original 1960s cool of this area had been largely lost owing to the intrusion of artificial partitions, to provide smaller areas for various activities by day as well as in the evening, in the 2000s. The extensive foyer was restored during the renovation works of 2016-18, with better integration of access for persons of reduced mobility. The bar area was extended to the south onto part of the external terrace with new glazing to bring more light into the foyer. The main entrance to the foyer is from walkway level near the north end of the terrace of the RFH. To see the intended effect this should be viewed head-on from the north corner of the RFH. The entrance, in brutalist style, is in the form of a horizontal slit in the concrete structure, with six pairs of cast aluminium doors. A smaller entrance is provided at ground level, originally intended to be for visitors set down by car (circulation of traffic under the Waterloo Bridge approach was possible before the Museum of the Moving Image building was constructed in the 1980s) or coming from the car park under the Hayward Gallery. This entrance also appears to have led to the undercroft, but that access is now blocked off. An internal staircase leads to the foyer level from this lower entrance, past the original box office area. Lavatories take up the south-east wall of the foyer building, and are housed in a structure extending out towards the centre access road. QEH foyer building with the Hayward Gallery to right The building's appearance works best by night, especially when approached from the eastern one of Golden Jubilee Footbridges beside Hungerford Bridge. After being closed for many years, the roof terrace and bridge to the Hayward Gallery were reopened in 2011, with the creation of a new external gallery and a roof garden and caf√©, in partnership with the Eden Project in Cornwall. This reopened one of the most interesting pedestrian circulation possibilities of the original design. The roof terrace is reached by the external concrete staircase at the west corner on Queen's Walk near Festival Pier, which also leads to the lower level and the route to Festival Square. A crude disabled ramp, constructed of breeze blocks and bricks, has been added to the walkway between the QEH entrance and the Hayward Gallery.  Auditorium  The QEH auditorium is a separate building from the foyer. The auditorium building is aligned with the rear of its stage parallel to Waterloo Bridge and the seating area cantilevered out towards the foyer, supported by a massive column containing the emergency escape staircases at the rear. The north-west facade, by Waterloo Bridge, although stained by pollution and rainwater, is a good example of the massive concrete forms popular in 1960s Brutalist architecture in Britain. A slightly raised area, resembling a low stage is provided facing Waterloo Bridge. This may have been intended for outdoor performances. A great concrete \\"prow\\", encasing the air conditioning ducting, protrudes towards the Thames along the side of the auditorium at roof level. The walkway area below this feature is on the roof of a utility building, and a branch of the restaurant chain Wahaca has been installed in a set of containers there, in 2012. Ventilation services are provided from a plant room on the roof of the Purcell Room via a massive concrete duct between the buildings leading into the QEH roof, and a concrete tower leading to the concrete duct on the north-east edge of the foyer building roof. The acoustic properties of the Queen Elizabeth Hall are judged to be generally excellent. The acoustical properties of the Hall when examined in 1968 by music critics and engineers following a period of testing, trials and adjustment, were found to be of \\"general excellence\\" in the three key areas of: a) Reverberation Time, which in this Hall is mainly adjusted by opening and closing cavities in the vertical wood panels on both sides, b) Tone and Definition, by allowing diffusion with minimum use of deflectors over the seating area rather than the platform, and finally c) 'Singing' Tone produced here as in all excellent halls by a substantial height of the auditorium which. In the QEH's case, although the rear stalls are steeply raked, the ceiling is 25 feet above the highest seats to the ceiling. (Trends in Concert-Hall Acoustics and the Elizabeth Hall C. L. S. Gilford The Musical Times Vol. 109 No 1499 Jan. 1968) There have inevitably been many alterations and adaptation of the Hall, particularly in recent years, involving increasing the size of the platform and rigging extra specialised lighting arrays which allow the staging of dance and comedy productions. This had adversely impacted on the Hall's acoustics, in particular in the area of tone and definition by increasing deflection in the platform area. As part of the refurbishment work of 2015-18, a retracting gantry was provided at ceiling level reducing this intrusion when not required.  The undercroft  The Undercroft The undercroft of the foyer building has been popular with skateboarders since the early 1970s and it is widely acknowledged to be London's most distinctive and popular skateboarding area. Opened in 1967 as a pedestrian walkway, it was first used by skateboarders in 1973 as the architectural features were found to be perfect for skateboard tricks. Unlike skateparks which are designed specifically with skateboarding and BMX in mind, the undercroft is not a skatepark but a found space, and still considered by the users as a street spot. The area is now used by skateboarders, BMXers, graffiti artists, taggers, photographers, and performance artists, among others. A photographic archive of the graffiti can be found at The Graffiti Archaeology Project. Although this informal activity, social and arts scene is a distinctive feature of the Southbank Centre site, it was proposed that the area would be redeveloped. However a statement from the Prime Minister's office (reported in Time Out, in August 2008) cited the importance of the undercroft for these uses. The Southbank Centre, as part of its ¬£120 million proposed Festival Wing development, sought to insert caf√© and shop units in the Undercroft space partly to fund new performance spaces in the new buildings to be built above parts of the Queen Elizabeth Hall and to move the skate space to a new location under Hungerford Bridge about 120 metres away. This was opposed by the Long Live Southbank Campaign which gained the support of Mayor Boris Johnson in early 2014, leading to the suspension of the Festival Wing proposals. (See Southbank Centre entry for further details.) Long Live Southbank and the Southbank Centre agreed a refurbishment programmehttps://www.archdaily.com/883405/why-the-restoration-of-the- southbank-undercroft-is-a-landmark-for-both-architecture-and- skateboardinghttps://www.timeout.com/london/blog/there-are-plans-to- regenerate-the-undercroft-skate-park-on-the-south-bank-011817 for the Undercroft space which was subsequently carried out.  Roof  A Room For London viewed from the South Bank in 2012 Since 2012, the temporary structure A Room for London has been located on top of the auditorium building.http://www.living-architecture.co.uk/the- houses/aroomforlondon/overview/ The structure, designed by architect David Kohn is described as \\"a one-bedroom installation\\" and is shaped to appear like a boat perched on top of a building. Recent developments In 2005‚Äì06, the South Bank Centre and Arts Council considered reconstruction or replacement of the QEH and Purcell Room by two new auditoriums, each of approximately 1,100 seats, one for classical music and one for amplified music and contemporary dance performances. This would have posed significant architectural challenges, given the constrained site and the close proximity of the Royal Festival Hall. In 2013, proposals were commissioned from Feilden Clegg Bradley for the Festival Wing scheme of the Southbank Centre, but this scheme did not proceed. The whole 1960s complex including the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room and Hayward Gallery, underwent complete internal refurbishment under the banner \\"Let the Light In\\" in 2015-18, to designs by the architecture practice Feilden Clegg Bradley. The work does not cover any major cleaning or work to the exteriors. The Arts Council granted ¬£10 million, the remainder being raised by sponsorship, such as seat-naming, and private donations. Although none of these buildings are listed or protected the Southbank Centre has consistently opposed petitions to the government for listing so that it can maintain as much flexibility to make changes as part of future development of this area of the site in accordance with its masterplan in the future, the level and standard of restoration and renewal carried out was commensurate with the building's significance and standing.

After ten years as a professor at the University of Modena in Italy, he emigrated to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, where he became associated with several magnate families‚Äîthe Potockis, Lubomirskis, and Czartoryskis. He was a member of Duchess Dorothea von Medem's court in Courland (Lithuania) and of King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski's court. Piattoli was politically active in Warsaw during and after the Four-Year Sejm (1788‚Äì92). He served as intermediary between the reformist Patriotic Party and King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, and as an aide to the King (1789‚Äì93). He is best remembered for his participation in drafting the Constitution of May 3, 1791, a milestone in the history of Polish political legislation. He was an organizer of the 1794 Ko≈õciuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, which was the last armed struggle held under the banners of the Commonwealth. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Piattoli was interned by the Austrians for several years, together with another Polish activist of the Constitution movement, Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj. Freed in 1800, he worked several years with Polish and Russian statesman Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski in the service of Russia, before retiring to Courland. Piattoli was an inspiration to Leo Tolstoy, who based the figure of Abb√© Morio in War and Peace (1869) on him. He is also one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of May 3, 1791. In his 1980 ten-page entry on Piattoli in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, historian Emanuel Rostworowski notes that, ‚Äúdespite two Italian monographs (by A.D. Ancon and G. Bozzolato)‚Äù, Piattoli still awaits a definitive biography. Early life Scipione Piattoli was born in Florence on November 10, 1749, to a family of painters (father, Gaetano Piattoli; mother, Anna Bacherini Piattoli; brother, Giuseppe Piattoli). In 1763 he joined the Piarist order, taking the name Urban. Some historians have questioned whether he ever took Holy Orders; in any case he was known for a rather secular lifestyle. He taught rhetoric in Piarist schools in Massa and Corregio, and got his doctorate from the University of Florence. From 1772 to 1782 he was a professor at the University of Modena, teaching religious history and Greek. Soon he became involved in political activism, and in 1774 he published (anonymously) a brochure titled Saggio intorno al luogo del seppellire, which focused on the issue of hygiene and burials near churches. Also in 1774 he received permission to leave the Piarists, and resumed using the name Scipione. He would, however, keep and use the title of \\"the priest\\" (l'abb√©) for most of his life. By the turn of the decade, Piattoli found himself in a faction that was losing in the politics of Modena, and decided to move, giving up his professorship in 1782. Piattoli arrived in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth that year, as a tutor for the sons of Piotr Potocki, a member of the magnate Potocki family. It was said in a contemporary account that his entire material wealth at that time was composed of a ‚Äúsizable library‚Äù. Piattoli ended his service with the Potocki family around 1784 due to personal disagreements with Pelagia Potocka and Maria Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. In the meantime, he became associated with the Lubomirski family‚ÄîIzabela Lubomirska in particular‚Äîand through them befriended Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Potocki and Grzegorz Piramowicz. Through Potocki and Piramowicz he became a member of the Society for Elementary Books in 1784. In the Society he was tasked with writing a textbook on the history of science. Around that time he was also active in Warsaw freemasonry. Piattoli traveled through Europe in the retinue of the Lubomirski family, including Izabela, and as a tutor of young Henryk Lubomirski. During that time he developed extensive contacts at various European courts in Courland, Austria (Vienna), Italy (Turin) and France (Paris). During his three-year stay in the Lubomirskis' Parisian residence, he was in touch with many important men of the Age of Enlightenment. He met‚Äîoften through another Florentinian, Filippo Mazzei‚ÄîJohann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette, Luigi Landriani, Girolamo Lucchesini, and the Marquis de Condorcet. He also corresponded with J. G. Herder. In Poland, he developed close contacts with Ignacy Potocki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicza. From 1787 he also tutored Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, later an important politician in the Russian Empire, on whom Piattoli would retain significant influence. Reformer and constitution drafter Constitution of May 3, 1791, a 19th-century painting by Jan Matejko. Piattoli is one of many historical characters featured on this canvas. See here for a detailed legend. Piattoli developed contacts with notable figures on the Polish political scene, initially from the group opposed to the royal faction. By the end of his stay in Paris, he likely became a supporter of reforms in France and Poland, and begun taking his first serious steps in political activism, through the involvement in the Quattuowirat, a group of magnates planning a (never realized) confederacy. He became a foreign member of the Soci√©t√© des Amis des Noirs. Through his freemason contacts with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won the confidence of Poland's King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, by the end of 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers‚ÄîIgnacy Potocki in particular‚Äîand the king. In the words of a Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was ‚Äúlike a tireless spring‚Äù, constantly mediating between the two factions. Due to his association with the reformers, in conservative Rome he became infamous as a staunch supporter of revolutionary ideals and was accused of \\"democratism\\". Vatican diplomats criticized the king for hiring such a \\"revolutionary\\", but the king defended Piattoli quite vividly. In any case, many such claims were exaggerations or rumours spread by his political enemies: according to one such rumour, Piattoli was alleged to incite crowds in France to kill the king. In reality, Piattoli supported the Monarchiens of the French Revolution's early stages, but more in the direction of peaceful transformation into a constitutional republic than the regicidal excesses. Between 1790 and 1792, Piattoli was sent on several sensitive diplomatic missions for the king to Berlin and other places. He was involved in the negotiations of the Polish-Prussian alliance. He collaborated with Ignacy Potocki, helping draft many texts connected with Potocki's work in the Sejm, the legislature of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. He was also an active supporter of Poniatowski's plan for a hereditary succession. Piattoli, as Poniatowski's secretary and a resident of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, has been credited with winning the King over to the idea of social reforms and with playing a part in the drafting of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. The exact nature of Piattoli's role in regard to the Constitution remains uncertain; modern historians disagree to what degree he was an executor, a mediator, or an initiator. He played a role in convincing the King to collaborate with the leaders of the Patriotic Party on drafting a constitution. He might have prepared or expanded drafts of the document, based on discussions among the principal authors, including the King, Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj (another politically active Roman Catholic priest) and Ignacy Potocki. At a minimum, he seems to have helped catalyze the process. Historian Emanuel Rostworowski describes him as a vital secretary-editor, who certainly participated in related discussions and influenced both Potocki and the king, and calls Piattoli's quarters in the Royal Palace a ‚Äúcreche‚Äù of the constitution. Piattoli was, finally, involved in the final preparations for the vote that took place during the Sejm session on May 3. Later that month he became a founder of the Friends of the Constitution. He was active in various political causes and worked closely with other key figures in Poland such as Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj. He became a trusted adviser to Dorothea von Medem, Duchess of Courland. He supported reforms to improve the status of the burghers and Jews. Final years During the War in Defence of the Constitution in 1792, Piattoli found himself on another diplomatic mission to Dresden, where he stayed after the Commonwealth's defeat at the hands of Imperial Russia resulted in the Second Partition of Poland. In Dresden and nearby Leipzig, Piattoli was active in the circles of Polish patriotic emigres, who included Potocki and Kol≈ÇƒÖtaj. In 1793 he officially parted ways with Poniatowski, receiving a letter in which he was discharged from his service. In 1794 he was involved in the preparations for the Ko≈õciuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, and in negotiations with the newly republican France, in which Polish reformists proposed an alliance with France, promising to turn Poland into a second republic in Europe. At the same time, he was involved in much more conservative negotiations with Russians. In July 1794 he and several other activists were exiled from Leipzig, and Piattoli was soon arrested by the Austrian authorities. After the failure of the Ko≈õciuszko Insurrection later in 1794, many prisoners were set free, but Piattoli was kept imprisoned, together with Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, as the Russian authorities insisted that the two were ‚Äúextremely dangerous‚Äù. Hence, even after the final Partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Piattoli was kept interned in Prague by the Austrian Empire authorities until 1800, despite requests for his release from Poniatowski and even Napoleon Bonaparte. His release in 1800 seems to have been the result of efforts of the Czartoryski family and Duchess Dorothea. After his release he returned to Dorothea's Courland court, where he served as a tutor for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success. In 1807 Scipione Piattoli returned to Courland. There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married one of the ladies of the court. In his final years in Courland he was involved with Courland's educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a lifelong dream for which he never found enough time. He died of a lung infection in Altenburg on April 12, 1809. He was buried in a park in L√∂bichau. Remembrance Piattoli was an inspiration to Leo Tolstoy, who based the figure of the Abb√© Morio in War and Peace (1869) on him. He is also one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of May 3, 1791.

It was released in 1989 and it is the first \\"Book of the Art\\" in a trilogy, known as The Art Trilogy by fans. The novel is about the conflict between two highly evolved men ‚Äì Randolph Jaffe and Richard Fletcher ‚Äì over the mystical dream sea called Quiddity. Jaffe hopes to tap into Quiddity's power while Fletcher wants to prevent it from being tainted. The conflict between the two men spills into the real world in a decades-long feud, distorting reality and affecting the entire human race. Clive Barker has said in interviews that this novel was the hardest to write of all his books.  Plot summary  In 1969, while working in a dead letter office in Nebraska, disgruntled postal clerk Randolph Jaffe discovers hints to a mysterious society known as The Shoal, which ostensibly practises a form of magic only vaguely known as \\"The Art\\". Jaffe's search eventually brings him to a New Mexico town where he encounters Kissoon, who claims to be the last of the Shoal. Kissoon tells Jaffe of the mystical dream sea Quiddity and the islands within it known as the Ephemeris. Quiddity, as it turns out, is visible exactly three times to an ordinary human: The first time we ever sleep outside our mother's womb, the first time we sleep beside the one we truly love and the last time we ever sleep before we die. However, this simply is not enough for the megalomaniac Jaffe, who wishes to actually visit the dream sea in person and gain control of it. Jaffe flees when Kissoon tries to bargain for his body. Jaffe later teams up with a scientist named Fletcher to develop a liquid called Nuncio, which can theoretically allow a human to evolve to a state that would enable him to physically reach Quiddity. However, Fletcher realises that Jaffe will only use Nuncio for evil and destroys his laboratory. Jaffe arrives and both are exposed to the Nuncio. After the two battle each other for a year, their spirits arrive in California, where they rape and impregnate four teenage girls. One of the girls is infertile and fails to conceive while another kills herself and her child after giving birth. The third, Trudi Katz, moves away with her baby Howard, while the fourth, Joyce McGuire, gives birth to twins, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray. Eighteen years pass. Howard returns to California after the death of his mother. While Jaffe and Fletcher produced offspring to continue their battle, Howard and Jo-Beth instead fall in love after meeting. Fletcher and Jaffe are able to escape captivity. Jaffe is able to amass an army of creatures known as Terata using the minds of vulnerable people, and gets his son Tommy Ray on his side as well. Howard encounters Fletcher, who explains his heritage to him. Fletcher explains Quiddity to Howard, telling him that the Ephemeris contain the Great and Secret Show. However, Howard refuses to align with his father. Meanwhile, a reporter named Grillo and his friend, Tesla, arrive in town. Fletcher is unable to amass his own army of hallucigenia from the mind of dreamers and instead kills himself through immolation, spreading his essence to the people of the town. Having encountered Fletcher before his death, Tesla heads to the remnants of his laboratory to recover the remains of the Nuncio. Tommy Ray is sent by Jaffe. While there Tesla encounters Raul, an ape who had been evolved through the power of the Nuncio. Tommy Ray arrives and shoots Tesla, but the last remaining vial of Nuncio breaks, infecting both men. Tesla's consciousness travels to a time loop in New Mexico where she encounters Kissoon. Kissoon explains to Tesla that the Shoal were dedicated to keeping Quiddity and the Art pure but with them all dead, Earth (known as the Cosm) could be dominated by the evil race Iad Uroboros, who live in the Metacosm on the opposite side of Quiddity. Tesla leaves when Kissoon tries to take over her body but agrees to find another body for him to inhabit. Leaving the time loop, Tesla encounters a woman named Mary Muralles, who reveals that it was Kissoon who murdered the Shoal and he is actually an agent of the Iad Uroboros. Kissoon manages to kill Mary using snake-like creatures created by his excrement and semen (Lix), then captures Raul to take over his body. Tommy Ray leads an army of the dead while the hallucigenia created by Fletcher's death convince Howard to help them attack Jaffe. Jaffe manages to tear a hole through reality into Quiddity but realises it is too much power for him to deal with. As his Terata battle the hallucigenia many are dragged into Quiddity including Howard, Jo- Beth and Tommy Ray. Tesla, Grillo and Jaffe flee the house and attempt to close the vortex into Quiddity. Quiddity transforms Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray as they reach the Ephemeris, where they find that the Iad Uroboros are crossing Quiddity towards Earth. The town starts to collapse and is sealed off by the authorities. Tesla recalls a word Kissoon had brought up, \\"Trinity\\", which is the place where the first atomic bomb was detonated. Kissoon arrives, now occupying Raul's body, but Jaffe is able to distract him as Tesla transports the vortex to Quiddity into Kissoon's time loop. Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray, completely transformed from their experience in Quiddity, return from the vortex. Jaffe is able to kill Raul's body and is reunited with Tommy Ray. Tesla finds that Raul has occupied Kissoon's former body. By convincing Raul's consciousness to enter her body, Kissoon's body dies, which disintegrates the time loop, destroys the vortex to Quiddity and the Iad Uroboros who were arriving. Tesla and the others are able to escape the time loop just in time. Jo-Beth and Howard meet supernatural investigator Harry D'Amour, who asks for their story. Tesla meets Grillo and tells him that the worshippers of the Iad Uroboros are still active and will try to summon them again. Adaptations=Comics It was also released as a 12-part comic book between March 2006 and May 2007 by IDW Publishing. Television In December 2016, filmmaker Josh Boone announced that he is adapting the novel as a television series with co-writer Owen King. Reception Critical reception for the book has been mixed. Ken Tucker of The New York Times gave a mixed review of The Great and Secret Show, writing \\"From The Great and Secret Show, it is clear that Mr. Barker's intention is to force the horror genre to encompass a kind of dread, an existential despair, that it hasn't noticeably evinced until now. This is a tall order, one that this novel, which is skillful and funny but ultimately overwrought, doesn't quite accomplish. But, having announced the intention of writing a trilogy about the Art and its mysteries, he may yet achieve his goal.\\" Author David Foster Wallace was also mixed in his review as he heavily criticized the work as overly pretentious but commented that the novel was \\"not without some cool sections\\". Publishers Weekly panned the work overall, stating \\"Though diverting, the novel is something of a potboiler, and despite its pervasive horrific imagery, it fails even to frighten us--or invite us to suspend disbelief.\\" References 1989 British novels 1989 fantasy novels Novels by Clive Barker British fantasy novels William Collins, Sons books Novels adapted into comics ","title":"The Great and Secret Show"},{"id":"1345219","text":"TK Solver (originally TK!Solver) is a mathematical modeling and problem solving software system based on a declarative, rule-based language, commercialized by Universal Technical Systems, Inc. History Invented by Milos Konopasek in the late 1970s and initially developed in 1982 by Software Arts, the company behind VisiCalc, TK Solver was acquired by Universal Technical Systems in 1984 after Software Arts fell into financial difficulty and was sold to Lotus Software. Konopasek's goal in inventing the TK Solver concept was to create a problem solving environment in which a given mathematical model built to solve a specific problem could be used to solve related problems (with a redistribution of input and output variables) with minimal or no additional programming required: once a user enters an equation, TK Solver can evaluate that equation as is--without isolating unknown variables on one side of the equals sign. Software Arts also released a series of \\"Solverpacks\\" - \\"ready-made versions of some of the formulas most commonly used in specific areas of application.\\" The New York Times described TK Solver as doing \\"for science and engineering what word processing did for corporate communictions [sic] and calc packages did for finance.\\" Universal Technical Systems Lotus, which had acquired Software Gardens, including TK Solver, in 1984 sold its ownership of the software to Universal Technical Systems less than two years later. Release 5 was still considered \\"one of the longest‚Äìstanding mathematical equation solvers on the market today\\" in 2012. Core technology TK Solver's core technologies are a declarative programming language, algebraic equation solver, an iterative equation solver, and a structured, object-based interface, using a command structure./M for move, /I for insert ... \\"carried over from Visicalc.\\" The interface comprises nine classes of objects that can be shared between and merged into other TK files: * Rules: equations, formulas, function calls which may include logical conditions * Variables: a listing of the variables that are used in the rules, along with values (numeric or non-numeric) that have been entered by the user or calculated by the software * Units: all units conversion factors, in a single location, to allow automatic update of values when units are changed * Lists: ranges of numeric and non-numeric values which can be associated with a variable or processed directly by procedure functions * Tables: collections of lists displayed together * Plots: line charts, scatterplots, bar charts, and pie charts * Functions: rule-based, table look-up, and procedural programming components * Formats: settings for displaying numeric and string values * Comments: for explanation and documentation Each class of object is listed and stored on its own worksheet‚Äîthe Rule Sheet, Variable Sheet, Unit Sheet, etc. Within each worksheet, each object has properties summarized on subsheets or viewed in a property window. The interface uses toolbars and a hierarchal navigation bar that resembles the directory tree seen on the left side of the Windows Explorer. The declarative programming structure is embodied in the rules, functions and variables that form the core of a mathematical model. Rules, variables and units All rules are entered in the Rule Sheet or in user-defined functions. Unlike a spreadsheet or imperative programming environment, the rules can be in any order or sequence and are not expressed as assignment statements. \\"A + B = C / D\\" is a valid rule in TK Solver and can be solved for any of its four variables. Rules can be added and removed as needed in the Rule Sheet without regard for their order and incorporated into other models. A TK Solver model can include up to 32,000 rules, and the library that ships with the current version includes utilities for higher mathematics, statistics, engineering and science, finances, and programming. Variables in a rule are automatically posted to the Variable Sheet when the rule is entered and the rule is displayed in mathematical format in the MathLook View window at the bottom of the screen. Any variable can operate as an input or an output, and the model will be solved for the output variables depending on the choice of inputs. A database of unit conversion factors also ships with TK Solver, and users can add, delete, or import unit conversions in a way similar to that for rules. Each variable is associated with a \\"calculation\\" unit, but variables can also be assigned \\"display\\" units and TK automatically converts the values. For example, rules may be based upon meters and kilograms, but units of inches and pounds can be used for input and output. Problem-solving TK Solver has three ways of solving systems of equations. The \\"direct solver\\" solves a system algebraically by the principle of consecutive substitution. When multiple rules contain multiple unknowns, the program can trigger an iterative solver which uses the Newton-Raphson algorithm to successively approximate based on initial guesses for one or more of the output variables. Procedure functions can also be used to solve systems of equations. Libraries of such procedures are included with the program and can be merged into files as needed. A list solver feature allows variables to be associated with ranges of data or probability distributions, solving for multiple values, which is useful for generating tables and plots and for running Monte Carlo simulations. The premium version now also includes a \\"Solution Optimizer\\" for direct setting of bounds and constraints in solving models for minimum, maximum, or specific conditions. TK Solver includes roughly 150 built-in functions: mathematical, trigonometric, Boolean, numerical calculus, matrix operations, database access, and programming functions, including string handling and calls to externally compiled routines. Users may also define three types of functions: declarative rule functions; list functions, for table lookups and other operations involving pairs of lists; and procedure functions, for loops and other procedural operations which may also process or result in arrays (lists of lists). The complete NIST database of thermodynamic and transport properties is included, with built-in functions for accessing it. TK Solver is also the platform for engineering applications marketed by UTS, including Advanced Spring Design, Integrated Gear Software, Interactive Roark‚Äôs Formulas, Heat Transfer on TK, and Dynamics and Vibration Analysis. Data display and sharing Tables, plots, comments, and the MathLook notation display tool can be used to enrich TK Solver models. Models can be linked to other components with Microsoft Visual Basic and .NET tools, or they can be web-enabled using the RuleMaster product or linked with Excel spreadsheets using the Excel Toolkit product. There is also a DesignLink option linking TK Solver models with CAD drawings and solid models. In the premium version, standalone models can be shared with others who do not have a TK license, opening them in Excel or the free TK Player. Reception BYTE in 1984 stated that \\"TK!Solver is superb for solving almost any kind of equation\\", but that it did not handle matrices, and that a programming language like Fortran or APL was superior for simultaneous solution of linear equations.

It was released in 1994 and is the second in the \\"Book of the Art\\", but it also can be read alone. The first part of The Art Trilogy, The Great and Secret Show, was released in 1989. Everville tells the story of a small town of the same name, from its creation to transformation over the years. Several characters populate the book, some from our world and others from Quiddity, the vast universe or afterlife hinted at in the first book of the series. Noteworthy characters include detective Harry D'Amour from previous Barker works (including his story \\"The Last Illusion\\") as well as a few from book one of the series. Among several new characters, mentioned in passing or detail, are the 'Shu (small, squid-like beings who are described as \\"pieces of God\\"), Phoebe Cobb, a resident of the town who passionately loves Joe, a dark-skinned painter, and Seth, a gay teenager who can hear angels knocking from the other side of Heaven.  Plot summary  In 1848, an Irish immigrant named Maeve O'Connell is traveling west with her father and a group of others. Her father seeks to found the town of Everville, being inspired by a mysterious man named Buddenbaum and having been given a medallion similar to the one possessed by Jaffe in the Great and Secret Show. Maeve's father is scapegoated and murdered by the fanatics in the group but Maeve is saved by a winged creature named Coker. Disobeying his orders to not follow him, Maeve ends up disrupting a wedding ceremony of two warring families from Quiddity, leading to a large conflict and the death of most of the families. Coker and Maeve are about to head through a portal, called a neirica, which brought such beings to Earth from Quiddity, but the arrival of Buddenbaum disrupts things. As the neirica closes, Coker severs his wings to stay with Maeve. Only one of the beings from Quiddity remains, a creature named Noah. The narrative then shifts to the present day, where Everville is about to hold its popular annual festival. A doctor's receptionist named Phoebe Cobb carried on an affair with a black painter named Joe Flicker. When caught by Phoebe's husband, a struggle ensues and her husband is accidentally killed, forcing Joe, who has a prior criminal record, to go on the run. Tesla Bombeck, whose head is also occupied by Raul, returns to Palomo Grove where she meets a young man named Lucien and his colleagues, who believe Fletcher has returned. Meanwhile, Grillo, who has been collecting strange stories from around the world in a database he calls \\"The Reef\\" comes across a report that makes him believe Tommy Ray is still alive. He reaches out to Howard and Jo-Beth, who are now married with a baby daughter, Amy. An attorney named Erwin Toothaker comes across a 30-year-old confession about the lynching of a strange family of three. His research leads him to the remains of the family's home where he finds Fletcher. Tesla meets up with and makes love to Lucien but the two argue and split up, spurned primarily by Raul. Fletcher drains the life out of Erwin, killing him. Erwin's spirit remains and sees him creating Lix, revealing that Fletcher is in fact Kissoon. Joe, fleeing to the hills near Everville, comes across Noah and the still present neirica to Quiddity. Noah convinces Joe to bring him through into Quiddity and promises him power. He introduces Joe to a squid-like creature called Zehraphushu (\\"Shu\\") which is believed to be a god-like being possessing a hive mind. Erwin's spirit is able to lead Tesla to his home where she meets and befriends Phoebe. Buddenbaum returns to Everville and starts a relationship with local teenager Seth Lundy. Buddenbaum has brought spirits he calls avatars with him and is looking for what he calls the crossroads. Tesla and Phoebe return to Erwin's house where they encounter Kissoon. Due to the arrival of Erwin and other spirits, as well as Kissoon's weakened state, Tesla and Phoebe are able to escape. In a dream Phoebe is able to interact with Joe, however he is left for dead in the water by the enslaved beings on the ship he is traveling on. In New York, Harry D'Amour meets with his friend Ted, who has made a painting of Wyckoff Street, where years earlier D'Amour encountered a demon he calls Lazy Susan who killed a friend of his. With support from Ted and his psychic friend Norma, D'Amour infiltrates a ceremony of beings from Quiddity, but Kissoon arrives in a new body, killing them and sealing the neirica. D'Amour finds an old abode of Kissoon's and pursues him across the country, eventually being led to Everville. Tesla and Phoebe head to the mountains of Everville where they find some creatures from Quiddity and the bodies of Lucien and his colleagues, who have been crucified. By threatening one of the creatures, and due to the timely arrival of D'Amour, they are able to escape. Tesla and Phoebe split up as Phoebe heads through the neirica into Quiddity. Due to the close proximity to Quiddity, Raul's spirit departs Tesla's body. In Quiddity, Phoebe meets a creature named Musnakaff who brings her to a home in the recreated city of Liverpool where she meets the now elderly Maeve O'Connell. Meanwhile, Joe makes it to the island of Mem-e b'Kether Sabbat where he finds many fleeing the city in fear of the Iad Ourobourus who are continuing to make their way across Quiddity to the Earth. Buddenbaum and Seth reunite. As the annual parade takes place in Everville, Buddenbaum tries to dig up the medallion buried in the ground and starts using the Art, causing many strange things to happen. A girl, one of Buddenbaum's avatars known as the jai wai, appears to Tesla, and are interested in her. D'Amour shoots Buddenbaum in the head which doesn't kill him, but he stops his attempts at using the Art. Speaking with Maeve, Phoebe learns that she, along with her husband Coker and child, were the three that were lynched many years ago as discovered by Erwin. Maeve wants to return to Everville and along the way her former lover, a being made of earth called King Texas, appears. Maeve refuses him but Phoebe falls in a chasm and is forced to remain with him. Joe reunites with Noah, who leads him to a temple where there is a giant Shu, the only thing holding back the Iad Ouroborus. Joe has a special bond with the Shu, but Noah wants him to kill it. When he refuses, he kills Joe then the giant Shu as well. Joe's spirit departs his body and witnesses the Iad now heading across Quiddity. Grillo helps Howard and Jo-Beth flee from Tommy Ray, but he pursues them along with the numerous dead spirits that follow him which he is unable to control. In the attempt to stop Tommy Ray, Howard starts a fire, but this ends up claiming the life of both him and Jo-Beth. Grillo is also killed trying to save Amy, who he gives to Tesla. Tesla meets all of the jai wai. Meanwhile, Erwin meets the spirit of Coker and they follow D'Amour to the mountains. There D'Amour is captured by the same creatures from Quiddity that Tesla and Phoebe had encountered before. Kissoon reveals himself to D'Amour and says that he has sealed the neirica across the world such that the Iad would enter Earth via Everville. Raul, who has possessed the body of one of the creatures from Quiddity is able to free D'Amour. Phoebe is able to free herself of King Texas, who is able to block a large portion of the Iad from heading through the neirica to Earth. However, a portion of the Iad still head through. Maeve meets D'Amour and Raul. She reveals to them the origins of Everville, that the town was founded through prostitution she had set up there, and of her husband Coker and son Clayton, who showed utter contempt for humanity. Hearing of him, D'Amour recognizes Clayton to be Kissoon, who is seeking revenge upon Everville. Seth reaches out to Tesla, trying to set up a meeting with her and Buddenbaum. The jai wai have decided to abandon Buddenbaum for Tesla and she meets with him. Her being there disrupted Buddenbaum's previous attempt to use the Art and she agrees to bring the jai wai to him and leave him be. Tommy Ray arrives in Everville and is able to take Amy, whom he claims to be his daughter, away with him. Tesla meets with the jai wai and agrees to let them follow her, but wants them to tell Buddenbaum they are abandoning him. Buddenbaum, who is again attempting to use the Art, reacts to the news by causing a blaze in the area, killing Tesla and the jai wai. Light from the event envelops Maeve, causing her original whorehouse to appear again. D'Amour looks for and finds Kissoon, and Seth helps him escape from Buddenbaum. Kissoon confronts his mother in the whorehouse and kills her, but by doing so Tesla is resurrected and given the power of the Art. Maeve's spirit is reunited with that of Coker's. Kissoon and the Iad fade away into the darkness. Time passes and the events in Everville hit the news. Buddenbaum, Seth, Kissoon and the Iad have all disappeared. Tesla heads to Omaha to see the Reef. Harry has one final confrontation with the Lazy Susan demon and kills him. He is summoned by Raul to come see Tesla, finding her in a non-responsive state. Despite her state, Tesla is able to show D'Amour visions of the stories gathered in the Reef and is looking for the origins of everything. In Quiddity, Phoebe returns to Maeve's home. The spirit of Joe reaches the house where he partially comes into being while she is dreaming of him. Phoebe later is reunited with Joe by the shore, with the remains of his new body being created by the Shu. Reception Critical reception for Everville has been mixed. The Sun-Sentinel panned Everville as inconsistent and stated that they felt that like its predecessor, it contained too many characters and that \\"when you weed out the subplots, you find there is no main plot.\\" In contrast outlets like the Orlando Sentinel and Publishers Weekly praised the work, and Publishers Weekly wrote \\"At times profoundly moving as flawed heroes and heroines martyr themselves to love or goodness, this novel confirms the author's position not only as one of horror's most potent and fertile minds but also as one of modern fiction's premier metaphysicians.\\" References 1994 British novels 1994 fantasy novels Novels by Clive Barker British fantasy novels HarperCollins books ","title":"Everville"},{"id":"1345233","text":"Merillat Industries was founded in Adrian, Michigan as an American manufacturer of kitchen cabinets in 1946 by Orville D.

He formerly co- hosted live Formula One practices, qualifying sessions, and races alongside David Hobbs and Bob Varsha. As well as his live F1 duties, Matchett also co- presented with the same duo a pre-recorded show on Speed Channel called Formula One Debrief, reviewing the events of the preceding week's grand prix. Until the conclusion of the 2012 Formula One season, he was a commentator for the FOX owned American Speed Channel. For the 2013 Formula One season, he was signed to NBC Sports Network, alongside Speed TV veterans David Hobbs and Bob Varsha until broadcasts moved to ESPN for the 2018 season He was a columnist for the Speed Channel website and presented a series of web-based video 'chalk-talk' features in which, with photographs and a telestrator, he explains F1 engineering and technical matters. He was a regular contributor and columnist to F1 Racing magazine from 1996 to 2008. He was Technical Editor of the magazine from 1998 to 2008 (resigning his editorship when Matt Bishop resigned as Editor-in-Chief). He has also published a semi-autobiographical trilogy based around his years in the F1 pit lane. Education Loughborough University (technical college) 1979‚Äì1982, City & Guilds Mechanical Engineering Apprenticeship Early career In 1977, he started working as a mechanic for Howlett's of Loughborough performing routine service for Mazda and Vauxhall vehicles. He joined Graypaul Motors in 1986, a UK Ferrari dealership; then to a BMW dealership from 1988 to 1989. In January 1989 he was employed at a Cooper-BMW dealership in Rothley near Loughborough for exactly one year. He began his F1 career in 1990.Steve Matchett Fan Club The Formula One years Employed by Nigel Stepney, Matchett worked as a race mechanic with the Benetton F1 team from 1 February 1990 through 13 February 1998. During this period Michael Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship in both 1994 and 1995 before leaving the team, moving to Ferrari the following year; while Matchett and his team won the Constructors' Championship in 1995. Throughout his time with Benetton he worked with many key drivers and personalities of the era: Michael Schumacher, Nelson Piquet, Riccardo Patrese, Martin Brundle, Johnny Herbert, Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi all drove F1 cars prepared by Matchett. Herbert and Matchett both claimed their maiden Formula One wins in the 1995 British Grand Prix, a race perhaps made most famous for the fact that Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill crashed out of the race while battling for the lead. Although Matchett had by this time experienced many wins as part of the Benetton team, the win at Silverstone was significant as it was the first Benetton victory secured by a Matchett prepared car. Ten years later, in his closing remarks of the relevant episode of Formula 1 Decade Matchett described his feelings during the closing laps of that landmark race, and how much the win had meant to him. Said Matchett:Herbert and Matchett would team up for another Formula One win in at the 1995 Italian Grand Prix held at Monza, another race in which Schumacher and Hill crashed out together. His career as a mechanic was brought to an end by a back injury (from which he has since recovered) sustained while operating the rear jack on a car during a pre-race practice session. Throughout his Benetton career Matchett formed a close working relationship with both Stepney and Ross Brawn who was then technical director of Benetton. Brawn and Matchett remained on amicable terms even after Brawn's move to Ferrari at the end of 1996 and Matchett's own move into television four years later. During the Speed Channel Formula One broadcasts Matchett often cites conversations he has had with Brawn ‚Äì and indeed other leading F1 engineers ‚Äì by way of explaining to his viewers the pressing technical issues of the day. Television He made his television debut for Speedvision in 2000 filling in as a substitute commentator during the Canadian GP weekend. He joined the crew for two more races in 2000, then joined Speedvision's F1 broadcast crew full-time in 2001. In late 2001 Speedvision was acquired by Fox Television, rebranded as Speed Channel and relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina. Matchett made the switch to Charlotte. Matchett remained with the network until the end of the 2012 season, at which point he joined his colleagues in moving to NBC and NBC Sports. His broadcasting niche is one of giving priority to the teams' involvement, rather than to any specific driver. During the Speed Channel shows he has often stated that the Constructors Championship is of greater significance to him than the Drivers Championship. At the end of each race show, David Hobbs reads out the driver points; Matchett always reads out the team points. Unlike his co-announcers, Matchett's unique approach is to talk of the races from the perspective of the competing teams (the engineer's view) rather than the driver's perspective. He describes the track's challenges to the various GP teams and describes how the mechanics prepare the 'set up' of the race cars to try and win the race. He is also credited with the ability to notice minor changes that the mechanics have made to the cars and for his ability to spot mechanical problems on the cars even while they are running on the circuit. In addition to his duties calling the racing action, Matchett also estimates when the cars will be visiting the pits for fuel and tires. From 2003 to 2005, Matchett also hosted Speed Channel's Formula 1 Decade. On 2 April 2004, the show had the daunting task of airing the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, showing the crash that claimed the life of three-time World Drivers' Champion and 41-time Grand Prix race winner Ayrton Senna. Matchett, a mechanic for Benetton-Ford that weekend, made these remarks at the beginning of the broadcast: (*)-There had already been two serious accidents in the days before Senna's, one on 29 April during Friday practice that nearly killed Rubens Barrichello, and one on 30 April during Saturday qualifying that killed Roland Ratzenberger. Since 2007, Matchett has hosted an annual series of technical features for SPEED called RPM - Racing Per Matchett in which he interviews key members of the Renault F1, Red Bull Racing and McLaren F1 teams, explaining to the viewers different features of modern race car design and ultra-exotic technology. In January 2008 he also hosted the first visit to America by BMW Sauber's popular Pit Lane Park Formula One show, supporting the prestigious Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He also emceed the four-day event alongside Mark Goodman of Sirius Satellite Radio, one of MTV's original VJs. Graham Rahal son of Indy 500 winner Bobby Rahal drove a BMW Sauber F1.06 car in a series of demonstration runs during the event. In 2009 Matchett presented a thirty-minute show for Speed Channel called Always Ferrari, in which he visited the famous Italian marque's Maranello factory, toured the road car restoration division, the Formula 1 racing headquarters and there interviewed F1 team members including drivers Felipe Massa and Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen.

It introduced the talents of his backing band the Jeff Beck Group, specifically Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, to a larger audience, and peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. Content and background After leaving the Yardbirds in late 1966, Jeff Beck had released three commercial singles, two in 1967 featuring himself on lead vocals, and one without vocals in 1968. All had been hits on the British singles chart,UK Chart Stats retrieved 04/02/11 and all were characterized by songs aimed at the pop chart on the A-side at the behest of producer Mickie Most.Charles Shaar Murray. Truth, 2006 reissue, Legacy Recordings 82876 77352 2, liner notes. Harder rock and blues-based numbers were featured on the B-sides, and for music on the album, Beck opted to pursue the latter course. Recording sessions for the album took place over four days, 14‚Äì15 May and 25‚Äì26 May 1968.Murray, Truth reissue liner notes. Nine eclectic tracks were taken from these sessions, including covers of \\"Ol' Man River\\" by Jerome Kern, the Tudor period melody \\"Greensleeves\\", and Bonnie Dobson's \\"Morning Dew\\", a 1966 hit single for Tim Rose. Beck acknowledged two giants of Chicago blues in songs by Willie Dixon ‚Äì Muddy Waters' \\"You Shook Me\\" and Howlin' Wolf's \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\". The album started with a song from Beck's old band: \\"Shapes of Things\\". Three originals were credited to \\"Jeffrey Rod\\", a pseudonym for Beck and Stewart, all reworkings of previous blues songs: \\"Let Me Love You\\" the song of the same title by Buddy Guy; \\"Rock My Plimsoul\\" from \\"Rock Me Baby\\" by B.B. King; and \\"Blues Deluxe\\" similar to another song by B.B. King, \\"Gambler's Blues\\".Murray, Truth reissue liner notes. \\"Plimsoul\\" had already been recorded for the B-side to the 1967 single \\"Tallyman\\", and the tenth track, an instrumental featuring Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Keith Moon, and future Beck group pianist Nicky Hopkins, \\"Beck's Bolero\\", had been edited and remixed for stereo from the earlier B-side to \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\". Due to contractual conflicts, Moon had been credited on the original album as \\"You Know Who\\". Reception and legacy Reviewing for Rolling Stone in 1968, Al Kooper called Truth a \\"classic\\" and a contemporary version of the 1966 Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton LP, saying the Beck group \\"swing like mad on this record.\\" Truth has since been regarded as a seminal work of heavy metal because of its use of blues toward a hard rock approach.Nick Logan and Bob Woffinden, editors. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock. New York: Harmony Books, 1977, p. 137. According to Pete Prown and HP Newquist, \\"although some have claimed that this disc was the first metal album, the sound actually leaned more towards a heavy brand of blues rock.\\" Classic Rock magazine ranked Truth eighth on its list of the 30 greatest British blues rock albums; an accompanying blurb read, \\"it was an album that not only helped establish the British blues rock sound, but featured many of its best exponents.\\" Tom Scholz of Boston has listed it as his favorite album on Gibson's online magazine, stating, \\"I knew Jeff Beck's Truth album inside out...\\" The album's title inspired the name of Iowa band Truth and Janey. Blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa recorded a studio version of \\"Blues Deluxe\\" on his 2003 album Blues Deluxe and recorded live versions on Live at Rockpalast (2005), and Live from the Royal Albert Hall (2009). Bonamassa also played \\"Beck's Bolero\\", \\"Let Me Love You Baby\\" (and \\"Spanish Boots\\" and \\"Plynth (Water Down the Drain)\\" from the Beck-Ola album) in his Salute to the British Blues Explosion tour featuring the music of Beck, Clapton and Page in July 2016. On 10 October 2006, Legacy Recordings remastered and reissued the album for compact disc with eight bonus tracks. Included were two earlier takes of \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"Blues Deluxe\\", the latter without the overdubbed applause, and the six tracks making up the three singles by Beck. The B-side to the 1968 single \\"Love Is Blue\\", \\"I've Been Drinking\\", was another \\"Jeffrey Rod\\" special, this time reconfiguring the Johnny Mercer song \\"Drinking Again\\".

The book is a fable written for children, but intended to be read by adults as well. The book's cover was created by Barker and the book contains several black and white illustrations by the author. Plot Harvey Swick is a 11-year-old boy bored with school, teachers, homework, and his day-to-day life. In response to Harvey's frustrated plea for change, a man named Rictus visits Harvey and tells him about a kid's paradise called the Holiday House. At the Holiday House, there are all the sweets a person could ask for, four seasons in a day, Halloween every evening, Christmas, with whatever gifts you could wish for every night, and everything else you could dream of. One week after his encounter with Rictus, Harvey hesitantly visits the house, entering through a wall of mist. Harvey stays at the Holiday House for 31 days, becoming friends with two other children staying alongside him, Wendell and Lulu. There is also a woman, Mrs. Griffin, who cooks all the meals for the children. She claims to have been there longer than anybody. And though she seems sweet, she appears to be keeping a secret about the house and its creator, Mr. Hood. Harvey eventually discovers that the house's creator, Mr. Hood, has sucked all of the children's souls away and turned them into fish, imprisoning them in the mysterious, dark, gloomy lake. Lulu is turned into a fish the night of Harvey's escape, but Harvey and Wendell still manage to flee the house by following a cat named Blue Cat through the mist barrier that constantly surrounds the property of the house at night. When both Harvey and Wendell come home, they soon discover that for every day they had spent in the Holiday House, one year had passed in the rest of the world. When Harvey meets his parents, he thinks he went to the wrong house, but he is wrong. His parents also realize who he is and invite him in. He takes a long nap and then tells them what happened. They go on the search of the House, but Harvey had forgotten all the roads he took coming home. They try all day, but Harvey and his parents can't find the house. Harvey's father finally decides to go to the police station. Harvey's mother decides to go out shopping and Harvey goes up to his room. When he is in his room, he sees Wendell in the street walking towards Harvey's house. Wendell tells Harvey that Wendell's mother is old, fat, and divorced. Harvey also tells Wendell what happened to him. They both think about what happened in the Holiday House and decide that the only way to regain their lost time is to return to the Holiday House. Upon doing so, Harvey learns that Hood runs the entire house on magic and illusions. Harvey defeats Hood by tricking him into using up all of his magic by wishing for as many things he can think of as fast as he can. With his power drained, an exhausted Hood allows Harvey one more wish. Harvey wishes for all the seasons at once, resulting in a furious lightning storm that burns down the house. Hood seems to perish in the fire, but he manages to rebuild a body from the debris of the house, and remarks at Harvey's courage. He contrasts Harvey with Wendell, who has succumbed to the House's lures and wishes to stay forever in a trance. Hood then offers Harvey, whom he calls \\"A Thief of Always,\\" the chance to become a vampire with him and be immortal. Harvey refuses, and the confrontation ends with Mr. Hood being sucked into the lake, which has turned into a whirlpool. The children all leave the remains of the house to go back to their respective times. People * Harvey Swick'‚Äì An 11-year-old boy, who is straw-haired and brown-eyed, and impulsive, is bored with his everyday life and wishes to go to a place that is a kids' paradise. His wish is granted when Rictus enters through the bedroom window and persuades him to come to this kids' paradise known as the Holiday House and agrees to come. When he arrives, Harvey becomes flabbergasted by the magic and wonders the Holiday House possessed. Harvey then discovers when he stays in the world of the Holiday House, all of the years of his life are stolen by Mr. Hood and he himself has realized that he has stolen the lives of children, including one of his friends Lulu, must put an end to all of the dark magic of Mr. Hood, destroy the House and all of its pitiful creatures that hide in its shadows. Harvey is bored and frustrated with his life in the first chapter, but he's very observant, smart, clever, and kind and does everything to help his friends and the children become free from the Holiday House and discovers in the end that there's nothing more powerful than the love of his family and friends and is the brightest child in the story. *Rictus ‚Äì One of four servants of Hood's. Rictus is six inches taller than Harvey, wears gentlemen's clothes, a tall brim hat, and wears spectacles. He's very thin, has yellowish skin, and has a grin that can stretch wider than any grin, resembling the bizarre Cheshire Cat from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Rictus's name means \\"a fixed grimace or grin.\\" *Jive ‚Äì One of four servants of Hood's. Jive's downfall occurs when he attempts to change Harvey's mind to stay at the Holiday House with pie and ice cream. Harvey tricks him by saying that the food's not real, but Jive unwillingly eats both plates of the pie and ice cream, which causes him to fall down and crawl on the stairs as he spews dirt and dust out of his mouth screaming for his master's help, and suddenly turns to a pile of dirt and dust. Jive's name means \\"deceitful or worthless.\\" *Marr ‚Äì One of four servants of Hood's. A grotesquely overweight female who is said to resemble a slug. Marr possesses the unique ability to manipulate human flesh into whichever shape she desires (similar to how one would mold clay). Marr's downfall occurs when Harvey forces her to see herself as the wretched slob that she is. Marr melts into a puddle of brackish, fleshy liquid. Marr's name is similar to the word \\"mar\\" which means to \\"impair the appearance of; disfigure.\\" *Carna ‚Äì One of four servants of Hood's. Carna's name could be alluding to the word \\"carnivore\\", which means \\"an animal that feeds on flesh.\\"Carna is not a human. *Wendell ‚Äì A naive, obnoxious boy who loves to be in the Holiday House and becomes friends with Harvey. At some point in the book, he becomes obese due to the food in the house, and wants to stay in the house, but ultimately leaves when the house burns down. *Lulu ‚Äì A girl about the same age as Harvey, who's been there longer than both he and Wendell. She has a room full of Christmas presents, as she has been there for months. She eventually has her soul taken by Mr. Hood. *Mrs. Griffin ‚Äì The housekeeper, and a fantastic cook. She has been there longer than anyone and seems to know more than she lets on. *Mr. Hood ‚Äì The owner of the Holiday House and is a part of the house. *The Holiday House ‚Äì The place where every day is perfect, and children can go to live out the rest of their lives if they are not careful. *Blue Cat ‚Äì Owned by Mrs. Griffin, who according to Mrs. Griffin, \\"has a good sense of direction\\" and helped Harvey and Wendell leave the holiday house. Blue Cat also dies because once Wendell and Harvey leave, Mr. Hood kills it. *Clue Cat ‚Äì Owned by Mrs. Griffin, who happened to die during lunch from burning alive due to a number of factors. *Stew Cat ‚Äì Owned by Mrs. Griffin.

History In 1755, the government of Denmark formally claimed sovereignty over Nicobars, under the name of Frederiks√∏erne (\\"Frederik Islands\\") and encouraged a mission established by the Moravian Brethren of Herrnhut. The Danes established a short-lived colony on the island which they named Ny Sj√¶lland (\\"New Zealand\\").https://books.google.com/books?id=cL5mAAAAcAAJ&dq;=%22Ny+Sj%C3%A6lland%22+%22Nancowry%22&pg;=PA31&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=%22Ny%20Sj%C3%A6lland%22%20%22Nancowry%22&f;=false Along with Kamorta Island, which lies just to the north, Nancowry Island forms the \\"magnificent land-locked\\" Nancowry Harbour, used by European sailors since at least the 17th century and described as \\"one of the safest natural harbours in the world\\" (). The harbour was apparently used as a base for piracy; in 1868, the British Navy entered the harbour in some force, destroying suspected pirate ships. 2004 tsunami The island, like many others in the Nicobar and Andaman islands, was severely affected by tsunamis generated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. According to reports from the Andaman and Nicobar Inspector General of Police, S.B. Deol, the Nancowry group of islands were among the worst-hit islands in the chain, with thousands missing and presumed dead. Post-tsunami satellite photos, and government situation reports indicate that while portions of Nancowry Island were affected, the adjoining islands of Katchall and Kamorta were more severely overrun. As of January 18, 2005, the government reported only 1 dead and 3 missing from Nancowry island, but 51 dead and 387 missing from Kamorta, and 345 dead and 4310 missing from Katchall. Demography As of the 2011 Indian census, there are 1019 persons living on Nancowry island. Geography Nancowry Island has an area of 47 km¬≤, and located 160 km south-southeast of Car Nicobar, the northernmost Nicobar island. Nancowry, like the Nicobar islands generally, is under the sovereignty of the nation of India. It is also part of the Nicobar and Andaman Tribal Reserve Area, which bars non-native people from visiting or conducting business on the island without permission in hopes of preserving the threatened native communities that live there.

Historical background Throughout history, Christian thought has struggled with the ideas of flesh, world, and spirit, and their interplay in each person's salvation. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) said in What It Means To Be a Christian (2006), \\"Christian theology... in the course of time turned the kingdom of God into a kingdom of heaven that is beyond this mortal life; the well-being of men became a salvation of souls, which again comes to pass beyond this life, after death.\\" This tendency of spiritualization, Ratzinger said, is not the message of Jesus Christ. \\"For what is sublime in this message,\\" he stated, \\"is precisely that the Lord was talking not just about another life, not just about men's souls, but was addressing the body, the whole man, in his embodied form, with his involvement in history and society; that he promised the kingdom of God to the man who lives bodily with other men in this history.\\"Joseph Ratzinger, What It Means To Be a Christian (2006) Christian materialism is a widely discussed position in contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, defended by figures such as Peter van InwagenPeter van Inwagen, \\"The Possibility of Resurrection\\" and Trenton Merricks.Trenton Merricks, \\"The Resurrection of the Body\\" Josemar√≠a Escriv√° and Opus Dei The most visible use of the term is found in the writings of Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, a Spanish Catholic saint of the twentieth century, who said that all temporal realities have a sanctifying power and Christians can find God in the most ordinary material things. As such, it is associated with the Roman Catholic prelature of Opus Dei which Escriva founded. It is an organization which teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life, even the most material activity, is a path to sanctity. Escriva criticized those who \\"have tried to present the Christian way of life as something exclusively spiritual, proper to pure, extraordinary people, who remain aloof from the contemptible things of this world, or at most tolerate them as something necessarily attached to the spirit, while we live on this earth. When things are seen in this way, churches become the setting par excellence of the Christian life. And being a Christian means going to church, taking part in sacred ceremonies, being taken up with ecclesiastical matters, in a kind of segregated world, which is considered to be the ante-chamber of heaven, while the ordinary world follows its own separate path.\\" Instead, he affirmed the \\"high value of the material.\\" According to him, \\"Authentic Christianity which professes the resurrection of all flesh, has always quite logically opposed 'dis-incarnation,' without fear of being judged materialistic. We can, therefore, rightfully speak of a Christian materialism, which is boldly opposed to those materialisms which are blind to the spirit.\\" (Italics added; see also ) In an address to a theological symposium, Holiness and the World, which studied the teachings of Josemaria Escriva, John Paul II referred to one of his homilies: :There is nothing that is outside of the concern of Christ. Speaking with theological rigor ... one cannot say that there are things ‚Äî good, noble or even indifferent ‚Äî which are exclusively profane; for the Word of God has made his dwelling the sons of men, he was hungry and thirsty, worked with his hands, knew friendship and obedience, experienced sorrow and death.(Conversations 112) In connection with this quote, John Paul II said that the Catholic Church today is \\"conscious of serving a redemption that concerns every aspect of human existence,\\" an awareness which was \\"prepared by a gradual intellectual and spiritual development.\\" He also said that the message of Escriva, which has contributed in this direction, stems \\"from a unique grasp of the radiant, universal force of the Redeemer's grace.\\" He later called Escriva \\"one of Christianity's great witnesses.\\"Syposium Holiness and the World Footnotes Materialism Christian philosophy ","title":"Christian materialism"},{"id":"1345251","text":"Location of the Achterhoek Flag of the Achterhoek (unofficial) Doesburg Zutphen Winterswijk. The Achterhoek (; ) is a cultural region in the eastern Netherlands. Its name (meaning \\"rear-corner\\") is geographically appropriate because the area lies in the easternmost part of Gelderland, and therefore in the east of the Netherlands, protruding into Germany. The Achterhoek lies at the East of the IJssel and Oude IJssel rivers. On the other sides, it the borders Germany and the Dutch province of Overijssel. The region is also called de Graafschap (Dutch for earldom, shire or county) because it coincides with the historical Zutphen County. The region is predominantly rural, with much open space, forests and farms. The area around the town of Winterswijk is regarded as very beautiful. A well-known beer originates from this region: Grolsch beer was first brewed in Groenlo in 1615. Language The original language of the Achterhoek is Achterhooks, a variety of Low Saxon. The language can also differ per municipality/town, even in such a way that a person speaking the 'Grols' variant (i.e. the dialect of Groenlo) will pronounce words differently from a person from Winterswijk which is merely 10 km to the east, although they will probably understand each other. The number of inhabitants whose sole language is Achterhooks has greatly declined over the last 60 years, inhabitants are raised with Dutch at school and the dialect is only spoken (sometimes) at home. Partly due to immigration from outside the Achterhoek region and the effects of national government, the Dutch language is having a significant impact on the dialect. Many old words have been forgotten and replaced by their Dutch-derived equivalents. Municipalities of Achterhoek The largest towns in the Achterhoek are: Doetinchem, Winterswijk, and Zutphen. Doesburg and Zutphen are old Hanseatic cities.

It is about a magical world that is hidden inside a tapestry, known as the Fugue, to safeguard it from both inquisitive humans and hostile supernatural foes. Two normal people become embroiled in the fate of the Fugue, attempting to save it from those who seek to destroy it. The book was nominated in 1988 for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. Plot summary Decades prior to the book's opening, a magical race known as the Seerkind combined all of their powers to create a secret world known as \\"the Fugue\\", a carpet into which they wove their most beloved locations, animals, possessions and themselves as a safe haven. Their aim was to avoid persecution by humans (who call them demons and fairies) and eradication by a destructive being known as the Scourge. This creature's nature is entirely unknown to the Seerkind, as no-one has survived to describe it. The Fugue, resembling an ordinary, albeit exquisitely woven, carpet is left in the care of a normal woman, Mimi Laschenski, who married one of the Seerkind and resides in Liverpool, England. Mimi reaches old age and is hospitalised following a stroke. A young man named Calhoun Mooney, chasing an escaped homing pigeon, accidentally glimpses the Fugue hidden in the carpet, which profoundly affects him. Simultaneously, Mimi's granddaughter Suzanna Parrish, arrives in the city at Mimi's behest. The mystery surrounding Mimi and the full potential of the carpet brings Cal and Suzanna together and quickly into confrontation with the primary antagonists: Immacolata, an exiled and extremely powerful Seerkind bent on revenge; Shadwell, a human salesman with limitless ambition; and Hobart, a conscientious policeman. Cal and Suzanna acquire new allies and abilities in their goal of protecting the Fugue from destruction, venturing into it themselves twice. When Shadwell's actions result in the Fugue's seemingly total obliteration, the surviving Seerkind scatter. In a last desperate attempt to finish them, Shadwell locates and awakens the Scourge, which begins systematically destroying any and all traces of magic it can find. Cal, Suzanna and their remaining allies make a final stand against Shadwell by using his own tactics against him and convince the Scourge to abandon its cause and leave the planet in peace. In the aftermath, a severely traumatised Cal is cared for by Suzanna whilst their friends adjust to permanent life amongst humanity. Eventually, Cal emerges from his withdrawal with the knowledge of how the Fugue is still alive and can be restored to its full glory. Characters *Calhoun \\"Cal\\" Mooney: A bored young man whose unremarkable life takes on a dramatic turn when he witnesses the Fugue. Immediately captivated, Cal attempts to simply observe the beauty of the Fugue once again but in doing so becomes embroiled in Immacolata and Shadwell's plot to destroy it. His salvation comes in the form of Suzanna as well as the Fugue's inhabitants who collectively encourage him to fight for it. Part of Cal's character development is a rite of passage less so of a boy to a man or even the reverse, but of a person self actualizing. His progression is charted through his recollections and imaginings of his grandfather; a poet dubbed \\"Mad Mooney\\". Through Cal's contact with the Seerkind he gradually inherits the identity of Mad Mooney himself. *Suzanna Parish: A young woman who pays a visit to her dying grandmother, Mimi Laschenski and is given clues to her family's secret past. Suzanna carries both Seerkind and Cuckoo blood in her veins. After accidentally obtaining the \\"Menstruum\\" by an attack from Immacolata, she becomes almost as powerful and develops a complicated kinship with her as the story progresses. Suzanna is a sculptor/potter and a self-described pragmatist, initially hesitant to comprehend the bizarre situations she comes to find herself in she adapts quickly and learns to rely more on her instincts and less on her \\"cuckoo thinking\\". The object of Cal's affections from the onset, Suzanna politely rejects his advances believing their friendship is based more upon trust and the shared experience of the Fugue rather than romantic intimacy, instead she forms a relationship with Jerichau up until his demise, at the novel's conclusion it is hinted that she has developed feelings for Cal. *Immacolata: A cold, ruthless sorceress, who was exiled by her own race for practising evil magic and desiring too much power. Already exceptionally gifted by the standards of the Seerkind, Immacolata is also a possessor/avatar of The Menstruum - a subtle, powerful and seemingly sentient form of magic that manifests only in women and differently with each individual - where Suzanna's is described as a heavenly silver light Immacolata's takes the form of her own weaponised blood. Introduced as the main villain of the first half of the book she has many aspects associated with the wicked witch trope such as avoiding sunlight and a predilection for surrounding herself with bones/body parts. Unlike her ally Shadwell, Immacolata acts out of revenge with no desire for personal gain. In achieving her goal she unwittingly brings about her own undoing when Shadwell betrays, humiliates and kills her. *Shadwell: A charismatic, middle-aged salesman. Little is revealed of his origins or even his full name,:he is simply an ordinary-looking salesman and through years of experience has honed his trade to an art. Shadwell can persuade, charm and intimidate any prospective buyer through his own talent and through the use of a gift given by Immacolata; a jacket with enchanted lining in which viewers see whatever their heart most desires. At an unspecified time prior to the book's opening he was approached by Immacolata to be her ally in unmaking The Fugue, the existence of which he seemingly accepted with ease. He initially accepts her mission as an exciting challenge; the ultimate sale, with both knowing that the selling of something so powerful into any inexperienced hands would result in disaster for both buyer and goods, as is Immacolata's plan. *The Scourge: a catastrophic, ancient power of unknown origin that was present at the first emergence/evolution of the Seerkind. When they left their mutual garden home it reacted to their abandonment violently and slew them by the hundreds if not thousands. When its quarry vanished from sight into the rug, the Scourge returned to their ancestral garden to stand guard over the rest of time. In its lonely watch the Scourge slowly succumbed to madness forgetting itself, its duty and the Seerkind as well (although Immacolata given her great power could still sense its dormancy and inevitable re-awakening much to her terror). Secluded in time, when its garden (which is situated in a vast desert wasteland) is discovered by human explorers it learns from them the story of Genesis and after killing them takes its home for the garden of Eden and sees itself as an avenging angel: Uriel. Physically the Scourge (when not controlling a human host) is described as indefinite and full of paradoxes, genderless and at once dark and bleached, towering and infinitesimal and always surrounded by a smothering fog. Its only physical qualities, if any are innumerable eyes that rotate seemingly on wheels of fire throughout its shapeless form, indeed Barker attributes The Scourge to a being of geometries and fire rather than a corporeal entity. *The Hag: one of Immacolata's triplet sisters, whom she strangled while all three were in the womb. The Hag survived as the ghostly presence of a gruesome old woman, always accompanying her sisters and helping when necessary. She can divine knowledge by examining the afterbirth produced by her prolific and likewise ghostly sister. The Hag is permanently killed by her sister's progeny when Shadwell gains control of them. *The Magdalene: Immacolata's other triplet sister who also survives after her prenatal death as ectoplasm. She frequently rapes defenceless men and gives birth to brutally deformed abominations (called by-blows) within hours of their conception. *Hobart: A British police inspector with unwavering dedication to the law, Hobart is contemptuous of civilians and criminals alike, believing everyone is guilty of something. Practical and narrow-minded to a fault, when first confronted with the after-effects of magic he deduces they are the result of unknown terrorist actions. When Suzanna and Jerichau accidentally incite a riot in down-town Liverpool he becomes convinced they are criminal masterminds and from there onwards become Suzanna's personal nemesis leading a nationwide manhunt for her. *The Rake: A hideous phantasm of a former sorcerer named Domville who tested Immacolata by becoming a necromancer in an attempt to seduce her, believing himself to be more powerful than her. The attempt failed when he brought forth 'the Surgeons' (although it is never confirmed, it is heavily implied that these were the Cenobites from Barker's earlier work 'The Hellbound Heart' and its subsequent film adaptation 'Hellraiser'), who proceeded to fillet him. He is resurrected by Immacolata as a terrifying boneless demon and sent to assassinate the Seerkind which he does, claiming the life of Lillia before being destroyed by a passing train after being lured onto the tracks by Cal and Nimrod. *Jerichau St. Louis: one of the Seerkind who is among the first five to be unleashed from the rug. He later becomes Suzanna's friend and companion, choosing not to return to the weave. *Nimrod: another one of the first five Seerkind to be unleashed from the carpet after Cal tears off a piece of it. He is a shape-shifter, initially trapped in the form of the infant which he used to escape from a jilted husband whose wife he had seduced. *Mimi Laschenski: Suzanna's grandmother, the guardian of the rug. At the time Immacolata tracks her down, she is too old and weak to use an effective magical trick and willingly dies to prevent herself from disclosing any secrets, under Immacolata's pressure. *Romo: A Seerkind lion tamer and husband of Mimi. During an encounter with Immacolata, his lions grievously wound her in revenge for Mimi's death at the hands of the dark sorceress. *Balm de Bono: A Seerkind rope-dancer. He becomes friends with Cal during Calhoun's first visit to the Fugue, and later warns him and Suzanna of the approaching Scourge following a failed attempt to invoke the Old Science to combat it. *Lemuel Lo: Owns an orchard of enchanted fruit (Giddy fruit) in the Fugue, which is later burned to the ground by Hobart's invading forces.

He commanded the fleet of the North Sea during the Second Schleswig War of 1864, and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He is often considered by some Austrian historians to be one of the most adept naval officers of the 19th- century, due to his tactical inventiveness, sense of command, and inspirational leadership.Antonio Schmidt-Brentano: Die K.K bzw.

Band I 1808‚Äì1895, Bibliotheksverlag, Osnabr√ºck 1997, S. 176‚Äì187. Early life and career Tegetthoff was born in Marburg, Styria in Austrian Empire (now Maribor in Slovenia), on 23 December 1827 the son of Karl von Tegetthoff, an Oberstleutnant in the Austrian Army. On his mother's side he was related to Johann Kaspar Freiherr von Seiller, Mayor of Vienna from 1851 to 1861. Entering the Marinecollegium (naval academy) in Venice in 1840, Tegetthoff became a Seekadett on 23 July 1845 and witnessed the Venetian uprising in 1848/49. He received a commission upon his graduation on 16 April 1849 and took part in the blockade of Venice from May to August 1849. Tegetthoff was promoted to Fregattenleutnant on 16 June 1851 and Linienschiffsleutnant on 16 November 1852. Tegetthoff received his first command, the naval schooner Elisabeth, in 1854. This was at the time of the Austrian Navy's intensive conversion to steam power, of which he was an earnest advocate. In 1855 he was appointed commander of the paddle steamer Taurus, patrolling the Sulina mouth of the Danube during the Crimean War. This service brought him to the favorable notice of Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria, the Oberkommandant der Marine (High Commander of the Navy), with whom he had been acquainted since 1850. Promoted to Korvettenkapit√§n in 1857, Tegetthoff served on a semi-official scientific expedition to the Red Sea and to the island of Socotra.https://diepresse.com/home/science/4753641/Kolonialgeschichte_Tegetthoffs- stuemperhafte-Geheimmission Having shown exceptional diplomatic and organizational ability, in December 1857 he was appointed a staff officer. He was named commander in 1858 of the new screw corvette Erzherzog Friedrich on the coast of Morocco, then in a confused state of disorder. The Italian campaign of 1859 saw the Austrians unable to challenge the French fleet for mastery of the Adriatic. With the return of peace, Tegetthoff accompanied Ferdinand Maximilian on a voyage to Brazil to visit Emperor Pedro II during the winter of 1859/60. Promoted Fregattenkapit√§n on 27 April 1860 and Linienschiffskapit√§n on 23 November 1861, he was named commander of the Levant Squadron in 1862. In this capacity, he monitored the Greek revolution that deposed King Otto I and the anti-Western disturbances in Syria. Second Schleswig War Tegetthoff (centre) at the Battle of Lissa, painting by Anton Romako, 1880 During the Second Schleswig War, Tegetthoff as a Kommodore was given command, in February 1864, of a small Austrian squadron that sailed to the North Sea to support the very weak Prussian naval forces against the superior Danish navy which was blockading northern German ports. He was engaged by a Danish squadron commanded by Edouard Suenson at the Battle of Heligoland, in which Tegetthoff's flagship, the screw frigate Schwarzenberg, caught fire in a close-range gunnery fight with the Danish frigates Niels Juel and Jylland. Although the action was a tactical defeat for Tegetthoff, he achieved his main objective since the Danish squadron was shortly thereafter recalled to Copenhagen, lifting the blockade of the Elbe and Weser ports. Tegetthoff's telegraphic dispatch was answered by Emperor Franz Josef I with another on 12 May 1864 promoting him Kontreadmiral (Rear Admiral) and conferring upon him the Order of the Iron Crown. Seven Weeks' War Tegetthoff was appointed commander of the Austrian battle fleet on 9 May 1866, shortly before the Seven Weeks' War against Italy. Although the Italian fleet was larger and more powerful, Tegetthoff decided to engage it after a successful reconnaissance of the Italian base of Ancona on 27 June 1866. With their army suffering defeats against the Austrians during the first week of the war from 20 to 27 June 1866, the Italians sought a victory over the Austrian navy by sending their fleet against the Austrian naval base at Lissa, off the coast of Dalmatia near Sp√†lato (Split) on 16 July 1866. Encountering the Italian fleet early on the morning of 20 July 1866, Tegetthoff sailed straight for the center of the Italian fleet, hoping to ram the ships to make up for his own fleet's lack of firepower (Rammstosstaktik). The smoke from the Italian ships made visibility very poor, however, and the Austrians missed the Italian fleet completely. Swinging around, Tegetthoff again charged, this time setting two Italian armored ships on fire and damaging several more. After Tegetthoff's flagship, the Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, rammed and sank the armored Italian frigate Re d'Italia, the Italian fleet retreated the next day. Tegetthoff returned in triumph to his base at Pola. Nevertheless, his victory did not materially affect the outcome of the war, as Italy's alliance with Prussia ensured an advantageous peace due to Prussian victory in the Austro- Prussian War. Tegetthoff was immediately promoted, by telegraph, to Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral). He received congratulatory telegrams from Ferdinand Maximilian, by then the embattled Emperor of Mexico, and Vizeadmiral Hans Birch Dahlerup, former Oberkommandant der Marine (High Commandant of the Navy). Tegetthoff was decorated with the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa and made honorary citizen of Vienna. Following the victory of Lissa, Tegetthoff urged Franz Josef to annex the hinterland of the Dalmatian coast, so as to protect the region for development of naval bases. This was in fact accomplished with the occupation (1878) and annexation (1908) of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though long after Tegetthoff's death. Tegetthoff undertook a journey of study to France, Britain and the United States in 1866/67. Upon the execution of Ferdinand Maximilian by the Mexican government of Benito Ju√°rez, Tegetthoff was sent with the screw frigate Novara to bring his body home to Austria, arriving in the port of Trieste on 16 January 1868. Late years He received the post of Marinekommandant, as the chief administrative officer was named in 1865 in succession of Viceadmiral Ludwig von Fautz. In March 1868 Tegetthoff took also charge as Chef der Marinesektion (Chief of the Naval Section) of the War Ministry of the new dual monarchy. Despite considerable resistance from the General Staff, he vigorously pursued a complete reform of the Austro-Hungarian Navy; his reforms remained in force until the fall of the Donaumonarchie in 1918. On 1 April 1868 Tegetthoff was made a Geheimrat and a member of the Herrenhaus. Tegetthoff died suddenly from pneumonia on 7 April 1871 in Vienna at the age of 43. His grave is located in the cemetery of St. Leonhard in Graz.Manfred Jasser: Hoch vom Dachstein an. Das Steiermark-Brevier.Paul Neff Verlag, Wien 1990 S. 64. In 1871 One florin match in today's money about six euros. He was succeeded as head of the naval administration by Friedrich von P√∂ck.  Memorials  Memorial to Tegetthoff in Vienna Memorials to Tegetthoff were erected in Marburg, Vienna and Pola. The monument on Vienna's Praterstern, the largest traffic junction of the city, consists of a column 11 meters high (by Karl Hasenauer), topped by a bronze statue of Tegetthoff, some 3.5 meters in height, by Carl Kundmann and was finished in 1886.Felix Czeike: Historisches Lexikon Wien, volume 5, Kremayr & Scheriau, Vienna 1997, , p. 424 The memorial at Pola, also by Kundmann, was erected in 1877 and consists of a bronze statue of Tegetthoff, with supporting bronze mythological figures. Pola passed to Italian sovereignty in 1919, and in 1935 the monument was moved to Graz, Austria. Tegetthoff was pictured on an Austrian postage stamp in 1935 and on a 20-euro coin minted in 2004 (see below). Ships named for Tegetthoff included: * The arctic research ship SMS Tegetthoff (1872). * The central battery ship ‚Äì renamed SMS Mars in 1912. * The dreadnought battleship . Of these, the first was used in the 1872‚Äì74 arctic expedition of Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht which discovered Franz Josef Land in 1873. The expedition's first discovery was named Cape Tegetthoff. See also S.M.S.

The s≈´rah takes its name from the mention of the parties (al-a·∏•zƒÅb), or confederates (an alliance among the Quraysh and other tribes), who fought the Muslims at the Battle of the Trench (5/627), also known as the Battle of the Parties and as the Siege of Madinah.Joseph E. B. Lumbard, \\"Introduction to S≈´rat al-A·∏•zƒÅb in The Study Quran, ed. S. H. Nasr, Caner Dagli, Maria Dakake, and Mohammed Rustom (HarperOne, 2015). In the 1730s George Sale noted that Muslims have divided the Quran into sixty equal portions, which they call Ahz√¢b, in the singular Hizb, each subdivided into four equal parts; an imitation of the Jewish division of their Mishna into sixty portions.Sale, Preliminary discourse 3 Exegesis This surah mentions what happened at the Battle of the Trench to remind believers the mercy and power of Allah since Allah made the various tribes who attacked Medina leave. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), Q33 is a later period \\"Medinan surah\\". It contains instructions regarding treatment of the Prophet and his wives and warns the hypocrites of their bad behavior. According to some scholars, Medinan verses are concerned with the legal matters in Islamic society. These suras generally contain rules and regulations for the believers to follow. 33:5-6 Adopted and blood-related persons Verses 33:5-6 are concerned with the differences between adopted and blood-related persons. Verse 33:5 refers to adoption in Islam and verse 33:6 contains a reference to the term \\"Mother of Believers\\", who were the Prophet's wives. This perhaps suggests their elevated standing with the community and in the later verses, these women are described as \\"unlike any other.\\" 33:7-8 Sincerity of the prophets Verses 33:7-8 show that God will test even the sincerity of the prophets. The beginning of the sura seems to be concerned with truthfulness. The sura reinforces that \\"God is enough to trust...All this is written in the Scripture...God will question [even] the truthful about their sincerity, and for those who reject the truth He has prepared a painful torment...speak in a direct fashion.\\" Truthfulness and trust seem to be emphasized for believers and Muhammad since he was dealing with hypocrites and betrayers in Medina, who spread lies, deserted the army during the battle, or supported the attackers. 33:9-27 Battle of the Trench - Aftermath Verses 33:9-27 are concerned with the believers and hypocrites' reactions to the Battle of the Trench. The believers are those who remain steadfast in their belief and courage whereas the hypocrites try to run for safety, abandon the Muslim army, and doubt God and Prophet Muhammad. =Verse 33:21= \\"Surely, in the Messenger of God there is for you a fairer, good example for those whose hope had been in God and the Last Day and remembered God frequently.\\" shows is an important principle to follow the Messenger of God in all his words and deeds, =Verse 33:26= contains a reference to the Siege of the Banu Qurayza and consequent looting of their possessions. 33:28-34 Mohammad's wives  contain a reference to Mohammad's wives and tell the believers the proper conduct with Muhammad and his household. The prophet's wives are called the Mothers of the Believers and thus have to follow certain rules and regulations as women who are \\"unlike other women.\\" =Verse 33:33= According to Shi ªi interpretation, contains a reference to Ahl al-Bayt, the members of the Prophet's household. They are the Prophet, His Daughter Lady Fatimah, Imam Ali (a.s), Imam Hassan (a.s) and Imam Hussein (a.s). This Verse was revealed after Event of the Ahl al-Kisa and is also known as the Verse of Purification. The Shi'i scholars prove that this Ayah applies to the Household of the Prophet and not His Wives by using the change in grammar in the particular part of the verse. It addresses a group of people rather than females only, which would have been the case if it was addresssing the wives of the Holy Prophet. 33:35-36 Forgiveness and reward  show the characteristics of people who will be forgiven and rewarded by God. Some scholars take these verses to mean equal worth of women and men and thus reject claims that women are inferior to men. 33:37-47 God to be trusted, obeyed, and glorified reaffirm that God needs to be trusted, obeyed, and glorified. contains a reference to Finality of Prophethood. 33:49-52 Who the prophet can marry  detail who the prophet can marry or not. Verse 50 was revealed pertaining to Maymunah bint al-Harith. 33:53-58 House rules tell the believers how they should interact with Muhammad when visiting him and his household. 33:59 Islam and gender segregation uses the phrase adna al-jilbab which is sometimes understood as 'wrap around' and is used to acknowledge women to cover themselves, as an act of modesty.. 33:60-73 punishment for hypocrites and idolaters tell the actions that God will take with the disbelievers and believers and will direct Muhammad to take against the hypocrites. The last verse ends with the proclamation that God will punish both hypocrites and idolaters, whether they are men and women, and reward the believers of both genders. Both genders are presented as equal since they are both punished or redeemed without any differences when judged by God.

It discusses the lives of Solomon and David, a story about the people of Sheba, challenges and warnings against the disbelievers as well as the promises related to the Day of Judgment. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it has been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.  Revelation history  The chapter was revealed during the Meccan period of Muhammad's prophethood, therefore, a Meccan sura. Some commentators of the Quran, including Ahmad ibn Ajiba, Mahmud al-Alusi, Ibn al-Jawzi, and Al-Qurtubi opined that the sixth verse was an exception and was revealed in the Medinan period.  Content  The chapter began with the phrase Alhamdulillah (\\"Praise be to God\\"), one of the five chapter where to do so‚Äîthe others are Al FƒÅti·∏•ah, Al-An'am, Al-Kahf and Fatir. The first two verses assert God's praiseworthiness and omnipotence. The following verses (3‚Äì9) criticized the disbelievers for their rejection of the resurrection, the Day of Judgement and of Muhammad's message. The ninth verse also mentions the orderliness of the universe as evidence of God's omnipotence. The following verses (10‚Äì14) briefly discuss David and Solomon, both considered prophets by Islam. Verses 15‚Äì19 contain a story about the eponymous people of Sheba. The story is based on the ancient Sabaeans who lived in the central lowlands of Yemen. According to the verses, they were originally prosperous, but turned away from worshiping and giving thanks to God, and as a result suffered a flood. The story is presented as a warning against worldly pride and arrogance. Orientalist A. F. L. Beeston linked the story to the prosperous Sabeans of the Ma'rib oasis who settled on each side of the wadi (hence the reference to \\"the garden of the right\\" and \\"of the left\\" in verse 15. Beeston, another orientalist J√©r√©mie Schiettecatte, as well as the Quranic commentary The Study Quran argued that the flood corresponds to the failure of the dam system that irrigated the community. The dams were mentioned in inscriptions dated from around 450‚Äì540 CE, and The Study Quran further argues that the phrase \\"the flood of 'Arim\\" correspond to the triliteral root  ø-r-m that appeared in the inscriptions to refer to the dam system. The rest of the chapter discusses various topics, including the nature of Iblis (the Devil in the Islamic tradition), challenges to those who reject the message of Islam, warnings of the consequences which will come to them in the Day of Judgement, as well as the nature of Muhammad's mission.  Name  The name of the chapter refers to Sheba, a kingdom mentioned in the Quran and the Bible. Sheba is the subject of the verses 15 to 21 of the chapter, although this passage likely does not refer to the kingdom under the famous Queen of Sheba, but rather about a group of people in the same region in a later period. Orientalist A. F. L. Beeston and J√©r√©mie Schiettecatte identified the people in these verses to be the Sabaeans who lived in the Ma'rib valley.

The amendment set the first federal vehicle emissions standards, beginning with the 1968 models. These standards were reductions from the 1963 emissions: 72% reduction for hydrocarbons, 56% reduction for carbon monoxide, and 100% reduction for crankcase hydrocarbons. The impact the regulatory standards will have on air quality in the future, as well as the potential characteristics of the vehicle fleet can be analyzed with the use of roadway air dispersion models. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a department specific to the Clean Air Act. Its purpose is to make sure the amount of air pollution emitted stays inside the standards set by the U.S. Each state is required to have a state implementation plan (SIPs) that clearly indicates how it will enforce the regulations of the Clean Air Act. The states have to create regulations of their own that also adhere to the guidelines of the U.S. regulations; in order to do so, they must hold hearings so the public can contribute ideas and provide feedback.The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act, U.S. EPA website, see pages 1-2 for explanation of the roles of the states and local governments as well as the role of the U.S. EPA. Cleaning up commonly found air pollutants The six common air pollutants of primary concern to the United States are particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead.Cleaning Up Commonly Found Air Pollutants, U.S. EPA website These pollutants are detrimental to health, the environment, and a person's home and other belongings. The worst two of the six pollutants are particle pollution and ground-level ozone, which have to be regulated by the EPA. Particle pollution, or particle matter, consists of soot, smoke, and chemically formed \\"droplets\\". These particles are very small and can bury themselves deep inside the lungs. Ground-level ozone is found in smog and can also negatively affect the lungs. Smog contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). VOCs come from cars burning gasoline, petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, etc., while NOx results from burning gasoline, coal, or oil. Cars, trucks, buses, and non-road equipment Motor vehicles contribute a great deal to air pollution, so to reduce the amount of emissions released, the EPA placed restrictions on fuel and engine production. As a result, manufacturers are required to build cleaner engines and refiners are required to produce cleaner fuels. Gasoline used to include lead, which can cause damage to bodily functions and organs and sulfur was lowered over 90 percent in fuels because it doesn't allow a vehicle's catalytic converter to effectively clean up the exhaust.Cars, Trucks, Buses, and \\"Nonroad\\" Equipment, U.S. EPA website. Unlike most small cars, the majority of trucks, buses, and non-road equipment use diesel engines because they are more fuel efficient. However, they are also more harmful to the environment. In order to cut the emissions, the EPA issued rules to combine strict emissions standards for diesel engines and to lower sulfur diesel fuel. Alternative fuels such as natural gas, propane, methanol, ethanol, electricity, and biodiesel, are a major area of interest for the Clean Air Act. It is also important to find renewable fuels that can come from resources such as wood, waste paper, grasses, vegetable oils, and corn. Interstate and international air pollution Air pollution is not contained and is carried by the wind all over the world. Industries contribute air pollution in the form of smog and haze in \\"downwind states\\".Interstate and International Air Pollution, U.S. EPA website Sometimes pollution from \\"upwind states\\" blows into the downwind states, which can affect their air quality standards. These states can ask the EPA to enforce \\"a federal plan\\" to make sure that the standards are met. The Clean Air Act also requires that national parks maintain clear air; therefore, the EPA must collaborate with states to diminish the \\"regional haze\\" in national parks and wilderness areas. Reducing acid rain Acid precipitation comes in more forms than just rain. Snow, fog, mist, gas, and dust are also formed in the atmosphere and have the ability to become acid precipitation.Reducing Acid Rain, U.S. EPA website These types of precipitation are formed when certain types of air pollutants mix with the moisture in the air to form an acid. Each type is potentially dangerous to humans' health, can cause haze and problems in the environment, and can cause damage to people's properties. The two main pollutants that cause acid precipitation are sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Power plants that burn coal and \\"heavy oil\\" are accountable for over two- thirds of SO2 emissions annually in the U.S., while automobiles emit about fifty percent NOx and power plants emit about forty percent. The remaining percentages are from industrial and commercial boilers. Any toxin is harmful to life on Earth. Acid rain and snow can increase the acidity in lakes and streams long enough to harm fish and other forms of life. Sulfur dioxide can be dangerous to children and the elderly by causing serious damage to lung tissue. In 1990, the Clean Air Act was changed to include a \\"nationwide approach\\" to lowering SO2 and NOx emissions. A cap was placed on the total SO2 emissions from electric power plants across the U.S. Reducing toxic air pollutants Toxic air pollutants are the suspected cause of major illnesses and issues with reproductive problems. These pollutants stay in the environment for long periods, which can affect all living things and start a chain of negative events. In particular, smokestacks and automobiles are the two main sources of toxic air pollutants. When refueling, the gases turn into vapor that leak into the air. \\"Before the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, EPA regulated air toxics one chemical at a time.\\" Reducing Toxic Air Pollutants, U.S. EPA website The EPA now regulates pollutants by categories of industries because they release more than one chemical at a time. Some of the categories are, chemical plants, incinerators, dry cleaners, and manufacturers of wood furniture. Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, air toxics from large industries have already been reduced by 70 percent. Protecting the stratosphere ozone layer Ozone can be harmful if it is ground-level, but if it is in the stratosphere, it protects the Earth from ultraviolet rays from the sun. The stratosphere blocks some of the light called ultraviolet B, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage. It can also damage plant life on land and in the ocean.Protecting the Stratospheric Ozone Layer, U.S. EPA website Some of the main pollutants that are harmful to the stratosphere are called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). They come from aerosols such as hairspray, air conditioners, and some other types. They were banned in the 1970s. In the 1980s, scientists found that there were holes in the ozone around the South Pole. As a result, over 190 countries, including the United States, signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol. This agreement is designated to eliminating chemicals that harm the stratosphere. The 1990 Clean Air Act \\"phased out\\" the most harmful chemicals and in 1996, production of CFCs, halons, and methyl chloroform ended in the United States. There are still holes in the ozone that will take approximately 60 years to close up because of the chemicals that are already in the stratosphere. Permits and enforcement Congress added an operating permit program to the 1990 Clean Air Act for larger industries and commercial sources that release toxins into the air.Permits and Enforcement, U.S. EPA website These permits have information about which pollutants are emitted, how much may be emitted, and what actions the person in charge is taking to minimize the pollution. Permits must also state plans to measure and report the air pollution produced. The EPA is also responsible for making sure each state and tribe abides by the permits. For businesses that qualify for more than one thing under the Clean Air Act, operating permits are helpful because the information is all there. These permits tell them exactly what they need to do to prevent pollution. Now the EPA is more powerful in being able to enforce the rules instead of having to handle everything in court. The EPA can either \\"issue an order requiring the violator to comply, issue and administrative penalty order, or bring a civil judicial action\\". Public participation Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, the public has the opportunity to give input on \\"how a law is carried out\\".Public Participation, U.S. EPA website Hearings are held in different cities in the United States by the EPA. Anyone who attends is allowed to participate or written comments can be sent to the EPA. These hearings are open to the public when a \\"major rule\\" is about to be discussed. The more public input is recorded, the better the outcome will be for communities around the country. Reports from the Clean Air Act are made available to the public and they include information about the amount of pollution that is emitted by industries and other sources.

Since 2 September 1986 the airport is named after Tancredo de Almeida Neves (1910‚Äì1985), President-elect of Brazil. It is located in the municipality of Confins, in the Minas Gerais. It is operated by BH Airport S.A. History The airport was built by Infraero and inaugurated in 1984. Its purpose was to lessen the congestion at Pampulha Airport, which at the time was operating at 120% of its capacity of 1.3 million passengers per year. It was expected that by 1990, passenger movement at Confins would be nearly 2 million passengers per year. However, it surpassed the 1 million passenger mark only 22 years later. Presently its maximum operational capacity is 22 million passengers per year.url=http://www.bh- airport.com.br/novoaeroporto/ After its inauguration, just a small fraction of the capacity of Confins was used. This was partly due to its distance from downtown Belo Horizonte and, until recently, to the lack of satisfactory transportation alternatives for the pricey (about US$40) taxi rides. The over- crowded Pampulha Airport remained the airport of choice. Airport exterior In order to revert this scenario, in March 2005 the government of the state of Minas Gerais with the support of agencies of the Federal government decided to restrict Pampulha to operations of aircraft with capacity of up to 50 passengers. In the months thereafter, most operations were forced to move to Confins and the airport gained a new momentum. At that time, 130 flights were transferred from Pampulha to Confins, increasing annual passenger flow from 350,000 to around 3.0 million that year. The problems related to the distance of Confins to downtown Belo Horizonte were lessened by recent projects such as the improvement of the highway that links the city center to the airport (MG-10 highway), part of a larger project called Linha Verde (Green Line), which seeks to reduce the time needed to reach the airport. Another project called the \\"Industrial Airport\\" is underway. In this project the government will exempt tax of businesses interested in settling their operations near the airport. Its cargo facilities have a capacity of handling 18.000 tones (39.682.000 lb) and the warehouse has 6.400 m¬≤ (68.889 ft¬≤). The main maintenance facilities of Gol Airlines are located at this airport. On 26 April 2011 it was confirmed that in order to speed-up much needed renovation and upgrade works, private companies would be granted a concession to explore some Infraero airports - among them, in a later phase, Confins. The plan was confirmed on 31 May 2011 and it was added that Infraero would retain 49% of the shares of each privatized airport and that negotiations were expected to be concluded in the first half of 2012. On 22 November 2013 the Brazilian Government had a bidding process to determine the operator of the airport from 2014 until 2044. The group BH Airport formed by CCR (75%) and the administrator of Munich and Zurich Airports (25%) won the competition. On 16 September 2015, all international operations were transferred to a new provisional terminal - Terminal 3 while domestic operations remained in Terminal 1. The construction of Terminal 2 - an extension of Terminal 1 - started in September 2015 and finished in December 2016. It increased the airports capacity to 22 million passengers per year. On 8 December 2016 Terminal 2 was opened for domestic operations and in January 2017 international operations were transferred from Terminal 3. With the transfer of operations, Terminal 3 was closed. Future developments On 31 August 2009, the previous concessionary, Infraero, unveiled a BRL342.3 million (US$180.3 million; EUR126.4 million) investment plan to upgrade Tancredo Neves International Airport, focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The investment was supposed to be distributed as follows: *Parking. Value 6.8. Completed: July 2010 *Extension of runway, enlargement of apron and cargo terminal, construction of further taxiways. Value 120.0. Completed. *Renovation of the passenger terminal. Value 215.5. As of March 2016, only the parking lot and the apron expansion works have been completed. After many successive postponements due to budget cuts and judicial disputes between the airport administration, Infraero, the federal government and the contractors, the lengthening of the runway to was completed in June 2016. As part of the concession, BH Airport committed itself to construct a new parallel runway with a length of , connecting taxiways and service roads as well as a multi- storey car park until 2020.

The surah focuses on establishing the Qur'an as a divine source, and it warns of the fate of those who mock God's revelations and are stubborn. The surah tells of the punishments that plagued past generations of nonbelievers as a warning to present and future generations. Additionally, the surah reiterates God's sovereignty as exemplified by His creations through signs from nature. The surah ends with arguments in favor of the existence of Resurrection and God's sovereign power.

Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project. http://surah-yasin.com// YƒÅ Sƒ´n presents the message of the Qur'an in an efficient and powerful manner, with its quick and rhythmic verses. This surah asserts that Muhammad was not a poet, rather he was the greatest and the last messenger of Allah to come.  Virtues  It is recorded in Sunan al-Darimi that Muhammad said that \\"If anyone recites Yaseen at the beginning of the day, their needs for that day will be fulfilled.‚Äù In another narration, this S≈´rah has been described as the key to all good in this life and in the hereafter and a safety from all evil in this life and in the hereafter.

Sections and themes  There are three main themes of yƒÅ sƒ´n: Tawhid, the oneness of God; Risala, that Muhammad is a messenger sent by God to guide His creations through divine revelation; and the reality of Akhirah, the Last Judgment.Shaykh Abdul-Nasir Jangda. Tafsir Surah yƒÅ sƒ´n. Ramadhaan 1432 A.H. http://www.linguisticmiracle.com/yasin 36:70 ‚ÄúThis is a revelation, an illuminating Qur‚Äôan to warn anyone who is truly alive, so that God‚Äôs verdict may be passed against the disbelievers.‚Äù The Qur'an. A new translation by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem. Oxford University Press. 2004. Pg. 284 The surah repeatedly warns of the consequences of not believing in the legitimacy or the revelation of Muhammad, and encourages believers to remain steadfast and resist the mockery, oppression, and ridicule they receive from polytheists and nonbelievers. The arguments arise in three forms: a historical parable, a reflection on the order in the universe, and lastly a discussion of resurrection and human accountability. The chapter begins with an affirmation of the legitimacy of Muhammad. For example, verses 2-6, \\"By the wise Qur'an, you [Muhammad] are truly one of the messengers sent of a straight path, with a revelation from the Almighty, the Lord of Mercy, to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, and so they are unaware.\\"The Qur'an. A new translation by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem. Oxford University Press. 2004. Pg. 281 The first passage, verses 1-12, focuses primarily with promoting the Qur'an as guidance and establishing that it is God's sovereign choice who will believe and who will not. It is stated that regardless of a warning, the nonbelievers cannot be swayed to believe. 36:10 \\"It is all the same to them whether you warn them or not: they will not believe.\\" Surah YƒÅ æ-Sƒ´n then proceeds to tell the tale of the messengers that were sent to warn nonbelievers, but who were rejected. Although the messengers proclaimed to be legitimate, they were accused of being ordinary men by the nonbelievers. 36:15-17 \\"They said, 'Truly, we are messengers to you,' but they answered, 'You are only men like ourselves. The Lord of Mercy has sent nothing; you are just lying.\\"The Qur'an. A new translation by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem. Oxford University Press. 2004. Pg.281 However, a man from amongst these people beseeched them to believe in the messengers. Upon his death, the man entered Paradise, and lamented the fate of the nonbelievers. 36:26 \\"He was told, 'Enter the Garden,' so he said, 'If only my people knew how my Lord has forgiven me and set me among the highly honored.\\"The Qur'an. A new translation by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem. Oxford University Press. 2004. Pg. 282 This surah is meant to warn the nonbelievers of the consequences of their denial. Verse 36:30 goes on to state: \\"Alas for human beings! Whenever a messenger comes to them they ridicule him.\\"The Qur'an. A new translation by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem. Oxford University Press. 2004. Pg.282 Ultimately, it is God's will who will be blind and who will see. The following passage addresses the signs of God's supremacy over nature. This is presented by the sign of revived land, the sign of day and night, the sign of the arc and the flood, and the sign of the sudden blast that arrives on the day of judgement. 36:33-37 The sign of revived land follows: The disbelievers do not recognize God‚Äôs power in the natural world, although He is the one Creator. The surah further addresses what will happen to those who reject the right path presented by Muhammad and refuse to believe in God. On the last day, the day of reckoning, the nonbelievers will be held accountable for their actions and will be punished accordingly. God warned the nonbelievers of Satan, and yet Satan led them astray. 36:60-63 \\"Children of Adam, did I not command you not to serve Satan, for he was your sworn enemy, but to serve Me? This is the straight path. He has led great numbers of you astray. Did you not use your reason? So this is the fire that you were warned against.\\"The Qur'an. A new translation by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem. Oxford University Press. 2004. Pg. 283 Although God warned them against following Satan, the nonbelievers were deaf, and so now they will suffer the consequences of their ill judgements. 36:63 \\"So this is the Fire that you were warned against. Enter it today, because you went on ignoring [my commands].\\" The surah proceeds to address the clear nature of the revelation and assure that Muhammad is a legitimate prophet. 36:69 states, \\"We have not taught the Prophet poetry, nor could he ever have been a poet.\\" YƒÅ æ-Sƒ´n concludes by reaffirming God‚Äôs sovereignty and absolute power. 36:82-83 \\"When He wills something to be, His way is to say, 'Be'‚Äîand it is! So glory be to Him in whose Hand lies control over all things. It is to Him that you will all be brought back.\\" It is to God, the one Creator who holds everything in His hands, that everything returns. The closing passage is absolute and powerful and carries an essential message of the Qur'an.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. Chronology According to Egyptian chronology, it was the 56th sura to be revealed to Muhammad. Theodor N√∂ldeke presents a different classification putting it in the 50th position and most precisely revealed in the second Meccan period (see Meccan sura). That period is marked by increasing opposition of the Quraysh tribe against Muhammad and his followers and is distinguished by its focus on divine intervention and inspiration and also previous religious prophets. Although named Al-Saffat, the general theme of Sura 37 is the unity of God and His power to greatly reward and punish. We see in this Sura elaborations on the punishment of disbelievers and rewards of believers in the Day of Judgment but also God's examples of how a true believer should be through enumerations of biblical figures. One aspect of the Sura which can be relevant to the title (Ranged in Row, the rangers) is that it is threatening the people who attribute offspring to God, especially the pagans who believed that the angels were the daughters of God. ‚ÄúThe rangers‚Äù or ‚ÄúRanged in Row‚Äù refers to the angel who will be lining up on the Day of Judgment and refuting the idea of them being daughters of God (see Quran 37:1-5). Parts of Q37:15-33; 43-68; 82-103;& 118-144 are preserved in the ·π¢an‚ÄòƒÅ‚Äô1 lower text.Behnam Sadeghi & Mohsen Goudarzi, \\"Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran\\", Der Islam, 87 (2012), 37.  Structure and content  Sura 37 could be divided into three parts following one characteristic of Arabic Poetry widely known as tripartite division.How to Read the Qur'an by Carl Ernst, pages 105‚Äì120 The first part goes from verses 1 to 74, the second part from 75 to 148 and the last part from 149 to 182. 37:1-74 Eschatological prophecy  The first part goes from verse 1 to 74 with eschatological prophecy as central themeThe Cambridge Companion to the Qur'an by Jane McAuliffe, pages 104‚Äì112 but could be divided into two sub-parts: 1-10 and 11-74. From verse 1 to 10, we have a snapshot of the setting of the Day of Judgment. From this description, you see that there will be angels ranged in row claiming the unity of God (37:1-6), a higher assembly quite exclusive (37:7-8) and disbelievers who will be driven away for their perpetual torment (37:9-10). This same setting is consistent with the one described in Sura 78:38 in the early Meccan period: ‚ÄúOn the day when the spirit and the angels stand in rows, they will not speak except for those to whom the Lord of Mercy gives permission, and who will say only what is right‚Äù. However comparing this two verses, we see that the last one (37:1-6) has more details than the previous one (78:38). It almost seems that the latter is a continuation of the former. We can infer, from the combination of the two verses, that the angels ranged in row will vehemently refute what the pagans were putting forward about them (the angels) being the daughters of God (see Arabian mythology) and will claim the unity of God under his permission. From 11 to 74, the verses reveal the description of the Day of Judgment including a depiction of its dynamic in its smallest details. At the beginning of this sub-part (11 to 39), we are exposed to a debate between the Prophet and the angels on one side, and the disbelievers on the other side. Debates are mainly characteristics of middle Meccan suras. In this particular section, one could sense a two-way discussion between both parties, putting more stress on the feelings of one party: the disbelievers. This section starts with how the disbelievers use to refute the message of God and continue with how their attitude will change when they will be faced with the truth of the Day of Judgment. The Sura portrays their surprise, their regrets for not believing in the word of God and makes it seem that it will be too late for them to be saved because in the Day of Judgment, no one can save no one, your deeds could no longer be changed. In addition, this section puts the Prophet in an intermediate position where he is made to transmit God's answers to them on that specific day: ‚ÄúSay, yes indeed, and you will be humiliated‚Äù (37:18). Finally, throughout verses 11 to 74 we see an interesting juxtaposition structure which is very visible. The attitudes and experiences of people whose actions were good on earth and those whose actions were bad are explored back to back to make the contrast more visible but also to provide a picture of the scenery in the Day of Judgment with the two sides sitting not far away from each other. From verse 11 to 39, we have a description of the experience of the disbelievers on the D-day and follows, from verse 40 to 57, a contrasting experience of the believers where they comment on the fate of the disbelievers and how lucky they were not to be in their place: ‚ÄúBy God, you almost brought me to ruin! Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I too would have been taken to hell‚Äù (37:56). Finally we see again from verses 58 to 74 another description of the disbelievers‚Äô experience. One specific detail that will be interesting to look at in this last part is the mention of a specific tree in verses 62 to 69: the tree of Zaqqum whose fruits will be forced to people in hell to intensify their torment. In Asbab al-nuzul, this tree is believed to be used to threaten the unbelievers among the Quraysh tribe. 37:75-148 Earlier messengers of God  In the early Meccan suras, there was not any mention of the earlier messengers of God as present in the Bible but in the middle Meccan suras they are gradually brought in to translate their actions into great rewards in the Afterlife and therefore give good references to the common believers and unbelievers. This section particularly tackles some biblical figures with a snapshot of specific actions they took that translated into great rewards. It starts with Noah with a snapshot of the Noah's Ark story in the Bible, putting a stress on how God helped him to save his people because he was a true believer. We also have a mention of the story of Jonah, Yunus, describing his fall in the ocean and how God saved him by making him be swallowed by a big fish. We therefore see a slightly different approach of the Quran from the Bible based on where the emphasis is put on in counting that story. We also see snapshots of stories about Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Elijah and Lot included in this section to serve the same purpose: stressing out God's rewards to his true servants (37:121) instead of limiting oneself in counting these stories as they occurred, as the Bible does. Q37:149-182 Day of Judgment In this last section, we are taken back into the Day of Judgment where the Quran is addressing the disbelievers one more time but differently. Here it is no longer a debate but one way speech. We see a succession of rhetorical question about certain claims the disbelievers are making that God, through Muhammad, is asking. He then develops into saying that those claims are all false and the disbelievers will know when the Day of Judgment comes. This section closes with a few praises to God making a ring structure which is very noticeable. Indeed, as mentioned in the beginning, the angels were ranged in row praising God and we see here from 164 to 166 the same scenario and then from 180 to 182 we read again praises to God. The Sura therefore goes from one point and comes back to the same point at the end, making a ring.

They ‚Äúprove that divine justice is at work in history, the unjustly harassed being rewarded with salvation, the transgressors and unbelievers punished by annihilation‚Äù (McAuliffe, 106).

The wide scope of historical figures‚Äîranging from Old Testament characters such as David, Solomon, and Job, to the devil of Islam, Iblis‚Äîwere designed to resonate with a wide audience in the face of the disbelief among the Quaryash, Muhammad‚Äôs clan; as Ernst poignantly states, Muhammad was likely dealing with ‚Äúreligiously well-informed skeptics‚Äù .Ernst, Carl W. How to Read the Qur'an : A New Guide, with Select Translations. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2011. Ebook Library. Web. 24 Sep. 2013. Like many contemporary passages, Sura 38 attempts to convert the reader to a monotheistic religion honoring Muhammad as Prophet by promising salvation for true believers on the Day of Judgment.  General divisions of sura 38  Most Middle and Late Meccan suras can be divided into three sections by content and style- a tripartite division. Examination of the structure of a sura can make what seems like an elliptical compilation of sentences far more comprehensible. Symmetrical structure, also known as ring composition, can help both the novice and experienced reader find the central message. Sura 38 can first be divided into three primary sections: the first from verses 1-11; the second, 12-64; the third, 66-88. The first and third sections, similar in length, remind the reader of the power of God and the Qur'an by describing destruction and hell, the third section going so far as to describe the creation of evil: the fall of Iblis, who becomes Satan. The larger center section (12-64) gives examples of biblical figures like David, Solomon, and Job to Muhammad as Messengers who also faced adversity. In the middle portion of the sura, God concisely tells Muhammad to ‚ÄúRemember Our servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all men of strength and vision. We caused them to be devoted to Us‚Ä¶with Us they will be among the elect, the truly good‚Ä¶This is a lesson‚Äù (Q38:45-49). The historical context of the sura confirms that this is indeed its central message: supposedly, Muhammad was struggling with rejection from his tribe, the Quraysh, so God sent this revelation to support and encourage him. As entrance to heaven is the final goal of Islam, nothing could serve as better inspiration to Muhammad to persevere in the face of adversity. Nevertheless, one must keep in mind that as Islam gained followers and adapted to continue its growth, the clear divisions within suras blur and texts slowly become lengthier and more expansive works; the reader cannot always find three, let alone two, clear-cut sections.Ernst, 12. Even within Sura 38, the subject and tone can shift every few verses from general descriptions of heaven and hell to short examples of specific prophets.  Q38:1-11 comments made by nonbelievers  The sura opens with comments made by nonbelievers confused by the Prophet‚Äôs portents. Verse 8: the nonbelievers do not try to understand warnings: they blatantly ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù (Q38:8). God warns that they ‚Äúhave not tasted My torment yet‚Äù (Q38.8). He tells Muhammad to ‚Äúbear their words patiently‚Äù (Q38.17), given the historical context of disbelief among the Quaryash.Donner, Fred M. ‚ÄúThe historical context.‚Äù The Cambridge Companion to the Qur ºƒÅn.

This marks the transition from generalizations about the disbelieving peoples of the past to stories of specific messengers. = Q38:17-26: Story of David and the Two Litigants = The tone and style of Sura 38 become more specific, both in examples of previous prophets and their stories. For example: verses 17-26 chronicle David as he errs during a test God gives him, but quickly ‚Äúfell down on his knees, and repented‚Äù (Q38.24). Unlike those of the early Meccan Period, suras of the 2nd Meccan Period often reference biblical characters as Muhammad tried to convert the Judeo-Christian population to Islam by finding common ground between their faiths. Though there is no evidence to prove this, it is believed that Muhummad was illiterate. Muhummad‚Äôs inability to read supports the authenticity of his revelations from God as uninfluenced by any knowledge he could have gained from texts of the time. Muhummad‚Äôs biblical references could have been common knowledge, but their broad range and sufficient clarity point to an omnipotent source greater than Muhummad alone, a role that God fits. The crowds to whom Muhammad spoke likely already knew the story of David. According to the bible, the story of David and the Two Litigants was a test of God. The Qur'anic version of the story differs slightly from the biblical version, but the ultimate message is the same. In the Muslim tradition, though David already has many wives, he asks a man to divorce his only wife because David wants her for himself. Disapproving of David‚Äôs selfishness, God sends two brothers, one with ninety-nine ewes, the other with only one, to David. He is asked to decide whether it is fair for the brother with ninety-nine ewes to take the only ewe of his brother, a clear parallel to David taking another man‚Äôs only wife. As David tells the men that it is wrong for the one with many ewes to take the only ewe of his brother, he realizes the error of his own ways and begs God for forgiveness. = Q38:30-40: Story of Solomon = The Qur'an also references Solomon, son of David, as a devoted Messenger who realizes the error of his ways and is forgiven by God. With further research, one uncovers the story referred to in Sura 38: Solomon is more devoted to his horses than to God, and misses prayer sessions while indulging in the hoofed creatures‚Äô company. He justifies his obsession, saying, ‚ÄúMy love of fine things is part of my remembering my Lord!‚Äù (Q 38:32). God knows this is not true, is displeased with the king and ‚Äú[reduces] him to a mere skeleton on his throne‚Äù (Q38.34) as punishment. Eventually Solomon realizes that God has been testing him. According to Muslim legend, Solomon slaughters all his horses to prove his devotion to God, and God forgives him, granting him great power over the earth.Tottoli, Roberto. Biblical Prophets in the Qur'an and Muslim Literature. Hoboken: Taylor and Francis, 2013. 30-32. Print. Like the Qur'an does of David, Solomon‚Äôs positive attributes are emphasized, even though he too ‚Äúyielded to certain temptations on the road to faith‚Äù (Tottoli, 35). However, Solomon was granted even greater powers by God than his father was. A particularly miraculous one was his over the wind, so that he could travel over his immense territory quickly. Solomon could speak to animals and was commander over a rank of jinn, or invisible spirits. The bible even claims that God made Solomon so wise that kings from all over the land traveled to hear him speak. (2 Chronicles 9:14). = Q38:55-64: The Day of Judgment = One does not have to be a prophet to have a fruitful afterlife. Through verse 49, the Qur'an repeats that the reward for devout followers ‚Äúwill be nearness to Us, and a good place to return to‚Äù (Q38.49). The reader is called by descriptions of heaven through verse 54, in which rich words like ‚Äúbliss‚Äù and ‚Äúabundant‚Äù are used. Such enticing information becomes particularly important when contrasted with a long description of Hell, lasting from verses 55-64, which includes a bone-chilling description of what hell tastes like: ‚Äúa scalding, dark, foul fluid‚Äù (Q38.58). The Qur'an describes this Day of Judgment with increasingly vivid descriptions as Islam develops. This one is particularly scaring, arresting multiple senses and capturing the reader in a dark, seemingly inescapable cloud of perpetual agony. = Other Biblical references = God also references Noah, Job, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Ishmael, and Elijah in Sura 38. Of these characters, he only elaborates on the story of Job, providing a third major example of overcoming ‚Äúadversity‚Äù (Q 38:44) to become a noteworthy messenger of the past. = Q38:63 Day of Reckoning= In verse 63, God repeats to Muhammad that he must warn the masses against this Day of Reckoning, that God will forgive those who seek forgiveness but only if they heed the Prophet‚Äôs warnings. Q38:66-88 the holiness and validity of the Qur‚Äôan The Sura ends with three short verses maintaining the holiness and validity of the Qur‚Äôan, just as it begins with a verse saying ‚ÄúBy the Qur‚Äôan with its reminding‚Äù (Q38.1). = Verses 71-85: Story of Iblis and Hell = Humility is key to acceptance in heaven. God recounts the story of Iblis‚Äô rejection from heaven and God‚Äôs generous compromise with him, giving him ‚Äúrespite till the Appointed Day,‚Äù when God will then ‚Äúfill Hell with you and all those that follow you‚Äù (Q38.80-85). However, there is a more interesting explanation for the creation of Satan. He exists to tempt us, and prove our true devotion to God. God warns humans that Satan will tempt them, lead them astray; and this test for the believer must be passed with the most strict devotion to God.Haleem, 126-129.  Forgiveness  God is \\"Oft-Forgiving\\", He is also Just, punishing those who have done wrong. In Sura 38, God speaks of entire civilizations wiped out because they did not believe (e.g. Q:38 10-17). However, the Sura suggests that God will forgive a believer if his faith is strong and true and he repents for his misdeeds. We, too, can be saved by God and given a place in heaven on the Day of Judgment. However, Sura 38 is unique in the number of concrete examples it gives of biblical figures who have served God. Though Muhammad faces adversity among his own people, the tone of this Sura is more confident in the essential truth behind Islam than earlier Suras. This faith is exemplified by the emphasis on forgiveness for all, although the reader can have no doubt about God‚Äôs wrath on the disbeliever and His Absolute Power over all.  Exegesis Ja'far al-Sadiq, in a written letter to his companions, advises them to observe Taqiya when dealing with \\"liars and hypocrites\\" because the status of the \\"people of falsehood\\" is different to Allah than the status of the \\"people of truth\\", hence he cites the following verse from Surah Sad in support of this: \\"Or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land? Or should We treat those who fear Allah like the wicked?\\"(38:28)  References  External links  Sad Satan Solomon David ","title":"·π¢ƒÅd (surah)"},{"id":"1345303","text":"Some famous verses of Az-Zumar seen in the tilings of Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf, Iraq, 1994. Az-Zumar (, \\"The Troops, The Throngs\\") is the 39th chapter (surah), of the Qur'an, the central religious text of Islam. It contains 75 verses (ayat). This surah derives its name from the Arabic word zumar (troops) that occurs in verses 71 and 73. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is believed to have been revealed in the mid-Maccan period when persecutions of the Muslim believers by the polytheists had escalated.  Content  The surah expounds the signs of God's Oneness (tawhid) in the natural world and emphasizes the absurdity of associating partners with God. It also hints at emigration for the believers who were suffering great difficulties in worshiping God in their homeland. It also declares that there can be no reconciliation between believing in God's Oneness and association partners with God. The chapter also reminds readers of the other world, where Muslims believe people will see the outcome of their own deeds.

Online text-based role playing games date to 1978, with the creation of MUD1, which began the MUD heritage that culminates in today's MMORPGs. Some online-text based role playing games are video games, but some are organized and played entirely by humans through text-based communication. Over the years, games have used TELNET, internet forums, IRC, email and social networking websites as their media. There are varied genres of online text-based roleplaying, including fantasy, drama, horror, anime, science fiction, and media-based fan role-play. Role-playing games based on popular media (for example, the Harry Potter series) are common, and the players involved tend to overlap with the relevant fandoms.  Varieties =MUDs Precursor to the now more popular MMORPGs of today are the branch of text-based games known as MUD, MOO, MUCK, MUSH et al., a broad family of server software tracing their origins back to MUD1 and being used to implement a variety of games and other services. Many of these platforms implement Turing-complete programming languages and can be used for any purpose, but various types of server have historical and traditional associations with particular uses: \\"mainstream\\" MUD servers like LPMud and DikuMUD are typically used to implement combat-focused games, while the TinyMUD family of servers, sometimes referred to by the term MU*, are more usually used to create \\"social MUDs\\" devoted to role-playing and socializing, or non-game services such as educational MUDs. While these are often seen as definitive boundaries, exceptions abound; many MUSHes have a software- supported combat system, while a \\"Role-Playing Intensive MUD\\" movement occurred primarily in the DikuMUD world, and both the first Internet talker (a type of purely social server) and the very popular talker software ew-too were based on LPMud code. Although interest in these games has suffered from the popularity of MMORPGs, a large number of them still operate. Play-by-post and PBEM Play-by-post role-playing games or PBP RPGs refer to another type of text-based gaming. Rather than following gameplay in real-time, such as in MUDs, players post messages on such media as bulletin boards, online forums, Chatrooms (such as like AOL, hangouts and Yahoo chat) and mailing lists to which their fellow players will post role-played responses without a real limit or timeframe. Of late such blogging tools and sites as LiveJournal have been utilized for this purpose. This includes such games as play-by-email (or PBEM) RPGs. The origins of this style of role-playing are unknown, but it most likely originated in some form during the mid-to-late 1980s when BBS systems began gaining in popularity. Usually it is played through 'Script' and 'Story' format, both styles are interchangeable and work well but it depends on which the player prefers, or which the human administrator insists upon. Script format is a simple stating of what each character is saying, post by post, with little to no mention of said characters' actions, whereas Story format requires that the character's actions be mentioned, including the surroundings and a general description of what is going on. Real-time human-moderated Some games rely entirely upon human moderators to dictate events, and physical print books for rules sets. Such games may use code dice-rollers, to generate random results, and may include databases for the purposes of maintaining character records. Interaction between characters is controlled by communication between individual players (with each other) and with moderators (who portray non-player characters). Communication software and database options vary, from the DigiChat front-end / character database back-end pairing pioneered by Conrad Hubbard at White Wolf Publishing, to the numerous AOL, hangouts and Yahoo chats with hosted character databases. Many games also choose to play on Internet Relay Chat on networks such as DarkMyst and SorceryNet. More robust options are available on many virtual tabletops. Some virtual tabletops include text chat in addition to map and image sharing, campaign management and more. Free-form games may even do away with database integration or dice-rollers entirely and rely upon individual players to keep their own records, with online community reputation dictating how other players react. Characteristics and social aspects These methods of role- playing have many advantages and disadvantages in comparison with more traditional, off-line role playing systems. On the one hand, text-based games allows players to exercise their writing skills, while using writing as a medium. The internet also makes it relatively easier for individuals to meet and play together. This freedom, though it is a great strength to the system, also has the potential to be a great weakness. Such broad freedom of expression can easily be grossly abused, most often by new players unfamiliar with the mostly unwritten etiquette of the text-based gaming community. This has caused many more experienced players to form tight knit cliques, which can also be detrimental to new players seeking to join the community. As a result, many sites are labeled for three levels of role-playing: 'beginner' 'intermediate' or 'advanced'. While some sites usually have some sort of application process to judge a new member's ability to role-play, others allow users to choose their level as they create their character. Certain MUDs that are \\"Newbie-friendly\\" also maintain \\"Newbie\\" channels that are run by more experienced users for the sole purpose of teaching new users. These advanced players often answer questions and teach these \\"newbies\\" things they should and should not do throughout the game. Types of behavior commonly considered breaches of etiquette include powergaming and godmoding. Another aspect of note is the development of a role-playing vocabulary that are almost exclusively limited to those who have experience with or are actively immersed in this pursuit as a hobby. Some terms overlap with those in commonly used in popular fandom. Terms as Mary Sue, slash, powergaming, godmoding, OOC, and IC are among the terms used with relative frequency in text-based role-playing circles, and it has come to be expected of role-players to be familiar with such jargon.  Consent  The term \\"consent\\" refers to players' \\"veto power\\" over what happens to their player characters. Often referred to in the rolling roleplay community as \\"orthodox\\", \\"unorthodox\\", and \\"hybrid\\". Levels of consent might be: * Non-consent: This does not necessarily mean that they use a traditional role-playing game system: it could just be that consequences are enforced based on a \\"common sense\\" basis, e.g., if several police officers go to seize a character, even without dice rolls, an administrator might say that the only reasonable outcome is that the character is brought into custody. Or, if there is such a system, this means that the results of system calculations are final. * Limited consent: Usually, this would be control over the character's death. A setting might strictly enforce In Character consequences, with or without a system, but allow the player an 'out' to avoid character death. For example, if it is decided that the character was mortally wounded, it might be allowable to alter in-game reality just slightly and instead have the character suffer only a serious wound. * Consent: Nothing can happen to a character without the player's approval. Most RPGs have limited consent, allowing game masters some leeway if the player asks for it (in fact, almost total leeway, though this may destroy the believability of the scenario).  Rules and Etiquette Systems  Though there are countless different rules systems and game-specific rules, there is a single universal criterion that separates role-playing from collaborative writing -- there must be a variable under the control of one or more players that some other players cannot control. The most common example of this is for each player participating in the activity to have their own characters that no other participant may write dialogs or actions for. Most separate textbased gameworlds have their own set of rules or TOS by which all users must consent to abide. In addition to rules there is usually a universal set of mores and a terminology common to text-based role playing games, that more or less constitutes gaming etiquette. Some common examples of these rules are: *Enforcing a specific genre or theme on another that is not relevant to them i.e. their location. *Sticking to a certain 'point of view' without plausible reason to do so. *Observing correct grammar and spelling and use of a certain, default language to the best ability of the player. *Observing the rating of the game. Mature games may contain no restrictions on adult content. *Restrictions on or requirements to work together outside the story over plot and other elements. *Restrictions on: **who can contribute, and how often, when the work is being put together in an open area such as an online forum or mailing list. **Killing off or otherwise permanently changing a major character owned by another player without it being plausible or within the realism of the scenario. **Powergaming, twinking and/or godmoding. **Creating Mary Sues or characters with a set of characteristics or stats too beneficial to the player as to give them an unfair and unrealistic advantage over others. Various forms of gaming that developed within these media, such as sparring (see below), have garnered their own cult following and developed their own sets of norms and subcultures over time.  Sparring  Sparring is a form of online role-play that deals with combat between two or more characters, usually conducted on play-by-post media. Two or more players take turns in writing a joint-narrative battle, each one attempting to defeat his or her rival. The battle ends when one participant acknowledges defeat or one is judged the victor by an unbiased arbiter after a review of all related posts. In the context of Internet-based role-play, sparring retains its traditional meaning of play or practice combat, but is limited to written interaction. It is different from role-play in that sparring usually contributes little, if nothing, to a story or character development and participants are subject only to the rules of an agreed on role-play fighting system. These fighting systems fall into three categories, speed-based, descriptive, and turn-based. Of these, the former is such that the involved parties seek to outmatch one another via superior typing speed and stratagem, and thus is usually left for websites or programs that support an instant messenger or chats. The latter has no emphasis on typing speed, but focuses wholly on strategy, and are thus usually based on forums and message boards. Both systems are further divided into explicit and implicit subsets (also called open and closed), which refer to whether the outcome of an attack is stated by the attacker or assumed to have happened in the flow of battle. There is a large rift of ideologies within the community of sparring. It comes from the basis of the spar's purpose and intent, and divides sparrers into two categories, being roleplayers and fighters. Roleplayers are grouped as \\"orthodox\\" combatants, where no \\"autos\\" are acceptable, and it is a mutually respectful practice. Orthodox matches are completely based upon the honor system, and are held more to the ability of the character than the mechanics of the system. Explicit guidelines and rules apply to the fighters, in an \\"unorthodox\\" system. Unorthodox spars tend to use hit claims, as discussed above as open and closed. Psychology of Roleplaying Although an undeveloped field, there exists some research done on people who roleplay online. One interesting facet of roleplaying online is the instance of a roleplayer acting as a character of a different gender. One study was conducted in the Journal of Computer Game Culture, which discussed this phenomenon of cross-gendered play. In the study, it was found that roleplayers would create opposite gendered characters to revel in their own embodiment as alternative beings. This was a form of conscious adoption of the 'bodies' that the player could not physically 'own.' Although this creates a tension between the avatar of the character and the user, it is a tension that seems to not stand in the way of anything as players often show unselfconsciousness.MacCallum-Stewart, Esther. \\"Real Boys Carry Girly Epics: Normalising Gender Bending in Online Games\\" Eludamos. Journal for Computer Game Culture [Online], 2 29 Feb 2008 Additionally, research on online personalities has been done that could potentially extrapolate to the phenomena of online roleplaying. Researcher J. Suler found that, despite the various layers hiding the person behind the character, there is still a presence of the true personality of the roleplayer. Suler, in their study, highlighted several reasons for this extended emotional expression:Suler, J. \\"The online disinhibition effect\\" Journal of Cyberpsychology Behavior [Online], 3 7 Jun 2004 *Dissociative Anonymity in that the roleplayer tends to not see the similarity between their online self and their offline self, although they are but two sides of the same coin. *Invisibility in that there is no worry about appearances when interacting online. This can lead to increased emotional expression as well. *Asynchronicity in that users can respond when they have time to, and there is no pressure to respond emotionally. This allows a better procession of emotions and thus heightened expression of the player's emotions.

He began his career at hometown club Bradford City before a four-year stay with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He left to play Premier League football with Southampton and finally Tottenham Hotspur. He also made four appearances for England under-21s. Richards retired from playing in 2005 due to health concerns, but later returned to the game as a coach at Bradford. He died six years later at the age of 36. Personal life Richards was born in Bradford on 9 June 1974. He attended Allerton Middle School and Rhodesway School in Bradford. Playing career=Bradford City As a central- defender, Richards started his career at his hometown club Bradford City as a youth trainee. He signed as a full-time professional in 1992 and made his debut aged 17 in October of the same year in a 3‚Äì1 victory over A.F.C. Bournemouth in a game in which he scored. He played 86 league games for the Bantams, scoring four goals, and playing 102 games in all competitions. Wolverhampton Wanderers Richards moved on loan to promotion-chasing Wolverhampton Wanderers in March 1995, making his debut on 1 April in a 1‚Äì0 win at Southend. A permanent deal was quickly arranged for a fee which was initially ¬£1.3m but eventually rose to ¬£1.8m once various clauses took effect. Richards made four England under-21 appearances at the Toulon Tournament in 1995, making his debut as captain against Brazil. England reached the semi- final of the competition but lost to hosts France. During the 1995‚Äì96 season he was elevated to the role of club captain but, in January 1996, he was in a car crash that initially seemed to only leave him with a bruised ankle but later revealed an injured knee and back issues. He subsequently missed much of the following two seasons due to persistent injuries. On the field, his performances earned the attention of the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United. He remained with the club until his contract expired at the end of the 1998‚Äì99 season; ironically his final game saw his former club Bradford win promotion to the Premier League at Molineux while Wolves missed out on a play- off place. Southampton In July 1999, he reached the Premier League when he was signed for Southampton by Dave Jones on a free transfer. He settled quickly into the Southampton side despite replacing the popular Ken Monkou. He was voted the fans' Player of the Year at the end of his first season. In the three seasons Richards was at the Saints, he made 79 appearances in all competitions and found the net seven times, before joining Tottenham Hotspur in September 2001. Tottenham Hotspur He impressed new manager Glenn Hoddle so much that, when Hoddle moved to Tottenham Hotspur in March 2001, he tried to take Richards with him. This led to a drawn-out battle of words between chairman Rupert Lowe and the Tottenham board, which ended when Spurs paid ¬£8.1 million to persuade Lowe to release Richards from his contract which he had only signed a few months earlier. Richards never realised his full potential at Tottenham due to persistent injury problems, and never fulfilled his ambition to play for his country. At the time, his transfer fee to Tottenham was the highest amount ever paid by a club for a player who had not played internationally. In March 2005, he announced his retirement from the game due to illness after receiving \\"evidence that it would be harmful to his health to continue\\". A specialist told him that if he continued playing he could suffer from a brain haemorrhage. Richards said: \\"I am obviously deeply disappointed to be giving up the sport I love, but it's the only choice.\\" He was suffering from frequent dizzy spells and headaches that were initially thought to be an inner-ear infection. Coach Having gained his coaching qualifications, Richards returned to Bradford City on 3 August 2007, when it was confirmed that he was taking a part-time role as youth coach. He also worked with a company in Spain.  Death  Richards died at the age of 36 on the morning of 26 February 2011 at St. Gemma's Hospice, Leeds after a long- term illness. On 6 March 2011 two of his former clubs, Wolves and Tottenham, met in the Premier League. This fixture was designated as a tribute game, and as such featured several official and media tributes to Richards' career and life. Joining the teams in the centre circle at Molineux Stadium for a minute's applause before kick-off were his widow Samantha and his two sons Rio and Jaden as well as representatives from his four former clubs (Ledley King for Tottenham, Claus Lundekvam for Southampton, Matt Murray for Wolves, and Mark Lawn for Bradford City), two of his former managers Graham Taylor and Dave Jones, and two former teammates, Don Goodman and James Beattie.

Early life Pease was born near Bristol, the son of devout Quakers, Thomas Pease (1816‚Äì1884) and Susanna Ann Fry (1829‚Äì1917; sister of Edward Fry, the judge); he was the sixth of Thomas's 15 children but Susanna's first, Thomas having had five children by previous marriages. Edward Pease was educated at home until he was 16, and soon after moved to London where he became a successful stock-broker. Career In the early 1880s Pease became friends with Frank Podmore and husband and wife Edith Nesbit and Hubert Bland. In 1884, the group founded the Fabian Society. In 1886, the death of a wealthy relative meant Pease received a sizeable legacy allowing him to give up work at the London Stock Exchange and devote time to his socialist interests. In 1886, he moved to Newcastle- upon-Tyne, began working as a cabinet-maker and formed the National Labour Federation, a general union with a national scope. However, his attempts to convert the working class to socialism were unsuccessful so he returned to London. He travelled to United States with Sidney Webb in 1888, and on his return married Marjory Davidson, a young Scottish schoolteacher. In 1890 Pease was appointed secretary of the Fabian Society. As well as managing the society's administration, he edited Fabian News and wrote ten pamphlets, including tracts on liquor licensing (1899) and The History of the Fabian Society (1916). With Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Pease was a trustee in the fund used to found the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1895. Pease was also a member of the Independent Labour Party and in February 1900 he represented the Fabian Society at the meeting where it was decided to establish \\"a distinct Labour group in Parliament\\", forming the Labour Representation Committee (LRC - the forerunner to the Labour Party) to which Pease was elected, serving on the Party's executive committee for 14 years. Family Pease married Mary (Marjory) Gammell Davidson (1861‚Äì1950). They had two children: Michael S. Pease, the geneticist, and Nicholas Arthington Pease. With his wife Marjory, Pease established the East Surrey Labour Party and both served on the local council. Their home at Limpsfield, The Pendicle, Pastens Road, became known as 'Dostoevsky Corner', because he housed so many Russian refugees who had been forced to leave their country because of their socialist beliefs.biographical record at British Library of Political & Economic Science See also *List of Fabian Tracts ReferencesExternal links *The History of the Fabian Society by Edward R.

The rest of the band was made up of Nikolaj Bloch (guitar), whom Bradley found through an advert in Melody Maker, the latter's drumming friend and Danish compatriot Tommas Arnby, and George Brown (bass). Their first concert was in York, England in 1995. By May 1996, Subcircus had played more than 150 shows throughout the UK, headlining two nightclub tours and opening for Echo & the Bunnymen, Suede, Elvis Costello, Grant Lee Buffalo, Stereophonics and Ocean Colour Scene. Their debut album, Carousel, was recorded in London at Air Studios, and at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Bath, Somerset. It was issued in the UK by the independent Echo label in 1996, and drew critical raves from the UK press. Through 1997 the band released the singles \\"86'd\\" and \\"U Love U\\". Later in the year, \\"86'd\\" was re- released along with the album which featured a new track sequence. \\"I heard them on the Evening Session and I thought they sounded fantastic,\\" remarked Radiohead's Ed O'Brien. \\"I've listened to the album a couple of times and I still can't hear that they sound like us, not at all.\\" Subcircus was quiet for over two years but reappeared in 1999 with the single \\"Do You Feel Loved\\".

Podmore suggested that the group should be named after the Roman General, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, who advocated weakening the opposition by harassing operations rather than becoming involved in pitched battles. In January 1884 the group became known as the Fabian Society, and Podmore's home at 14 Dean's Yard, Westminster, became the organisation's first official headquarters. He was a member of the Oxford Phasmatological Society which dissolved in 1885. In 1886 Podmore and Sidney Webb conducted a study into unemployment, eventually published as a Fabian Society pamphlet, The Government Organisation of Unemployed Labour. Podmore married Eleanore Bramwell in 1891, however, the marriage was a failure and they separated. They had no children.Stanley Kunitz, Howard Haycraft. (1973).

Rationalist author Joseph McCabe stated that despite Podmore's \\"highly critical faculty\\" he was misled in the Piper case by Richard Hodgson.

Born in Decatur, Texas, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1928. During World War II he directed the Gunnery Training Section at the Bureau of Aeronautics. He also served in the Pacific on aircraft carriers: Raborn was the executive officer of the carrier when her deck was damaged by a kamikaze attack. He had the deck repaired in four hours, allowing the ship's aircraft (which had been airborne when the kamikaze struck) to land safely - for this Raborn was awarded the Silver Star.\\"A PERT Man for the CIA\\", Time magazine, April 23, 1965 He later commanded the carriers and .

Raborn was told the new system had to achieve interim capability by early 1963 and full capability by early 1965.

The same year he was awarded the Collier Trophy for his work on Polaris.Collier 1960-1969 Winners, National Aeronautic Association Raborn had delivered Polaris three years ahead of schedule, due in part to his application of the PERT methodology.

A member of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Cullen was re-elected in 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2015, allowing him to serve in the 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st, and 42nd Parliaments. Cullen was a candidate in the 2012 New Democratic Party leadership election, and came in third. During the 41st Parliament, Cullen was the House Leader for the Official Opposition and then Finance critic in Thomas Mulcair's Shadow Cabinet. He was the NDP critic for Democratic Reform as well as Ethics, and deputy critic for Finance in the 42nd Parliament.  Early life  Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Cullen worked in several countries in Central and South America, during the 1990s, on community economic development projects. He moved to Smithers, British Columbia in 1998 and started a private consulting business focussed on strategic planning and conflict resolution. While working in Latin America, Cullen learned Spanish and named his company Maravilla Consultants after the town (the Spanish word for wonder) in Costa Rica in which he worked. He has lived in Smithers since 1998. Cullen completed high school at Martingrove Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Ontario, and graduated from Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario with a B.A. Honours in International Development Studies and Environmental Studies.  Federal politics = 38th Parliament  At the age of 31, in the June 2004 federal election, Cullen was elected to his first term as a Member of Parliament. He had won the NDP nomination in the Skeena‚ÄîBulkley Valley riding three months earlier against a Prince Rupert social worker. In the general election, he challenged the Conservative incumbent Andy Burton, Liberal Miles Richardson who was chair of the B.C. Treaty Commission, Rod Taylor of the Christian Heritage Party, engineer and photographer Roger Benham of the Green Party and Marxist-Leninist Frank Martin. The election was seen as a tight three-way race between Burton, Richardson, and Cullen. Cullen made support of the federal moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling part of his campaign and a magnitude 6.7 earthquake off the Queen Charlotte Islands during the campaign helped highlight Cullen's arguments. Cullen went on to defeat the Conservative incumbent Burton by a margin of 1,272 votes. Cullen was the youngest of 19 New Democratic Party candidates elected to the 38th Parliament, a minority parliament led by Paul Martin and the Liberal Party. He became the party's national critic for youth issues, the environment and national parks. Cullen opened constituency offices in Smithers and Terrace. He continued to support the moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling despite Prime-Minister Paul Martin opening a cabinet level review of the moratorium; the review ended with the conclusion that lifting the moratorium was too politically divisive. By the end of 2004, he got engaged to his girlfriend, Diana Dahr, who was studying at a teacher's college, and he was voted \\"Favourite Up-and-Comer Rookie Politician\\" by fellow Members of Parliament. He was also awarded the US Ambassador's Award as one of only two Canadian recipients. In the first half of 2005, Cullen toured western provinces with other MPs to promote a private member's bill (Bill C-261) which would lower the voting age to 16. In February he made a motion in the House of Commons to \\"recognize the public health impacts of smog\\" and require improved emission standards of light duty vehicles sold in Canada, though it was not supported by the Liberal Party or Conservative Party. In summer 2005 Cullen co-sponsored, along with several credit unions, a series of Youth Entrepreneur Awards within the Skeena/Stikine/Bulkley Valley to recognize local young persons' entrepreneurial achievements. In the fall, Cullen challenged the Minister of the Environment St√©phane Dion to take a blood test to illustrate the level of toxins present in the environment. He also spent time lobbying the Liberal government to publicly disclose the bids for Ridley Terminal; the proposed sale of the Prince Rupert Port Authority coal loading terminals by the federal government to a private firm was criticized by opposition parties as undervaluing the facility and likely to restrict fair access by competing coal companies (the sale was blocked by the Conservative Party after they won the subsequent election).  39th Parliament  Cullen was unchallenged as the NDP candidate going into the 2006 election where he faced Conservative Party candidate and former MP Mike Scott (who had represented Skeena, essentially the current riding's northwest portion, from 1993 to 2000), Liberal Party candidate and Prince Rupert mortgage specialist Gordon Stamp-Vincent, Green Party candidate Phil Brienesse of Smithers, and Rod Taylor of the Christian Heritage Party. The election was seen as a two-way race between Cullen and Scott. Their party leaders both visited the riding, Stephen Harper in late- December to Prince Rupert and Jack Layton with a mid-January stop in Terrace. Scott ran an aggressive campaign attacking the Liberal candidate, filing a request with Elections Canada for an investigation into Cullen's campaign finances, and using signage saying \\"Re-elect Scott\\", despite the fact that Cullen was the incumbent. Cullen was effective at forcing Scott to defend issues from his time in office during the 1990s while Scott made Cullen defend his vote to support the Canadian Firearms Registry despite promising to vote against it. Cullen went on to win by an unexpectedly large margin, 15%, over Scott while the NDP elected 29 of its candidates nationwide to the 39th Parliament, which was led by Prime-Minister Stephen Harper with a minority government., In April 2006, Cullen introduced a Private Member's Bill (Phthalate Control Act Bill C-307) to ban phthalates, a chemical in many plastics, from products intended for infants and toddlers. The bill passed through all stages in the House of Commons but died on the order paper in the Senate when the 39th Parliament was dissolved. The proposal was subsequently adopted by Government and in June 2009 new regulations were introduced to place restrictions on six phthalates.Canada Gazette Vol. 143, No. 25 ‚Äî June 20, 2009 'Phthalates Regulation' As Environment Critic for the NDP, Cullen sat on the committee that largely re-wrote the Government's Clean Air Act (C-30). The new act was called the Clean Air and Climate Change Act (Bill C-468). The Government refused to reintroduce the bill after Cullen's revisions and the act died on the order paper in the House. On June 4, 2008, the House of Commons passed C-377, a private member bill introduced by Jack Layton. Cullen presented the bill to the Environment committee. However, Bill C-377 also died in the Senate when the NDP and Liberals withheld its confidence, causing the 2008 Canadian federal election. The bill was reintroduced in the 40th Parliament as Climate Change Accountability Act (Bill C-311).  40th Parliament  Following the election of October 2008, Cullen was named the New Democrat Critic for Natural Resources and Energy. In this role he chaired the NDP's Green Economy Taskforce, working on ways to help create employment while meeting our responsibilities to the planet's future generations and promoted sustainable energy development through a study of Canada's Energy Security at the House of Commons Standing Committee on Natural Resources. Cullen also led an NDP effort to secure a bulk oil tanker ban on the north coast of British Columbia which led to the passage in the House of Commons of a motion calling for such a ban by a close vote of 143 - 138. In 2009 Cullen created a contest in his constituency called Create Your Canada which challenges students between grades 5 and 12 to submit proposals for federal legislation. Two winners are picked each year and are flown to Ottawa to watch their submissions introduced in the House of Commons as private member's bills. In 2009, two bills were introduced including Bill C-399, which proposed a ban on the mining and export of asbestos, and Bill C-400, which encouraged the Government of Canada to support the development of cycling friendly infrastructure.  41st Parliament  In 2011, Cullen was elected for a fourth term with 55% of all votes cast - the highest plurality in the riding since 1962. In the 41st Parliament, Cullen served as Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Privacy, Access to Information and Ethics. He was also the Associate Critic for Natural Resources, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, and Environment and Sustainable Development before resigning from his roles to participate in the NDP Leadership race. The 2013 Hill Times Annual Most Valuable Politician & All Politics Poll awarded Cullen 3rd place in the \\"Best Up-and-comer MP\\" category tied with Elizabeth May. = NDP leadership race = Nathan Cullen during a candidates debate on February 12, 2012 in Qu√©bec Following the death of party leader Jack Layton, the NDP began a leadership race. Cullen announced his official candidacy on September 30, 2011. In his opening speech, Cullen stated his vision for a new and progressive kind of politics, saying \\"now's the time for an honest discussion about the direction our politics is going in...and how we must change it for the better.\\" Cullen also argued the choice between the economy and the environment is unnecessary, but that a green economy is a balance between creating jobs and protecting the environment. He cast himself as a pro- business candidate Cullen proposed that joint primary nominations should take place in Conservative-held ridings to determine the best possible local candidate to avoid vote splitting among 'progressives'. Cullen is suggesting that each constituency association would have the choice of whether or not to run their respective campaign in this way, and that there would be no \\"top- down\\" directive to do so. In his policy papers thus far, Cullen has also advanced a number of other ideas such as: creating a national public transit strategy, instituting carbon cap-and-trade pricing, putting a moratorium on new genetically modified organisms, redefining the Canadian Wheat Board, and holding a referendum on voting reform (Nathan supports Mixed-member proportional representation as currently utilized in New Zealand and Germany). Cullen's candidacy was endorsed by three fellow NDP MPs, Alex Atamanenko, Fin Donnelly, and Brian Masse (NDP trade critic), former Toronto-Danforth MP Lynn McDonald, four BC MLAs, Robin Austin, Gary Coons, Doug Donaldson, and Norm Macdonald, former BC MLAs Corky Evans, Lois Boone, and Joan Sawicki, as well as Ontario MPP Taras Natyshak, and Manitoba cabinet minister Jim Rondeau. Slam poet Shane Koyczan has also supported Cullen's candidacy, as well as author and former Ottawa city councilor Clive Doucet and author/explorer-in- residence/ethnobotanist Wade Davis. Observers and commentators noted that Cullen's performances in the debates increased his profile. Whereas at the beginning of the race Cullen was considered one of the \\"also-rans\\", he eventually was given considerably more attention, with the CBC, The Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, and National Post all running articles on his candidacy. On March 24, the day of the convention, Cullen surprised many by placing third in the first round of voting with 16% of the vote ahead of Peggy Nash, Paul Dewar, Martin Singh and Niki Ashton, with Thomas Mulcair and Brian Topp in first and second respectively (30% for Mulcair, 21% for Topp). He continued to hold third place after the second and third counts, eventually being eliminated at the third count with 24.6% of the votes (Mulcair had 43% of the vote, Topp had 31%). He declined to endorse another candidate. = House Leader for the Official Opposition = On April 20, 2012 Cullen was named House Leader for the Official Opposition in Thomas Mulcair's first Shadow Cabinet Shuffle. Cullen replaced long time Ontario MP Joe Comartin as House Leader, with Comartin being named Critic for Democratic Reform. = Finance Critic for the Official Opposition = On March 20, 2014, Cullen replaced Peggy Nash as Finance Critic for the Official Opposition just days after former Natural Resources minister Joe Oliver was named Minister of Finance. Upon taking up the post, Cullen emphasized his previous occupation as a small business owner in northern British Columbia against Oliver's previous career as a Merrill Lynch executive and promised to bring a \\"Main Street\\" perspective to challenge Oliver's \\"Bay Street\\" background. In March 2015, Cullen attacked Joe Oliver over his avoidance of Question Period after repeated delays in introducing the budget after the drop in oil prices. On September 23, 2014, Cullen tabled Bill C-628 (short-titled An Act to Defend the Pacific Northwest) in the House of Commons, which would ban supertankers from the Queen Charlotte Sound, the Hecate Strait and the Dixon Entrance, as well as modify the National Energy Board Act to require any pipeline review to take into account the impact of any proposal on employment in the refining and upgrading sectors, and require the National Energy Board to deepen its consultations with communities and First Nations. The bill was a response to the National Energy Board's approval of the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline. As part of the Take Back Our Coast campaign, Cullen toured dozens of communities around British Columbia's north, interior, lower mainland and across Vancouver Island promoting Bill C-628 and raising awareness about the potential impacts of a pipeline or supertanker spill from Northern Gateway on fisheries, tourism and communities. On April 1, 2015, the bill came to a vote at second reading in the House of Commons, and was defeated by a count of 141-120, with all government MPs voting against. On November 22, 2014, Cullen was named Most Knowledgeable Parliamentarian at the Maclean's Magazine Parliamentarian of the Year Awards in Ottawa, edging out Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who placed second in votes. 42nd Parliament After the 2015 election, Cullen was appointed the NDP critic for Environment and Climate Change and Democratic Reform in the 42nd Parliament. As critic for Democratic Institutions, Cullen took the lead in criticizing the government's plans for electoral reform, and in particular for the Special Committee on Electoral Reform. The government ultimately reversed course, and instead backed Cullen's motion for the composition of the committee.Laura Stone, Liberals agree to give majority to Opposition on electoral reform committee, The Globe & Mail, June 2, 2016. Cullen was subsequently named to the committee, and serves as vice-chair. Cullen announced on March 1, 2019 that he would not run for re-election in the 2019 election. Provincial politics On September 17, 2020 Cullen announced his intention to seek the nomination for the BC NDP in the riding of Stikine ahead of the next provincial election.  Election results Personal life Nathan Cullen and Diana Dahr met in Smithers through their work with Katimavik and by the end of 2004, they were engaged. On August 6, 2010, he and his wife became parents of twin boys at Mills Memorial Hospital. Controversies In the lead up to the 2020 British Columbia general election, Nathan Cullen was involved in a controversy over the selection and process for the BC NDP nomination for the Provincial riding of Stikine. The BC NDP nominated Nathan Cullen as its candidate for the riding one week after Annita McPhee, a former elected president of the Tahltan Nation, announced she was seeking the nomination for the riding. The BC NDP has an equity policy whereby a male MLA has to be replaced by a member of an equity-seeking group, such as a woman or an Indigenous person when they retire. The party claims the local riding association conducted a search for candidates to meet its equity policy but found none and then Nathan Cullen was asked to seek the nomination. Annita McPhee asked Nathan Cullen to step down to from seeking the nomination for that riding because of the party's equity policy but Nathan refused. In 2020, Nathan Cullen was paid $101,930 in fees and $2,593.57 in expenses for a total of $104,523.57 by the BC Government on contact by the B.C. ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation to represent the Province in mediating issues involving the hereditary chiefs of the Wet ºsuwet ºen Nation during the 2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests.

His best known book is Confessions of an Economic Hit Man (2004), in which Perkins claims to have played a role in an alleged process of economic colonization of Third World countries on behalf of what he portrays as a cabal of corporations, banks, and the United States government. This book spent more than 70 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has been published in at least 32 languages, and is used in many college and university programs. Perkins has also written about mystical aspects of indigenous cultures, including shamanism. Biography Perkins graduated from the Tilton School in 1963. He subsequently attended Middlebury College for two years before dropping out. He later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Boston University in 1968. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ecuador from 1968 to 1970. He spent the 1970s working for the Boston strategic-consulting firm Chas. T. Main; he claims to have been screened for this job by the National Security Agency (NSA) and subsequently hired by Einar Greve,\\"The Veracity of John Perkins' Accounts\\" Memo by Steven Piersanti, President and Publisher, Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc. March 7, 2005 a member of the firm (alleged by Perkins to have been acting as an NSA liaison, a claim which Greve has denied). As Chief Economist at Chas. T. Main, Perkins and his staff advised the World Bank, United Nations, IMF, U.S. Treasury Department, Fortune 500 corporations, and countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. He worked directly with heads of state and CEOs of major companies. Perkins's time at Chas T. Main provides the basis for his subsequent published claims that, as an \\"economic hit man\\", he was charged with inducing developing countries to borrow large amounts of money, designated to pay for questionable infrastructure investments, but ultimately with a view to making the debt- laden countries more dependent, economically and politically, upon the West. In the 1980s Perkins left Main and founded and directed an independent energy company. In the book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, Perkins claims that his company was successful due to 'coincidences' orchestrated by those appreciative of his silence about the work he says he did as an economic hit man. Perkins is a founder and board member of Dream Change and The Pachamama Alliance, nonprofit organizations devoted to promoting environmentally sustainable and socially just societies. He has lectured at Harvard, Oxford, and more than 50 universities around the world, and is the author of eight books on global economics and indigenous cultures. He has been featured on ABC, NBC, CNN, CNBC, NPR, A&E;, the History Channel, Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Cosmopolitan, Elle, Der Spiegel, and many other publications, as well as in numerous documentaries. He was awarded the Lennon Ono Grant for Peace 2012, and Rainforest Action Network Challenging Business As Usual Award, 2006. Perkins's story is the main theme in part II of the movie Zeitgeist: Addendum, released in October 2008. In that same year, he appeared in the film, The End of Poverty?. His life as an economic hit man is detailed in the full-length movie, Apology of an Economic Hit Man. He also appears in the films The Weight of Chains by Boris Malagurski, released in December 2010, Let's Make Money (in German) by the Austrian director Erwin Wagenhofer, released October 2008, and Four Horsemen by Ross Ashcroft, released in 2012.  Controversy  Sebastian Mallaby, economics columnist of the Washington Post, reacted sharply to Perkins' book:The Facts Behind the 'Confessions' by Sebastian Mallaby, Washington Post Op-Ed, 2006-02-26 describing him as \\"a conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense, and yet his book, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, is a runaway bestseller.\\" Mallaby, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, holds that Perkins' conception of international finance is \\"largely a dream\\" and that his \\"basic contentions are flat wrong.\\" As an example, Mallaby states that Indonesia reduced its infant mortality and illiteracy rates by two-thirds after economists persuaded its leaders to borrow money in 1970. Articles in the New York Times and Boston magazine, as well as a press release issued by the United States Department of State, have referred to a lack of documentary or testimonial evidence to corroborate the claim that the NSA was involved in his hiring by Chas T. Main. After an extensive investigation, the New York Times concluded that \\"the arc of Mr. Perkins's career seems to be described accurately,\\" although they did not find evidence to support \\"some of his fancier claims,\\" including those involving the NSA. In a 2006 statement, a State Department release claims that much of the book \\"appears to be a total fabrication... the National Security Agency is a cryptological (codemaking and codebreaking) organization, not an economic organization... Neither of [its] missions anything remotely resembling placing economists at private companies in order to increase the debt of foreign countries.\\" Perkins responds that Wikileaks and Edward Snowden documents clearly demonstrated that the NSA is involved in a wide range of activities that have nothing to do with codemaking and codebreaking and that often serve to undermine other countries and their leaders. The State Department also claims that Perkins has alleged U.S. Government complicity in \\"the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., former Beatle John Lennon, and several unnamed U.S. senators who had died in plane crashes.\\" Questioned in a recorded interview about the State Department claims on the assassinations, Perkins replied, \\"No, I've never alleged that. I probably opened a question as to whether it might have been that way.\\" There is no mention in any of his books about U.S. Government complicity in these assassinations. Perkins, however, does allege that two of his clients, President Jaime Rold√≥s Aguilera of Ecuador and Omar Torrijos of Panama, had been assassinated and the US government had been involved, adding \\"I know. I was there.\\"  Bibliography  * Touching the Jaguar: Transforming Fear into Action to Change Your Life and the World (2020), Berrett-Koehler Publishers; . *The New Confessions of an Economic Hitman (2016), Berrett-Koehler Publishers; . * Hoodwinked: An Economic Hit Man Reveals Why the World Financial Markets Imploded ‚Äì and What We Need to Do to Remake Them (2009), Crown Business; * The Secret History of the American Empire (2007), Plume; * A Game as Old as Empire: the Secret World of Economic Hit Men and the Web of Global Corruption (edited by Steven Hiatt, introduction by John Perkins) (2007), Berrett- Koehler; * Confessions of an Economic Hit Man (2004), Berrett-Koehler; Perkins's books on mystical aspects of indigenous cultures, including shamanism, include: * Spirit of the Shuar: Wisdom from the Last Unconquered People of the Amazon (2001), co-authors Shakaim Mariano Shakai Ijisam Chumpi, Shakaim Mariano Ijisam Chumpi, Destiny Books, * Psychonavigation: Techniques for Travel Beyond Time (2nd 1999), Destiny Books, * Shapeshifting: Shamanic Techniques for Global and Personal Transformation (1997), Destiny Books, * The World Is As You Dream It: Teachings from the Amazon and Andes (1994), Destiny Books, * The Stress Free Habit: Powerful Techniques for Health and Longevity from the Andes, Yucatan, and the Far East (1989), Healing Arts Books, Appearances in documentary films *The American Ruling Class (2005) *Speaking Freely Volume 1: John Perkins (2007) *Confessions of an Economic Hitman (2007) *On The Line (2007) *The End of Poverty?

He previously played for Suntory Sungoliath and the Japan national rugby union team. Nicknamed \\"the eel\\" for his sharp sidestepping ability, Onozawa is the second most capped Japanese rugby player of all time, and fifth highest try scorer in international rugby. Despite spending much of his career in the shadow of Daisuke Ohata he is considered an all-time great of Japanese rugby in his own right.  Career  Onozawa made his debut for Japan against in June 2001 and immediately impressed troubling the Welsh defence throughout and scored a try from 75 metres out from a move that he started himself. From there onwards he became a fixture in the Japan side. He scored 8 tries in his first 7 caps playing at full back, but in 2003 moved to a spot on the wing. He played all of Japan's matches at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, scoring in his first match against and his wing partnership with Daisuke Ohata at the tournament was noted as one of the most positive aspects of Japan's tournament. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Onozawa again played in all Japan's matches and notably scored a 70-metre individual try against . Over the next few years, Onozawa gradually kept increasing his try scoring record and by 2011 he entered the top 10 on the all time international try scoring list. At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Onozawa played in all Japan's matches for a third consecutive tournament, and also scored against to become the 15th player to score in a three World Cups. Onozawa was retained by new coach Eddie Jones, and 2012 proved to be one of his most successful years at age 34, becoming the 5th player to score 50 international tries in May 2012 , and overall scoring 10 tries in 8 matches, including tries in Japan's first ever wins away in Europe against and in November. Into his 12th year of his international career in 2013, Onozawa won his 80th cap against to become the most capped Japanese player of all time, overtaking centre Yukio Motoki's total of 79 caps. However he suffered with persistent injuries, including a long term shoulder injury which brought his international career effectively to a close with younger players coming through. He still was thought of in high regard by Eddie Jones though, who kept Onozawa with the squad in a mentoring role. At domestic level, Onozawa played for 14 years with Suntory Sungoliath, before joining Canon Eagles in 2014 to finish his career. With Suntory Sungoliath he won the Top League three times, was the league's leading try scorer in the 2009/10 and 2010/11 seasons, was named in the team of the season 8 times at the end of season awards, and was named the league's overall MVP for the 2007/08 season. In October 2012, Onozawa became the first player to score 100 tries in the Top League.

Originally called Bechstein Hall, it specialises in performances of chamber music, early music, vocal music and song recitals. It is widely regarded as one of the world's leading centres for this type of music and an essential port of call for many of the classical music world's leading stars. With near- perfect acoustic, the Hall quickly became celebrated across Europe and featured many of the great artists of the 20th century. Today, the Hall promotes 550 concerts a year and broadcasts a weekly concert on BBC Radio 3. The Hall also promotes an extensive education programme throughout London and beyond and has a huge digital broadcasting arm, which includes the Wigmore Hall Live Label and many live streams of concerts.  Origins  Originally named Bechstein Hall, it was built between 1899 and 1901 by C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik, the German piano manufacturer, whose showroom was next door. The renowned British architect Thomas Edward Collcutt was commissioned to design the space. Collcutt was also responsible for the Savoy Hotel on The Strand (since modified) and the Palace Theatre on Cambridge Circus (originally the Royal English Opera House), with which the Hall shares pale terracotta ornamentation. The Bechstein Company built similar concert halls in Saint Petersburg and Paris, though like its London offices and performing space, these and the business as a whole suffered during the First World War. Bechstein was forced to cease trading in Britain on 5 June 1916 after the passing of the Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act 1916 and all property, including the concert hall and the showrooms, was seized and summarily closed. In 1916, the Hall was sold as alien property at auction to Debenhams for ¬£56,500 ‚Äì a figure considerably short of the ¬£100,000 cost of the building alone. It was then rechristened Wigmore Hall and opened under the new name in 1917.  Design  The building follows the Renaissance style, using alabaster and marble walls, which furnish a flat, rectangular hall with a small raised stage area complete with a cupola above depicting the Soul of Music. The distinctive mural was designed by Gerald Moira, who was responsible for a number of contemporary public art works; he later became principal of the Edinburgh College of Art. After the completion of the design, the cupola was executed by the sculptor Frank Lynn Jenkins. It was restored in 1991 and 1992 and has often been featured in the Hall's marketing and print material. The Hall is considered to have one of the best acoustics for classical music in Europe. It was refurbished in 2004 and was widely praised for being completed on time and on budget. The Hall's current capacity, spread across the stalls and a smaller balcony, is 545 seats.www.lpo.org.uk Chamber Contrasts at Wigmore Hall. Retrieved 6 November 2011. In 2005, the Wigmore Hall Trust purchased a long lease of 300 years for ¬£3.1m. This both secured the future of the Hall and allowed money previously required for rent to be used for further development of its artistic programme. There are two bars and a restaurant on the lower ground floor, below the main auditorium.  Early performers  Bechstein Hall opened on 31 May 1901 with a concert featuring the virtuoso pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni and violinist Eug√®ne Ysa√øe. During its early period, the Hall attracted great musicians like Artur Schnabel, Peter Arnold, Pablo Sarasate, Percy Grainger, Myra Hess, Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Rosing, Alexander Siloti, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Jascha Spivakovsky and Max Reger. At his final recital, in 1976, Rubinstein urged the audience to 'keep coming back to this wonderful Hall.'  Artists and associations  Colin Low Wigmore Hall enjoyed a number of long associations with many great artists of the 20th century including Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los √Ångeles, Sergey Prokofiev, Shura Cherkassky, Paul Hindemith, Andr√©s Segovia, Peter Pears, Benjamin Britten and Francis Poulenc.  Benjamin Britten  The Hall maintained a particularly fruitful relationship with Benjamin Britten, both as composer and performer. His Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, the Second String Quartet, The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo were premi√®red at the Hall, as were extracts from the opera Peter Grimes (ahead of its world premi√®re at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in June 1945). Wigmore Hall commemorated its association with Britten with a series of performances and events entitled 'Before Life and After' in November and December 2012. Those concerts featured artists such as Alice Coote, Ann Murray, Mark Padmore, Gerald Finley, Julius Drake, Malcolm Martineau, Martyn Brabbins, Nash Ensemble and the Tak√°cs Quartet, given to mark the beginning of a year-long international celebration of the 100th anniversary of Britten's birth. Wigmore Hall's 2019‚Äì20 season features a series focussing on Britten and his connections with the venue. Allan Clayton and James Baillieu commemorate the first performance of Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, given by Britten and his partner, the tenor Peter Pears, on 23 September 1942, alongside a lineup of additional singers in further Britten works. Later in the season, Wigmore Hall will commemorate both Britten's birthday and the anniversary of his death.https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/artistic-series/britten- series  Lieder and song  Since its inception, the Hall has been a major hub for Lieder and art song performance.

Director  Wigmore Hall's current director is Limerick-born John Gilhooly, OBE, a classical singer. He joined Wigmore Hall as CEO in 2000 and became Artistic Director in addition in 2005 at the age of 32.www.londonmusicmasters.org John Gilhooly. Retrieved 23 January 2013. Gilhooly has maintained and expanded the Hall's core repertoire of classical song, chamber and early music, as well as introducing new initiatives to entice a more diverse audience. Gilhooly introduced Jazz evenings, curated by the American jazz pianist Brad Mehldau. World music is also a regular feature at the address and there is a series of late night concerts, which have attracted a number of new younger listeners. The previous Artistic Director was Paul Kildea. Before him, William Lyne served as director for 37 years from 1966 to 2003, during which time he introduced themed seasons, the first of which was the Faur√© Series in 1979/80, with subsequent programmes dedicated to Schumann, Purcell, Bach, Ligeti, Haydn, Shostakovich and Vaughan Williams.  New music  Building on its heritage, Wigmore Hall has become a major commissioner of new music. On 31 August 2007, John Gilhooly announced a scheme for modern composers.  Composer-in-Residence  Wigmore fosters further links with the contemporary music scene through the introduction of its Composer-in-Residence scheme. Luke Bedford became the first Composer-in-Residence in 2009 and was succeeded by Julian Anderson in 2013. Alongside performances of their work, Wigmore has featured series of concerts dedicated to the music of Sir George Benjamin, Huw Watkins, Thomas Larcher, Elliott Carter, Brett Dean, Kevin Volans, James MacMillan and J√∂rg Widmann. The 2019/20 Season Composer-in-Residence is Vijay Iyer.  Recent commissions  In 2012, John Gilhooly publicised a renewed commissioning scheme, supported by a major gift from the Fondation Hoffmann and its president, the Swiss businessman, conservationist and philanthropist, Andr√© Hoffmann. The Fondation's donation has ensured the commission of new works by Julian Anderson, Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Anna Meredith, Nico Muhly, Wolfgang Rihm, Judith Weir and J√∂rg Widmann and from 2013 the Hall has committed to premi√®ring 13 new works per season.

It is located east of Kamorta Island.  Geography  Trinket has an area of 12.25 km¬≤, and a flat, low topography. Regional monsoons bring rains of 3,000 mm to 3,800 mm yearly. The island is surrounded by shallow waters and coral reefs,K. Venkataraman, \\"Coral Reefs of India\\", in D. Hopley (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs: Structure, Form and Process, Springer (Dordrecht, 2011). . which allow it to be approached by boat only during high tide.  Administration  From 1869 until 1947 Trinket was part of Britain's Indian colonies. In 1947 it became part of the Dominion of India, and since 1950 of the Republic of India. Trinket is part of the Kamorta Tehsil, Nancowry subdivision of the Nicobars District, and part of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands state. Since 1956 the Government of India has afforded protection to the native Nicobarese through a special legislation, the Andaman and Nicobar Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation, which regulated entry to the islands.  Demographics  Two early censuses of the island were conducted by the British administration in 1883 and 1901. The 1883 census revealed a population of 85 persons living in eight villages. The 1901 census indicated an estimated population of 102 persons, spread between four and six villages, ruled by two chiefs. As of 2001, the Indian census had catalogued 436 persons living on Trinket in four villages: Trinket (population 244), Safebalu (pop. 127), Tapiang (pop. 42) and Hockcook (pop. 23).Trinket , at Andaman & Nicobar Police website. Like most other islands in the Nicobar district, Trinket's population was almost exclusively ethnic Nicobarese. Although, the 2011 Census of India indicated that the island had become uninhabited following the 2004 tsunami disaster, as of the end of 2012 the island appeared to have been repopulated by a pair of returnees, living at the site of what had been Trinket village.  Economy  From the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, trade with Trinket, as with the rest of the Nicobar Islands, was dominated by Indian, Arab, and European merchant fleets.Lisa Ringhoffer, \\"Chapter 6: Comparing Local Transitions Across the Developing World\\", in L. Ringhofer, Fishing, Foraging and Farming in the Bolivian Amazon: On a Local Society in Transition, Springer, London (2010), . Prior to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the island's populace was dependent on the outside world for many goods, including foodstuffs. Until the 1950s they exported whole coconuts and other forest products, but after the 1950s local production shifted toward exports of processed coconut, in the form of copra.Hobbes, Marieke. Figuring Rural Development: Concepts and Cases of Land Use, Sustainability and Integrative Indicators, Leiden University Press (2010), page 117. Those products were traded for imports such as rice, sugar, and clothes, which were used to supplement the local subsistence economy based on hunting and gathering, fishing, pig and chicken rearing, and household gardens.Marina Fischer-Kowalski, Simron J.Singh, Lisa Ringhofer, Clemens M.

Truzzi was an investigator of various protosciences and pseudosciences and, as fellow CSICOP cofounder Paul Kurtz dubbed him \\"the skeptic's skeptic\\". He is credited with originating the oft-used phrase \\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof\\", though earlier versions existed. Biography Truzzi was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was the only child of juggler Massimiliano Truzzi and his wife Sonya. His family moved to the United States in 1940 where his father performed with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Truzzi served in the United States Army between 1958 and 1960; he became a naturalized citizen in 1961. Truzzi founded the skeptical journal Explorations and was a founding member of the skeptic organization CSICOP as its co-chairman with Paul Kurtz. Truzzi's journal became the official journal of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) and was renamed The Zetetic (\\"zetetic\\" is another name for \\"skeptic\\" and is not to be confused with zetetics, the study of the relationship of art and science). The journal remained under his editorship. He left CSICOP about a year after its founding, after receiving a vote of no confidence from the group's Executive Council. Truzzi wanted to include pro-paranormal people in the organization and pro-paranormal research in the journal, but CSICOP felt that there were already enough organizations and journals dedicated to the paranormal. Kendrick Frazier became the editor of CSICOP's journal and the name was changed to Skeptical Inquirer. The Zetetic Scholar journal founded by Marcello Truzzi After leaving CSICOP, Truzzi started another journal, the Zetetic Scholar.Zetetic Scholar archives He promoted the term \\"zeteticism\\" as an alternative to \\"skepticism\\", because he thought that the latter term was being usurped by what he termed \\"pseudoskeptics\\". A zetetic is a \\"skeptical seeker\\". The term's origins lie in the word for the followers of the skeptic Pyrrho in ancient Greece. Skeptic's Dictionary memorialized Truzzi thus: > Truzzi considered most skeptics to be pseudoskeptics, a term he coined to > describe those who assume an occult or paranormal claim is false without > bothering to investigate it. A kind way to state these differences might be > to say that Marcello belonged to the Pyrrhonian tradition, most of the rest > of us belong to the Academic skeptical tradition.in memoriam Skeptics and > Scientists Truzzi was skeptical of investigators and debunkers who determined the validity of a claim prior to investigation. He accused CSICOP of increasingly unscientific behavior, for which he coined the term pseudoskepticism. Truzzi stated: Truzzi held that CSICOP researchers sometimes also put unreasonable limits on the standards for proof regarding the study of anomalies and the paranormal. Martin Gardner writes: \\"In recent years he (Truzzi) has become a personal friend of Uri Geller; not that he believes Uri has psychic powers, as I understand it, but he admires Uri for having made a fortune by pretending he is not a magician.\\"Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the Leading Paranormal Inquirers edited by Paul Kurtz, Prometheus Books, 2001, p 360 Truzzi co-authored a book on psychic detectives entitled The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime. It investigated many psychic detectives and concluded: \\"[W]e unearthed new evidence supporting both sides in the controversy. We hope to have shown that much of the debate has been extremely simplistic.\\"Marcello Truzzi, The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime, The Mysterious Press, 1991., p. 284, paperback edition The book also stated that the evidence didn't meet the burden of proof demanded for such an extraordinary claim.Marcello Truzzi, The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime, The Mysterious Press, 1991., p. 252, hardback edition Although he was very familiar with folie √† deux, Truzzi was very confident a shared visual hallucination could not be skeptically examined by one of the participators. Thus he categorized it as an anomaly. In a 1982 interview Truzzi stated that controlled ESP (ganzfeld) experiments have \\"gotten the right results\\" maybe 60 percent of the time.Marcello Truzzi, Detroit Free Press Science Page, 26 Oct 1982 This question remains controversial. Truzzi remained an advisor to IRVA, the International Remote Viewing Association, from its founding meeting until his death.About IRVA Truzzi was Keynote Speaker at the 1st annual National Roller Coaster Conference, \\"CoasterMania\\", held at Cedar Point Amusement Park, Sandusky, Ohio - 1978. On the subject of riding in the front vs riding in the back of a roller coaster, he said: Truzzi died from cancer on February 2, 2003.  Pseudoskepticism  Marcello Truzzi popularized the term pseudoskepticism in response to skeptics who, in his opinion, made negative claims without bearing the burden of proof of those claims. While a Professor of Sociology at Eastern Michigan University in 1987, Truzzi discussed pseudoskepticism in the journal Zetetic Scholar which he had founded: The term has found occasional use in fringe fields where opposition from those within the scientific mainstream or from scientific skeptics is strong. In 1994 Susan Blackmore, a parapsychologist who became more skeptical and eventually became a CSICOP fellow in 1991, described what she termed the \\"worst kind of pseudoskepticism\\": \\"Extraordinary claims\\" Carl Sagan popularized this as \\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\\", which later came to be known as the Sagan standard. It is derived from Pierre-Simon de Laplace's \\"The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness.\\" Martin Gardner - Truzzi Correspondence In 2017, World Scientific released a book edited by Dana Richards about the correspondence between Martin Gardner and Truzzi. The book called Dear Martin, Dear Marcello: Gardner and Truzzi on Skepticism is broken up into four sections; \\"The Road to CSICOP\\", \\"The Demarcation Problem\\", \\"The Dissolution\\", and the \\"Return to Cordiality\\". The early letters from Truzzi were not preserved and the beginning of the book seems one-sided with only Gardner's letters. The editor, Richards states in the introduction the conflicts between the two men, their differing goals for CSICOP, and various people in the skeptic and paranormal communities. They discuss many topics including publishers, Geller, and the \\"definitions of charlatan and crankpot\\". Books by Truzzi    *, 236 pages.

He arrived in Virginia around 1610, and served as a Burgess in the first representative legislative session in North America. Jordan patented a plantation known as Jordan's Journey (a.k.a. 'Beggar's Bush'), which became a safe haven and stronghold for settlers during the Second Anglo-Powhatan War that ensued after the Powhatan surprise attack of 1622. Jordan died in 1623. After his death, the control of Jordan's Journey was uncertain: his widow Cecily Jordan became involved in the first breach-of-promise dispute in North America, the suit filed by Rev. Greville Pooley. Cecily Jordan won the case, then married William Farrar; her daughters with Jordan inherited Jordan's Journey. Early life and arrival in New World Samuel Jordan came to Virginia sometime around 1610, as his 1620 patent mentions him as having lived ten years in the colony. Samuel Jordan's early life is uncertain. Alexander Brown suggests \\"he was probably married more than once\\". Some authors state that he had three sons from a first wife who were born in England: Robert, Samuel, and Thomas . Though the genealogist John Dorman does not mention either Robert or Samuel, he does acknowledge the possibility that Thomas Jordan, who arrived in Virginia at age 18 aboard Diana in 1619, could be Samuel's son from an earlier marriage in England; however, he also points out there is no conclusive evidence to establish this relation. Role in Virginia government Thomas Armstrong's illustration of the First Assembly in Virginia, which Samuel Jordan attended. When Deputy-Governor George Yeardley called the first representative legislative assembly in Virginia in 1619, Jordan served as a Burgess on behalf of Charles City . During this first meeting, Jordan also served on the committee of readers for the Great Charter, which been recently received from the Virginia Company and had authorized the assembly. As a privilege granted by the Great Charter, Jordan also became an ancient planter , which entitled him to 100 acres of land. Marriage to Cecily Sometime before 1620, Jordan married Cecily, who had arrived in Virginia around 1611 and was around 18 when they married. By 1621, their first daughter Mary had been born, and when Jordan died in 1623, Cecily was pregnant with her second daughter, Margaret. Virginia Historical Highway Marker of Jordan's Journey In 1620, Samuel Jordan officially received his patent for 450 acres of land. This patent included 200 acres for both his and Cecily's claim as ancient planters, as well as an additional 250 acres as headright for paying the transportation costs to Virginia for five indentured servants. Jordan's patent, located at today's Jordan Point, Virginia, was originally known as Beggars Bush and later as Jordan's Journey.. When the paramount chief Opechancanough of the Powhatan Confederacy launched the surprise attack of 1622 that killed nearly a third of the English colonists and triggered the Second Anglo-Powhatan War, nobody from Jordan's Journey was listed as killed . Jordan's Journey withstood the attack and became a fortified refuge. After the initial assault, many of the outlying settlements were temporarily abandoned, and most of the colonists were ordered to move to a small number of relatively safer settlements, one of which was Jordan's Journey . As a result, Jordan's Journey grew. In February 1624, 42 people were living at Jordan's Journey ; a year later, 56 people were living there. Death and aftermath Samuel Jordan died sometime before mid-February 1623, as his name does not appear among living at Jordan's Journey in a list submitted to the Virginia Company that month. After he died, Cecily almost immediately became involved in a legal dispute that has been called the first breach-of-promise suit in North America . About three days after Jordan had died, Reverend Greville Pooley proposed marriage. By June 1623, Cecily had contracted herself to another man who was currently living at Jordan's Journey, William Farrar, who was bonded to execute Samuel Jordan's will.. Pooley took the case to the Virginia Council, claiming his proposal had initially been accepted. The outcome of this dispute not only determined who would marry Cecily, but also who would ultimately have say over the management of Jordan's property. After a prolonged period of litigation that lasted until 1625, when Pooley eventually forswore any claims against her. In 1625, Cecily Jordan and William Farrar married. Even though William Farrar had married Cecily, the lists of patents sent back to England still listed Jordan's Journey as owned by the Jordan family. Farrar eventually acquired his own rights to a 2000 acre patent on Farrar's Island at the site of what had previously been Henricus, Historian Martha McCartney suggests Jordan's Journey may have remained with one or both of Jordan's daughters., but their fates are not recorded.

Panaro graduated from La Salle College High School, in Springfield (Montgomery County, Pennsylvania) in 1982. Career Having a love for animals since childhood, he considered becoming a veterinarian, an ambition which was never fulfilled as he fell in love with theater after having seen his first Broadway musical, starring fellow Philadelphian Andrea McArdle, as an adolescent. Hugh appeared in high school productions of Godspell and Pippin, as well as numerous regional and dinner theater productions throughout his teen years; with his first stage role being Friedrich in The Sound of Music. He began performing at the age of 13 and studied voice with Robert Grooters at the Boyer College of Music and Dance at Temple University. His pre-Broadway and regional roles include 'Mary Sunshine' in Chicago, and the lead in Jesus Christ Superstar. He made his Broadway debut as Marius in Les Mis√©rables, a role he originated in the first U.S. national touring company.

In 2009, he starred in Sunday in the Park with George at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle and appeared as 'Fagin' in Oliver! to rave reviews before hometown audiences at the Walnut Street Theatre, opening November 18, 2009, through January 10, 2010. He was later active as a concert artist appearing with symphonies throughout the United States and Canada. Panaro returned to the title role in the Broadway production of The Phantom of the Opera on September 7, 2010. He replaced John Cudia in the role. This was Panaro's third time playing The Phantom in this production. In January 2013, he performed the role in the Broadway production's 25th anniversary. He took a break from Phantom from April until the end of August 2013. During this time, he reprised the role of Jean Valjean at The Muny in the St. Louis in their production of Les Mis√©rables, alongside Norm Lewis as Javert. Panaro won a St. Louis Theater Circle Award for his portrayal of Valjean. Afterwards, he returned to the Majestic stage on August 26, starring opposite Mary Michael Patterson as Christine Daae. Panaro's final performance as the Phantom was May 3. His former co-star in Les Miserables, Norm Lewis, succeeded him in the role. Beginning August 29, he assumed the lead from Norm Lewis in the Off-Broadway production of Sweeney Todd at the Barrow Street Theater. He played the role through February 25, 2018. In 2011 he was the announced 'Maxim de Winter' in a later to be cancelled Broadway version of Rebecca.

It is a part of the municipality of Borsele, and lies about 12 km east of Vlissingen. Note that the municipality name is spelled with a single s while the name of the town is spelled with a double s. In 2001, the town of Borssele had 1081 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.30 km¬≤, and contained 410 residences.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Bevolkingskernen in Nederland 2001. (Statistics are for the continuous built-up area). The statistical area \\"Borssele\\", which also can include the peripheral parts of the village, as well as the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 1440.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Statline: Kerncijfers wijken en buurten 2003-2005 . As of 1 January 2005. Something rather interesting about Borssele, is the town's structure. In 1616 (the year the town was established). It follows a rectangular design with four streets all leading to a central square (called the \\"Plein\\"). The streets are named according to their cardinal directions. Energy The town is the site of the Netherlands' only commercial nuclear power plant, the 485 MW Borssele nuclear power plant. A nearby area in the North Sea is also called Borssele, and is scheduled for offshore wind farm development. The first two stages for a combined 700-760 MegaWatt capacity was awarded to DONG Energy (among 36-38 bidders) in July 2016 at a price of 7.27 Euro cent per kilowatt hour for 15 years, after which it would produce at market conditions. The price will not be adjusted for inflation. TenneT receives a further ‚Ç¨14/MWh (1.4 c/kWh) for transmission, giving a total price of ‚Ç¨87/MWh (8.7 c/kWh). Two more stages with a further 680-740 MW went on auction on 29 September 2016 with 26 bids from 7 consortia. The auction was won by the Blauwwind II c.v. consortium with 8MW Vestas- Mitsubishi turbines, at a price of 5.45 c/kWh. The total subsidy is estimated at ‚Ç¨300 million, down from the expected ‚Ç¨5 billion. Experts view the price as unusually low (the lowest price was 10.3 c/kWh), and consider finance, high wind of 9.5 m/s and scaling as main drivers for the decreased price. Proximity to shore also means the project can use alternating current transformer and cables to shore, instead of direct current, decreasing the cost. The wind farm operators only handle the farms, as TenneT handles the transmission.

His landmark 1938 book, The Functions of the Executive, sets out a theory of organization and of the functions of executives in organizations. The book has been widely assigned in university courses in management theory and organizational sociology.Chester (Irving) Barnard Biography (1886 - 1961) on biography.com. Retrieved 16 June 2008. Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. According to Barnard, organizations are generally not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: effectiveness and efficiency.  Biography  In his youth, Barnard worked on a farm, then studied economics at Harvard University, earning money selling pianos and operating a dance band. He did not obtain his Harvard BA because he did his four-year work in three years and could not complete a science course, but a number of universities later granted him honorary doctorates.R.C.S. Trahair (1994) \\"Barnard's executive functions\\" in From Aristotelian to Reaganomics. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.40 Barnard joined the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT&T;) in 1909. In 1927, he became president of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. During the Great Depression, he directed the New Jersey state relief system. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1939. He was president of the United Service Organizations (USO), 1942-45. Upon retiring from business, he served as president of the Rockefeller Foundation, 1948‚Äì52, and as chairman of the National Science Foundation, 1952-54. End 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research.  Work  Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. It is rare for a firm to last more than a century. Similarly most nations last for less than a century. The only organization that can claim a substantial age is the Roman Catholic Church. According to Barnard, organizations are not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness, is defined the usual way: as being able to accomplish stated goals. In contrast, Barnard's meaning of organizational efficiency differed substantially from the conventional use of the word. He defined efficiency of an organization as the degree to which that organization is able to satisfy the motives of the individuals. If an organization satisfies the motives of its members while attaining its explicit goals, cooperation among its members will last. Barnard was a great admirer of Talcott Parsons (1902‚Äì1979) and he and Parsons corresponded persistently. The two scholars would send manuscripts for commentary to each other and they would write long letters where they engage in a common theoretical discussion. The first correspondence between Barnard and Parsons began in the end of the 1930s and it persisted essentially to Barnard‚Äôs death in 1961.  The Functions of the Executive  Barnard's classic 1938 book, The Functions of the Executive discusses, as the title suggests, the functions of the executive, but not from a merely intuitive point of view, but instead deriving them from his conception of cooperative systems. Barnard summarized the functions of the executive as follows: * Establishing and maintaining a system of communication; * Securing essential services from other members; * Formulating organizational purposes and objectives. * To manage people and make sure they do their jobs  Authority and incentives  Barnard formulated two interesting theories: one of authority and the other of incentives. Both are seen in the context of a communication system grounded in seven essential rules: * The channels of communication should be definite; * Everyone should know of the channels of communication; * Everyone should have access to the formal channels of communication; * Lines of communication should be as short and as direct as possible; * Competence of persons serving as communication centers should be adequate; * The line of communication should not be interrupted when the organization is functioning; * Every communication should be authenticated. Thus, what makes a communication authoritative, rests with the subordinate, rather than with his superior. Barnard's perspective had affinities to that of Mary Parker Follett and was very unusual for his time, and that has remained the case down to the present day. He seemed to argue that managers should obtain authority by treating subordinates with respect and competence. As for incentives, he proposed two ways of convincing subordinates to cooperate: tangible incentives and persuasion. Barnard gives great importance to persuasion, much more than to economic incentives. He described four general, and four specific incentives. The specific incentives were: # Money and other material inducements; # Personal non-material opportunities for distinction; # Desirable physical conditions of work; # Ideal benefactions, such as pride of workmanship etc. The general incentives were: # Associated attractiveness (based upon compatibility with associates) # Adaptation of working conditions to habitual methods and attitudes # The opportunity for the feeling of enlarged participation in the course of events # The condition of communing with others (personal comfort with social relations, opportunity for comradeship etc., ) See also *Organizational studies  Selected publications  * 1938.

In the United States, chickenhawk or chicken hawk is an unofficial designation for three species of North American hawks in the family Accipitridae: Cooper's hawk, also called a quail hawk, the sharp-shinned hawk, and the red-tailed hawk. The term \\"chicken hawk\\", however, is inaccurate. Although Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks do primarily hunt other birds, chickens do not make up a significant part of their diets; red-tailed hawks may opportunistically hunt free-range poultry, but are chiefly predators of mammals such as rodents and rabbits. Historically, misinterpretation of the name \\"chicken hawk\\" has labelled these birds as pests, hence justifying their slaughter. Officially, per the American Ornithologists' Union's list of bird names, the term has become obsolete as applied to birds, but still enjoys widespread colloquial use in rural areas where any of the three species has been seen as a threat to small outdoor animals kept as pets or livestock, especially chickens. While the term is still widely used by those who keep such animals, it is too ambiguous to be of any scholarly usefulness, especially since the meaning of hawk differs between America and Europe; thus, the term's propriety (or lack thereof) depends entirely upon context. The unofficial names of other raptors that are derived from their supposed prey include: duck hawk (peregrine falcon), sparrowhawk (American kestrel), goshawk (northern goshawk), pigeon hawk (merlin), fish hawk (osprey), and quail hawk (Cooper's hawk). In popular culture * Henery Hawk was a cartoon character created by Chuck Jones and Robert McKimson in the Looney Tunes series. The premise of this character was that he was too young to know what a chicken was and hence, although having a great deal of energy, was easily tricked into thinking that other animals (usually the Barnyard Dawg or Sylvester) were chickens. The character Foghorn Leghorn was introduced to complement the Henery Hawk character, but quickly eclipsed him in popularity. He, along with the rest of the Looney Tunes cast, returned in the latest Looney Tunes installment, a sitcom called The Looney Tunes Show. In addition to the aforementioned Henery Hawk, Looney Tunes features chicken hawks Elvis and Pappy. * Jim Henson's Animal Show featured Armstrong the Chickenhawk (performed by Bill Barretta) who is the show's expert on birds.

The national edition of the newspaper was published in Toronto. A weekly Montreal edition in English with some French began its run in 1976. The newspaper announced its closure in 2013 but was able to continue after restructuring and reorganizing. It again announced its closure on April 2, 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada on its finances. Its final edition was published on April 9, 2020. History The Canadian Jewish News was founded by M. J. Nurenberger, a friend of Menachem Begin and supporter of his Herut party, and his wife Dorothy and was first published on Friday, January 1, 1960, and was the first exclusively English-language Jewish newspaper published in Ontario. The CJN was considered a \\"provocative\\" paper into the 1970s but was later considered something of a \\"lapdog for the community\\". The original CJN hewed a line that supported the right in Israeli politics and was critical of the liberal leadership of the Canadian Jewish community at the time as well as community institutions such as B'nai Brith and the United Jewish Appeal, the latter for its secrecy in how it dispersed money. According to his daughter, Atara Beck, \\"He believed that a newspaper should be a thorn in the side of the establishment.\\" In 1971, following the death of his wife, Nurenberger sold the newspaper for $30,000 to a group of community leaders that included Shoppers Drug Mart founder Murray Koffler and real estate developer Albert Latner and was led by philanthropist and businessman Ray Wolfe.\\"Drawing the line: There are many subjects writers can discuss in The Canadian Jewish News. Criticizing the security policies of the Israeli government is not one of them\\" , Ryerson Review of Journalism, Spring 2005 Though independent, the newspaper has been owned, since 1971, by a group of Jewish leaders allied with what was then the Canadian Jewish Congress. Nurenburger soon regretted his decision, discouraged by the new version of the paper's reticence to challenge the community's establishment, and started the Jewish Times in 1974, which was decidedly more right wing than CJN under its new management, and continued publication into the early 1990s. In 1979, it adopted editorial guidelines that prevent articles from criticizing the state of Israel's security policies. By 2013, the CJN had a circulation of 40,000 copies per week. Suspension On April 22, 2013, the newspaper issued termination notices to its 50 staff and announced that it will cease printing with its June 20 edition due to financial constraints. The publishers sought benefactors to provide funding that would allow the CJN to continue as an exclusively online publication less reliant on advertising.\\"The Canadian Jewish News is shutting down, citing changes ‚Äòsweeping‚Äô newspaper industry\\", National Post, April 22, 2013.  Resumption of publication  On June 14, 2013, the CJN's board announced that it would resume publication of its print edition in August 2013 after moving to smaller offices and pending the results of a subscription and advertising drive and various changes to the newspaper's business model. Among others, editor Mordechai Ben-Dat and senior staffer and columnist Sheldon Kirshner were let go.Elizabeth Wolfe, \\"Call to Action,\\" Canadian Jewish News, Aug. 1, 2013. The newspaper was subsequently reorganized under new leadership, and with a drastically reduced staff, beginning in January 2014, with Elizabeth Wolfe, daughter of Ray Wolfe, becoming president and former Jerusalem Report, National Post and Macleans journalist Yoni Goldstein becoming the newspaper's editor. Goldstein subsequently introduced a more diverse range of contributors to the newspaper. The content of the newly revamped paper was described as \\"racier\\" and was more reliant on freelancers. By 2016, the newspaper's subscriptions remained mostly unchanged at 31,000, but Wolfe reported advertising and subscription revenues were enough to invest in new projects. Closure The paper announced that it would cease publication with its 9 April 2020 issue, with its final circulation estimated at 32,000. It had suffered from financial shortfalls for years, which were exacerbated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Canada on its finances. CJN president Elizabeth Wolfe stated that \\"The CJN suffered from a pre-existing condition and has been felled by COVID-19.\\"  Contributors  Notable contributors to the newspaper have included Jacob Elbaz, J. B. Salsberg, who was a featured columnist in the newspaper for several decades until shortly before his death in 1998, and Rabbi Gunther Plaut, who also contributed a weekly column for many years. In its final years, Bernie Farber and Barbara Kay were weekly columnists. The main Toronto edition of the CJN had a rotating group of guest columnists: among them were academics Norma Baumel Joseph and Norman Ravvin of Concordia University; Sarah Horowitz of York; Gil Troy of McGill; Gerald Steinberg of Bar-Ilan University, as well as Jean Gerber in Vancouver, and Rabbi Dow Marmur and Avrum Rosensweig in Toronto.

He was first elected in the 1997 provincial election and was re-elected four times. He is perhaps best known as the sponsor of the legislation that led to the enshrining of Alberta. In April 2008, he elected as the Legislature's Deputy Speaker and Chair of Committees and served in that position for the 27th Legislature. Mr. Cao also served as a member of the Standing Committee on Resource Stewardship.https://www.assembly.ab.ca/committees/resourcestewardship/index.html Early life Cao was born December 7, 1946 in northern Vietnam. He studied engineering, mathematics, and computing science in Saigon and at the University of Auckland and the University of Waterloo. After the Vietnam War, he came to California as a refugee - he boarded an American helicopter just before the fall of Saigon - and settled in Calgary in 1976. He worked for Shell Petroleum for twenty-six years before taking early retirement in 1997 to enter politics. During this time, he also lectured at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.  Political career  Cao first sought public office in the 1997 provincial election, when he ran in the riding of Calgary-Fort as the Progressive Conservative. He was elected handily, and was re-elected in each of the next three elections. He supported Jim Dinning in the 2006 P.C. leadership race. Wayne Cao elected Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Whole Assembly Committees, Legislature, Alberta, Canada, April 2008 In April 2008, he was elected by his legislator colleagues as the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, defeating Len Mitzel and Bridget Pastoor in a secret ballot. Cao would announce he would retire from the legislature in February 2015, prior to the 2015 Alberta general election which saw the Progressive Conservative dynasty end when the New Democratic Party would be elected to a majority government. Cao's former electoral district Calgary-Fort would elect New Democrat Joe Ceci. Legislative initiatives Cao has moved a large number of private member's bills. Of these, the only one to pass was 2001's Alberta Official Song Act, which established a contest for the province's official song, with the winner to be selected by an all party committee of the legislature. It passed with the support of members from all parties, although Progressive Conservative Rob Renner felt that the province's official song should be something that was already known to most Albertans rather than a new song composed for the occasion, and Liberal Hugh MacDonald argued that no official song was necessary, since Alberta already had an \\"unofficial song\\", Alberta Bound (which MacDonald recalled hearing Ian Tyson sing at the closing ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics, although the song, along with Four Strong Winds, was actually sung at the opening ceremonies by Tyson and Gordon Lightfoot, the song's composer and singer). The ensuing competition selected Alberta, composed by Mary Kieftenbeld, as the province's official song. Cao followed this bill with efforts to encourage the translation of O Canada into all languages spoken by Canadians; he composed a Vietnamese version and sang it on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Wayne Cao, Deputy Speaker, Legislature, Alberta, Canada 2008 Cao also made headlines in 2007 with the School (Canadian History Content) Amendment Act, which would have mandated that 75% of the instructional hours in high school social studies courses be devoted to Canadian history. Several MLAs spoke in opposition to the bill, including Liberals Bill Bonko (who felt, as a former school trustee, that any percentage should be mandated by local school boards) and Harry Chase, New Democrat David Eggen (who suggested that global history was as or more important than Canadian history), and Progressive Conservative Education Minister Ron Liepert (who agreed with Eggen and who extolled the virtues of the recently implemented existing social studies curriculum). Outside of the legislature, Progressive Conservatives Neil Brown and Len Webber expressed reservations about the decision being made at the political, rather than local, level. The legislature adjourned before the bill came to a vote. Cao also sponsored the Employment Standards (Parental Leave) Amendment Act, which would have combined the provisions for adoptive leave and maternity leave and extended them to 27 weeks (Alberta's maternity leave provisions were, at the time, the least generous in the country). He first introduced the bill in 1999, but the legislature adjourned before it reached second reading. He re-introduced it in 2000, when several MLAs, including Liberals Don Massey, Laurie Blakeman, Linda Sloan, and Percy Wickman and Progressive Conservatives Moe Amery, Karen Kryczka, and Mary Anne Jablonski, spoke in support of the bill on second reading. Only Shiraz Shariff spoke against, citing concerns that the business community hadn't been sufficiently consulted. The bill passed second reading with 34 votes in favour and four (Gary Friedel, Richard Magnus, Barry McFarland, and Rob Renner) against. However, the legislature adjourned while the bill was still in committee. In 2008, Cao sponsored the Alberta Volunteer Service Medal Act, which would have established a medal for exceptional volunteers. It received bipartisan support from Progressive Conservatives Jonathan Denis, Carl Benito, Neil Brown, and Greg Weadick and Liberals Hugh MacDonald and Darshan Kang, but was ultimately hoisted on a motion from Progressive Conservative Fred Horne. The bill's opponents included Liberal Harry B. Chase (who felt that the government's role in volunteer recognition should come in the form of support, rather than in the form of after-the-fact recognition) and Progressive Conservatives Richard Marz (who argued that medals should be restricted to those who had risked their lives), Heather Forsyth (who was concerned by the level of bureaucracy in the bill), George Rogers (who suggested that it duplicated existing government programs), Ray Prins (who was concerned that by singling out individual volunteers it would demean the contributions of those who weren't recognized), and Doug Griffiths (who echoed Rogers' arguments and also expressed concern that the proposed award would have a built in bias in favour of volunteers with large organizations). His other private member's bills have included 1997's Highway Traffic Amendment Act, 2002's Environmental Protection and Enhancement (Residential Land Disclosure) Amendment Act, 2003's Financial Summit Act, and 2004's Government Accountability (Identification of Expenditures) Amendment Act, none of which reached second reading. In addition to his private member's bills, Cao has sponsored a government bill, the Tobacco Tax Amendment Act of 2003. The bill was in response to an increase in the number of Albertans buying tobacco products out of province, after the government imposed taxes on the import of tobacco products to Alberta that saw taxes on such goods more than double. It passed after little debate. Cao also sponsored a successful private bill in 1998, the Tanya Marie Bryant Adoption Termination Act. Personal life Cao is married to Kim Hoang. The pair have three sons: William (a lawyer), Winston (an engineer), and Willis (a scientist). They also have one grandson. He identifies Confucius and Winston Churchill as his political heroes.

Eastwood plays a mysterious stranger, meting out justice in a corrupt frontier mining town. The film was influenced by the work of Eastwood's two major collaborators, film directors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. The film was shot on location on the shores of Mono Lake, California. Dee Barton wrote the film score. The film was critically acclaimed at the time of its initial release and remains popular today, holding a score of 96% at the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Plot An unnamed man rides out of the desert into the isolated mining town of Lago in Inyo County, California in the American Old West. Three men follow him into the saloon, taunting him, then follow him to the barbershop. When they challenge him, he kills all three with little effort. Townswoman Callie Travers deliberately bumps into him in the street, knocks his cigar from his mouth, and loudly insults him. He drags her into the livery stable and rapes her. That night, in his hotel room, the Stranger dreams of a man being brutally whipped. The dream morphs into a flashback in which Jim Duncan, a federal marshal, is whipped to death in front of the hotel by outlaws Stacey Bridges and brothers Dan and Cole Carlin as the citizens look on. The next day, Sheriff Sam Shaw approaches the Stranger and offers him the job previously held by the men he killed: defending the town from Bridges and the Carlins, who are about to be released from jail. He declines. Shaw, in desperation, offers him anything he wants in return. The Stranger learns that the townspeople were complicit in Duncan's murder; they hired the outlaws to kill him after he discovered that the town's only source of income, the mine, was on government land. They then double-crossed the hired murderers and turned them in. Upon learning this, the Stranger accepts the job and takes full advantage of the deal. He appoints barbershop employee Mordecai as sheriff and mayor, and provides a Native American and his children with supplies at the shopkeeper's expense. He orders the hotel owner and his guests to vacate the premises, leaving him its sole occupant. The hotel owner, Lewis Belding, and his wife Sarah, object. Callie and some of the resentful townsmen conspire to do away with the Stranger. Callie and the Stranger have sex in his room but Callie later sneaks out thinking he's asleep. This is when some of the townspeople go after the Stranger in his hotel room, only to be blown up when he tosses a stick of dynamite into the room while they are beating a dummy in the bed, which wrecks most of the hotel as well. He drags Sarah, kicking and screaming, into her bedroom and they sleep together. The next morning, while discussing the imprisoned murderers, Sarah tells the Stranger that Duncan cannot rest in peace because he is buried in an unmarked grave outside of town. The Stranger instructs the townspeople in defensive tactics, but they lack the competence for the job. He also orders that every building in town be painted blood red. Then, without explanation, he mounts his horse and rides out of town, pausing to replace \\"Lago\\" on the town sign with \\"Hell\\". Meanwhile, Bridges and the Carlins have been released from prison and are heading to Lago. The Stranger harasses them with dynamite and long-range rifle fire, leaving them to ponder the identity of their attacker. Returning to Lago, the Stranger inspects the preparations‚Äîthe entire town painted red, townsmen with rifles stationed on rooftops, picnic tables laden with food and drink, and a big \\"WELCOME HOME BOYS\\" banner overhead‚Äîthen he remounts and departs again. The Bridges gang arrives and easily overcomes the inept resistance of the townspeople. Bridges shoots several of the civic leaders who double-crossed them. By nightfall the town is in flames, and the terrified citizens are huddled in the saloon with the Bridges gang, who taunt them. A sound is heard in the street; Cole Carlin, while standing by the entrance to the saloon, is caught by a whip around the throat, dragged outside and everyone listens as he is whipped to death. Dan Carlin is then found dead, too, hanging from another whip. As Bridges investigates, the Stranger appears, beats Bridges to the draw, and kills him. On his way out of town the following morning, the Stranger pauses at the cemetery as Mordecai is finishing a new grave marker. \\"I never did know your name\\", Mordecai says. \\"Yes, you do\\", the Stranger replies. As he rides past a bewildered Mordecai to vanish into the desert heat haze, the writing on the new grave marker is revealed: Marshal Jim Duncan ‚Äì Rest in Peace.

It is the first Western film that he both directed and starred in. Under a joint production between Malpaso and Universal, the original screenplay was written by Ernest Tidyman, who had won a Best Screenplay Oscar for The French Connection.McGilligan (1999), p. 221 Tidyman's screenplay was inspired by the real-life murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens in 1964, which eyewitnesses reportedly stood by and watched. Holes in the plot were filled in with black humor and allegory, influenced by Sergio Leone. An uncredited rewrite of the script was provided by Dean Riesner, screenwriter of other Eastwood projects. Universal wanted Eastwood to shoot the feature on its back lot, but Eastwood opted instead to film on location. After scouting locations alone in a pickup truck in Oregon, Nevada and California,Gentry, p. 63 he settled on the \\"highly photogenic\\" Mono Lake area.Hughes, p. 28 Over 50 technicians and construction workers built an entire town‚Äî14 houses, a church, and a two-story hotel‚Äîin 18 days, using 150,000 feet of timber. Complete buildings, rather than facades, were built, so that Eastwood could shoot interior scenes on the site. Additional scenes were filmed at Reno, Nevada's Winnemucca Lake and California's Inyo National Forest. The film was completed in six weeks, two days ahead of schedule, and under budget.Eliot (2009), p. 144 The character of Marshal Duncan was played by Buddy Van Horn, Eastwood's long-time stunt double, to suggest that he and the Stranger could be the same person. In an interview, Eastwood said that earlier versions of the script made the Stranger the dead marshal's brother. He favored a less explicit and more supernatural interpretation, and excised the reference. The Italian, Spanish, French and German dubbings restored it.Clint Eastwood. Guardian interviews, retrieved August 8, 2016. \\"It's just an allegory,\\" he said, \\"a speculation on what happens when they go ahead and kill the sheriff and somebody comes back and calls the town's conscience to bear. There's always retribution for your deeds.\\"Hughes, pp. 30‚Äì31 The graveyard set featured in the film's final scene included tombstones inscribed \\"Sergio Leone\\" and \\"Don Siegel\\" as a humorous tribute to the two influential directors. Reception Universal released the R-rated High Plains Drifter in the United States in April 1973, and the film eventually grossed $15.7 million domestically, ultimately making it the sixth- highest grossing Western in North America in the decade of the 1970s and the 20th highest-grossing film released in 1973. The film was well received by many critics, and rates 96% positive on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"part ghost story, part revenge Western, more than a little silly, and often quite entertaining in a way that may make you wonder if you lost your good sense.\\"Canby, Vincent (April 20, 1973). \\"'High Plains Drifter' Opens on Screen\\". The New York Times. 21. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, \\"What does work very well indeed is Eastwood's presence, personal style, and direction.

Section 2, p. 3. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called it \\"a nervously humorous, self-conscious near satire on the prototype Clint Eastwood formula of the avenging mysterious stranger. Ernest Tidyman's script has some raw violence for the kinks, some dumb humor for audience relief, and lots of arch characterizations befitting the serio-comic-strip nature of the plot.\\"Murphy, Arthur D. (March 28, 1973). \\"Film Reviews: High Plains Drifter\\". Variety. 24. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a stylized, allegorical western of much chillingly paranoid atmosphere and considerable sardonic humor that confirms Eastwood's directorial flair. It's also a pretty violent business that won't disappoint the millions who flocked to the Leone westerns.\\"Thomas, Kevin (April 6, 1973). \\"Clint Back in Saddle in 'Drifter'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 17. Tom Zito of The Washington Post called it \\"an enjoyable, well-constructed work that suffers only from a slightly tedious tone that makes the film seem longer than its 105 minutes.\\"Zito, Tom (May 29, 1973). \\"Eastwood Again\\". The Washington Post. B9. The film had its share of detractors. Some critics thought Eastwood's directing derivative; Arthur Knight in Saturday Review remarked that Eastwood had \\"absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society\\".McGilligan, p. 223 Jon Landau of Rolling Stone concurred, noting \\"thematic shallowness\\" and \\"verbal archness\\"; but he expressed approval of the dramatic scenery and cinematography. Nigel Andrews of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"after Play Misty For Me, High Plains Drifter emerges as a disappointingly sterile exercise in style, suggesting that the first thing Eastwood should do as a director is forget the lessons he has learned from other film-makers and start to forge a convincing style of his own.\\" John Wayne criticized the film's iconoclastic approach; in a letter to Eastwood, he wrote, \\"That isn't what the West was all about. That isn't the American people who settled this country.\\"Peter Biskind, \\"Any Which Way He Can\\", Premiere, April 1993. The film was recognized by American Film Institute in 2008 on AFI's 10 Top 10 in the category \\"Nominated Western Film\\".  Home media  High Plains Drifter was released on DVD on February 24, 1998. High Plains Drifter made its Blu-Ray debut on October 15, 2013. Kino-Lorber reissued the film on October 27, 2020 with commentary tracks and new interviews.

Their first title was a strip poker game called \\"Foxy Poker\\" and was supposed to serve as a revenue stream for their future titles. Their first game as PopCap was Bejeweled, a gem-swapping game, which was supported on all major platforms and awarded by Computer Gaming World Hall Of Fame in 2002. The company expanded in 2005 with the acquisition of Sprout Games, a Seattle-based casual games developer company like PopCap Games, founded by James Gwertzman. Sprout Games is the creator of the game Feeding Frenzy. The Sprout team helped PopCap to make a sequel to the game, Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown, with Gwertzman becoming the Director of Business Development at PopCap. In early 2006, PopCap International was opened, based in Dublin, Ireland, working on product localization, mobile games development, marketing, sales and business development. PopCap began another round of expansion in July 2007 by buying other casual game developers including the creators of an online consumer portal, SpinTop Games. One week prior, the company acquired the Chicago-based development house Retro64, founded by Mike Boeh, which is best known for their retro-arcade action and puzzle titles. After these acquisitions, the PopCap logo was rebranded, dropping the \\"Games\\" portion. PopCap's premium games list on their website are mixed with other games from other developers/distributors.

This idiom is appropriate for comparison-based sorting when the ordering is actually based on the ordering of a certain property (the key) of the elements, where computing that property is an intensive operation that should be performed a minimal number of times. The Schwartzian transform is notable in that it does not use named temporary arrays. The Schwartzian transform is a version of a Lisp idiom known as decorate-sort-undecorate, which avoids recomputing the sort keys by temporarily associating them with the input items. This approach is similar to memoization, which avoids repeating the calculation of the key corresponding to a specific input value. By comparison, this idiom assures that each input item's key is calculated exactly once, which may still result in repeating some calculations if the input data contains duplicate items. The idiom is named after Randal L. Schwartz, who first demonstrated it in Perl shortly after the release of Perl 5 in 1994. The term \\"Schwartzian transform\\" applied solely to Perl programming for a number of years, but it has later been adopted by some users of other languages, such as Python, to refer to similar idioms in those languages. However, the algorithm was already in use in other languages (under no specific name) before it was popularized among the Perl community in the form of that particular idiom by Schwartz. The term \\"Schwartzian transform\\" indicates a specific idiom, and not the algorithm in general. For example, to sort the word list (\\"aaaa\\",\\"a\\",\\"aa\\") according to word length: first build the list ([\\"aaaa\\",4],[\\"a\\",1],[\\"aa\\",2]), then sort it according to the numeric values getting ([\\"a\\",1],[\\"aa\\",2],[\\"aaaa\\",4]), then strip off the numbers and you get (\\"a\\",\\"aa\\",\\"aaaa\\"). That was the algorithm in general, so it does not count as a transform. To make it a true Schwartzian transform, it would be done in Perl like this: @sorted = map { $_->[0] } sort { $a->[1] <=> $b->[1] or $a->[0] cmp $b->[0] } # Use numeric comparison, fall back to string sort on original map { [$_, length($_)] } # Calculate the length of the string @unsorted; The Perl idiom The general form of the Schwartzian transform is: @sorted = map { $_->[0] } sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] or $a->[0] cmp $b->[0] } map { [$_, foo($_)] } @unsorted; Here \`foo($_)\` represents an expression that takes \`$_\` (each item of the list in turn) and produces the corresponding value that is to be compared in its stead. Reading from right to left (or from the bottom to the top): * the original list \`@unsorted\` is fed into a \`map\` operation that wraps each item into a (reference to an anonymous 2-element) array consisting of itself and the calculated value that will determine its sort order (list of item becomes a list of [item, value]); * then the list of lists produced by \`map\` is fed into \`sort\`, which sorts it according to the values previously calculated (list of [item, value] ‚áí sorted list of [item, value]); * finally, another \`map\` operation unwraps the values (from the anonymous array) used for the sorting, producing the items of the original list in the sorted order (sorted list of [item, value] ‚áí sorted list of item). The use of anonymous arrays ensures that memory will be reclaimed by the Perl garbage collector immediately after the sorting is done. Efficiency analysis Without the Schwartzian transform, the sorting in the example above would be written in Perl like this: @sorted = sort { foo($a) cmp foo($b) } @unsorted; While it is shorter to code, the naive approach here could be much less efficient if the key function (called in the example above) is expensive to compute. This is because the code inside the brackets is evaluated each time two elements need to be compared. An optimal comparison sort performs O(n log n) comparisons (where n is the length of the list), with 2 calls to every comparison, resulting in O(n log n) calls to . In comparison, using the Schwartzian transform, we only make 1 call to per element, at the beginning stage, for a total of n calls to . However, if the function is relatively simple, then the extra overhead of the Schwartzian transform may be unwarranted. Example For example, to sort a list of files by their modification times, a naive approach might be as follows: function naiveCompare(file a, file b) { return modificationTime(a) < modificationTime(b) } // Assume that sort(list, comparisonPredicate) sorts the given list using // the comparisonPredicate to compare two elements. sortedArray := sort(filesArray, naiveCompare) Unless the modification times are memoized for each file, this method requires re-computing them every time a file is compared in the sort. Using the Schwartzian transform, the modification time is calculated only once per file. A Schwartzian transform involves the functional idiom described above, which does not use temporary arrays. The same algorithm can be written procedurally to better illustrate how it works, but this requires using temporary arrays, and is not a Schwartzian transform. The following example pseudo-code implements the algorithm in this way: for each file in filesArray insert array(file, modificationTime(file)) at end of transformedArray function simpleCompare(array a, array b) { return a[2] < b[2] } transformedArray := sort(transformedArray, simpleCompare) for each file in transformedArray insert file[1] at end of sortedArray History The first known online appearance of the Schwartzian transform is a December 16, 1994 posting by Randal Schwartz to a thread in comp.unix.shell Usenet newsgroup, crossposted to comp.lang.perl. (The current version of the Perl Timeline is incorrect and refers to a later date in 1995.) The thread began with a question about how to sort a list of lines by their \\"last\\" word: adjn:Joshua Ng adktk:KaLap Timothy Kwong admg:Mahalingam Gobieramanan admln:Martha L. Nangalama Schwartz responded with: #!/usr/bin/perl require 5; # New features, new bugs! print map { $_->[0] } sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] } map { [$_, /(\\\\S+)$/] } <>; This code produces the result: admg:Mahalingam Gobieramanan adktk:KaLap Timothy Kwong admln:Martha L. Nangalama adjn:Joshua Ng Schwartz noted in the post that he was \\"Speak[ing] with a lisp in Perl\\", a reference to the idiom's Lisp origins. The term \\"Schwartzian transform\\" itself was coined by Tom Christiansen in a follow-up reply. Later posts by Christiansen made it clear that he had not intended to name the construct, but merely to refer to it from the original post: his attempt to finally name it \\"The Black Transform\\" did not take hold (\\"Black\\" here being a pun on \\"schwar[t]z\\", which means black in German). Comparison to other languages Some other languages provide a convenient interface to the same optimization as the Schwartzian transform: * In Python 2.4 and above, both the function and the in-place method take a parameter that allows the user to provide a \\"key function\\" (like in the examples above). In Python 3 and above, use of the key function is the only way to specify a custom sort order (the previously supported comparator argument was removed). Before Python 2.4, developers would use the lisp-originated decorate‚Äìsort‚Äìundecorate (DSU) idiom, usually by wrapping the objects in a (sortkey, object) tuple. * In Ruby 1.8.6 and above, the abstract class (which includes s) contains a method, which allows specifying the \\"key function\\" (like in the examples above) as a code block. * In D 2 and above, the function is available. It might require less temporary data and be faster than the Perl idiom or the decorate‚Äìsort‚Äìundecorate idiom present in Python and Lisp. This is because sorting is done in-place, and only minimal extra data (one array of transformed elements) is created. * Racket's core \`sort\` function accepts a \`#:key\` keyword argument with a function that extracts a key, and an additional \`#:cache-keys?\` requests that the resulting values are cached during sorting. For example, a convenient way to shuffle a list is . * In PHP 5.3 and above the transform can be implemented by use of , e.g. to work around the limitations of the unstable sort algorithms in PHP. function spaceballs_sort(array& $a): void { array_walk($a, function(&$v, $k) { $v = array($v, $k); }); asort($a); array_walk($a, function(&$v, $_) { $v = $v[0]; }); } * In Elixir, the and methods allow users to perform a Schwartzian transform for any module that implements the protocol. * In Raku, one needs to supply a comparator lambda that only takes 1 argument to perform a Schwartzian transform under the hood: @a.sort( { $^a.Str } ) # or shorter: @a.sort(*.Str) would sort on the string representation using a Schwartzian transform, @a.sort( { $^a.Str cmp $^b.Str } ) would do the same converting the elements to compare just before each comparison.

Note the man standing in front of the formation, for scale. New Jersey, U.S.A. In structural geology, an anticline is a type of fold that is an arch-like shape and has its oldest beds at its core, whereas a syncline is the inverse of a anticline. A typical anticline is convex up in which the hinge or crest is the location where the curvature is greatest, and the limbs are the sides of the fold that dip away from the hinge. Anticlines can be recognized and differentiated from antiforms by a sequence of rock layers that become progressively older toward the center of the fold. Therefore, if age relationships between various rock strata are unknown, the term antiform should be used. The progressing age of the rock strata towards the core and uplifted center, are the trademark indications for evidence of anticlines on a geologic map. These formations occur because anticlinal ridges typically develop above thrust faults during crustal deformations. The uplifted core of the fold causes compression of strata that preferentially erodes to a deeper stratigraphic level relative to the topographically lower flanks. Motion along the fault including both shortening and extension of tectonic plates, usually also deforms strata near the fault. This can result in an asymmetrical or overturned fold. Terminology of different folds  Diagram showing constituent parts of an anticline An antiform can be used to describe any fold that is convex up. It is the relative ages of the rock strata that distinguish anticlines from antiforms. The hinge of an anticline refers to the location where the curvature is greatest, also called the crest. The hinge is also the highest point on a stratum along the top of the fold. The culmination also refers to the highest point along any geologic structure. The limbs are the sides of the fold that display less curvature. The inflection point is the area on the limbs where the curvature changes direction. The axial surface is an imaginary plane connecting the hinge of each layer of rock stratum through the cross section of an anticline. If the axial surface is vertical and the angles on each side of the fold are equivalent, then the anticline is symmetrical. If the axial plane is tilted or offset, then the anticline is asymmetrical. An anticline that is cylindrical has a well-defined axial surface, whereas non-cylindrical anticlines are too complex to have a single axial plane. An overturned anticline is an asymmetrical anticline with a limb that has been tilted beyond perpendicular, so that the beds in that limb have basically flipped over and may dip in the same direction on both sides of the axial plane. If the angle between the limbs is large (70‚Äì120 degrees), then the fold is an \\"open\\" fold, but if the angle between the limbs is small (30 degrees or less), then the fold is a \\"tight\\" fold. If an anticline plunges (i.e., the anticline crest is inclined to the Earth's surface), it will form Vs on a geologic map view that point in the direction of plunge. A plunging anticline has a hinge that is not parallel to the earth's surface. All anticlines and synclines have some degree of plunge. Periclinal folds are a type of anticlines that have a well-defined, but curved hinge line and are doubly plunging and thus elongate domes. Model of anticline. Oldest beds are in the center and youngest on the outside. The axial plane intersects the center angle of bend. The hinge line follows the line of greatest bend, where the axial plane intersects the outside of the fold. Folds in which the limbs dip toward the hinge and display a more U-like shape are called synclines. They usually flank the sides of anticlines and display opposite characteristics. A syncline's oldest rock strata are in its outer limbs; the rocks become progressively younger toward its hinge. A monocline is a bend in the strata resulting in a local steepening in only one direction of dip. Monoclines have the shape of a carpet draped over a stairstep. An anticline that has been more deeply eroded in the center is called a breached or scalped anticline. Breached anticlines can become incised by stream erosion, forming an anticlinal valley. A structure that plunges in all directions to form a circular or elongate structure is a dome. Domes may be created via diapirism from underlying magmatic intrusions or upwardly mobile, mechanically ductile material such as rock salt (salt dome) and shale (shale diapir) that cause deformations and uplift in the surface rock. The Richat Structure of the Sahara is considered a dome that has been laid bare by erosion. An anticline which plunges at both ends is termed a doubly plunging anticline, and may be formed from multiple deformations, or superposition of two sets of folds. It may also be related to the geometry of the underlying detachment fault and the varying amount of displacement along the surface of that detachment fault. An anticlinorium is a large anticline in which a series of minor anticlinal folds are superimposed. Examples include the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Purcell Anticlinorium in British Columbia and the Blue Ridge anticlinorium of northern Virginia and Maryland in the Appalachians, or the Nittany Valley in central Pennsylvania. Formation processes Anticline near Ehden, Lebanon Anticlines are usually developed above thrust faults, so any small compression and motion within the inner crust can have large effects on the upper rock stratum. Stresses developed during mountain building or during other tectonic processes can similarly warp or bend bedding and foliation (or other planar features). The more the underlying fault is tectonically uplifted, the more the strata will be deformed and must adapt to new shapes. The shape formed will also be very dependent on the properties and cohesion of the different types of rock within each layer. During the formation of flexural-slip folds, the different rock layers form parallel-slip folds to accommodate for buckling. A good way to visualize how the multiple layers are manipulated, is to bend a deck of cards and to imagine each card as a layer of rock stratum. The amount of slip on each side of the anticline increases from the hinge to the inflection point. Passive-flow folds form when the rock is so soft that it behaves like weak plastic and slowly flows. In this process different parts of the rock body move at different rates causing shear stress to gradually shift from layer to layer. There is no mechanical contrast between layers in this type of fold. Passive-flow folds are extremely dependent on the rock composition of the stratum and can typically occur in areas with high temperatures.  Economic significance  Anticlines, structural domes, fault zones and stratigraphic traps are very favorable locations for oil and natural gas drilling. About 80 percent of the world's petroleum has been found in anticlinal traps. The low density of petroleum causes oil to buoyantly migrate out of its source rock and upward toward the surface until it is trapped and stored in reservoir rock such as sandstone or porous limestone. The oil becomes trapped along with water and natural gas by a caprock that is made up of impermeable barrier such as an impermeable stratum or fault zone. Examples of low-permeability seals that contain the hydrocarbons, oil and gas, in the ground include shale, limestone, sandstone, and rock salt. The actual type of stratum does not matter as long as it has low permeability. Water, minerals and specific rock strata such as limestone found inside anticlines are also extracted and commercialized. Lastly, ancient fossils are often found in anticlines and are used for paleontological research or harvested into products to be sold. Notable examples=Asia Ghawar Anticline, Saudi Arabia, the structural trap for the largest conventional oil field in the world. Australia * Hill End Anticline, New South Wales, which is associated with deposits of gold. * Castlemaine Anticlinal Fold, Victoria, which is celebrated with a plaque that says, \\"This fine exhibit was disclosed when Lyttleton Street East was constructed in 1874. Saddle reefs occur in similar folds of the sandstones and slates on lower geological horizons.\\" Europe Harpea's Cave in southern France The Weald‚ÄìArtois Anticline is a major anticline which outcrops in southeast England and northern France. It was formed from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene, during the Alpine orogeny. North America Anticlines can have a major effect on the local geomorphology and economy of the regions in which they occur. One example of this is the El Dorado anticline in Kansas. The anticline was first tapped into for its petroleum in 1918. Soon after the site became a very prosperous area for entrepreneurs following World War I and the rapid popularization of motor vehicles. By 1995 the El Dorado oil fields had produced 300 million barrels of oil. The central Kansas uplift is an antiform composed of several small anticlines that have collectively produced more than 2.5 million barrels of oil. Another notable anticline is the Tierra Amarilla anticline in San Ysidro, New Mexico. This is a popular hiking and biking site because of the great biodiversity, geologic beauty and paleontological resources. This plunging anticline is made up of Petrified Forest mudstones and sandstone and its caprock is made of Pleistocene and Holocene travertine. The anticline contains springs that deposit carbon dioxide travertine that help to contribute to the rich diversity of microorganisms. This area also contains remains of fossils and ancient plants from the Jurassic period that are sometimes exposed through geological erosion. The Ventura Anticline is a geologic structure that is part of the Ventura oil fields, the seventh largest oil field in California that was discovered in the 1860s. The anticline runs east to west for 16 miles, dipping steeply 30‚Äì60 degrees at both ends. Ventura County has a high rate of compression and seismic activity due to the converging San Andreas Fault. As a result, the Ventura anticline rises at a rate of 5 mm/year with the adjacent Ventura Basin converging at a rate of about 7‚Äì10 mm/year. The anticline is composed of a series of sandstone rock beds and an impermeable rock cap under which vast reserves of oil and gas are trapped. Eight different oil bearing zones along the anticline vary greatly from 3,500 to 12,000 feet. The oil and gas formed these pools as they migrated upward during the Pliocene Era and became contained beneath the caprock. This oil field is still active and has a cumulative production of one billion barrels of oil making it one of the most vital historical and economic features of Ventura County.

Although currently releasing on their own label and having previously been signed to !K7 Records, they were one of the best-known acts from the Ninja Tune independent record label. They have released 11 albums, including two DJ mixes: one for Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series and the other for Fabric's Live Mix series. The Herbaliser's album Same As It Never Was was their first release on !K7 Records. Their latest album There Were Seven was released in September 2012, on their own label Department H. Jake Wherry has also recorded solo tracks as The Meateaters, released on the Parisian Big Cheese label, and has worked with The Propheteers. Ollie Teeba is also part of Soundsci with Jonny Cuba of Dynamic Syncopation, Audessey ex-Mass Influence, U-George The Hemisphere and Oxygen Sputnick Brown History Jake Wherry grew up in South West London and played guitar and bass in a number of jazz, funk and rock bands in his teenage years. During this time, he met Patrick Carpenter aka PC, later one of the DJs behind DJ Food, and through him became aware of the Ninja Tune label. Ollie Teeba, (real name Ollie Trattles) began DJing at 15 and played his first live sets to London audiences a year later. Wherry and Teeba met years later at Wherry's Traintrax studio, and began recording together, collaborating with DJ Malachi, Kaidi Tatham of Bugz in the Attic and Ralph Lamb of Easy Access Orchestra. They developed a jazzy instrumental style of hip hop, due to an absence of available rappers. They passed their recordings on to Ninja Tune bosses Matt Black and Jonathan More of Coldcut and were signed shortly thereafter. Inspired by the funk bands of previous decades, rather than performing simply with turntables, Jake Wherry decided to take a seven piece band on tour, which included Tatham, Lamb, Andrew Ross, Micah Moody Jnr and percussionist Patrick Dawes. The band performed in Toronto, Ontario om 1999.\\"Live Reviews: The Herbaliser September 8, 1999 The Phoenix, Toronto\\".

He acquired the nickname \\"Cone\\" from fellow band member Deryck Whibley in high school, because he frequently ate ice cream cones at lunch. Professional career He co- created the garage punk/garage rock side project The Operation M.D., with Todd Morse (of H2O), in which he goes by the name Dr. Dynamite. He plays bass and a bunch of other random instruments on the songs including lead vocals on a few tracks on both albums. The 1st album, We Have an Emergency was released in Canada and Japan exclusively in 2007. Operation M.D. then released their second album \\"Birds + Bee Stings\\" worldwide in late 2010 on their own label \\"Mouth To Mouth Music\\". He has also acted in many Sum 41 short films. For example, in \\"Basketball Butcher\\", he gets beaten up, killed and eaten by Steve Jocz due to beating him at basketball. He also played Dante the drug dealer in \\"1-800-Justice\\". He recently helped produce an album with Shelter With Thieves, a Canadian band from Halifax. The EP, entitled Confessions of a Toxic Generation, was nominated for 2 Nova Scotia Music Awards, for Group Recording and also Loud Recording. The band eventually won the Loud Recording award for the EP. In December 2009, McCaslin was also producing 5 songs for a new album by Canadian piano rock band The Greatest Invention (Formally ‚Äì Credible Witness), which eventually got released under Walter Senko.

It is best known through the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, writing in the late second century or early third century CE. Origins Map of Alexander the Great's empire and the route he and Pyrrho took to India Pyrrho of Elis (c. 360 ‚Äì c. 270 BCE) and his teacher Anaxarchus, both Democritean philosophers, traveled to India with Alexander the Great's army where Pyrrho was said to have studied with the magi and the gymnosophists,La√´rtius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers Book XI. and where he was influenced by Buddhist teachings, most particularly the three marks of existence. After returning to Greece, Pyrrho started a new line of philosophy now known as \\"Pyrrhonism.\\" His teachings were recorded by his student Timon of Phlius, most of whose works have been lost. Pyrrhonism as a school was either revitalized or re-founded by Aenesidemus in the first century BCE. Philosophy As with other Hellenistic philosophies such as Stoicism, Peripateticism and Epicureanism, eudaimonia is the Pyrrhonist goal of life. According to the Pyrrhonists, it is one's opinions about non-evident matters (i.e., dogma) that prevent one from attaining eudaimonia. As with Epicureanism, Pyrrhonism places the attainment of ataraxia (a state of equanimity) as the way to achieve eudaimonia. To bring the mind to ataraxia Pyrrhonism uses epoch√© (suspension of judgment) regarding all non-evident propositions. Pyrrhonists dispute that the dogmatists ‚Äì which includes all of Pyrrhonism's rival philosophies ‚Äì have found truth regarding non-evident matters. For any non-evident matter, a Pyrrhonist makes arguments for and against such that the matter cannot be concluded, thus suspending belief and thereby inducing ataraxia. Pyrrhonism is the earliest Western form of philosophical skepticism. In ancient literature Pyrrhonism was commonly referred to as \\"skepticism,\\" and Pyrrhonism was often lumped together with the similar philosophy of Academic Skepticism. Correspondingly their practitioners were called \\"skeptics\\" and \\"Academics.\\" Although Pyrrhonism's objective is eudaimonia, it is best known for its epistemological arguments, particularly the problem of the criterion, and for being the first Western school of philosophy to identify the problem of induction and the M√ºnchhausen trilemma. Pyrrhonists (or Pyrrhonist practice) can be subdivided into those who are ephectic (engaged in suspension of judgment), zetetic (engaged in seeking), or aporetic (engaged in refutation). Practice Pyrrhonist practice is for the purpose of achieving epoch√©, i.e., suspension of judgment. The core practice is through setting argument against argument. To aid in this, the Pyrrhonist philosophers Aenesidemus and Agrippa developed sets of stock arguments known as \\"modes\\" or \\"tropes.\\" The ten modes of Aenesidemus Aenesidemus is considered the creator of the ten tropes of Aenesidemus (also known as the ten modes of Aenesidemus)‚Äîalthough whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior Pyrrhonist works is unknown. Sextus Empiricus attributed them simply to the earlier Pyrrhonists. Diogenes Laeritius attributed them to Aenesidemus. The title of a lost work of Plutarch's (On Pyrrho's Ten Modes) appears to attribute the modes to Pyrrho.Mauro Bonazzi, \\"Plutarch on the Differences Between the Pyrrhonists and Academics\\", Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy, 2012 The tropes represent reasons for epoch√© (suspension of judgment). These are as follows: # \\"The same impressions are not produced by the same objects owing to the differences in animals.\\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 27 # The same impressions are not produced by the same objects owing to the differences among human beings.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 47 # The same impressions are not produced by the same objects owing to the differences among the senses.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 55 # Owing to the \\"circumstances, conditions or dispositions,\\" the same objects appear different. The same temperature, as established by instrument, feels very different after an extended period of cold winter weather (it feels warm) than after mild weather in the autumn (it feels cold). Time appears slow when young and fast as aging proceeds. Honey tastes sweet to most but bitter to someone with jaundice. A person with influenza will feel cold and shiver even though she is hot with a fever.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.61 # Based on positions, distances, and locations; for owing to each of these the same objects appear different; for example, the same porch when viewed from one of its corners appears curtailed, but viewed from the middle symmetrical on all sides; and the same ship seems at a distance to be small and stationary, but from close at hand large and in motion ; and the same tower from a distance appears round but from a near point quadrangular.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book I Section 118 Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.69-71 # ‚ÄúWe deduce that since no object strikes us entirely by itself, but along with something else, it may perhaps be possible to say what the mixture compounded out of the external object and the thing perceived with it is like, but we would not be able to say what the external object is like by itself.\\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.73 # \\"Based, as we said, on the quantity and constitution of the underlying objects, meaning generally by \\"constitution\\" the manner of composition.\\" So, for example, goat horn appears black when intact and appears white when ground up. Snow appears white when frozen and translucent as a liquid.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.77 # \\"Since all things appear relative, we will suspend judgement about what things exist absolutely and really existent.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 79 Do things which exist \\"differentially\\" as opposed to those things that have a distinct existence of their own, differ from relative things or not? If they do not differ, then they too are relative; but if they differ, then, since everything which differs is relative to something..., things which exist absolutely are relative.\\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 81 # \\"Based on constancy or rarity of occurrence.\\" The sun is more amazing than a comet, but because we see and feel the warmth of the sun daily and the comet rarely, the latter commands our attention.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 83 # \\"There is a Tenth Mode, which is mainly concerned with Ethics, being based on rules of conduct, habits, laws, legendary beliefs, and dogmatic conceptions.\\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 85 Superordinate to these ten modes stand three other modes: * I: that based on the subject who judges (modes 1, 2, 3 & 4). * II: that based on the object judged (modes 7 & 10). * III: that based on both subject who judges and object judged (modes 5, 6, 8 & 9) Superordinate to these three modes is the mode of relation.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, pp. 25‚Äì27 The five modes of Agrippa These \\"tropes\\" or \\"modes\\" are given by Sextus Empiricus in his Outlines of Pyrrhonism. According to Sextus, they are attributed only \\"to the more recent skeptics\\" and it is by Diogenes La√´rtius that we attribute them to Agrippa.Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. The five tropes of Agrippa are: # Dissent ‚Äì The uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general. # Progress ad infinitum ‚Äì All proof rests on matters themselves in need of proof, and so on to infinity, i.e., the regress argument. # Relation ‚Äì All things are changed as their relations become changed, or, as we look upon them from different points of view. # Assumption ‚Äì The truth asserted is based on an unsupported assumption. # Circularity ‚Äì The truth asserted involves a circularity of proofs. > According to the mode deriving from dispute, we find that undecidable > dissension about the matter proposed has come about both in ordinary life > and among philosophers. Because of this we are not able to choose or to rule > out anything, and we end up with suspension of judgement. In the mode > deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a > source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such > source, which itself needs another, and so ad infinitum, so that we have no > point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgement > follows. In the mode deriving from relativity, as we said above, the > existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to the subject judging > and to the things observed together with it, but we suspend judgement on > what it is like in its nature. We have the mode from hypothesis when the > Dogmatists, being thrown back ad infinitum, begin from something which they > do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a > concession. The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of > the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object > under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish > the other, we suspend judgement about both.Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrh≈çneioi > hypotyp≈çseis i., from Annas, J., Outlines of Scepticism Cambridge University > Press. (2000). With reference to these five tropes, that the first and third are a short summary of the earlier Ten Modes of Aenesidemus. The three additional ones show a progress in the Pyrrhonist system, building upon the objections derived from the fallibility of sense and opinion to more abstract and metaphysical grounds. According to Victor Brochard ‚Äúthe five tropes can be regarded as the most radical and most precise formulation of skepticism that has ever been given. In a sense, they are still irresistible today.‚ÄùBrochard, V., The Greek Skeptics. Criteria of action Pyrrhonist decision making is made according to what the Pyrrhonists describe as the criteria of action holding to the appearances, without beliefs in accord with the ordinary regimen of life based on: # the guidance of nature, by which we are naturally capable of sensation and thought # the compulsion of the path√© by which hunger drives us to food and thirst makes us drink # the handing down of customs and laws by which we accept that piety in the conduct of life is good and impiety bad # instruction in arts and craftsSextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism Book I Chapter 11 Section 23 Skeptic sayings The Pyrrhonists devised several sayings (Greek Œ¶Œ©ŒùŒ©Œù) to help practitioners bring their minds to epoche.Sextus Empiricus Outlines of Pyrrhonism Book I Chapter 18 Among these are: * Not more, nothing more (a saying attributed to DemocritusSextus Empiricus Outlines of Pyrrhonism Book II Chapter 30) * Non-assertion * Perhaps, it is possible, maybe * I withhold assent * I determine nothing (Montaigne created a variant of this as his own personal motto, \\"Que s√ßay-je?\\" ‚Äì \\"what do I know?\\") * Everything is indeterminate * Everything is non-apprehensible * I do not apprehend * To every argument an equal argument is opposed Similarities with Buddhism The summary of Pyrrho's teaching preserved in the \\"Aristocles passage\\" shows signs of Buddhist philosophical influence. This text is: Adiaphora, astathmƒìta, and anepikrita are strikingly similar to the Buddhist three marks of existence, demonstrating that Pyrrho's teaching is based on what he learned in India, which is what Diogenes La√´rtius reported. Other similarities between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism include a version of the tetralemma among the Pyrrhonist maximsSextus Empricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism Book 1, Section 19 and a parallel with the Buddhist Two Truths Doctrine.McEvilley, Thomas (2002). The Shape of Ancient Thought. Allworth Communications. ., p. 474 In Pyrrhonism the Buddhist concept of \\"ultimate\\" (paramƒÅrtha) truth corresponds with truth as defined via the criterion of truth, which in Pyrrhonism is seen as undemonstrated, and therefore nothing can be called \\"true\\" with respect of it being an account of reality. The Buddhist concept of \\"conventional\\" or \\"provisional\\" (sa·πÅv·πõti) truth corresponds in Pyrrhonism to truth defined via the Pyrrhonist criterion of action, which is used for making decisions about what to do. Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy is particularly similar to Pyrrhonism.Adrian Kuzminski, Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism 2008 According to Thomas McEvilley this is because Nagarjuna was likely influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India.Thomas McEvilley, The Shape of Ancient Thought 2002 pp499-505 Texts Except for the works of Sextus Empiricus and Diogenes La√´rtius, the texts about ancient Pyrrhonism have been lost, except for a summary of Pyrrhonian Discourses by Aenesidemus, preserved by Photius, and a summary of Pyrrho's teaching preserved by Eusebius, quoting Aristocles, quoting Pyrrho's student Timon, in what is known as the \\"Aristocles passage.\\" Symbols Balance scales in equal balance are the symbol of Pyrrhonism The balance scale, in perfect balance, is the traditional symbol of Pyrrhonism. The Pyrrhonist philosopher Montaigne adopted the image of a balance scale for his motto.Sarah Bakewell, How to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer 2011 p 127 Influence Pyrrhonism so influenced Arcesilaus, the sixth scholarch of the Platonic Academy that Arcesilaus reformed the teaching of the Academy to be nearly identical to PyrrhonismSextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism Book I Chapter 33 thus initiating the Academic Skepticism of the Middle Academy. The Pyrrhonist school influenced and had substantial overlap with the Empiric school of medicine. Many of the well-known Pyrrhonist teachers were also Empirics, including: Sextus Empiricus, Herodotus of Tarsus, Heraclides, Theodas, and Menodotus. However, Sextus Empiricus said that Pyrrhonism had more in common with the Methodic school in that it ‚Äúfollow[s] the appearances and take[s] from these whatever seems expedient.‚ÄùSextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism I.237, trans. Etheridge (Scepticism, Man, and God, Wesleyan University Press, 1964, p. 98). Because of the high degree of similarity between the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy and Pyrrhonism, particularly as detailed in the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, Thomas McEvilley suspects that Nagarjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. Pyrrhonism regained prominence in the late fifteenth century. The publication of the works of Sextus Empiricus played a major role in Renaissance and Reformation thought. Philosophers of the time used his works to source their arguments on how to deal with the religious issues of their day. Major philosophers such as Michel de Montaigne, Marin Mersenne, and Pierre Gassendi later drew on the model of Pyrrhonism outlined in Sextus Empiricus‚Äô works for their own arguments. This resurgence of Pyrrhonism has been called the beginning of modern philosophy. Pyrrhonism also affected the development of historiography. Historical Pyrrhonism emerged during the early modern period and played a significant role in shaping modern historiography. Historical Pyrrhonism questioned the possibility of any absolute knowledge from the past and transformed later historians' selection of and standard for reliable sources. A revival of the use of \\"Pyrrhonism\\" as a synonym for \\"skepticism\\" occurred during the seventeenth century.Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, page 7, section 23. Fallibilism is a modern, fundamental perspective of the scientific method, as put forth by Karl Popper and Charles Sanders Peirce, that all knowledge is, at best, an approximation, and that any scientist always must stipulate this in her or his research and findings. It is, in effect, a modernized extension of Pyrrhonism.Powell, Thomas C. \\"Fallibilism and Organizational Research: The Third Epistemology\\", Journal of Management Research 4, 2001, pp. 201‚Äì219. Indeed, historic Pyrrhonists sometimes are described by modern authors as fallibilists and modern fallibilists sometimes are described as Pyrrhonists.\\"Ancient Greek Skepticism\\" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

Written by John Howard Lawson, the film is about a notorious French jewel thief hiding in the labyrinthine native quarter of Algiers known as the Casbah. Feeling imprisoned by his self- imposed exile, he is drawn out of hiding by a beautiful French tourist who reminds him of happier times in Paris. The Walter Wanger production was a remake of the successful 1937 French film P√©p√© le Moko, which derived its plot from the Henri La Barthe novel of the same name. Algiers was a sensation because it was the first Hollywood film starring Hedy Lamarr, whose beauty became the main attraction for film audiences. The film is notable as one of the sources of inspiration to the screenwriters of the 1942 Warner Bros. film Casablanca, who wrote it with Hedy Lamarr in mind as the original female lead. Charles Boyer's depiction of Pepe le Moko inspired the Warner Bros. animated character Pep√© Le Pew. In 1966, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Premise Pepe le Moko (Boyer) is a notorious thief, who, after his last great heist, escaped from France to Algeria. Since his escape, le Moko became a resident and leader of the immense Casbah, or \\"native quarter\\", of Algiers. French officials who arrive insisting on Pepe's capture are met with unfazed local detectives, led by Inspector Slimane (Calleia), who are biding their time. Meanwhile, Pepe begins to feel increasingly trapped in his prison-like stronghold, a feeling which intensifies after meeting the beautiful Gaby (Lamarr), who is visiting from France. His love for Gaby soon arouses the jealousy of Ines (Gurie), Pepe's Algerian mistress. Cast Sigrid Gurie, Charles Boyer, and Hedy Lamarr * Charles Boyer as Pepe le Moko * Sigrid Gurie as Ines * Hedy Lamarr as Gaby * Joseph Calleia as Inspector Slimane * Alan Hale as Grandpere * Gene Lockhart as Regis * Walter Kingsford as Chief Inspector Louvain * Paul Harvey as Commissioner Janvier * Stanley Fields as Carlos * Johnny Downs as Pierrot * Charles D. Brown as Max * Robert Greig as Giraux * Leonid Kinskey as L'Arbi * Joan Woodbury as Aicha * Nina Koshetz as Tania Cast notes * Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr made her American film debut in Algiers, although she was already known for her appearance in the 1933 Czech film Ecstasy, in which she appeared nude. Howard Dietz, the head of MGM's publicity department, quizzed her about this, and she admitted to having appeared nude. \\"Did you look good?\\", he asked. \\"Of course!\\" \\"Then it's all right\\", he said, \\"no damage has been done.\\" Production Walter Wanger, the producer of Algiers, purchased the rights to the French film Pepe le Moko in order to remake it, and bought all prints of the film to prevent it from competing with his film in the U.S. Wanger used most of the music from the French film in this remake as well as background sequences. Algiers The first version of the script for Algiers was rejected by the Breen Office because the leading ladies were both portrayed as \\"kept women,\\" and because of references to prostitution, the promiscuity of the lead character, and his suicide at the end of the film, which was directed to be changed to his being shot instead of killing himself. Backgrounds and exteriors for the film were shot in Algiers by a photographer named Knechtel, who was based in London. These photographs were integrated into the film by cinematographer James Wong Howe. MGM had considered Ingrid Bergman, Dolores del R√≠o, and Sylvia Sidney for the female lead, but, as Boyer tells it, he met Hedy Lamarr at a party and introduced her to Wanger as a possibility for his co-lead. Cromwell says about Lamarr that she could not act. \\"After you've been in the business for a time, you can tell easily enough right when you meet them. I could sense her inadequacy, Wanger could sense it, and I could see Boyer getting worried even before we started talking behind Hedy's back...Sometimes the word personality is interchangeable with presence although they aren't the same thing. But the principle applies, and Hedy also had no personality. How could they think she could become a second Garbo?...I'll take some credit for making her acting passable but can only share credit with Boyer fifty-fifty.\\" Boyer did not enjoy his work on Algiers. \\"An actor never likes to copy another's style,\\" he said, \\"and here I was copying Jean Gabin, one of the best.\\" Director Cromwell \\"would run a scene from the original and insist we do it exactly that way ‚Äî terrible, a perfectly terrible way to work.\\" Cromwell, however, said that Boyer \\"never appreciated how different his own Pepe was from Gabin's. Boyer showed something like genius to make it different. It was a triumph of nuance. The shots are the same, the dialogue has the same meaning, but Boyer's Pepe and Gabin's Pepe are two different fellows but in the same predicament.\\" Box office The film earned a profit of $150,466.

Algiers was adapted for the October 8, 1939, presentation of the CBS Radio series The Campbell Playhouse. The hour-long adaptation starred Orson Welles and Paulette Goddard, with Ray Collins taking the role of Inspector Slimane. The film was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on two broadcasts of Lux Radio Theatre. Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr reprised their roles in the broadcast July 7, 1941. Boyer starred with Loretta Young in the broadcast December 14, 1942. Film Algiers was remade in 1948 as Casbah, a musical produced by Universal Pictures, starring singer Tony Martin and Yvonne De Carlo. The film was directed by John Berry. A 1949 Italian parody titled Tot√≤ Le Moko featured the comedian Tot√≤. In popular culture The 1938 film Algiers was most Americans' introduction to the picturesque alleys and souks of the Casbah. It was also the inspiration for the 1942 film Casablanca, written specifically for Hedy Lamarr in the female lead role. However, MGM refused to release Hedy Lamarr. Charles Boyer's invitation to \\"Come with me to ze Casbah,\\" did not appear in the film, but still became comedians' standard imitation of Boyer, much like \\"Play it again, Sam\\" for Humphrey Bogart, \\"Judy, Judy, Judy\\" for Cary Grant and \\"You dirty rat\\" for James Cagney- all apocryphal lines. Boyer hated being reduced in that way, believing that it demeaned him as an actor. In some part, the lampoon of Boyer spread, owing to its use by Looney Tunes cartoon character Pep√© Le Pew, himself a spoof of Boyer as P√©p√© le Moko. The amorous skunk used \\"Come with me to ze Casbah\\" as a pickup line. In 1954, the Looney Tunes cartoon The Cat's Bah, which specifically spoofed Algiers, the skunk enthusiastically declared to Penelope Pussycat, \\"Do not come with me to ze Casbah.

She was the 300 ton purpose-built flagship of the London Company and a highly unusual vessel for her day, given that she was the first single timbered, merchantman built in England, and also the first dedicated emigration ship. Sea Ventures wreck is widely thought to have been the inspiration for William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. The Virginia Company  The proprietary of the London Company had established the settlement of Jamestown in Virginia in 1607, and delivered supplies and additional settlers in 1608, raising the English colony's population to 200, despite many deaths. The entire operation was characterized by a lack of resources and experience. The Company's fleet was composed of vessels that were less than optimal for delivering large numbers of passengers across the Atlantic Ocean, and the colony itself was threatened by starvation, diseases, and warfare with native peoples. The colony at Jamestown seemed doomed to meet the same fate as the Roanoke Colony and the Popham Colony, two earlier failed English attempts to settle in North America, unless there was a major relief effort, despite the delivery of supplies in 1608 on the First and Second Supply missions of Captain Christopher Newport. Yet the investors of the London Company expected to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon the leaders of Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay the cost of the voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony. It fell to the third president of the Council to deliver a reply. Ever bold, Captain John Smith delivered what must have been a wake-up call to the investors in London. In what has been termed \\"Smith's Rude Answer\\", he composed a letter, writing (in part): Smith did begin his letter with something of an apology, saying \\"I humbly intreat your Pardons if I offend you with my rude Answer\\". There are strong indications that those in London comprehended and embraced Smith's message. Their Third Supply mission was by far the largest and best equipped. They even had the newly constructed purpose-built flagship Sea Venture placed in the most experienced hands of Christopher Newport. Construction The Company built Sea Venture, probably in Aldeburgh, as England's first purpose-designed emigrant ship and in response to the inadequacy of its vessels. She measured \\"300 tunnes\\", cost ¬£1,500, and differed from her contemporaries primarily in her internal arrangements. Her guns were placed on her main deck, rather than below decks as was then the norm. This meant that the ship did not need double-timbering, and she may have been the first single-timbered, armed merchant ship built in England. The hold was sheathed and furnished for passengers. She was armed with eight demi-culverins, eight sakers, four falcons, and four arquebuses. The ship was launched in 1609, and her uncompleted journey to Jamestown appears to have been her maiden voyage. Loss On 2 June 1609, Sea Venture set sail from Plymouth as the flagship of a seven-ship fleet (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown, Virginia as part of the Third Supply, carrying 500 to 600 people (it is unclear whether that number includes crew, or only settlers). On 24 July, the fleet ran into a strong storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. A pinnace, Catch, went down with all aboard lost.[needs reference: said to have been \\"a ketch\\" in tow by the 'Sea Venture' and intentionally cast adrift in the hurricane; why do we suppose anyone at all was still on board?] Sea Venture however, fought the storm for three days. Comparably sized ships had survived such weather, but Sea Venture had a critical flaw in her newness: her timbers had not set. The caulking was forced from between them, and the ship began to leak rapidly. All hands were applied to bailing, but water continued to rise in the hold. The ship's starboard-side guns were reportedly jettisoned to raise her buoyancy, but this only delayed the inevitable. The Admiral of the Company himself, Sir George Somers, was at the helm through the storm. When he spied land on the morning of 25 July, the water in the hold had risen to , and crew and passengers had been driven past the point of exhaustion. Somers deliberately had the ship driven onto the reefs of Discovery Bay, in what later proved to be eastern Bermuda, in order to prevent its foundering. This allowed 150 people, and one dog, to be landed safely ashore. The survivors, including several company officials (Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, the ship's captain Christopher Newport, Sylvester Jordain, Stephen Hopkins, later of Mayflower, and secretary William Strachey), were stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months. Deliverance and Patience Sylvester Jordain's A Discovery of the Barmudas, 1610 During the time on Bermuda, the survivors constructed two new ships, the pinnaces Deliverance and Patience, from local Bermuda cedar, which was a wood especially prized by regional ship builders because it was as strong as oak, yet lighter. This misnamed juniper species could be worked with immediately after felling, and it has high resistance to rot and wood worms. Materials salvaged from the beached wreck were also used, especially her rigging.Forests filled with 'cedar' were everywhere on Bermuda, and the colony became a major ship building center after the dissolution of the Somers Isles Company in 1684. Export of Bermuda cedar for ship building had been severely restricted by the local assembly in 1627, but shipbuilding had denuded much of Bermuda's landscape by the 1830s. They were constructed between late fall 1609 and early spring 1610 under the guidance of Admiral Somers and James Davis, Captain of the \\"Gift of God\\" who possessed considerable ship building knowledge. These ships represented the second and third pinnaces built in the English colonies in the Americas, the first being the 1607‚Äì08 construction of Virginia at the Popham Colony in New England. The original plan was to build only one vessel, Deliverance, but it soon became evident that she would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the food that was being sourced on the islands. While the new ships were being built, Sea Ventures longboat was fitted with a mast and sent under the command of Henry Ravens to find Virginia, but the boat and its crew were never seen again. Finally, under the command of Newport, the two ships with 142 survivors set sail for Virginia on 11 May 1610, and arrived at the Jamestown settlement on the 23rd, a journey of less than two weeks.Christopher Newport had an extraordinary career as privateer and then ship captain for the Virginia Company of London. He captained the flagship Susan Constant that planted the first settlers in Virginia, landing on April 26, 1607. He then commanded John and Francis, and Phoenix, two ships that comprised the First Supply, and delivered 120 additional colonists to Jamestown on January 8, 1608. As captain of the 150 ton Mary Margaret, Newport also led the Second Supply to Jamestown. The Second Supply landed in September 1608 and delivered 70 colonists that included the first women from England. Adventure never stopped with Christopher Newport. On a voyage to Indonesia for the British East India Company, he died in Java in 1617. Two men, Carter and Waters, were left behind; they had been convicted of unknown offences, and fled into the woods of Bermuda to escape punishment and execution. On reaching Jamestown, only 60 survivors were found of the 500 or so who had preceded them. Many of these were themselves dying, and Jamestown was quickly judged to be nonviable. Everyone then boarded Virginia, Deliverance, and Patience, which set sail for England. The timely arrival of another relief fleet, bearing Governor Baron De La Warre, granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were relanded at the colony, but there was still a critical shortage of food. In the fall of 1610, Admiral Somers returned to Bermuda in Patience to obtain wild pigs and food that had been stockpiled there. Unfortunately, Somers died in Bermuda from a \\"surfeit of pork\\" and the pinnace, captained by his nephew Mathew Somers, returned directly to Lyme Regis in Dorset, England with the body in order to claim his inheritance.Overall, the food and supplies brought by the Third Supply were not adequate. 80% of the colonists would die during the Starving Time of 1610. Afterwards, survivors at Jamestown had boarded Deliverance and Patience and were sailing downstream to the ocean when they met yet another resupply fleet. Lord Delaware was this expedition's leader and he turned the distraught settlers back. He had brought a doctor but food supplies remained inadequate. Wreck Captain John Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda), showing St. George's Town and related fortifications, including the Castle Islands Fortifications. Sea Venture sat atop the reefs off Gate's Bay long enough to be stripped of all useful parts and materials, not only by her crew and passengers, but by subsequent settlers; what was left of her eventually disappeared beneath the waves. Two of her guns were salvaged in 1612 and used in the initial fortification of Bermuda (one was placed on Governor's Island, opposite Paget's Fort, the other on Castle Island). After the wreck's submergence, her precise location was unknown until rediscovered by sport divers Downing and Heird in October 1958, still wedged into a coral reef. There was little left of the ship or its cargo. Despite the lack of artifacts to be found, she was positively identified in 1959, in time for the 350th anniversary of the wrecking. Subsequent research uncovered one gun and cannonball, along with shot for small arms. There were also some Spanish jars, stoneware from Germany and ceramics and cooking pots much like what had been found excavating Jamestown.Making landfall at Jamestown (2005) Accessed 2017-01-22 In fiction * The wrecking is believed to have inspired William Shakespeare's The Tempest.

Setos are mostly Seto-speaking Orthodox Christians of Estonian nationality. The Seto language (like Estonian and Finnish) belongs to the Finnic group of the Uralic languages. The Setos seek greater recognition, rather than having their language considered a dialect of Estonian. Along with Orthodox Christianity, vernacular traditional folk religion is widely practiced and supported by Setos. There are approximately 15,000 Setos around the world. The bulk of Setos, however, are found in the Setomaa region, which is divided between south-eastern Estonia (P√µlva and V√µro counties) and the north-western Russian Federation (Pechorsky District of Pskov Oblast). Setos are an officially protected ethnic minority of Pskov Oblast. The culture of Setos blossomed in the early 20th century when many national societies of Setos were organized. In 1905 the number of Setos reached its peak. After the proclamation of independence of Estonia its authorities adopted a policy of Estonification of its population, which eventually led to virtual disappearance of Setos as a distinctive linguistic entity of Estonia. In Russia, due to the influence of Estonian language schools, high rates of mixed marriages, and emigration to Estonia, the number of Setos drastically decreased as well.  Ethnic history  A Seto wedding in V√§rska in 1912. The bride and groom are dressed in traditional period wedding attire. Attendants of the 1912 V√§rska wedding in traditional Seto dress. Before A.D. 600 the whole of Setomaa was within the vast northern Finnic lands of the indigenous Finno-Ugric peoples. The first significant event that separated Setos from Estonians was forced conversion of the latter into Catholicism in the 13th century, while Setos who lived in Novgorod Land remained pagans. In the 15th century Setos were converted into Orthodox Christianity but kept their vernacular beliefs. Later elements of Catholic culture were brought to the Setos by Estonian colonists, while in Estonia itself they nearly disappeared after the Lutheran reformation in Estonia.  The border issue  In 1920, with the peace treaty of Tartu, the area Setomaa (Setoland) was ceded to the newly created Republic of Estonia and it was included into Petseri County. As a result of World War II, the Republic of Estonia was forcibly annexed to the Soviet Union. And on August 15, 1944 the border between the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was revised by Moscow authorities to what it is now. The issue became topical as the Republic of Estonia was restored in the borders of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 and a national border was established soon afterwards. The establishment of the border brought about the division of Setomaa between two countries for the first time in history. Setos in Radaja Seto Festival in 2016  Seto leelo  In 2009, the Setos' polyphonic style of folk singing, called leelo, was added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. Seto leelo is usually performed by women, dressed in traditional clothing. During the Seto Kingdom Day celebration, the winning lead singer of a leelo group is awarded the title of \\"Mother of Song\\".  Representative organisations  The Seto Congress, a body comprising representatives of Seto villages and organisations, is regularly convened every three years and elects a permanent Council of Elders. The Society for Seto Congress was a member of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages. The Setomaa federation of municipalities in Estonia (Setomaa Valdade Liit, comprising the communes of Mikit√§m√§e, V√§rska, Merem√§e and Misso) publishes the newspaper Setomaa, partly in the Seto language, partly in Estonian. Also, every year the Seto choose a steward of King Peko (sootska or √ºlebtsootska) for the so-called Kingdom of Setomaa at the annual celebration of the Day of the Kingdom (Seto Kuningriigi p√§iv), a local festival that rotates among the bigger Seto villages.BBC News, In Pictures: The Seto People The office is largely ceremonial and has been held by local activists, politicians, entrepreneurs and scholars.

Background In December 1783, George III engineered the dismissal of the Fox‚ÄìNorth coalition, which he hated, and appointed William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister. Pitt had very little personal support in the House of Commons and the supporters of Charles James Fox and Lord North felt that the constitution of the country had been violated. The doctrine that the government must always have a majority in the House of Commons was not yet established and Fox knew he had to be careful. On 2 February 1784 Fox carried a motion of no confidence which declared \\"That it is the Opinion of this House, That the Continuance of the present Ministers in their Offices is an Obstacle to the Formation of such an Administration as may enjoy the Confidence of this House, and tend to put an End to the unfortunate Divisions and Distractions of the Country\\" by 223 to 204. Pitt remained in office, and government supporters ensured petitions and resolutions of borough corporations were presented to Parliament to encourage members to back Pitt, and slowly Members changed sides. By 1 March, Fox's motion which concluded by \\"beseech[ing] His Majesty, that He would be graciously pleased to lay the Foundation of a strong and stable Government, by the previous Removal of His present Ministers\\" was carried but only by 201 to 189. A week later, a more strongly worded motion threatening the withholding of supply was also passed‚Äîbut only by 191 to 190. Fox thereafter declined to push motions, as his base continued to crumble. Pitt meanwhile decided to go to the country and on 24 March, Parliament was prorogued and on the following day the Parliament first elected in 1780 was dissolved. Course of the election The election was fought very much as a national campaign around the questions of the fall of the Fox‚ÄìNorth government and whether or not Pitt should continue in office, rather than a series of local campaigns, which was more common for 18th century British elections. Thanks to a combination of patronage and bribes paid by HM Treasury, many small pocket boroughs returned Pitt-supporting MPs as widely expected. Additionally, in the constituencies decided by large electorates there was massive support for candidates who backed Pitt. Many of Fox's supporters were forced either to withdraw or to make deals with their opponents to avoid electoral defeat. In the county constituencies only one Fox supporter was elected in a contest, although others returned due to local electoral pacts. Those Members who had remained in opposition, refusing to go over to support Pitt, who failed to return to the House of Commons as a consequence, became known as \\"Fox's Martyrs\\" in reference to John Foxe's Book of Martyrs (although the majority were supporters of North). The first day's polling, 30 March, saw thirteen government supporters and four opponents returned. By the conclusion of the fifth day (3 April), there were already more than 150 government Members and a lead of fifty over the supporters of the coalition. The government achieved an overall majority on 15 April and the election ended on 10 May. Notable contests=University of Cambridge \\"THE DEVONSHIRE, or Most Approved Method of Securing Votes\\", by Thomas Rowlandson, 1784. Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire canvassing. The contests involving both Pitt and Fox attracted particular attention. Pitt had long wished to be a Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge and had failed to be elected when he stood for the seat in the 1780 general election. Now he was returned at the top of the poll and would hold the seat for the rest of his life. Westminster Fox was one of the two sitting members for the constituency of Westminster, which had the largest electorate of any in the country and a great deal of prestige. His position there was central to his claim to be representing the people. He stood against two Pitt supporters for the constituency's two seats; both sides spent heavily, campaigned bitterly, allegedly libelled and slandered their opponents relentlessly and resorted to all kinds of tactics, including Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, touring the streets and, according to the opposition, kissing many voters to induce them to vote for Fox. Even George, Prince of Wales, campaigned for Fox. At the conclusion of polling on 17 May, Fox had narrowly succeeded, with 6,233 votes to Sir Cecil Wray's 5,998. However, Pitt's supporters then demanded a scrutiny of the votes and the Returning Officer therefore did not make the return. A scrutiny in a constituency as large as Westminster was an enormously time-consuming process; Fox, suspecting this might happen, had already arranged for his return for the Tain Burghs, which had elected him on 26 April, so that he would not be out of the House during such a scrutiny. The process did not show unexpectedly large numbers of unqualified voters and as the months went by it looked more and more like a political delaying tactic; on 4 March 1785 the House of Commons finally put an end to it by ordering the Returning Officer to declare the result. A London constable, Nicholas Casson, was killed during the election. Ipswich The election results were originally recorded as being 490 votes for William Fowle Middleton, 297 votes for John Cator and 7 votes for Charles Crickitt. However Crickitt filed a petition against Cator's election, accusing him of bribery. The petition was handled by Bamber Gascoyne, who was both Crickitt's political agent and godfather. John Strutt acted on Crickitt's behalf on the House of Commons committee which investigated the allegation. Crickitt also had the support of the Duke of Cumberland. Caor's election was declared void and Crickett was seated in June 1784.

He attended Gulu High School and Boroboro Teacher Training College, after which he taught at a primary school. Luwum converted to Christianity in 1948, and in 1949 he went to Buwalasi Theological College. In 1950 he was attached to St. Philip's Church in Gulu. He was ordained a deacon in 1953, and the following year he was ordained a priest. He served in the Upper Nile Diocese of Uganda and later in the Diocese of Mbale. In 1969 he was consecrated Bishop of the Diocese of Northern Uganda at Gulu. After five years he was appointed Archbishop of the Metropolitan Province of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga (in Zaire), becoming the second African to hold this position.Gordon Landreth, Heroes ‚Äì Janani Luwum Arrest and death Archbishop Luwum was a leading voice in criticising the excesses of the Idi Amin regime that assumed power in 1971.

Historically in Cumberland, it is the only coastal town in the Lake District National Park. It is located at the estuary of three rivers: the Esk, Mite and Irt. History Walls Castle, Ravenglass The town dates back to at least the 2nd century, when it was an important naval base for the Romans. The Latin name of the settlement is the subject of scholarly debate: believed by some experts to have been Tunnocellum, it is often named Glannoventa. It occupied the most southerly point of the Cumbrian coastal defence system, which can be seen as an extension of Hadrian's Wall and the western extremity of the Roman frontier World Heritage Site. Ravenglass was occupied by the Romans for over 300 years and had a Roman garrison (castra) of 500 soldiers. The town was a regional supply point for much of north-western Roman Britain, with a road from Ravenglass over the Hardknott Pass to the Roman forts at Hardknott and Ambleside.http://cambridgemilitaryhistory.com/2015/04/30/ruins-of-a-roman- bath-and-the-foundations-of-a-castle-ravenglass-and-muncaster/ The location is featured in The Fort at River's Bend, a book in Jack Whyte's A Dream of Eagles (Camulod Chronicles) series, and is also mentioned briefly in Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy under the name Clannoventa. Today, there are few Roman remains, with the notable exception of a bath house, known locally as Walls Castle. This is one of the largest remaining Roman structures in England, originally covering an estimated area of by and with walls up to high, though only one end is now visible. Excavations of the rest of the foundations have since been covered and are not visible. The property is now maintained by English Heritage. Approximately a mile's walk from the bath house is Muncaster Castle, which it is believed was built partly with the remains of a Roman fort which was located near Ravenglass. The grade II listed Muncaster War Memorial, designed by Edwin Lutyens, sits between Muncaster and Ravenglass. 'Renglas' appears in charters and other records of the late 12th century. In 1208 King John granted Richard de Lucy, Earl of Egremont a charter for a market at Ravenglass on Saturdays and a yearly fair on the festival of St. James, 5 August. Ravenglass is reputed to be the birthplace of Saint Patrick. Etymology There are multiple explanations of the origin of the name Ravenglass. One is that it may be derived from, or from words equivalent to Welsh yr afon glas, meaning \\"the greenish or blueish river\\". The name may also be of Norse-Irish origin, containing the Irish personal name Glas and meaning \\"Glas's part or share\\". The terminal element might be Gaelic glas, \\"small stream\\". Also suggested is derivation from the Old Norse personal name Hrafnkell, suffixed with Old Norse √≥ss, \\"estuary\\". Governance Ravenglass is within the Copeland UK Parliamentary constituency. Trudy Harrison is the Member of parliament. Before Brexit, its residents were covered by the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. Attractions Tourist attractions include Muncaster Castle and the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway. Transport Ravenglass is served by Ravenglass railway station on the Cumbrian Coast railway line, with trains to Carlisle and Lancaster. This station is also a terminus of the narrow-gauge Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, which runs inland up Eskdale. This serves both as a tourist attraction and as local transport during its operating season. Ravenglass is connected by a minor road to the nearby A595 trunk road. It also has minor tracks running northwards and southwards via tidal fords, which are unsuitable for normal motor vehicles.

Biography  M√ºller was born in Reval (present-day Tallinn), at that time a city with a strong Baltic German community in the Governorate of Estonia, part of the Russian Empire. He became a chamber musician in Saint Petersburg before he was twenty. At the same time, he was constantly striving to improve the clarinet, with new types of keywork. At the time, the standard clarinet used flat brass plates covered in soft leather to cover the toneholes. Since these leaked air, the number of them had to be kept to a minimum, which meant that notes outside the main scale of the clarinet (accidentals) had to be obtained by complicated fingerings which were difficult to play quickly and rarely were in tune. Clarinets would have five or six keys, the bare minimum to obtain an acceptable chromatic scale. M√ºller's solution was the stuffed pad, originally made of kid leather stuffed with felt. These pads would \\"bulge\\", such that in combination with countersunk tone holes, would close the keyholes sufficiently tight to permit the use of an increased number of keys making the \\"clarinette omnitonique\\" possible. In addition to the fingering system and felt pads, M√ºller is also known as the inventor of metal ligature (that replaced twine, string and wire, widely used in the past and still used today in German- speaking regions), which are used today in almost all single-reeded woodwind instruments.Lawson, Colin. The Cambridge Companion to the Clarinet. Cambridge University Press, 1995. M√ºller went on to work in Dresden, Berlin and Leipzig, where he specialized in the basset-horn, a type of low-pitched clarinet. In 1809, M√ºller performed to great acclaim on a clarinet made to his own specifications. In that same year, M√ºller moved to Paris, gained the support of a wealthy patron, (Mr.) Marie-Pierre Petit, and started mass-producing clarinets. In 1812, M√ºller presented his new 13-key clarinet with air-tight pads to the Paris Conservatoire, but they weren't impressed. Nevertheless, M√ºller's new clarinet with fully chromatic range became popular and became the standard clarinet for much of the 19th century. It was further developed into the √ñhler system, the prevalent system in Germany today. He was also, before the famous Hyacinthe Klos√©, principal clarinet at the Th√©√¢tre Italien in Paris.

The supply missions also resulted in the colonization of Bermuda as a supply and way-point between the colony and England. The Jamestown colonists initially chose the fort's location because it was favorable for defensive purposes. Although some of them did some farming, few of the original settlers were experienced farmers, and as hunters they quickly exhausted the area's supply of small game. To make matters worse, the most severe drought in 700 years occurred between 1606 and 1612. Consequently, the colonists quickly became dependent upon trade with the Native Americans and periodic supply from England for their survival. Captain Christopher Newport was tasked with the duty of leading the first three re-supply missions back to Jamestown. However, it was not until a fourth mission under Lord Thomas West that the settlement was finally able to establish both defensive and food security. Original mission State Quarter The London Company organized a for-profit expedition to establish a settlement in the Virginia territory in late 1606. The expedition consisted of three ships, which set sail on December 20, 1606 from Blackwall, with 105 men and boys and 39 crew-members. There were no women on the first ships. The ships in this fleet were: *Discovery, 20 tons, with Captain John Ratcliffe and 21 people *Godspeed, 40 tons, with Captain Bartholomew Gosnold (serving as vice-admiral) and 52 people *Susan Constant - sometimes known as Sarah Constant - (flagship), 120 tons, with Captain Christopher Newport and 71 people  Voyage  The fleet headed south-west towards the Azores. Early in the voyage, on February 13, 1607, near the Canary Islands, Captain John Smith was charged with mutiny, and Newport had him arrested and planned to execute him upon arrival in the Caribbean (and later in Virginia). Passing Martinique on March 23, they also visited Dominica, on March 28, Nevis, and St. Croix, where they replenished their water and food. By April 6, 1607, the fleet arrived at the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico, where they stopped for provisions before continuing their journey. They landed on Mona and Monito Islands on April 7, and left on April 9, the last stop before the new world.THE VIRGINIA COLONY Accessed 2017-01-18 After an unusually long voyage of 144 days, and the death of only one passenger, they made landfall on April 26, 1607 at the southern edge of the mouth of what they named the James River on the Chesapeake Bay. A party of men then explored the area and had a minor conflict with some local \\"Indians\\", so the colonists moved north. On May 14, 1607, they finally chose Jamestown Island (at that time a peninsula), further upriver and on the northern shore, for their settlement, as it was a location that could be easily defended from attacks by other European states, notably the Dutch Republic, France, and Spain. However, after the long voyage, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day. Further, the worst drought in 700 years occurred in the area between 1606 and 1612, affecting the Jamestown colonist and local Powhatan tribe's ability to produce food and obtain a safe supply of water.Blanton, Dennis B. \\"Drought as a Factor in the Jamestown Colony, 1607-1612.\\" Historical Archaeology 34, no. 4 (2000): 74-81. http://www.jstor.org/stable/25616853. In addition to settling, the early colonists were expected to make a profit for the owners of the Company. The early settlers were excited by the apparent availability of gold, and from the outset settlers attempted to produce timber for export, given the seemingly inexhaustible supply within Virginia's virgin forests. However, they could not devote much time to developing commodity products, as they were too busy trying to survive. On June 22, 1607, Newport sailed back for London with Susan Constant and Godspeed carrying a load of supposedly precious minerals, leaving behind the 104 colonists and Discovery (to be used in exploring the area). John Smith (1607) Using the ship left to the colony, Smith undertook three exploratory voyages of the Chesapeake Bay and along the various rivers seeking a supply of food for the colonists in June, July, and August 1607. However, while leading one food-gathering expedition in December 1607, this time up the Chickahominy River west of Jamestown, his men were set upon by Pamunkey natives, and Smith was captured. After being \\"saved\\" by Pocahontas, Smith returned alone to Jamestown just in time for the \\"First Supply\\", in January 1608. First supply mission Arriving back in London on August 12, 1607, Newport delivered a letter from the council alongside his cargo of \\"gold\\" (which was quickly determined to be iron pyrite). He was then put in charge of the urgently needed re-supply mission, containing a few provisions and more than 70 new colonists. The ships were: *John and Francis with Captain Christopher Newport *Phoenix with Francis Nelson Voyage The first re- supply fleet, tracing the same route as the original fleet, arrived at the colony on January 2, 1608. Upon his return, Newport found that the effects of the lack of planning and lack of skills amongst the original colonists, combined with Powhatan attacks, had quickly reduced the original settlement to only 38 survivors. However, despite replenishing the colony's supplies, the two ships also brought an additional 120 men (settlers and crew), as recorded later by Smith. This proved troublesome, particularly when a few days later the fort caught fire destroying most of the existing buildings, food, and supplies. Despite original intentions to grow food locally and trade with the local natives, the barely surviving colonists became increasingly dependent upon external supply missions. After expanding fortifications, rebuilding shelters, and placing armed men to defend crops from native attacks, Newport felt he had sufficiently re-secured the settlement by the end of winter. Accordingly, he departed again for England on April 10, 1608, with another hold full of \\"gold\\". In his absence, the meagre food supplies quickly ran low, and although Native Americans brought some food, Smith wrote that \\"more than half of us died\\".  John Smith (1608)  Zuniga map of the Jamestown area, probably derived from Smith's 1608 sketch Smith ventured into the Chesapeake Bay twice more in 1608, in the months between the first and second supply missions, charged by the Company to search for gold and a passage to the Pacific Ocean. The first trip lasted from June 2 to July 21; a second, longer expedition spanned July 24 to September 7. Searching for badly needed food, he covered an estimated 3,000 miles (4,828 km), producing a map (see image) that was of great value to local explorers for more than a century. This time he successfully traded for food with the Nansemonds along the Nansemond River, and several other groups. He had mixed results dealing with the various other tribes, most of whom were affiliated with the Powhatan Confederacy. These explorations were later commemorated in the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, established in 2006.  Second supply mission  Statue of Christopher Newport at the university bearing his name Newport and the ships arrived back in London on May 21, 1608, and despite another disappointment with false gold, an additional re-supply trip was quickly organized. Urgently needed supplies and 70 new settlers (see list below) were gathered, including Thomas Graves, Thomas Forrest and Forrest's wife \\"Mistress Forrest and Anne Burras her maide\\" (the first women known to have come to Jamestown). Also included were the first non-English settlers. The Company recruited these as skilled craftsmen and industry specialists: soap-ash, glass, lumber milling (wainscot, clapboard, and ‚Äòdeal‚Äô ‚Äî planks, especially soft wood planks) and naval stores (pitch, turpentine, and tar). Among these additional settlers were eight \\"Dutch-men\\" (probably German or German- speakers), Polish and Slovak craftsmen, who had been hired to help develop and manufacture profitable export products. William Volday (Wilhelm Waldi), a Swiss German mineral prospector, was also among those who arrived in 1608. His mission was seeking a silver reservoir that was believed to be within the proximity of Jamestown. Some of the settlers were the artisans who built a glass furnace which became the first factory in America. The ships were: * Mary Margaret with Captain Christopher Newport Passenger manifest A passenger manifest of those in the second fleet was recorded, in Volume 1 of The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles by Captain John Smith, published 1624. Colonial History by Captain John Smith 1624 Voyage Newport's instructions were to search for any survivors of the Lost Colony of Roanoke, resume exploring for gold mines, and stage a \\"coronation\\" of Powhatan, making him a \\"sub-king\\" under James I. On October 1, 1608 the supply ship arrived following a journey of approximately three months. Following his orders, Newport searched for the Lost Colonists and gold mines, and attempted a coronation, all without success. He then returned to England, this time not with iron pyrite, but with products of the new world including: \\"clapboard, wainscot, pitch, tarre, glasse, frankincense, and sope ashes\\". He arrived in London in mid-January 1609, and despite all these efforts, profits from these early exports were not sufficient to meet the expenses and expectations of the investors back in England, and no New-World silver or gold had been discovered, as earlier imagined. Despite these disappointments, the need for another, ideally much larger, supply mission was conveyed to the leaders of the Company. Samuel Argall In early 1609, Captain Samuel Argall, as an employee of the London Company, was commissioned to develop a shorter, more direct route for sailing from England across the Atlantic Ocean to the colony at Jamestown. He was also ordered to fish for sturgeon on the voyage. Rather than following the normal practice of going south to the tropics and west with the trade winds, Argall, aboard Mary and John, sailed west from the Azores to the Bermuda area, then almost due west to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. This voyage took only nine weeks and six days, including two weeks becalmed (compared to the three to five months of previous fleets), enabling the English to save on provisions and to also avoid hostile Spanish ships. Upon his arrival at Jamestown, Argall found the colonists in dire straits, since in April, an infestation of rats had been discovered, along with dampness, which had destroyed all their stored corn. He resupplied the colony with all the food and wine he could spare (which Smith bought on credit), and also brought the news that the Company was being reorganized and was sending more supplies and settlers to Jamestown along with a new governor. Argall then returned to England at the end of the summer of 1609. His unexpected help was significant, in that it came to the colony at one of the most critical moments in its history, as it preceded the Starving Time, and without the provisions Argall had left, the colony may have been totally destroyed. Third supply mission Virginia pinnace approaching the Virginia shore, Seth Eastman c. 1850 On May 23, 1609, King James issued a new charter for the Company to allow for reorganization and additional capital. Company treasurer Thomas Smythe soon organised a major supply mission, with the goal to rescue the failing settlement. It consisted of nine ships, between 500 and 600 passengers, including women and children, livestock and enough provisions to last a year in \\"the largest fleet England has ever amassed in the West\\". Newport, as vice-admiral, commanded Sea Venture, the new flagship of the Company, which had been specially built for the purpose. It was considerably larger than the other eight ships, and carried a large proportion of the supplies intended for the colony. Also aboard the new flagship were Admiral Sir George Somers, William Strachey, Sylvester Jourdain, Ralph Hamor, and Sir Thomas Gates, people notable in the early history of English colonization in North America. On June 2, 1609, after a number of delays, the fleet departed Plymouth. The ships were: * Blessing with Captain Gabriel Archer and Captain Adams * Catch (pinnace) with Master Matthew Fitch * Diamond (second largest) with Captain John Ratcliffe and Captain King * Falcon (third largest) with Captain John Martin and Master Francis Nelson * Lion with Captain Webb * Sea Venture (largest ship and flagship) with Captain Christopher Newport * Swallow with Captain Moone and Master Matthew Somers (nephew of Sir George) * Unitie with Captain Wood and Master Robert Pitt * Virginia (pinnace; first ship built in Colonial America) with Captain James Davis and Master Davis\\" Voyage The fleet stayed together for seven weeks as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean, but 32 yellow fever victims from two ships were buried overboard, and the \\"London plague\\" broke out on Diamond - diseases that were transplanted to the New World, and probably contributed to the colony's high mortality rate during the Starving Time. On Saint James Day, July 25, 1609, the fleet ran into a massive 'tempest', believed to have been a hurricane, which lasted for three days, and became separated. After the storm, Blessing, Falcon, Lion, and Unitie came together and headed for Virginia, \\"falling into the James River\\" on August 11. Diamond appeared a few days later, and Swallow a few days after that (around August 18, 1609). Virginia arrived some six weeks later on October 3, 1609. All in all, seven ships arrived safely at Jamestown, delivering most of the colonists, but relatively few supplies. In the colony, there was no word of the fate of Sea Venture (which had been wrecked in Bermuda) or Catch (which had been lost at sea), including the supplies, passengers, and leaders who had been aboard them. Blessing, Diamond, Falcon, and Unitie soon returned to England on October 14, 1609, to advise of Jamestown's plight carrying Captain Samuel Argall, an injured John Smith, and 30 young men sent from England but rejected by the colony. However, no further supply ships from England arrived that year, nor the following spring. In the absence of strong leadership, and most of the supplies, all of which had been aboard Sea Venture, the existing and newly- brought settlers at James Fort were ill-prepared to survive the winter, resulting in the siege and \\"Starving Time\\" of 1609-1610, when most of the inhabitants perished. Sea Venture During the storm, Sea Venture was soon separated from the seven other vessels of the third supply fleet and began taking on water through her new caulking. On July 28, 1609, and with bailing efforts failing, Admiral Sir George Somers had the ship deliberately driven onto the reefs at Discovery Bay in eastern Bermuda to prevent her sinking.Woodward, Hobson. A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest. Viking (2009) pp. 32‚Äì50. The 150 passengers and crew members all landed safely, but the ship was now permanently disabled. Over a period of nine months, the survivors built two new pinnaces ‚Äî Deliverance and Patience ‚Äî using local Bermuda cedar and hardware salvaged from the wreck. The original plan was to build only one vessel, Deliverance, but it soon became evident that one would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the supplies that were being sourced on the islands. During the building, Sea Venture's longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown, but neither it, nor its crew, were ever seen again. The ships were provisioned with salvaged and local goods - from Bermuda the crew were able to gather pork from feral pigs, sweet potatoes, and onions, figs and olives from stock grown first in Bermuda. The vessels were both readied by May 10, 1610, and sailed on the 20th. By May 23 they had reached Comfort Point. The survivors of Sea Venture, led by Sir Thomas Gates (the new governor) and Sir George Somers, assumed they would find a thriving colony in Virginia. Instead, they found the colony in ruins and practically abandoned. Of the 500 or so colonists living in Jamestown in the autumn, they found only 60 survivors with many of those also sick or dying.Bryan, Corbin Braxton. The Church at Jamestown in Clark, W. M., ed. Colonial Churches in the Original Colony of Virginia. 2d. ed. Richmond, VA: Southern Churchman Company, 1908. . p. 20.Beverley, Robert. The History of Virginia in Four Parts. Richmond, VA: J. W. Randolph, 1855. . 2d revised edition originally published London: 1722. p. 26. Worse yet, many supplies intended for Jamestown had been lost in Bermuda, and Gates and Somers had brought along with them about 140 additional people, but only a small food supply. The decision was soon made to abandon James Fort, and on June 7, 1610, everyone boarded Deliverance, Discovery, Patience, and Virginia to return to England, and began to sail down the James River. Francis West In the interval between the departure of Smith for England, and the arrival of the Sea Venture survivors, George Percy became President of the council in Jamestown. He however accomplished little while in charge, other than to order to construction of Fort Algernon at Old Point Comfort. To secure food, he had sent Francis West and James Davis up the Chesapeake Bay (in Virginia) to obtain corn from the Patawomeckin 1609, but instead of delivering that food to the starving colony, West sailed directly back to England, and avoided the Starving Time by abandoning Percy and the colonists. Percy wrote later that when West brought his ship loaded with corn back to Point Comfort, the captain in charge of Fort Algernon told everyone about the hunger at Jamestown, and instead of hurrying upstream to feed the colonists, \\"Captain Weste, by the persuasion, or rather by the enforcement, of his company hoised up sails and shaped by their course directly for England, and left us in that extreme misery and want.\\" \\"Fourth\\" supply mission Depiction of the arrival of West at Jamestown During the period that Sea Venture suffered its misfortune, and its survivors were struggling in Bermuda to continue on to Virginia, the publication of Captain John Smith's books of his adventures in England sparked a resurgence of interest and investment in the Company. There was also a religious call in England by clergymen and others to support the stranded colonists. Another mission was soon prepared, equipped with additional colonists, a doctor, food, and supplies, and heading this group was the new governor, Francis West's older brother, Thomas West, who also recruited and equipped an armed contingent of 150 men at his own expense. The ships were: *Blessing of Plymouth * De La Warr with Admiral Thomas West and Samuel Argall * Hercules of Rye Voyage West and his fleet departed London on March 12, 1610, from England on April 1, and arrived on the James River on June 9, just as the existing colonists were sailing downriver to leave Virginia. Intercepting them about 10 miles (16 km) downstream from Jamestown near Mulberry Island, the new governor directed the ships to return to the abandoned colony. This was not a popular decision at the time, but it was to prove a turning point in the English colonization of North America. Subsequent supply missions * After the return to Jamestown, and with the population now at around 375 people, Captain Robert Tyndall was directed to take Virginia to catch fish in the Chesapeake Bay between Cape Henry and Cape Charles. * On June 19, 1610, Admiral Somers, not wanting to be subordinate to West, departed for Bermuda (known later as the \\"Somers Isles\\") aboard Patience, accompanied by Captain Argall on Discovery, with the intention of gathering more food, including fish, sweet potatoes and live pigs for Jamestown. Blown north towards Newfoundland, the ships became separated in thick fog. Argall attempted fishing before returning, reaching the Chesapeake on August 31, while Somers, who had continued on to Bermuda, became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on November 2, 1610 at age 56 before completing the mission. Captain Matthew Somers, now in charge of Patience, and probably keen to secure his uncle's inheritance, then disobeyed orders by returning to Lyme Regis in England with the preserved body of his uncle. However, by doing so, he was also able to provide an update to the Company on the status of the colony. * On July 25, 1610 Hercules with Captain Adams was sent from Jamestown for supplies. It returned \\"soon after\\" the departure of Thomas West, who had left Virginia for the island of Mevis in De La Warr on April 7, 1611. Blessing and Hercules returned to England in September 1610 with Gates, Newport, Adams and \\"others from Virginia\\". * When the Jamestown garrison again required provisions in December 1610, Captain Argall was dispatched to the Potomac River and procured maize and furs there from Iopassus (Japazaws), a Patawomeck town. * Newport, now vice Admiral of Virginia, and Sir Thomas Dale, lieutenant Governor or Marshall of Virginia, left England in March 1611 for Jamestown with a fleet of three ships, 300 people, and supplies including horses and livestock. Sailing via Dominica and Puerto Rico, they arrived at Point Comfort on the night of May 22, 1611. The ships were Elizabeth, Prosperous, and Starr with Newport. * The last major fleet of this time, under Sir Thomas Gates, lieutenant General of Virginia, sailed from England towards the end of May 1611 with three ships, 280 men, 20 women, 200 cattle, and \\"many swine and other necessaries\\". They sailed via the West Indies, and arrived in Virginia on August 30, 1611. The ships were Sara, Swan, and Trial. Impact By 1610, with the end of the Starving Time, the majority of the colonists who had arrived at the Jamestown settlement had died and its economic value was negligible with no active exports to England and very little internal economic activity. Only financial incentives including a promise of more land to the west from King James I to investors financing the new colony kept the project afloat. The timely arrival of Lord West resulted in a renovation of the settlement, and a counter-offensive against the Powhatan Confederacy, whose refusal to trade and siege of the fort had threatened the food security of the colony. The campaign ended the Powhatan siege and resulted in the marriage of Pocahontas and John Rolfe (a Sea Venture survivor) which introduced a short truce between the English and the Powhatan Confederacy. This allowed the English to fully secure the colony's fortifications and housing, expand its farming, develop a network of alliances with other Indian nations, and establish a series of outlying smaller settlements. Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, and the Company, in due, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir Thomas Dale continued to keep strict discipline (see Dale's Code), with Sir Thomas Smythe in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send to Jamestown. By 1612, Rolfe would also successfully pioneer new strains of hybrid tobacco that would allow the colony to cultivate and export its own cash crop, thereby ensuring a new form of financial security.

It flows for approximately 25 km (15.5 miles) from its source in the Scafells range of mountains to its estuary at Ravenglass. It is one of two Rivers Esk in Cumbria, and not to be confused with the Border Esk which flows on the Scottish side of the border. It rises in the Sca Fell range of mountains at a height of 800 metres, just below Esk Hause, the mountain pass between the fells of Great End and Esk Pike. The infant river then flows southerly through wild and picturesque countryside receiving many streams flowing off the Scafell range, the most significant of which are Calfcove Gill and Little Narrowcove Beck. The river makes several leaps over waterfalls including the Esk Falls before being joined by its first major tributary Lingcove Beck at Lingcove Bridge. Within a few miles the Esk passes Brotherilkeld Farm, which formerly belonged to the monks of Furness Abbey, at this point it is joined by Hardknott Beck and the river now flows westerly through the farmland of Eskdale and is accompanied by the motor road which goes down the valley. The Esk continues past the small villages of Boot and Eskdale Green. Just after Boot, the significant tributary of Whillan Beck joins the river from the north east, the beck being the outflow from Burnmoor Tarn, four km to the north. Continuing in a south westerly direction the Esk flows beneath Hinning House bridge, three km east of Ravenglass, at this point the river becomes tidal. Shortly after passing the Muncaster Castle Estate the river reaches the Irish Sea at Ravenglass. At its estuary the Esk is joined by the rivers Irt and Mite. The estuary has evolved over the centuries, the Esk and Irt were earlier separated by a shingle bank formed by the sea, dunes were formed when they eventually joined together. The estuary dunes are the location of the Eskmeals nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) over an area of 165.5 acres (67 hectares). The SSSI is made up of mostly coastal dunes and salt marsh attracting breeding birds and a profusion of flowers.The Cumbria Directory Gives details of estuary formation and Eskmeals Nature Reserve. The dunes are also the site of the Eskmeals Range, a shooting range owned by the MOD) and operated by the contractor Qinetiq.LTPA website Gives details of Eskmeals range. The estuary is crossed by the Cumbrian Coast Line railway on the Eskmeals viaduct just south of Ravenglass.Old Cumbria Gazetteer Gives details of Eskmeals Viaduct. Etymology In his book The Origins Of English Place Names, P.H. Reaney says that the river's name is derived from the Brythonic word *Iska (abounding in fish) and cognate with the modern Welsh word Pysg (fishes). This derivation applies to many similarly named rivers throughout Britain including the Axe, Exe and Usk, with the names evolving local distinctions over the centuries.A Survey of the History of English Placenames Gives details of etymology (second paragraph). Angling The Esk has a reputation as a very good fishing river; it offers fine angling for sea trout and salmon. It was made famous by the writer and broadcaster Hugh Falkus, who lived in the Esk valley and used the river as a basis for many of his books and films.Angling World Wide Gives details of Angling on the Esk. Many of the angling locations on the Esk are privately owned, although the Millom Angling Association offers daily tickets for visitors at its sites on the Muncaster Castle Estate and Brant Rake.Millom Anglers Details fishing sites.

The Eurohound is typically crossbred from the Alaskan husky group and any of a number of pointing breeds (\\"pointers\\").  History  A Eurohound is a cross between an Alaskan husky and German Shorthaired Pointer. Scandinavia was the first to use Eurohounds in competitive sled dog racing.Stephanie Little Wolf, \\"A Deeper History of the Origins of the Alaskan Husky\\", http://www.sleddogcentral.com/features/little_wolf/alaskans.htm The Eurohound is not purebred, and is not a breed of dog, but a crossbreed, its parents being deliberately crossed in order to produce progeny with specific traits. The Eurohound need cooler weather to run, the European Canicross Championships is held from September to May to avoid heat.  Crossbreeding  Rather than inbreeding similar-looking dogs in order to create a new breed with a consistent appearance, Eurohound racers crossbreed for specific working traits and health. Crossbreeding includes breeding between two established breeds, with two tightly bred but unrelated gene pools, and breeding the first generation cross back to one of the purebred breeds.Crossbreeding in cattle Crossbreeding is also done for the purpose of heterosis (hybrid vigor). The dogs most often used for Eurodog crosses are purebred German Shorthaired Pointers (and English Pointers), other pointers, and Alaskan huskies (Gareth Wright lines primarily) from tightly bred sprint dog lines used for racing. A first-generation Eurohound cross (fifty percent pointing breed, fifty percent husky) have short coats, suitable for sprint races, which don't involve resting or sleeping on the trail. When the first-generation cross is crossed again with the Alaskan husky, the resulting generation can have thicker coats, suitable for longer-distance teams. Most distance mushers prefer the pointer genetics to only be 1/8 in a dog for maximum performance. This then reduces the Eurohound influence, and dogs should be termed Alaskan Husky crosses or mixed hounds. The Eurohound is sleeker than a husky and can hit speeds of 25 miles per hour. The term \\"Eurohound\\" was coined by Ivana Nolke, to distinguish the European racing dogs being imported into Alaska. Greyhound crossbred with German Shorthaired Pointers are known as \\"greysters\\" and popular for dryland racing, and limited-class snow racing.  Appearance and breeds  Fairly common features of fifty percent crosses are half-dropped ears, black with white blazing as shown in the photo, or solid with patches of spots. Some completely spotted dogs appear as well. Once the percentage of pointer drops, the dogs start to look more like Alaskan huskies. The dogs have a similar coat to German Shorthair Pointer and looks like standard hunting dogs. The Alaskan husky sprint dog has been bred for performance, not appearance. The German Shorthaired Pointer and English Pointer gene pool too were bred for performance particularly hunting; the Scandinavian pointers from which the first Eurohounds came had been used historically for sled dog racing and hunting. The Eurohound was good for mushing and became widely used.  Terminology  Although more accurately and traditionally called \\"crossbred\\", crossbred dogs are sometimes referred to incorrectly as \\"hybrid\\", as a fashionable trend. A hybrid animal most often refers to one with parentage of two separate species or subspecies (but sometimes even genera), differentiating it from crossbred animals, which have parentage of the same species. All dogs, including crossbreeds, are even of the same subspecies Canis lupus familiaris, and so crossbred dogs are not a hybridization with another species.

It is the nation's third-oldest college hockey rink, behind Northeastern University's Matthews Arena and Princeton University's Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. Further, it is the second-oldest arena in the ECAC Hockey League, behind Princeton's rink. Until the opening of the Times Union Center in Albany in 1990, it was the largest arena in the Capital Region. Origins Popular legend holds that Houston Field House was previously an airplane or dirigible hangar for the United States armed forces during World War II. In reality, it originated as a warehouse for the United States Navy in Davisville, Rhode Island. Following the war, the federal government established the Veterans Education Facilities Program (VEFP) to help colleges build facilities to handle the increased enrollment of veterans returning from the war. One aspect of the VEFP was to offer buildings designated as \\"war surplus\\" to colleges and academic institutions who applied for them. Originally, the RPI Board of Trustees, led by then-RPI President Dr. Livingston W. Houston, sought a hangar from the VEFP in order to establish a \\"sports-civic arena\\" for the RPI campus and the city of Troy. Unfortunately, hangars were not considered \\"war surplus.\\" An investigation sponsored by the Board of Trustees discovered the warehouse facility in Rhode Island and applied under the VEFP to bring it to campus, despite the fact that its original design was not satisfactory for the creation of an arena. The VEFP underwrote both the cost of transporting the warehouse from Davisville to Troy and the cost to reassemble it upon its arrival. RPI, however, spent nearly $500,000 on its own to redesign the warehouse to its own specifications, including the re-fabrication of initial materials and the purchase of new materials. Construction was originally planned to be completed by June 1948; however, inclement weather throughout the project pushed completion back 16 months to October 1949. On October 13, Houston officially opened the building as the RPI Field House as part of a ceremony honoring the Institute's 125th anniversary. Early history A month later, on November 12, 1949, the RPI Field House hosted its first event, an Interfraternity Ball, with music performed by Elliot Lawrence and his Orchestra. On December 3, 1949, the first sporting event in the Field House's history took place as RPI defeated the New York State Maritime Academy 55-43 in basketball. A large impetus for the construction of the Field House was to create a home for the school's ice hockey team, which had played its first games in 1901 at Van Schaick Pond in nearby Cohoes, New York, and later played in various other locations in Cohoes and Albany, New York. From 1912 to 1938 (with the exception of 1937), the team played on an outdoor rink built every winter on campus along Sage Avenue, at the current location of Anderson Field. After the 1938 season, the team went into hiatus. Houston, an RPI alumnus who played hockey for RPI during his school years, originally sought to build the Field House as a means of returning hockey to campus. On January 10, 1950, the \\"Engineers\\" under legendary head coach Ned Harkness played their first game at home since 1938, dropping an 8-2 contest to Middlebury. However, and possibly thanks to the construction of the Field House, Harkness would lead the Engineers to an NCAA championship only four years later in 1954. Two weeks after the first hockey game, the RPI Field House hosted its first commencement ceremony, on January 27, 1950. General Omar Bradley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave the first commencement address. On December 27, 1951, the Field House hosted the first annual RPI Invitational Tournament. The first tournament featured 8 schools playing 12 games over three days, and was won by Brown University. The following year, the tournament was cut to 4 teams playing a round-robin schedule over 3 days, which remained the tournament's format until 1982, when it gained a 2nd-day consolation game/championship game format. The RPI Invitational was the nation's oldest in-season invitational tournament in college hockey until its final iteration in 2010. Throughout the 1950s, several RPI sporting events were held at the RPI Field House, including basketball, tennis, wrestling, and even pistol and rifle shooting. In March 1959, the Field House hosted the NCAA tournament known today as the Frozen Four. North Dakota won its first of several NCAA championships, defeating Michigan State, Boston College, and St. Lawrence. Three of the tournament's four games went into overtime. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the RPI Field House was often referred to as \\"The Madison Square Garden of Upstate New York\\". In its first two decades, it played host to more than 300 theatrical and musical events, countless hockey games, and several commencement ceremonies. Hockey line As the popularity of hockey grew, tickets became hot items among students. Owing to its origins as a military warehouse, most views were obstructed at least some angle between the rink and the seats due to large support columns that held up the Field House's roof. This led to the birth of what is known simply as \\"hockey line.\\" Groups of people ‚Äì usually members of various fraternities and sororities ‚Äì take a place outside of the RPI Student Union building. Traditionally, the line began sometime during late July or early August prior to the beginning of Fall classes and continued until tickets went on sale in mid-September. People in line are allowed to buy up to eight tickets and can have people hold their place in line while they eat or go to class. Students set up beds, couches, television sets, and, more recently, computers and video games to pass the time as someone occupies each place in line on a 24-hour basis. Following the Engineers' 1985 national championship victory, the Epsilon Iota chapter of the Psi Upsilon fraternity set a hockey line record by beginning the line on the very next day ‚Äì March 31, 1985 ‚Äì and continuing the line through the summer until tickets went on sale on September 25, 1985 -- besting the previous record of 33 days with 178 days. Renovation and rejuvenation In 1978, a new tradition started that continues today ‚Äì the annual Big Red Freakout! event. This event fills the Field House with thousands of screaming fans, and there is a giveaway each year. At the 1978 Commencement ceremonies, it was announced that the RPI Field House would be renamed Houston Field House in honor of former president Livingston W. Houston, who had died the previous winter. Houston had been RPI's 11th president from 1943 to 1958, and was president when the Field House was built. 1983 brought several changes to the Field House. The Institute spent $2.5 million to renovate the building during the summer, including a support renovation which allowed the removal of all but four of the columns. Some think the view obstruction caused by the original columns gave rise to \\"hockey line\\" and that column removal led to the demise of \\"hockey line\\", but popularity of hockey was at least as large a factor. Indeed, \\"hockey line\\" reached its peak several years after the 1983 renovations. New scoreboards were installed, and the ice surface was lengthened to a full NHL size. In 1984, the NCAA tournament returned to Houston Field House for the first time since 1959 as the Engineers took on North Dakota. The Fighting Sioux, coming in as heavy underdogs, upset the homestanding Engineers on consecutive nights, ending the Engineers national title hopes. The next season, the Field House would host its final two NCAA tournament games as RPI dispatched Lake Superior State on their way to their second NCAA championship. Today's NCAA tournament games all take place at neutral ice sites with a minimum capacity higher than that of the Field House. During the mid-1980s, Houston Field House was part of a vibrant boxing scene in the Capital District. Mike Tyson fought twice at the venue in 1986, but Tyson's rise to the heavyweight championship at the end of the year helped lead to a decline, and boxing has not been featured at Houston Field House in recent years. The 1987 Big Red Freakout! event featured plastic horns as the giveaway. These horns made Houston Field House reverberate with noise ‚Äì so much noise, in fact, that the evening's opponent, Brown, filed a complaint with the NCAA. In turn, this led to the creation of what is today known as \\"the RPI rule\\" nationwide, which prohibits fans from bringing artificial noisemakers into NCAA events. In 1990, the New York Islanders of the NHL moved their primary minor-league team to Houston Field House, naming them the Capital District Islanders. \\"CDI\\" played in the American Hockey League from 1990 to 1993. In 1993, the Capital District Islanders were sold to Albert Lawerence and moved across the river the play at the Knick/Pepsi/Times Union Center as the Albany River Rats. The team affiliated with the New Jersey Devils. The RPI women's hockey team, a club team beginning in 1976, hosted the AWCHA national women's club championship at Houston Field House in 1994, winning the national championship, and in 1995, when they finished in 3rd. The team became a varsity program later that year, and joined their male counterparts in NCAA's Division I in 2005. During the 1998‚Äì1999 hockey season, a new four-sided scoreboard was added to the center of the Field House, replacing the scoreboards on the eastern and western walls. Today Today, the Houston Field House seats 4,780 for hockey games, and remains the largest capacity in the ECAC Hockey League despite a decrease from its capacity of 5,217 in 2008. Its modern function is primarily as a home for the RPI men's and women's hockey teams to compete and practice, though several skating clubs also call the Field House home. Before the opening of the Times Union Center in Albany, the Houston Field House was the Capital District's main venue for concerts. Recent guests have included The Offspring, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Marilyn Manson, Sting, Bob Dylan, John Mayer, moe., Counting Crows, Matchbox Twenty, Guster & O.A.R., among others. Since the Field House's opening, the Institute has opened several other venues for athletic teams to play in, and today is used only by the hockey teams among the 21 other varsity sports offered at RPI. This decrease in activity allowed the Institute's intramural hockey program to utilize the Field House. Also, with the increase in enrollment, the Field House now no longer serves as the primary location for Commencement ceremonies. Today, the ceremonies are held at next-door East Campus Stadium. Houston Field House is considered the emergency venue, last holding ceremonies on May 25, 2013 when low temperatures and rain forced the ceremony indoors. Ironically, what may have initially prompted moving commencement out of the Field House was its lack of air conditioning, as the May, 1989 commencement was shortened because of the near-90¬∞ heat and stifling temperatures inside the arena. Today's \\"hockey line\\" is a shadow of what it was during its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s. With the number of obstructed view seats now at a minimum, it is no longer necessary to stay on line for weeks to ensure good seats, and the men's hockey team is currently not as successful as it once was. When the Student Union itself was renovated in the late 1990s, the hockey line all but died completely. Today, the Delta Phi fraternity tends to start the line every year in early September, and most other fraternities and many dormatories join the line a day or two before tickets go on sale. When it was a more major local concert venue in the 1970s and 1980s, one would frequently see lines for those tickets as well. In a usual occurrence in 1985, tickets for a joint Night Ranger/Jefferson Starship concert were to go on sale the morning after a Howard Jones concert commenced, so many people attending the concert went on line right after to wait for the ticket booth to open. As Howard Jones left his concert, he noticed the fans waiting outside in the 35¬∞ cold and asked what was going on. To show support he offered to sign autographs for everyone on the line. Notable features in the Field House today include the Rensselaer Alumni Association display at the entrance to the arena, which features RPI hockey players who have been named All-Americans and those who have played in the NHL. On the eastern side of the Field House is a stage, upon which \\"America's Pep Band\\" plays during hockey games. On the western wall of the Field House, centered by the seal of the Institute, are six banners honoring the men's team's NCAA championships in 1954 and 1985, their ECAC championships in 1984, 1985 and 1995 and a banner honoring the women's club team's AWCHA national championship of 1994. On November 5, 2004, RPI began its \\"Ring of Honor\\" at Houston Field House by unveiling a banner honoring Adam Oates and his number 12. Oates' banner was joined on November 12, 2005 by one recognizing number 9, Jo√© Juneau. Legendary coach Ned Harkness and 1954 standout Frank Chiarelli have since been added to the Ring as well. As part of a major campus improvement project to build the East Campus Athletic Village, the Houston Field House underwent several renovations starting in 2007. These included the renovations of the locker rooms, addition of a new weight room, and a new special reception room dedicated to Ned Harkness. Additionally, as part of the renovations, solar panels were added installed on the roof to supply power to the building through a government grant.

It forms part of the Borough of Copeland, and in 2001 had a population of 264,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish headcounts : Copeland Retrieved 2 June 2010 increasing to 304 at the 2011 Census. One of the Lake District's most popular tourist attractions, the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, runs through the valley, though along with other western valleys of the Lake District, Eskdale is notably quieter during the high summer season than the more accessible eastern areas. Topography The River Esk flows through the valley to its estuary at Ravenglass. The valley is notable in being one of few major valleys in the Lake District not to have its own lake, although several tarns are perched above the valley sides. The main access to the valley is from the western end; however, there is also a steep pass with a motor road leading out of the valley to the east over Hardknott Pass, as well as a road with beautiful views leading southwards over Birker Fell to the village of Ulpha in the Duddon Valley. Alfred Wainwright in his guide \\"Walks from Ratty\\" describes Eskdale as \\"One of the loveliest of Lakeland's valleys, descends from the highest and wildest mountains in the district to the Sands of Ravenglass in a swift transition from bleak and craggy ridges to verdant woodlands and pastures watered by a charming river.\\" Upper Eskdale is a remote wilderness surrounded by Sca Fell, Scafell Pike, Ill Crag, Esk Pike, Bow Fell and Crinkle Crags; the Woolpack walk takes in this classic horseshoe. Governance Eskdale is within the Copeland UK Parliamentary constituency and the North West England European Parliamentary constituency. Trudy Harrison is the Member of parliament. Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. Historical districts The former Eskdale ward of north eastern Cumberland was named after the River Esk in the Scottish Borders, whereas the valley described in this article was located in the former ward of Allerdale Above Derwent which is the present-day local council district of Copeland. June 2010 shootings The area became one of the locations involved in a killing spree perpetrated by 52-year-old taxi driver Derrick Bird, who shot and killed twelve people and wounded eleven others. Several of the wounded victims were shot in Eskdale and the surrounding area. St Catherine's chapel, Eskdale, Cumbria St Catherine's chapel seen from across the valley in autumn Proposed nuclear waste facility In June 2012, it became clear that Eskdale (specifically the Eskdale granite formed in the Ordovician Period around 450 million years ago) has been identified as a potential site for a Geological Disposal Facility for the UK's high level nuclear waste. Two other sites have also been identified - Ennerdale and the Solway Plain. Eskdale was not named by the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) Partnership, rather they referred to the 'granitic rocks forming part of The Lake District Batholith'. These are the Ennerdale and Eskdale granites. This was in (publicly available) document 285 of the West Cumbria MRWS in a report written by Dr Dearlove, the consultant geologist recruited by MRWS.

It is significant among Liverpool's parks on account of its layout and architecture. It has a grand terrace with expansive bedding schemes that were once highlighted by fountains. It includes the 1899 Gladstone Conservatory (recently restored and renamed the Isla Gladstone Conservatory), a Grade II listed building built by Mackenzie & Moncur of Edinburgh. 50‚Äì60% of the land consisted of open turfed areas, suitable for sport, with most of the rest being laid out as formal gardens and lakes. Kemp designed a horse-riding track ('Rotten Row'), though it did not catch on and was restyled as a cycle track around 1907. Stanley Park is known for dividing the home grounds of rival Merseyside football clubs Everton and Liverpool. However it was also the original home to a fledgling Everton Football Club in 1879 before the club moved to nearby Priory Road and then Anfield Road. Some of Stanley Park was to have been incorporated into the area of Liverpool's proposed new stadium, ironically the same location Everton F.C. played, however a change of ownership of the club during autumn 2010 resulted in the Stanley Park project being scrapped in October 2012, in favour of expanding Anfield.

Created by the Volkskammer on June 17, 1990, it oversaw the restructure and sale of about 8,500 state-owned companies with over four million employees. At that time, it was the world's largest industrial enterprise, controlling everything from steel works to the Babelsberg Studios. Responsibilities The Treuhand was responsible for more than just the 8,500 state-owned enterprises. It also took over around 2.4 million hectares of agricultural land and forests, the property of the former Stasi, large parts of the property of the former National People's Army, large-scale public housing property, and the property of the state pharmacy network. On the day of reunification, 3 October, 1990, it took over the property of the political parties and the mass organisations of the German Democratic Republic. Opposition Steel workers protest in Berlin in front of the Treuhand, December 1990. Its operations drew criticism for unnecessarily closing allegedly profitable businesses, misuse and waste of funds and layoffs that were claimed to be unnecessary. It also drew substantial protest from the workforces affected, as 2.5 million employees in state-owned enterprises (out of 4 million in total) were laid off in the early 1990s. Supporters argued that not placing the former state-owned enterprises into private hands would have caused the loss of many more jobs and slowed economic recovery. On 1 April, 1991, chairman of the Treuhand Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was shot dead by an unknown assassin (possibly the Red Army Faction). He was succeeded by Birgit Breuel. When its operations ended in 1994, it had amassed 260 to 270 billion DM in debt. Successors Total land sales by the BVVG amounted to around half the area of the state of Saxony-Anhalt Although the Treuhand ceased operations in 1994, it still retained much property and some other legal responsibilities. These were transferred to three successor agencies: * the Bundesanstalt f√ºr vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben, BvS (Federal Agency for Unification-derived Special Tasks), which managed remaining state-owned enterprises; * the Treuhandliegenschaftsgesellschaft (now TLG Immobilien GmbH), which manages the remaining state-owned urban and industrial real estate; * the Bodenverwertungs- und -verwaltungs GmbH (BVVG), a subsidiary of the Treuhand created in 1992, which manages the state-owned agricultural land, forest lands, and related real estate. The BvS ceased operations at the end of 2000, but it remains legally in existence; its remaining tasks are all delegated to other bodies. TLG and BVVG remain the largest real estate owners in the new federal states. In 2000, TLG was reoriented from focussing on privatisation of its assets to \\"active portfolio management\\" with a view to making profits for the German federal government. By 2007, having sold 45,000 properties in six years and reinvested 1.5 billion euros, it was still managing 1500 properties worth 1.4 billion euros.TLG ‚Äì History The planned privatisation of TLG itself was put on hold in July 2008 because of adverse economic conditions.\\"TLG Immobilien: Federal government halts privatization\\", Thomas Daily, 11 July 2008 In July 2008, the BVVG announced total privatization receipts of 3.5 billion euros since its establishment in 1992, which it had gained through the sale of around of agricultural land, with a similar amount of forest land and a small amount of other land.

This value is equal to the sum of the pre-money valuation and the amount of new equity.Get Venture by Mark Peter Davis: Venture Valuation Overview These valuations are used to express how much ownership external investors, such as venture capitalists and angel investors, receive when they make a cash injection into a company. The amount external investors invest into a company is equal to the company's post-money valuation multiplied by the fraction of the company those investors own after the investment. Equivalently, the implied post-money valuation is calculated as the dollar amount of investment divided by the equity stake gained in an investment. More specifically, the post-money valuation of a financial investment deal is given by the formula PMV = N \\\\times P , where PMV is the post-money valuation, N is the number of shares the company has after the investment, and P is the price per share at which the investment was made. This formula is similar to the market capitalization formula used to express the value of public companies. Example 1 If a company is worth $100 million (pre-money) and an investor makes an investment of $25 million, the new, post-money valuation of the company will be $125 million. The investor will now own 20% of the company. This basic example illustrates the general concept. However, in actual, real-life scenarios, the calculation of post- money valuation can be more complicated‚Äîbecause the capital structure of companies often includes convertible loans, warrants, and option-based management incentive schemes. Strictly speaking, the calculation is the price paid per share multiplied by the total number of shares existing after the investment--i.e., it takes into account the number of shares arising from the conversion of loans, exercise of in-the-money warrants, and any in-the-money options. Thus it is important to confirm that the number is a fully diluted and fully converted post-money valuation. In this scenario, the pre-money valuation should be calculated as the post-money valuation minus the total money coming into the company--not only from the purchase of shares, but also from the conversion of loans, the nominal interest, and the money paid to exercise in-the-money options and warrants. Example 2 Consider a company with 1,000,000 shares, a convertible loan note for $1,000,000 converting at 75% of the next round price, warrants for 200,000 shares at $10 a share, and a granted employee stock ownership plan of 200,000 shares at $4 per share. The company receives an offer to invest $8,000,000 at $8 per share. The post-money valuation is equal to $8 times the number of shares existing after the transaction--in this case, 2,366,667 shares. This figure includes the original 1,000,000 shares, plus 1,000,000 shares from new investment, plus 166,667 shares from the loan conversion ($1,000,000 divided by 75% of the next investment round price of $8, or $1,000,000 / (.75 * 8) ), plus 200,000 shares from in-the-money options. The fully converted, fully diluted post-money valuation in this example is $18,933,336. The pre-money valuation would be $9,133,336--calculated by taking the post-money valuation of $18,933,336 and subtracting the $8,000,000 of new investment, as well as $1,000,000 for the loan conversion and $800,000 from the exercise of the rights under the ESOP. Note that the warrants cannot be exercised because they are not in-the-money (i.e. their price, $10 a share, is still higher than the new investment price of $8 a share). Versus market value Importantly, a company's post-money valuation is not equal to its market value. The post-money valuation formula does not take into account the special features of preferred stock. It assumes that preferred stock has the same value as common stock, which is usually not true as preferred stock often has liquidation preference, participation, and other features that make it worth more than common stock. Because preferred stock are worth more than common stock, post-money valuations tend to overstate the value of companies. Gornall and Strebulaev (2017) provide the fair values of the 135 of the largest U.S. venture capital-backed companies and argue that these companies' post-money valuations are an average of 50% above their market values.

Topography The headwaters of the River Esk and the Duddon are separated by a ridge falling south west from the summit of Crinkle Crags. This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for , finally meeting the sea on the slopes of Black Combe. From Crinkle Crags the first fell on this ridge is Hard Knott, followed by Harter Fell and Green Crag. Alfred Wainwright did not include the remainder of the ridge in his influential ‚Äò‚ÄôPictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells‚Äô‚Äô, but later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow, Black Combe and the low hills around Devoke Water to their main volumes.Richards, Mark: Southern Fells: Collins (2003): Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland. From the main ridge of Crinkle Crags a low saddle juts out to the west in the vicinity of the southernmost Crinkle. This separates the basin of upper Eskdale from the head of the small marshy valley of Moasdale, down which the Moasdale Beck flows south to join the River Duddon at Cockley Beck. To the west of the saddle the ridge turns southward and gains height, rising over a series of rocky knolls to the summit of Hard Knott. The Moasdale side has gentle gradients but the western flanks above the Esk are fringed with crags. One feature on this side is the Eskdale Needle, (also known as The Steeple) a finger of rock detached from the main face.Richards, Mark: Mid-Western Fells: Collins (2004): As the Esk and Moasdale Becks diverge, the girth of the fell increases, until a pair of side valleys intrude to nip off its southward progress. These streams, both named Hard Knott Gill, fall from either side of Hardknott Pass, beyond which the ridge climbs again over a series of crags toward Harter Fell. The Hardknott Pass joins Eskdale with the Duddon Valley. There is a steep single- track road over the pass with gradients of up to 30% (1 in 3), reaching a maximum height of . The Hardknott Roman Fort stands at a height of about on the lower slopes of the western ridge as it descends into Eskdale. A Roman road from Ravenglass to Ambleside once crossed the pass, although by a slightly different route. Geology Rhyolitic lava-like tuff of the Bad Step Tuff forms the summit rocks with the dacitic lapilli-tuffs of the Lincomb Tarns Formation to the north west. Border end shows outcropping plagioclase- phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit Hard Knott reaches a height of 549 metres (1,803 feet), the summit knoll bearing a cairn. There are other named tops on the ridge in addition to the summit, with Yew Bank to the north and Border End to the south. Hard Knott is famous for its superb view of the Scafell massif to the north, while Harter Fell dominates the vista to the south. For a fabulous view of Eskdale it is recommended that the walker visits Border End half a mile to the south of the main summit.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 4: Ascents The fell is usually climbed from the top of the Hardknott Pass where there are several parking spaces. It is also possible to begin the ascent from the foot of the pass in Eskdale, although this will triple the length of the walk and the height gained. However, the best plan is probably to climb Hard Knott in conjunction with the neighbouring fell of Harter Fell making a horseshoe walk starting and finishing in Eskdale. From the top of the pass it is a short ascent to the fell summit following an electric fence that skirts to the right of the dangerous looking Raven Crag and takes the walker to the summit in a short time. Other possible routes include a pathless ascent from the Esk via The Steeple, a circuitous walk via the head of Moasdale and an ascent of the eastern flanks via Dod Pike.

The Yangtze Patrol also patrolled the coastal waters of China where they protected U.S. citizens, their property, and Christian missionaries. The Yangtze River is the longest river in China and it plays an important commercial role, with ocean-bound vessels proceeding as far upstream as the city of Wuhan. This squadron-sized unit cruised the waters of the Yangtze from Shanghai on the Pacific Ocean into the far interior of China at Chungking. Initially, the Yangtze Patrol was formed from ships of the United States Navy and assigned to the East India Squadron. In 1868, patrol duties were carried out by the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy. Under the unequal treaties, the United States, Japan, and various European powers, especially the United Kingdom, which had been on the Yangtze since 1897, were allowed to cruise China's rivers. In 1902, the United States Asiatic Fleet took control of the operations of the Yangtze Patrol. In 1922, Yangtze Patrol was established as a formal component of the United States Navy in China. In 1942, at the beginning of World War II, the Yangtze Patrol effectively ceased operations in China because of the limited resources of the United States Navy, which needed the patrol crews and their ships elsewhere in fighting Japanese forces throughout the Pacific. Following the end of World War II, the Yangtze Patrol resumed its duties in 1945, but on a more limited basis with fewer ships during the Chinese Civil War. When the Chinese Communist forces eventually occupied the Yangtze River valley in 1949, the United States Navy permanently ceased operations and disbanded the Yangtze Patrol.

Also, created by the treaties was the doctrine of extraterritoriality, a system whereby citizens of foreign countries living in China were subject to the laws of their home country. Most favoured nation treatment under the treaties assured other countries of the privileges afforded Great Britain, and soon many nations, including the United States, operated merchant ships and navy gunboats on the waterways of China. =1860‚Äì1900= During the 1860s and 1870s, American merchant ships were prominent on the lower Yangtze River, operating up to the deepwater port of Hankow inland. The added mission of anti-piracy patrols required U.S. naval and marine landing parties be put ashore several times to protect American interests. In 1874, the U.S. gunboat, , reached as far as Ichang, at the foot of the Yangtze gorges, from the sea. During this period, most US personnel found a tour in the Yangtze to be uneventful, as a major American shipping company had sold its interests to a Chinese firm, leaving the patrol with little to protect. However, as the stability of China began to deteriorate after 1890, the U.S. naval presence began to increase along the Yangtze.

Within the decade, several small motorships began hauling kerosene, the principal petroleum product used in China for that company. At the same time, the United States Navy acquired four Spanish vessels (the gunboats , , , and ), which it had seized in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. These vessels became the core of the Yangtze River patrol for the first dozen years of the 20th century, but they lacked the power to go beyond Ichang onto the more difficult stretches of the river. and were the first American gunboats built specifically for service on the Yangtze River. The Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California built them in 1913. The U.S. Navy then had them disassembled and shipped to China aboard the American steamer Mongolia. The Kiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai reassembled them and put them into service in 1914. Later in 1914, both vessels demonstrated their ability to handle the rapids of the upper river when they reached Chungking, which was more than from the sea, and then went further to Kiating on the Min River. In 1917, the U.S. entered World War I. The U.S. rendered the guns of Palos and Monocacy inoperable to protect Chinese neutrality. After China entered the war on the side of the Allies, the U.S. Navy reactivated the guns. In 1917, the first Standard Oil tanker reached Chungking, and a pattern of American commerce on the river began to emerge. On 17 January 1918, armed Chinese men attacked Monocacy and she was forced to return fire with her 6-pounder gun. Passenger and cargo service by American- flag ships began in 1920 with the Robert Dollar Line and the American West China Company. They were followed in 1923 by the Yangtze River Steamship Company, which stayed on the river until 1935, long after the other American passenger-cargo ships were gone. =1920‚Äì1930= In the early 1920s, the patrol found itself fighting the forces of warlords and bandits. To accommodate its increased responsibilities on the river, the United States Navy constructed six new gunboats in Shanghai during 1926‚Äì1927 and commissioned them in late 1927‚Äì1928 during the command of Rear Admiral Yates Stirling, Jr. to replace four craft, originally seized from Spain during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, that had been patrolling since 1903. All were capable of reaching Chungking at high water, and all year-round. Collectively referred to by the U.S. press as \\"the new six\\", and were the largest, and next in size, and and the smallest. These vessels gave the Navy the capability it needed at a time when operational requirements were growing rapidly. In the late 1920s, Chiang Kai-shek and the Northern Expedition created a volatile military situation for the patrol along the Yangtze. =1930‚Äì1942= After the Japanese took control of much of the middle and lower Yangtze in the 1930s, American river gunboats entered into a period of inactivity and impotence. During the early-1930s, National Revolutionary Army took control of much of the north bank of the middle river. The climax of hostilities occurred in 1937 with the Rape of Nanking and the sinking of Panay by the Japanese. The USS Panay incident was the first loss of a U.S. Navy vessel in the conflict which would soon become World War II. Just prior to the Attack on Pearl Harbor, most of the ships on the Yangtze River Patrol were brought out of China, with only the smallest gunboats, Wake (the renamed Guam) and Tutuila remaining behind. Wake, at Shanghai, was subsequently captured by the Japanese. Tutuila, at Chungking, was turned over to the Chinese. When the other gunboats reached Manila, the Yangtze River Patrol was formally dissolved when, on 5 December 1941, Rear Admiral Glassford sent the message, \\"COMYANGPAT DISSOLVED\\". Subsequently, the evacuated ships were all scuttled, or captured with their crews and imprisoned by the Japanese, after the fall of Corregidor in mid-1942. Luzon was later salvaged and used by the Japanese. was sunk in battle on 3 March 1942 and Mindanao was scuttled on 2 May; Oahu was sunk in battle 5 May 1942. During different periods of time, Naval and Marine Corps personnel, who were in the patrol, were eligible for either the Yangtze Service Medal or the China Service Medal. =1945‚Äì1949= After the surrender of Japan, some patrols on the river were resumed in September 1945. A few days after Japan's surrender, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, commander of the United States 7th Fleet, sailed south aboard to rendezvous with Task Force 73 and continue on to Shanghai. However, they were delayed due to a large typhoon and the river being swept for mines. They finally proceeded up the river and arrived in Shanghai on 19 September 1945, with the first Allied ships in over three years. The American flotilla included the command ship (USS Rocky Mount), two light cruisers, four destroyers, twelve destroyer escorts, and many PT boats and minesweepers along with a British naval contingent of three light cruisers, six destroyers, six destroyer escorts, and some minesweepers. In November the new heavy cruiser joined the unit. in October 1945 on Yangtze River Patrol in Whangpoo River, Shanghai, China. The ship is viewed from Whang-poo Pier with USS Rocky Mount on the right When the Chinese Civil War finally reached the Yangtze Valley, in 1949, the U.S. Navy permanently ceased operations on the Yangtze River and officially disbanded the Yangtze Patrol.

History The club was founded in 1964 as Milford Everton in the village of Milford, just outside Armagh city. The original name was in honour of the founders' favourite English team, Everton. Milford was the village were the penalty kick was first introduced in 1890 when local goalkeeper William McCrum suggested a way to combat illegal challenges near to goal. Milford Everton eventually bought and refurbished the McCrum Institute in the early 1980s as they strove to improve facilities for the 'B' Division. The club was renamed Armagh City after relocating to Armagh in 1988. They played at the Mill Field, Armagh from 1988 to 1993, when they moved to their current ground, Holm Park.Armagh City Football Club: The First 50 Years (n.d.), p.17. They achieved senior status in 1999, but reverted to intermediate status in 2003 when the Irish Premier League was established and the number of senior clubs was reduced from 20 to 16. In 2005, however, City gained promotion to the Premier League, but after three more seasons at senior level, the club failed to gain a place in the 12-club IFA Premiership and reverted once more to intermediate status as a member of the IFA Championship. The club's colours are azure and black stripes. Former player Marty Rice was named first team manager on 10 July 2010, having been assistant to Ivor McGucken at the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season. During the 2011‚Äì12 season Armagh City entered into negotiations with various bodies including the IFA, Armagh City and District Council and SportNI to secure funding to replace their grass pitch with the latest, FIFA approved, 3rd generation pitch. The pitch was laid in summer 2013 and opened in September 2013. The first game for the first team was on 14 September 2013 - a 5‚Äì1 win against Lurgan Celtic in the Bob Radcliffe Cup. Luke Grimley was the last player to score on the old Holm Park in a 1-0 win over rivals Loughgall, while Shea McGerrigan was the first player to score in the new Holm Park. In the 2011-12 season Armagh City F.C youth created history by winning their first ever national trophy, the Harry Cavan Irish Youth Cup, defeating Cliftonville 1-0 in the final with a goal from Barry Quinn, the side was managed by John Hynds and Martin Grimley, and captained by Matthew Hynds. In the 2013-14 season Armagh City F.C won the double by winning the league and Bob Radcliffe Cup, the side, captained by Liam Cullen also reached the Intermediate Cup Final but were defeated by Bangor F.C 2-1. The club over the years has reached several Mid Ulster Cup finals with a reasonably large following and have came close to promotion to the NIFL Premiership. The club was relegated to the Premier Intermediate League in the 2016-17 season following a disappointing 7-1 loss to Newry City in the championship relegation play off over two legs. Manager Marty Rice then resigned.

Now used as Judges' lodgings. * The Grade 2 listed Seamen‚Äôs Orphan Institution. * Fishing lakes with roach, carp and tench (registration permit required). * Children's play area * Lakeview Kiosk (open 9am-5pm) History The park is part of a set of Victorian public parks within Liverpool, including Stanley Park, Walton Hall Park, Princes Park and the largest of the group, Sefton Park. It is built on land purchased by the Liverpool Corporation from the Molyneux Estate. The development of the park was funded by the sale of plots for the construction of housing. Consequently the park is fringed by Victorian housing, some of which is currently empty and derelict. The area has been awarded Conservation Area status, a legal protection against development to protect and preserve the Victorian architecture. Newsham Park is the first individual work of the landscape architect Edward Kemp, an understudy of Joseph Paxton who was responsible for the grounds at Chatsworth House and the design of Birkenhead Park, a city park that became a working model for the creation of Manhattan's Central Park. The park is protected as a Grade II* listed site. The park contains two large lakes, the smaller of which hosts the sailing of model boats. The larger lake historically offered rowing boats for hire, but they are no longer present. It is currently used for fishing. Buildings Seaman's Orphanage The park also has several important buildings, including the Grade II listed Seaman's Orphanage -- a building later converted to Newsham Park Hospital and subsequently earmarked for development as luxury apartments, which never happened. Another building within the park is Newsham House, which is the residence for judges attending Liverpool Crown court and was visited by Queen Victoria. In 2004 work commenced on the Academy of St. Francis of Assisi, a secondary school (11-16) under the UK Government's City Academy programme. The school is a modern four-storey building at the western end of the park, and its contemporary style caused some friction with local residents who felt that it was at odds with the park's Conservation Area status. The now-closed Stanley railway station was located in the south east corner and the similarly closed Tue Brook railway station to the north east.

(Serial numbers obscured in altered photo.) In fiction, a gold key is a special token granting access to and control of a mythical or ultra-private or secret bank account or vault, such as a Swiss bank account. In reality, the key is often a code word and accounts are not completely anonymous. A real \\"gold key\\" need not be made of or colored gold, or even a key. If it is a key it may not fit any lock; the keys are important as authentication tokens, not always as literal keys. While Swiss law formerly granted nearly complete financial privacy, fully anonymous accounts are no longer available. Swiss banks are now required by law to obtain identifying information from any prospective clients. International pressure related to efforts to trace and identify terrorists and drug traffickers has eliminated the anonymous \\"Swiss bank account\\" that has appeared in numerous books and films and conspiracy theories. Other countries still offer bank accounts with varying degrees of anonymity. (See also: Offshore bank; Anonymous banking.) The arrival of a \\"gold key client\\" typically results in an extra flurry of attention. A number of plot devices detail the method of authentication of the account-holder, adding to the mystery and drama of the client's arrival. It is a common literary device that banks do not admit publicly that \\"gold key\\" accounts actually exist, and characters are therefore invested into a sort of secret society when they are offered such an account.  Literary references  In the best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code, the heroine Sophie Neveu is given a gold key by her grandfather. The gold key bears the logo of the Priory of Sion, a secret society, which leads Neveu and co-hero Robert Langdon to guess the code associated with the key. In Lewis Perdue's Daughter of God there is a gold key which is hidden in a painting (\\"The Home of the Lady of Our Redeemer\\"). This gold key (accompanied by a gold ingot with the account number) allows access to a safe deposit box in a Zurich bank. The key does not actually open a lock as such. In the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling, the wizarding bank Gringotts uses gold keys, among other devices, to protect the security of its vaults which contain wizards' gold hoards.

Usually denoted x, r, or s, it corresponds to the straight line segment from O to P. In other words, it is the displacement or translation that maps the origin to P:The term displacement is mainly used in mechanics, while translation is used in geometry. :\\\\mathbf{r}=\\\\overrightarrow{OP} The term \\"position vector\\" is used mostly in the fields of differential geometry, mechanics and occasionally vector calculus. Frequently this is used in two-dimensional or three- dimensional space, but can be easily generalized to Euclidean spaces and affine spaces of any dimension.Keller, F. J, Gettys, W. E. et al. (1993), p 28‚Äì29 Definition=Three dimensions Space curve in 3D. The position vector r is parameterized by a scalar t. At r = a the red line is the tangent to the curve, and the blue plane is normal to the curve. In three dimensions, any set of three-dimensional coordinates and their corresponding basis vectors can be used to define the location of a point in space‚Äîwhichever is the simplest for the task at hand may be used. Commonly, one uses the familiar Cartesian coordinate system, or sometimes spherical polar coordinates, or cylindrical coordinates: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{r}(t) & \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{r}(x,y,z) \\\\equiv x(t)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{e}}_x + y(t)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{e}}_y + z(t)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{e}}_z \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{r}(r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) \\\\equiv r(t)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{e}}_r\\\\big(\\\\theta(t), \\\\phi(t)\\\\big) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{r}(r,\\\\theta,z) \\\\equiv r(t)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{e}}_r\\\\big(\\\\theta(t)\\\\big) + z(t)\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{e}}_z, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where t is a parameter, owing to their rectangular or circular symmetry. These different coordinates and corresponding basis vectors represent the same position vector. More general curvilinear coordinates could be used instead and are in contexts like continuum mechanics and general relativity (in the latter case one needs an additional time coordinate). n dimensions Linear algebra allows for the abstraction of an n-dimensional position vector. A position vector can be expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors: :\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\mathbf{e}_i = x_1 \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x_2 \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\\\dotsb + x_n \\\\mathbf{e}_n. The set of all position vectors forms position space (a vector space whose elements are the position vectors), since positions can be added (vector addition) and scaled in length (scalar multiplication) to obtain another position vector in the space. The notion of \\"space\\" is intuitive, since each xi (i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, n) can have any value, the collection of values defines a point in space. The dimension of the position space is n (also denoted dim(R) = n). The coordinates of the vector r with respect to the basis vectors ei are xi. The vector of coordinates forms the coordinate vector or n-tuple (x1, x2, ‚Ä¶, xn). Each coordinate xi may be parameterized a number of parameters t. One parameter xi(t) would describe a curved 1D path, two parameters xi(t1, t2) describes a curved 2D surface, three xi(t1, t2, t3) describes a curved 3D volume of space, and so on. The linear span of a basis set B = {e1, e2, ‚Ä¶, en} equals the position space R, denoted span(B) = R. Applications=Differential geometry Position vector fields are used to describe continuous and differentiable space curves, in which case the independent parameter needs not be time, but can be (e.g.) arc length of the curve. Mechanics In any equation of motion, the position vector r(t) is usually the most sought-after quantity because this function defines the motion of a particle (i.e. a point mass) ‚Äì its location relative to a given coordinate system at some time t. To define motion in terms of position, each coordinate may be parametrized by time; since each successive value of time corresponds to a sequence of successive spatial locations given by the coordinates, the continuum limit of many successive locations is a path the particle traces. In the case of one dimension, the position has only one component, so it effectively degenerates to a scalar coordinate. It could be, say, a vector in the x direction, or the radial r direction. Equivalent notations include : \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\equiv x \\\\equiv x(t), \\\\quad r \\\\equiv r(t), \\\\quad s \\\\equiv s(t). Derivatives of position Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass m, position r, velocity v, acceleration a For a position vector r that is a function of time t, the time derivatives can be computed with respect to t. These derivatives have common utility in the study of kinematics, control theory, engineering and other sciences. ;Velocity :\\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{r}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}, where dr is an infinitesimally small displacement (vector). ;Acceleration :\\\\mathbf{a} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2\\\\mathbf{r}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2}. ;Jerk :\\\\mathbf{j} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{a}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2\\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^3\\\\mathbf{r}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^3}. These names for the first, second and third derivative of position are commonly used in basic kinematics. By extension, the higher-order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion. Study of these higher-order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function. Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as a sum of an infinite sequence, enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics.

It was directed and produced by Laurence Olivier, who also played the lead role. Featuring many noted Shakespearean actors, including a quartet of actors who were later knighted, the film depicts Richard plotting and conspiring to grasp the throne from his brother King Edward IV, played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke. In the process, many are killed and betrayed, with Richard's evil leading to his own downfall. The prologue of the film states that history without its legends would be \\"a dry matter indeed\\", implicitly admitting to the artistic licence that Shakespeare applied to the events of the time. Of the three Shakespearean films directed by Olivier, Richard III received the least critical praise at the time, although it was still acclaimed. It was the only one not to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, though Olivier's acting performance was nominated. The film gained popularity in the US through a 1966 re-release, which broke box office records in many US cities. Many critics now consider Olivier's Richard III his best screen adaptation of Shakespeare. The British Film Institute has pointed out that, given the enormous TV audience it received when shown in the United States on NBC, Sunday afternoon, March 11, 1956,See IMDB website for Richard IIIs release dates the film \\"may have done more to popularise Shakespeare than any other single work\\". Plot King Edward IV of England (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) has been placed on the throne with the help of his brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester (Sir Laurence Olivier). After Edward's coronation in the Great Hall, with his brothers George and Richard watching, he leaves with his wife and sons. Richard contemplates the throne, before advancing towards the audience and then addressing them, delivering a speech that outlines his physical deformities, including a hunched back and a withered arm. He goes on to describe his jealousy over his brother's rise to power in contrast to his lowly position. He dedicates himself to task and plans to frame his brother, George, Duke of Clarence (Sir John Gielgud), for conspiring to kill the King, and to have George sent to the Tower of London, by claiming George will murder Edward's heirs. He then tells his brother he will help him get out. Having confused and deceived the King, Richard proceeds with his plans after getting a warrant, and enlists two ruffians (Michael Gough and Michael Ripper) to carry out his dirty work: George is murdered, drowned in a butt of wine. Though Edward had sent a pardon to Richard, Richard stopped it passing. Richard goes on to woo and seduce the Lady Anne (Claire Bloom), and though she hates him for killing her husband and father, she cannot resist and ends up marrying him. Richard then orchestrates disorder in the court, fueling rivalries, and setting the court against the Queen consort, Elizabeth (Mary Kerridge). The King, weakened by exhaustion, appoints his brother, Richard, as Lord Protector, and dies soon after hearing of the death of George. Edward's son, soon to become Edward V (Paul Huson), is met by Richard whilst en route to London. Richard has the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Hastings (Alec Clunes) arrested and executed, and forces the young King, along with his younger brother the Duke of York (Andy Shine), to have a protracted stay at the Tower of London. With all obstacles now removed, Richard enlists the help of his cousin the Duke of Buckingham (Sir Ralph Richardson) to alter his public image, and to become popular with the people. In doing so, Richard becomes the people's first choice to become the new King. Buckingham had aided Richard on terms of being given the title of Earl of Hereford and its income, but balks at the idea of murdering the two princes. Richard then asks a minor knight, Sir James Tyrrel (Patrick Troughton), eager for advancement, to have young Edward and the Duke of York killed in the Tower of London. Buckingham, having requested his earldom at Richard's coronation, fears for his life when Richard (angry at Buckingham for not killing the princes) shouts \\"I am not in the giving vein today!\\" Buckingham then joins the opposition against Richard's rule. Richard, now fearful because of his dwindling popularity, raises an army to defend his throne and the House of York against the House of Lancaster, led by Henry Tudor (Stanley Baker), the Earl of Richmond and later Henry VII of England, at Bosworth Field (1485). Before the battle, however, Buckingham is captured and executed. On the eve of the battle, Richard is haunted by the ghosts of all those he has killed in his bloody ascent to the throne, and he wakes up screaming. Richard composes himself, striding out to plan the battle for his generals, and gives a motivational speech to his troops. The two forces engage in battle, with the Lancastarians having the upper hand. Lord Stanley (Laurence Naismith), whose loyalties had been questionable for some time, betrays Richard, and allies himself with Henry. Richard sees this and charges into the thick of battle, side-by-side with his loyal companion Sir William Catesby (Norman Wooland) to kill Richmond and end the battle quickly. Eventually Richard spots Richmond and they briefly engage in a duel before being interrupted by Stanley's men. Richard and Catesby are able to escape the oncoming forces, but, in doing so, Richard is knocked off his horse, loses his cherished crown, and becomes separated from Catesby, who is off seeking rescue. Searching desperately for Richmond, whom he has lost sight of, Richard cries out: \\"A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!\\" Catesby finds the king and offers him withdrawal, but Richard refuses to flee. Catesby is then killed by Richmond's men without Richard noticing. Richard then spots Lord Stanley, and engages him in single combat. Before a victor can emerge, the Lancastarian troops charge Richard, and fatally wound him. The wounded murderous king convulses in spasms, offering his sword to the sky, and eventually dies of his wounds. Stanley orders Richard's body to be taken away and then finds Richard's crown in a thorn bush. He then proceeds to offer it to Henry, leaving the crown of England in safe hands once again. Cast Olivier cast only British actors. Since the film was financed by Alexander Korda and produced by his London Films, obtaining the required actors was not difficult, as many actors were contractually obliged to London Films. As with most films with ensemble casts, all the players were billed on the same tier. However, Olivier played the title character and occupies the majority of screen time. When casting the supporting roles, Olivier chose to fortify the already impressive cast with seasoned veterans, such as Laurence Naismith, and with promising newcomers, such as Claire Bloom and Stanley Baker. For the murderers, Olivier originally wanted John Mills and Richard Attenborough. However, Mills thought the idea might be regarded as \\"stunt casting\\", and Attenborough had to pull out because of a scheduling conflict. The film's marketers in the US picked up on the fact that the cast included four knights (Olivier, Richardson, Gielgud and Hardwicke) and used this as a selling point. The four members of the cast who had already achieved British knighthood were all listed as \\"Sir....\\" in the film credits. The House of York * Sir Laurence Olivier as Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III), the malformed brother of the King, who is jealous of his brother's new power, and plans to take it for himself. Olivier had created his interpretation of the Crookback King in 1944, and this film transferred that portrayal to the screen. This portrayal earned Olivier his fifth Oscar nomination, and is generally considered to be one of his greatest performances; some consider it his best performance in a Shakespeare play. * Sir Cedric Hardwicke as King Edward IV of England, the newly crowned King of England, who, with the aid of his brother, Richard, has secured his position by wresting it from Henry VI of the House of Lancaster. This marked his only appearance in a film version of a Shakespeare play. He was 62 at the time of the film, whereas Edward died at the age of 40. * Sir John Gielgud as George, Duke of Clarence, brother of Richard and of the new King. Gielgud's standing as the great stage Shakespearean of the decades immediately preceding Olivier's career was a cause of a certain enmity on the part of Olivier, and it was known that he disapproved of Gielgud's \\"singing\\" the verse (i.e. reciting it in an affected style that resembles singing).Gielgud, Sir John, and Miller, John. Acting Shakespeare. New York: Scribner's, 1992. Gielgud's casting in this film can be seen as a combination of Olivier's quest for an all-star cast, and the fact that Olivier had rejected Gielgud's request to play the Chorus in Olivier's 1944 adaptation of Henry V. * Sir Ralph Richardson as the Duke of Buckingham, a corrupt official, who sees potential for advancement in Richard's plans and eventually turns against him when Richard ignores his wishes. Richardson was a lifelong friend of Olivier's. At first, Olivier wanted Orson Welles as Buckingham, but felt an obligation towards his longtime friend. (Olivier later regretted this choice, as he felt that Welles would have added an element of conspiracy to the film.) * Paul Huson as Edward, Prince of Wales (later, for a brief while, King Edward V), the eldest son of the King, who holds many strong beliefs, and wishes one day to become a Warrior King. * Andy Shine as the Duke of York, the younger son of Prince Edward. * Helen Haye as the Duchess of York, the mother of the King. Haye worked regularly for Alexander Korda. Her character's role is severely cut in the film from the play. * Pamela Brown as Mistress Shore, the King's mistress. Her character is only mentioned in Shakespeare's play, never seen. * Alec Clunes as The Lord Hastings (Lord Chamberlain), a companion and friend of Richard who is accused of conspiracy by Richard and is abruptly executed. * Laurence Naismith as The Lord Stanley. Stanley has a certain dislike for Richard and is not totally willing in his co-operation with him. Stanley eventually betrays Richard at Bosworth and engages him in a one-on-one duel. * Norman Wooland as Sir William Catesby, Esmond Knight as Sir Richard Ratcliffe, John Laurie as Lord Francis Lovell, Patrick Troughton as Sir James Tyrrell, and John Phillips as John, Duke of Norfolk, all loyal companions of Richard. The House of Lancaster * Mary Kerridge as Queen Elizabeth, Queen Consort of Edward. Kerridge did not make many screen appearances, though she did sometimes work for Alexander Korda. Her role has also been reduced from Shakespeare's original. * Clive Morton as The Lord Rivers, brother of the Queen Consort. Morton was a British actor who mainly played supporting roles on screen. * Dan Cunningham as The Lord Grey, youngest son of the Queen Consort and stepson of the King. Cunningham's role in Richard III was one of his few screen appearances. * Douglas Wilmer as the Marquess of Dorset, eldest son of the Queen Consort and stepson of the King. * Claire Bloom as The Lady Anne, a widow and an orphan thanks to the acts of Richard, though she cannot resist his charms and eventually becomes his wife. * Stanley Baker, appropriately cast as the young Welshman, Henry, Earl of Richmond (later Henry VII, first of the House of Tudor). Henry, who is Richard's enemy, and Lord Stanley's stepson, claims his right to the throne, and briefly duels Richard at Bosworth. Production=Background Of Olivier's three Shakespeare films, Richard III had the longest gestation period: Olivier had created and been developing his vision of the character Richard since his portrayal for the Old Vic Theatre in 1944. After he had made Shakespeare films popular with Henry V and Hamlet, the choice of Richard III for his next adaptation was simple, as his Richard had been widely praised on stage. For the stage production, Olivier had modelled some of the crookback king's look on a well-known theatrical producer at the time, Jed Harris, whom Olivier called \\"the most loathsome man I'd ever met\\". Years later Olivier discovered that Walt Disney had also used Harris as his basis for the Big Bad Wolf in the film The Three Little Pigs., Chapter 20 Alexander Korda, who had given Olivier his initial roles on film, provided financial support for the film. Screenplay Most of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but Olivier also drew on the 18th century adaptations by Colley Cibber and David Garrick, including Cibber's line, \\"Off with his head. So much for Buckingham!\\". Like Cibber and Garrick, Olivier's film opens with material from the last scenes of Henry VI, Part 3, to introduce more clearly the situation at the beginning of the story. A key change in the story involved the seduction of Anne. It is split into two scenes instead of one, and an element of perversity is added‚Äîwhereas in the original play she is following a coffin with the corpse of her father-in-law, in this film the coffin contains the corpse of her husband. John Cottrell has been quoted as saying this makes \\"the young widow's seduction even more daring and revolting than it is in the original, and [gives] Anne's capitulation\\" in the second part after a passionate kiss \\"a new and neurotic twist\\".See DVD audio commentary 2004 Criterion edition This is accomplished by cutting lines, changing lines, and changing the sequence of some lines. Olivier makes other small and subtle additions in the stage direction. When Richard's nephew makes a joke about his uncle's hunchback (\\"you should bear me on your shoulder\\"), Richard spins round and gives the boy a malevolent glare making the boy stagger back. This bit of stage direction is original to Olivier. Olivier also silently mimes some actions spoken of in his soliloquies such as when he whispers insinuations about Clarence into the ear of King Edward. In general the lengthy play is heavily cut. In an interview with Roger Manvell Olivier discussed how unwieldy and complex the play is. The character of Queen Margaret is cut entirely, the role of the Duchess of York (Helen Haye) is significantly reduced, the role of Edward IV's wife Elizabeth is also reduced, and the execution of Clarence and other scenes are abridged. These cuts were made to maintain the pace of the film and to cut down the running time, as a full performance of the play can run upwards of four hours. Richard is made more directly responsible for the death of Edward IV than in the play, as Edward has his fatal attack only moments after Richard informs the assembled nobles that Clarence is dead. Filming Gerry O'Hara was Olivier's assistant director, on hand to help since Olivier was acting in most of the scenes. Olivier was very precise in getting many of the visual details of the period correct. Actor Douglas Wilmer (Dorset) recounts that when he casually told Olivier that one piece of heraldry on the set was incorrect, that Olivier started pumping as much information out of him as possible as if he was \\"drilling for oil\\". Olivier made the unusual decision to deliver his soliloquies by directly addressing the film audience, something not often done before in film. Near the beginning of the film Richard's herald drops his coronet, a mistake that Olivier decided to keep in, as part of the motif of accidental loss of the crown continued in the final battle. Most of the film was shot in at Shepperton Studios, but the climactic Battle of Bosworth Field abruptly opens up the setting, as it was shot outdoors, in the Spanish countryside. During one sequence therein, Olivier suffered an arrow wound to the shin when his horse jerked forwards. Fortunately, it was on the leg Richard was supposed to limp on, allowing the scene to continue. Wilmer also notes During filming, Olivier's portrait was painted by Salvador Dal√≠. The painting remained one of Olivier's favourites until he had to sell it to pay for his children's school fees. Cinematography The cinematography for the film was by Otto Heller, who had worked on many European films before coming to the UK in the early 1940s. The film uses the Technicolor process, which Olivier had earlier rejected for his Hamlet after a row with the company. The use of Technicolor resulted in bright, vibrant colours. Korda had suggested that Olivier also use the new extreme widescreen format, CinemaScope, but Olivier thought it was nothing more than a gimmick designed to distract the audience from the true quality of the film, and chose the less extreme VistaVision format instead. To this day, Richard III remains the only Shakespeare film made in VistaVision. Music The score was composed by Sir William Walton, who worked on all of the films Olivier directed except The Prince and the Showgirl. He composed a score described in Chandos's record catalogue as \\"rousing\\" and \\"filled with pomp and circumstance, to add to the feel of pageantry\\". The music was conducted by Muir Mathieson, who collaborated on all of films Olivier directed, except for Three Sisters. The film's music was also used for a set of readings of speeches from the play on audio CD featuring John Gielgud. The Chandos catalogue notes that Walton used the main theme throughout the film, especially towards the closing scenes. Release and reception Richard III opened at the Leicester Square Theatre on December 13, 1955, with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip attending the premiere. Alexander Korda had sold the rights to the film to NBC in the US for $500,000 (about $ in today's dollars) and the film was released in North America on Sunday, 11 March 1956. The release was unique, in that the film had its US premiere on the same day both on television and in cinemas, the first instance of this ever being done. It was not shown during prime time, but rather in the afternoon, so prime time ratings for that day were not affected by any pre-emptions for a special programme. It is quite likely that it was the first 3-hour telecast of a film or a Shakespeare play ever to be shown in the US. The film, although slightly cut for television, was generally well received by critics, with Olivier's performance earning particular notice, but as a result of its simultaneous release through television and cinemas in the US, it was a box office failure, and many critics felt at the time that it was not as well-made as Olivier's previous films. However, the airing on US television received excellent ratings, estimated at between 25 and 40 million. In addition, when the film was reissued in 1966, it broke box office records in many US cities. Its critical reputation has since grown considerably, and many critics now consider it Olivier's best and most influential screen adaptation of Shakespeare. The film's failure at the US box office effectively ended Olivier's career as a director of Shakespearean films. His proposed film of Macbeth, which had been intended to go into production during 1957,Terry Coleman Olivier: The Authorised Biography, London: Bloomsbury, 2005, p. 277 in the end finally failed to gain financing. Awards In contrast to Olivier's previous work, Richard III was only nominated for a single Academy Award: Academy Award for Best Actor. It was Olivier's fifth nomination in the category, though the award was won by Yul Brynner for his performance in The King and I. Richard III was the second film to have won both Best Film awards at the BAFTAS. It dominated that year's awards ceremony, winning, in addition to the two Best Film awards, the award for Best British Actor. It was also the first winner of the newly created Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film, which had been split from the Best Foreign Film Award. Other awards won by the film include the Silver Bear Award at the 6th Berlin International Film Festival and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Production. The Jussi Award was given to Olivier for Best Foreign Actor. Olivier's performance as Richard III was ranked 39th in Premiere magazine's \\"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\\" Reputation The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes records that 79% of its collected reviews of the film are positive. However, the reviewer for the AllMovie website criticises Olivier's direction for being far more restricted in its style in comparison to the bold filming of Henry V, or the moody photography of Hamlet, and Olivier the actor for dominating the production too much (although the character of Richard certainly dominates Shakespeare's original play). There were some complaints about geographical inaccuracies in the film (the Battle of Bosworth Field was filmed in a region of Spain that does not resemble any locations in England). In response, Olivier wrote in The New York Times: \\"Americans who know London may be surprised to find Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London to be practically adjacent. I hope they'll agree with me that if they weren't like that, they should have been.\\" The British Film Institute suggests Olivier's Richard III may have done more to popularise Shakespeare than any other piece of work. According to them, the 25‚Äì40 million viewers during its airing on US television, \\"would have outnumbered the sum of the play's theatrical audiences over the 358 years since its first performance.\\" Home media The film has been released on VHS numerous times, but these releases are made from cropped low quality sources. Carlton Entertainment released the first DVD in 2000 presented in a widescreen ratio. This release was presented in 1.78:1 but is non-anamorphic and zoomed in the most compared to the later releases. In 2002, Wienerworld released a special edition DVD with a new 1.66:1 widescreen transfer, a trailer, and star bios. In 2004, Criterion digitally restored the film in its original 1.66:1 widescreen format and re-constructed it to match the release script. Unlike the previous releases before it that were made from different and inferior source elements, Criterion performed their own restoration and digital transfer. It was released in a 2-disc special edition, including an essay by film and music historian Bruce Eder, an interview with Olivier, and other numerous special features. The DVD is subtitled in English, with a Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio track. The DVD also contains a commentary by Russell Lees and John Wilders. The second disc of the DVD features a 1966 BBC interview with Olivier by Kenneth Tynan entitled Great Acting: Laurence Olivier. It also contains a gallery of posters, production stills and two trailers. The film was given a Blu-ray release in the UK by Network, and later in 2012 by The Criterion Collection for DVD and Blu-ray in the United States. Both releases featured a restoration from the original film elements by the Film Foundation in conjunction with ITV Global, owners of the London Films/Rank library.

In their first season in the Premiership the target was to avoid relegation. However, they surpassed all expectations, finishing 5th in the table. They secured a 2‚Äì2 draw at Ferney Park in their opening Premiership fixture against Dungannon Swifts, and their stand out results during the season included a 1‚Äì0 away win over eventual league champions Cliftonville at Solitude in September 2012. They also defeated reigning champions Linfield twice at Windsor Park, 3‚Äì1 in October 2012 and 1‚Äì0 in the post-split match in April 2013. In their second season 2013‚Äì14 they finished in 10th place, three points above Warrenpoint Town in the play-off place after going unbeaten in their last 6 games of the season. No play-off was ultimately needed that season. In their third season 2014‚Äì15 they finished in 9th place, 2 points above Dungannon Swifts in 10th and 9 points above Warrenpoint Town in the play-off place. The club also made history by reaching its first ever major cup semi final when it beat Glentoran in a penalty shootout in a Wasp Solutions League Cup quarter final at Ferney Park. In the 2015‚Äì16 season the Mallard's recorded their first ever win at The Oval beating Glentoran 0‚Äì2 and they also recorded their first ever win at Shamrock Park and The Ballymena Showgrounds winning 3‚Äì0 and 2‚Äì1 respectively. The Mallard's Irish Cup campaign was a disappointing one going out in the 5th Round on penalties to Coleraine after surrendering a two-goal lead in the second half. They reached the Quarter-Finals of the League Cup before being knocked out by eventual finalists Ards in another penalty shoot out. The Mallard's contested a thrilling end to the season with Carrick Rangers and Warrenpoint Town with Ballinamallard beating Carrick 1‚Äì0 on the final day and Warrenpoint beating Dungannon Swifts 1‚Äì0 meaning Carrick would automatically return to NIFL Championship 1 and Warrenpoint Town would contest the Promotion/Relegation Play-Off and the fermanagh side would be safe. However, in the 89th minute at Taylor's Avenue Carrick Rangers equalized through Mark Surgenor meaning that Carrick would still be automatically relegated to the NIFL Championship 1 but that Ballinamallard would now contest the play-off and Warrenpoint Town would be safe in 10th place. The drama took yet another turn when in the 94th minute of the game at Taylor's Avenue in the final minute of stoppage time, Miguel Chines scored a stunning bicycle kick to win the game for Carrick Rangers meaning in fact that they would be safe prompting wild celebrations from the Carrick supporters meaning now that Ballinamallard would be automatically relegated to Championship 1 and Warrenpoint would contest the play-off. In the final turn, Warrenpoint Town conceded a controversial penalty in the dying seconds of their game with Andrew Mitchell putting it away to make it 1‚Äì1 now automatically relegating Warrenpoint Town and Ballinamallard United contesting the play-off with Institute where they managed to beat the Drumahoe side 2‚Äì1 away from home and drew 3‚Äì3 at Ferney Park to secure the club's premier league status for the 2016‚Äì17 season. On 13 May 2016 it was announced legendary manager, Whitey Anderson, would be leaving the club after over ten years service. Finn Harps assistant coach Gavin Dykes was appointed as his replacement. The Mallards went on to secure 10th place to guarantee their 6th season in the NIFL Premiership. On the 30 March 2019 Ballinamallard United reached their first ever Irish Cup final by beating Warrenpoint Town in a penalty shoot-out. Striker Ryan Campbell scored the winning penalty.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47759900 In the final on 4 May, they lost 3-0 to Crusaders.

It is not to be confused with a similar episode \\"The Dummy\\", starring Cliff Robertson as a ventriloquist. Opening narrationPlot Jonathan West (Cooper) is an unsuccessful Irish ventriloquist. He is perpetually broke, selling valuable keepsakes like his grandfather's watch to pawnbrokers in exchange for petty cash. At the boarding house where he lives, he is mercilessly taunted by a little girl, Susan (billed as Susanne Cupito), for failing to find a job. But unbeknownst to everyone, Jonathan's evil ventriloquist dummy, \\"Little Caesar\\", has a mind of his own and talks to him at will. Despite Jonathan's reassurances that they are on the verge of a big break, Caesar apathetically tells him that they've hit bottom. When Jonathan and Caesar go to a nightclub for an audition, the performance is poorly received. The following day, Jonathan is unable to find employment because of his lack of vocational experience and immigrant status; he may soon leave the boarding house because he is behind on his rent. Caesar berates Jonathan for being a hopeless \\"clod\\", but has a solution to his money woes: burglary. A reluctant Jonathan‚Äîdirected by Caesar in his suitcase‚Äîbreaks into a delicatessen and steals its money. Jonathan uses it to pay his rent, but Caesar, during a conversation overheard by Susan, pressures him into committing more burglaries. Susan‚Äînow aware that Caesar can talk‚Äîsneaks into Jonathan's room in his absence to unsuccessfully speak with the dummy. Jonathan catches her coming out of the room and runs her off. Inside, Jonathan expresses a desire to flee, but Caesar cajoles him into carrying out the next burglary. The duo sneaks into the nightclub to break into the manager's office. However, they are caught by a night watchman after they steal money from the nightclub's safe. They manage to bluff their way past him by giving an impromptu routine. When Jonathan and Caesar arrive home, Susan eavesdrops on their ensuing argument. The next morning over breakfast, Susan hears her aunt, Mrs. Cudahy, read about the nightclub theft from a newspaper. She calls the police to tip them off about Jonathan and Caesar. Two detectives arrive at the boarding house and interrogate Jonathan, who tries to make Caesar talk about his role in the crime. The dummy, however, remains silent. Mrs. Cudahy and the detectives stare at the one-sided exchange, thinking Jonathan mad. Jonathan now realizes that Caesar has abandoned him, and is willingly arrested. After the detectives lead Jonathan out of the room, Caesar turns his head around and addresses Susan. He says that he likes her for her \\"hip attitude\\" and offers to help her run away to New York City. Caesar assures Susan that Jonathan will now be gone \\"for a long, long time\\" and that the two of them are now \\"a team.\\" Finally, Caesar implies that Susan should kill Mrs. Cudahy with poison darts.

According to Froug, they worked out this episode together. Strassfield is billed in the credits as \\"Adele T. Strassfield\\", not \\"A.T. Strassfield\\" as Zicree inexplicably avers in The Twilight Zone Companion; Serling also announced her as \\"Adele T. Strassfield\\" in a promotional announcement for the episode that aired the previous week. Strassfield is the only woman credited with writing an original teleplay for the original version of The Twilight Zone, though several women received credit for stories that were adapted for the show. She later wrote a first- season episode of Gilligan's Island with executive producer Froug's assistance. The dummy used in this episode to portray \\"Caesar\\" was originally created in the 1940s by puppet maker Revello Petee. The same dummy was used one year earlier in the 1962 Twilight Zone episode, \\"The Dummy\\". A figure of the puppet can be seen at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the dark corner of a barred-off exhibit to the side of one of the elevator exits of the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ride.

The Clubs were subsequently divided into three categories to accommodate the boys in the two early clubs, Sunlight Kids and Rainbows. The Missionettes were founded by the Assemblies of God Women's Ministries in 1956. Purpose  Girls Ministries Clubs are driven by a 5-fold Purpose. * To win girls to Jesus Christ through love and acceptance. * To teach them to obey everything Jesus commanded us‚Äîdeveloping girls spiritually and mentally. * To provide encouragement, support and accountability through lasting Christian relationships. * To provide an environment for girls to develop their gifts and abilities. * To acquaint them with the Great Commission of Jesus Christ our Lord.  Girls Clubs Code  One of the distinctives that sets these clubs apart from other clubs is that there is a code which is the mind-set of all leaders and girls. The Code is Philippians 4:8 -- \\"Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.\\" (NIV)  Club levels  Girls Ministries clubs are organized into three categories of clubs.

The club's reserve team play in the NIFL Development League for under 20s. The club also has a partnership with local youth club Ballyclare Colts, whose sides (from under 11 to under 15) provide players to progress to Comrades' own youth sides at under-17 and under-18 level. The under-18 side play in the IFA Youth League. The club was relegated to IFA Championship 2 in the 2010‚Äì11 season and finished in 6th place in the 2011‚Äì12 season, but the following season brought promotion back to Championship 1 after finishing as runners-up behind Championship 2 winners Knockbreda. One of the club's most famous products was Northern Ireland and Sunderland defender Paddy McNair who attends games when possible. Gareth McAuley, now of Rangers, and Michael Smith (Hearts) both played for the Comrades before switching to professional football.

The bhakri prepared using wheat is coarser than a regular wheat chapati. Bhakri can be either soft or hard in texture, similar to khakhra in respect to hardness. Grains and variants Different types of millets (jowar, bajra, nachni) are the more common grains used for making bhakris. These millet bhakris are popular in the Deccan plateau regions of India (Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka) as well as the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan. In the coastal Konkan and Goa regions of western India rice floor is used for making bhakri. # Jowar bhakri - Jowar bhakris are the most common type of bhakri. The dough is prepared by mixing jowar flour with hot water and then flattened by hand. Jowar roti(Jolad rotti) ‚Äì An easy way # Bajra bhakri - Bajra bhakris are mainly prepared in winter, especially near the festival of Sankrant. The preparation is similar to jowar bhakris. This is normally consumed with chutney and butter. # Nachni bhakri - Nachni bhakhris, or ragi rottis, are made of red finger millets. They are prepared similar to other bhakris. # Rice bhakri - Rice bhakhris are made of rice flour, prepared similarly to other bhakris. They are common in the Konkan region. # Wheat Bhakri - Wheat bhakris are like wheat rotis, but bigger in size and depth with proportionally more oil. Preparations Cooking bhakri over a fire. The dough for bhakri prepared by mixing the flour with small amount of salt in a bowl and knead into a smooth stiff dough, using enough hot water. The dough is split into little balls. The ball is then flattened using one's palms. There are 2 types by which is made. It is either flattened in the plate by palm by pressing or it is made thin by holding the ball in both palms which requires a lot of skill. The tava (pan) is heated and the bhakri is cooked applying little water to the upper surface and spread it all over with the help of the cook's fingers. The other side also cooked on the tava. Once it is prepared, it is roasted in the direct flame on both the sides.Bhakri preparation Serving Bhakri is typically served with yogurt, garlic chutney, Pithla, baingan bharta, thecha (chutney made of green chillies and peanuts), preparations of green leafy vegetables and raw onion. In some parts of north Karnataka it is served with stuffed brinjal curry. In Vidarbha, it is eaten with \\"Zunka\\"- A coarse and thick variant of \\"Pithla.\\" It has traditionally been the rural staple which would be carried to the farm at the crack of dawn and make up for both breakfast and lunch. In the fields, bhakri even used to serve as a plate, on which chutney or thecha was served and eaten together. In the coastal regions, the rice flour bhakris are mainly served with fish curry. In modern days, bhakhris have increasingly been replaced by wheat rotis and phulkas but they still retain popularity in many regions and as specialty dishes.

Unsecured debts are sometimes called signature debt or personal loans. These differ from secured debt such as a mortgage, which is backed by a piece of real estate. In the event of the bankruptcy of the borrower, the unsecured creditors have a general claim on the assets of the borrower after the specific pledged assets have been assigned to the secured creditors. The unsecured creditors usually realize a smaller proportion of their claims than the secured creditors. In some legal systems, unsecured creditors who are also indebted to the insolvent debtor are able (and, in some jurisdictions, required) to set off the debts, so actually putting the unsecured creditor with a matured liability to the debtor in a pre-preferential position. Under risk-based pricing, creditors tend to demand extremely high interest rates as a condition of extending unsecured debt. The maximum loss on a properly-collateralized loan is the difference between the fair market value of the collateral and the outstanding debt. Thus, in the context of secured lending, the use of collateral reduces the size of the \\"bet\\" taken by the creditor on the debtor's creditworthiness. Without collateral, the creditor stands to lose the entire sum outstanding at the point of default and must boost the interest rate to price in that risk. Hence, although sufficiently high interest rates are considered usurious, unsecured loans would not be made at all without them. Unsecured loans are often sought out if additional capital is required although existing (but not necessarily all) assets have been pledged to secure prior debt. Secured lenders more often than not include language in the loan agreement that prevents debtor from assuming additional secured loans or pledging any assets to a creditor.  Examples of unsecured debt = Types of unsecured debt  # Corporate unsecured debt ‚Äì Since this type of debt assumes a greater amount of risk, corporations that have lower bond ratings (such as BBB) are classified as unsecured debt due to their higher default risk. # Personal loan ‚Äì A personal loan is a loan which you can take to meet unspecified financial needs. Today personal loan segment has diverted into many specialised loans.It can be taken for various purpose such as a wedding, traveling, paying education fee, medical emergencies or any undefined reason etc. # Consumer durable loan ‚Äì In the retail sector or e-commerce, a growing number of merchants have embraced point-of-sale financing. It is commonly called consumer finance. On the spot no-cost EMI option is given. Even though, as per the rules and regulations of specific countries, there can never be no cost EMI option. Any lending institute is bound to take interest in some form or the other from you. # Student loans ‚Äì This common type of debt is considered unsecured in many countries, because the loan is usually taken by a student (usually from a graduate or undergraduate level) or his parent / legal guardian to pay tuition fees for the student. The borrower is usually expected to pay back the loan after completion of the course and securing a job. Due to the obvious uncertainty of the student to be able to find a job after he or she completes the course (or at times, even finish it), lenders have very strict criteria for this product. The loan is only given after the lender assesses the student's academic record, the type of course he or she is wishing to pursue and the quality of the university / institute where the student has secured admission for the aforementioned course, in addition to other standard criteria such as the guarantor's credit history, bank account statements, assets and holdings, etc. However, in rare cases, the borrower (usually a parent / legal guardian) of the student can pledge assets against the loan, thereby making it a secured loan. In recent times, a lot of salaried professionals also take loans to complete part time courses or certifications. In such cases however, the loan is not considered to be a student loan ‚Äì it is simply categorized as a general personal loan. National differences= United States  Failure to make a payment on an unsecured debt may ultimately result in reporting the delinquent debt to a credit reporting agency or legal action. However, a nongovernmental unsecured creditor cannot seize any of your assets without a court judgment in the U.S. A creditor must file a complaint in state or federal court before a judgment can be made for or against the borrower. Malaysia In Malaysia, there are personal loans for the private sector and for the government sector. The personal loan interest rate for the private sector is always higher than the government sector because it is of lower risk for the bank to lend to the government sector. The government will pay the salary of the civil servants through a payroll system known as the Biro Angkasa and the bank will deduct the monthly installment of the loan from the civil servant's salary through this system, before the salary is even released. An example of these loans are cooperative loans. Interest rates for personal loans in Malaysia are influenced by either one of these factors: loan amount, loan tenure and income of the applicant. In some cases, the bank will take 2 or even 3 of these factors to decide on the appropriate interest rate to be applied to the personal loan. In 2013, the Malaysian Central Bank introduces a new maximum loan tenure of 10 years for personal loan (previous maximum loan tenure was 25 years).  India  In India, there are several types of Personal Loans provided by Government Banks, Private Banks and NBFCs. Mostly Private Sector Banks and NBFCs provide high rate of Interest than Government Banks. Every Bank Provides Personal Loan on the basis of MCLR factors such as income level, employment history, credit scoring, existing monthly obligations, location / area, and banking transactions. Some times, providing a guarantor or a second person who will share liability of the loan repayment is also possible.

Carl played at the 1st night of Danny Rampling's Shoom night after his return from Ibiza in the summer of 1987, largely seen as the original Balearic / Acid House night in London / the UK. In the 1980s, Cox became a mainstage DJ in the electronica industry. He has performed at numerous clubs and events worldwide and has served as a monthly DJ for BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix. He has hosted a residency known as 'Music is Revolution' every summer season at the world renowned nightclub, Space Ibiza, from 2001 to 2016. He runs the record label, Intec Digital, which was founded in 1999 as Intec Records. Cox also had his own radio show, entitled 'Global'. In 2017 he announced that from February onwards he would no longer work on the show. He has featured his own 'Carl Cox & Friends' stage at many festivals, such as Ultra Music Festival, The BPM Festival and Tomorrowland.  Biography = Early life  At age 15, Cox began working as a mobile DJ, finding a passion for disco music. He began his music career around the same time that Chicago house music found its forefront in the world of dance music. He eventually became known as one of the founders of that sound and was part of the emerging British rave scene. He became renowned for the uncommon practice of three-deck mixing. Cox has performed at clubs such as the Eclipse, Shelley's Laserdome, Sterns Nightclub, Heaven, Sir Henry's, Angels and The Ha√ßienda, as well as raves for Fantazia, Dreamscape, NASA and Amnesia House.  Career  In the early 1990s, he decided that it was time to begin producing music, which is when he released his debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, \\"I Want You (Forever)\\". Cox became known as one of the best \\"celebrity DJs\\" in the world, and he continued to create music, eventually embracing the underground sounds of techno that would soon become very popular. He ran Ultimate Base at the now defunct Velvet Underground club on Charing Cross Road, London in the mid-to late 1990s. Cox also played the Millennium on New Year's Eve 1999 & 1882, by performing in Sydney, Australia, and again in Hawaii after flying back over the International Date Line. He was also global resident DJ for BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix in 1998‚Äì99 and he has also broadcast over a decade's worth of Ibiza live mixes from Space, specifically from 2001 to 2016. In 1997, DJ Magazine chose Cox as the first #1 DJ for its first top 100 poll, which to this day still takes place. Cox formed his own record label, Intec Records in 1998. From 1999 to 2006, Intec Records released a myriad of underground hits and became one of the best in dance music. However, in 2006 he decided to put the label on a brief hiatus and relaunched it in 2010 as Intec Digital. In 1999, Cox starred in the British film Human Traffic as Pablo Hassan, the manager of the Asylum club. In 2004, Cox debuted the Carl Cox & Friends arena at Ultra Music Festival, which has since taken place for twelve years. In the film Can U Feel It?, a documentary about Ultra Music Festival, Cox explains that the concept of Carl Cox & Friends came about as a result of not only wanting to play longer sets at festivals, but also to give festival goers an experience within the festival, as Carl has far more creative control over his own stage. The stage is popular with festival goers, and has featured artists like Laurent Garnier, Nic Fanciulli, Loco Dice, Marco Carola, Maceo Plex and many more. Since he created the Carl Cox & Friends concept in 2004, this curated stage has taken place at other festivals and events including Awakenings, EDC Las Vegas, The BPM Festival, Ultra Europe, Tomorrowland, Amsterdam Dance Event and many others. In 2001, Cox began a yearly residency at Space Ibiza, a nightclub located in Ibiza, Spain. He began playing on the terrace for Space's \\"We Love... Space on the Terrace\\". Following that, he was asked to play on Thursdays inside the club, which he was hesitant about at first. For fifteen years, Cox built his residency entitled \\"Music is Revolution\\". In 2016, he decided to end his yearly seasonal residency at Space Ibiza. In late 2015, Cox announced that 2016 will be his last year hosting a summer residency at Space Ibiza, as the club was closing and he came to the realization that Ibiza is not the same as it used to be. The final season of Cox's residency at Space Ibiza was entitled \\"The Final Chapter\\" and took place every Tuesday during the summer of 2016. Cox finished his residency at Space Ibiza on 20 September 2016 by playing a vinyl and CDJ, ten-hour set. Artists who joined Cox on his final night as part of his residency at Space Ibiza included tINI, Popof, Nic Fanciulli and DJ Sneak. Cox also played at Space Ibiza's closing fiesta on 2 October 2016 with Tale of Us, Anja Schneider, and Darius Syrossian. Cox will star in an upcoming EDM-themed documentary titled What We Started with Martin Garrix showing thirty years of EDM history by focusing mainly on his and Martin Garrix's diverging careers. The documentary is co-written, produced and directed by Bert Marcus alongside executive producer and music supervisor Pete Tong. While it was speculated that he would retire in 2017 after he finished his residency at Space Ibiza, Cox has continued to announce festivals and events for 2017 including three showcases at The BPM Festival, his stage at Ultra Music Festival, and two appearances at the Social Festival in Mexico and Colombia. In 2017, Cox was also named the global ambassador of Ultra Music Festival's techno and house music concept, Resistance. Carl Cox also announced the 2017 dates for a festival he has curated entitled Pure Festival, which took place in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, during April 2017. After sixteen years of Cox's Global radio podcast, he announced via Facebook that he would no longer be working on the show and that it would end in February 2017. For 2020, he announced via the Goodwood website that he would be playing a summer festival DJ set at the first of the Three Friday nights at Goodwood Racecourse with a special dedication to the Lloyds before their departure.

The population of Wasdale was only minimal and, from the 2011 Census is included in the parish of Gosforth. Geographical features On the south-eastern side of the lake are very steep screes below the summits of Whin Rigg and Illgill Head which are more accessible on the far side. The head of the valley is dominated by the Great Gable and Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England, which, along with Scafell, Kirk Fell and Yewbarrow, surround the small community of Wasdale Head. Wasdale is famous amongst rock climbers as the home of British rock climbing. A classic route is Nape's Needle on Great Gable.

Primarily portrayed by Edith Spencer, Aunt Jenny was best known as host and narrator of the long-lived radio show, Aunt Jenny‚Äôs Real Life Stories (January 18, 1937 ‚Äì November 16, 1956), but she was also seen promoting the product in drawings, photographs and cookbooks. Origins In 1936, Lever Brothers, part of the large corporation Unilever, introduced Spry Vegetable Shortening as a competitor to the long-successful shortening Crisco, produced by Procter & Gamble. Aunt Jenny was intended to give a pleasant face to what might otherwise be seen as a boring or at least uninspiring product, therefore presenting a challenge to writers of advertisement copy. Sometimes even Jenny‚Äôs enthusiastic writers seemed to be reaching for things to say‚Äîon the final page of the Aunt Jenny‚Äôs Favorite Recipes cookbook appears a blurb boasting that doughnuts made with Spry are ‚Äúso light and digestible a child can eat ‚Äòem.‚Äù For the most part, however, Aunt Jenny was successful, and within mere months Spry had consumed nearly half of Crisco‚Äôs considerable market share. In appearance, Aunt Jenny was a slightly plump, grandmotherly woman with bright white hair, thin spectacles, and an ever-present baking apron. Her demeanor was sweet, kind, helpful and enthusiastic, especially regarding her home cooking and Spry Vegetable Shortening in particular. She spoke in a plain and homey manner, often dropping the ending g of words like cooking. Radio Aunt Jenny‚Äôs best- remembered aspect was the long-running radio show, Aunt Jenny‚Äôs Real Life Stories, which made its debut on CBS on January 18, 1937. The show took the format of a dramatic serial or soap opera, presenting a different story weekly, and running for 15 minutes from 10:45am to 11:00am each weekday morning. The stories featured typical soap opera plots involving the people of a small American town called Littleton. Aunt Jenny herself was not the focus of these stories but served as host and narrator. She also offered cooking instruction, generally in the form of easy recipes which included Spry Vegetable Shortening as an ingredient. Aunt Jenny was played by Edith Spencer, who served not only as the voice of Jenny but also provided her visual appearance in promotional materials. The announcer of the show was actor Dan Seymour. Animal imitator Henry Boyd provided the warbling of Aunt Jenny‚Äôs canary. Like most soap operas, the show had a large revolving cast over the years, serving as a springboard into professional acting for future stars, such as Richard Widmark. Eventually, Edith Spencer left the show and was replaced by Agnes Young, who sounded reasonably similar to Spencer but did not look like her. Finally, on September 28, 1956, the show‚Äôs long run came to an end. The Major Broadcasting Network produced an Australian version of Aunt Jenny featuring Ethel Lang in the lead role.Richard Lane, The Golden Days of Australian Radio Drama. 1923-1960, 1994, National Film and Sound Archive Canberrahttps://www.nfsa.gov.au/latest/ethel-lang Cookbooks and print advertisements Aunt Jenny also appeared in numerous print ads found in women's magazines, as well as several promotional cookbooks. These were generally illustrated with photographs of Edith Spencer as Jenny, but after Spencer‚Äôs departure from the radio show, they displayed artwork based on her likeness. The character of Aunt Jenny was phased out after the radio show left the air, and Unilever eventually discontinued Spry Vegetable Shortening.

He was born and died in Halle, Belgium. He is one of the founders of the Modern Cellistic Schools of Paris and Madrid, which began with his friend Auguste Franchomme and his disciple V√≠ctor Mirecki Larramat. His compositions are still being studied, performed and recorded all over the world. Biography Potrait of Adrien-Fran√ßois Servais Servais was originally trained as a violinist before switching to the cello. Known by his contemporaries for his virtuosity and excessive vibrato, he was given the gift of a Stradivarius cello from 1701, which today bears his name. He is also known as the first cellist to adopt the bassists' use of an endpin because of the large size of his Stradivarius. (The use of the endpin was, however, not generally adopted by most cellists until the early 20th century. For instance, Carlo Alfredo Piatti never used an endpin, though its use by Lisa Cristiani in the 1840s and 1850s did popularize it for female cellists.) He composed numerous works for his instrument, including four concerti and nearly twenty duos for two cellos or for cello and violin. Hector Berlioz later referred to Servais as \\"the Niccol√≤ Paganini of the cello\\". Some years after his death in 1866, Servais was honored by his home town of Halle, where a statue of him was placed on its central market square by his son-in- law, Professor Cyprian Godebski.

In this episode, a crooked bookie learns that his son has suffered a mortal wound in the Vietnam War, only to encounter a childhood version of his son. This was the first episode of The Twilight Zone to be 25 minutes long since \\"The Changing of the Guard\\". Opening narrationPlot In South Vietnam, medics are examining Pip Phillips, a wounded soldier. The medical officer says Pip's case is hopeless and it is only a matter of time before he will die. In the United States, Pip's father Max, a bookie, suckers a young man into placing $300 on a bad bet. The man comes to him for help, saying that he made the bet on loaned money and will go to jail if he doesn't get it back. Max returns the $300, but his boss notices the discrepancy in the books and summons both Max and the debtor to his office. As the young man is strong-armed into returning his bet, Max receives a telegram about Pip's condition. Max vocally rues the time he spent working as a bookie instead of being a father to his son, and returns the money to the debtor. He tells him to run and threatens his boss and his underling with a knife. The underling shoots Max but Max is still enraged by his son's fate and uses his knife to kill both men. Wounded, he stumbles outside towards a closed amusement park and is surprised to see Pip at age 10. The two have some fun and redress Max's near-constant absence from his son's life, with Max teaching Pip how to shoot at a shooting gallery. Pip runs off into the house of mirrors, and Max follows. When Max finds him, Pip explains that he is dying and vanishes. Max prays to God and offers to trade his own life in exchange for Pip's. He collapses and dies on the midway. Some months later, the adult Pip is seen at the park, now walking with the aid of a cane. Max's former landlady is also there with her granddaughter and recalls Max's love for his son. Pip visits the shooting gallery, remembering the wonderful times he had as a child with his father and his father's advice to work the gun and not the jaw. He proclaims that his father was \\"[his] best buddy\\" as he begins to play the shooting game. Closing narrationEpisode notes The episode was filmed on location at the Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica, California. It is often incorrectly cited as the first American television drama to mention the growing Vietnam War, or the first to show a Vietnam veteran. However, starting in March 1963, actor Glenn Corbett had become a regular on the series Route 66, playing returned Vietnam soldier Lincoln Case. The Vietnam War and its effects on Linc were crucial plot points in several Route 66 episodes, including his debut, which was broadcast six months before this episode. \\"In Praise of Pip\\" opens in Vietnam, with a wounded Pip being brought into a front-line mobile hospital. Rod Serling originally wanted the episode's opening to take place in Laos; it was CBS who asked for the change to Vietnam. Jack Klugman appeared in four episodes of the original series. In addition to this episode, he appeared in \\"Death Ship\\", \\"A Game of Pool\\", and \\"A Passage for Trumpet\\". In addition to this episode, Billy Mumy appeared in two other episodes of the original series: \\"It's a Good Life\\" and \\"Long Distance Call\\". Bill Mumy also appeared in Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), and the second Twilight Zone revival episode \\"It's Still a Good Life\\" in 2003. This was the first episode sponsored by American Tobacco (on alternate weeks), on behalf of Pall Mall cigarettes, who suggested that Serling and some of the guest stars and supporting players \\"light up\\" during the episodes. Unlike previous sponsor Liggett & Myers, American Tobacco did not have Serling plug their products at the end of the program. References *Zicree, Marc Scott. The Twilight Zone Companion.

While only in his teens, Bad Boy Bill began his DJ career in 1985 during the Chicago house music movement of the mid to late 1980s. He worked with Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson and Julian \\"Jumpin\\" Perez of the WBMX DJ mixing team, known then as the Hot Mix 5. Bill's popularity grew out of DJing parties throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, as well as opening for the Hot Mix 5. As a remixer, he landed his first Top Five Billboard Dance Chart hit at the age of 19 ‚Äì Dada Nada's \\"Deep Love\\" which also featured remixes by House music legends Frankie Knuckles & David Morales, Robert Ozn and Steve Wight. Currently, Bad Boy Bill plays music ranging from House to Electro, and is known for playing six separate turntables at once. In 1988 and 1989, he was placed within the top three at the Disco Mix Club championships.  History =Street DJ Promotions era (1987‚Äì1995) Between 1987 and 1995, Bill produced a series of promotional mixtapes under the name \\"Street DJ Promotions.\\" These tapes were distributed out of Bill's car to local Chicago area record shops, flea markets, and DJ gigs. These mixes included: Hot Mix #1‚Äì17, Non-Stop Hip-Hop, Flashbacks Vol. 1 & 2, Classics Vol. 1‚Äì3, Street Style 1 & 2, and Gettin' Wicked. Bill has been credited with the idea of mass-producing mix tapes unlike before, and was apparently inspired by Andre Lopez, owner of the Hot Jams record store. This caught the attention of the Recording Industry Association of America and music publishing houses who were not paid any royalties from the use of copyrighted music on the vast number of mixtapes being produced and sold throughout Chicago by these many DJs. Bill then became a part of the licensed-mix movement and started Mix Connection Multimedia (MCM). He has been generally credited with being the first Chicago DJ to produce legally licensed mixes. Mix Connection Multimedia era (1995‚Äì2001) Bill created MCM in 1995 to produce legally licensed mixes, and as an umbrella company for several side projects and record labels such as International House Records (IHR), Moody Recordings, Contaminated Muzik, Canvas Recordings, and Motus Music. MCM has most notably produced Bangin' The Box Vol. 1‚Äì5, The House Connection (w/ Richard \\"Humpty\\" Vission) Vol. 1‚Äì3, and The B-96 Mixmaster Throwdown Vol. 1‚Äì5.  House Connection (1997‚Äì1998) Bad Boy Bill teamed up with Richard Vission to form a house DJ supergroup called The House Connection. They have released three mix albums, the last in 2013. In May 2006, Bill reunited with Vission in Dallas and Detroit for a two-day reunion show.  Behind The Decks (2003‚Äì2006) In 2003, Bill released a CD/DVD mixtape titled Behind the Decks. In May 2006, to support the Behind the Decks mixtape, Bill embarked on a three-day tour called \\"BTD Live\\". Bill performed in clubs like The Church in Denver and The Avalon in Los Angeles. Audio and video were recorded at all three shows and released as the BTD Live concert film in October 2006. On August 5, 2013, The Official Bad Boy Bill YouTube page released House Connection 3, a free mixtape available to download on Richard Vission's SoundCloud page.

In addition to local construction projects, it also involved in construction and engineering various projects in China and Southeast Asia. History The company originated from a construction business founded in India by John C. Gammon in 1919. In 1955, a branch was engaged to build a new runway at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. In 1958, Gammon Construction Limited (\\"Gammon\\") was formed to establish a permanent presence in Hong Kong. Once incorporated in Hong Kong, it grew rapidly, obtaining construction work of a diverse nature. By the late 1970s, it was established as the leading contractor in Hong Kong, participating in many of the major infrastructure projects of that time. The company began to expand business outside Hong Kong, establishing offices in Singapore and Vietnam. Ownership Jardine Matheson took a minority interest in Gammon in 1969 and it became a public company in 1970. Then in 1975, Jardines acquired the remaining shareholding and thus Gammon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Jardines. In late 1983 Jardine Matheson sold 50 percent of Gammon to Trafalgar House, a UK based company involved in construction, shipping and property. In India, Gammon was taken over in 1991 by Abhijit Rajan. In Pakistan Gammon was taken over by the Bibojee Group. Gammon then became the preferred constructor throughout the Asia-Pacific region for both Jardines and Trafalgar House. In 1996, Kvaerner took over Trafalgar House thereby acquiring its 50% interest in Gammon. Skanska acquired all of Kvaerner's construction businesses, including Gammon, in late 2000. Balfour Beatty, the international engineering, construction and services group, subsequently purchased Skanska's 50% in Gammon in 2004. Notable projects Gammon has been involved in the construction of various major projects in Hong Kong and around the region: * Bukit Panjang LRT line in Singapore completed in 1999 * Chater House in Central, Hong Kong completed in 2002 * Tseung Kwan O line extension in Hong Kong completed in 2002 * One Peking Road in Kowloon, Hong Kong completed in 2003 * Le M√©ridien Cyberport in Southern District, Hong Kong completed in 2004 * Three Pacific Place in Admiralty, Hong Kong completed in 2004 * Maintenance depot on the Ma On Shan line in Hong Kong completed in 2004 * The Disneyland Resort line on the Tsing Chau Tsai Peninsula in Hong Kong completed in 2005 * The northern section of the Kong Sham Western Highway completed in 2007 * One Island East in Eastern District, Hong Kong completed in 2008 * Upgrading of the Woodsville Interchange in Singapore completed in 2008 * Nam Wan Tunnel in Hong Kong completed in 2009 * iSQUARE in Kowloon, Hong Kong completed in 2009 * Institute of Technical Education College West Campus in Singapore completed in 2010 * The Downtown section of the Chinatown MRT station in Singapore completed in 2013 * The Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal at Hong Kong International Airport completed in 2015 * The Midfield Concourse at Hong Kong International Airport completed in 2016 * The northern section of the Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station completed in 2018 * The southern section of the Tuen Mun‚ÄìChek Lap Kok Link completed in 2018 The company is also involved in the construction of the Mayflower MRT station due to be completed in 2020 and Havelock MRT station due to be completed in 2021.

Lincoln often expressed moral opposition to slavery in public and private. \\"If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong\\", he stated in a now-famous quote. \\"I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel.\\" However, the question of what to do about it and how to end it, given that it was so firmly embedded in the nation's constitutional framework and in the economy of much of the country, was complex and politically challenging. As early as the 1850s, Lincoln was attacked as an abolitionist. But while many abolitionists emphasized the sinfulness of individual owners, Lincoln did not, although he did publicly condemn the institution of slavery. Lincoln was married to Mary Todd Lincoln, the daughter of a slaveowner from Kentucky. While William Lloyd Garrison in The Liberator newspaper, and a small but growing group of abolitionists called for total, immediate abolition of slavery (\\"immediatism\\"), Lincoln focused on the practical goal of preventing the creation of new slave states and specifically blocking the expansion of slavery into the new Western territories. Lincoln's 1850s activism on that issue started in reaction to the 1854 Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act designed by his great rival, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln saw the new Act as a great evil that was only brought into being through serious and continued violence on the ground. The Act was a radical departure from the previous law of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 which had strictly banned slavery from all new states north of the 36¬∞30‚Ä≤ parallel (except for Missouri). The new law directly permitted the potential vast expansion of slavery by granting settlers in any territory, for the first time and regardless of its location, the right to decide whether to permit slavery within its boundaries when they applied for it to become an official state in the Union. Lincoln was both opposed to slavery and to its extension on principle, including into any new western territory that was seeking to become a full-fledged state. Lincoln also suggested that if slavery was allowed to spread it would block free labour from settling in the new states and that, as a result, the entire nation would soon become ever more dominated by slave holders. This would be the inevitable result, Lincoln said, because the latter's representation in the US House of Representatives was always significantly weighted and overcounted according to the number of slaves that they held, as dictated by Article One of the US Constitution, leaving free states at an increasing disadvantage in governing the nation as a whole. After Lincoln became President he, with partial compensation to owners, ended slavery in the District of Columbia in 1862 when the abolitionist goal became possible after decades of effort with the departure of the Southern members of Congress at the beginning of the Civil War. In 1861 and 1862, Lincoln tried unsuccessfully to get the loyal border states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland and Missouri to also do so. He repeatedly stated that his goal was the preservation of the Union, not the ending of slavery in those states in which it still existed, but throughout the war he encouraged states to abolish slavery. State abolition plans were adopted in Maryland, Missouri, West Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas before the end of the war. However, Lincoln did not directly force them to abolish slavery during the Civil War because he reasonably feared that, if he did so, they would secede from the Union to join the southern states and that this would result both in the North losing the Civil War and in the continued existence of slavery. In a highly significant departure, Lincoln used his role as commander-in-chief to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, effective January 1, 1863. It was delayed for many months because the North had lost many battles and Lincoln did not want the Proclamation to appear to be a measure born out of desperation as this could affect how European nations conducted their relations with both the Union and the Confederacy; he waited until the North had won a significant battle at Antietam to issue the Proclamation. Under the guise of a military measure, it made all slaves in Confederate areas forever free under US law with immediate effect if the state that they lived in was in rebellion against the United States of America on that day. On its first day, the proclamation freed millions of slaves, but this could only be enforced in those places where the Union army was actually present in the south. Week by week, as the Union army advanced, slaves were liberated. The last were freed in Texas on \\"Juneteenth\\" (June 19, 1865).Randolph B. Campbell, \\"The End of Slavery in Texas\\" Southwestern Historical Quarterly 88.1 (1984): 71-80. The abolition of slavery in two of the border states was effected only by the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which Lincoln had vigorously promoted. Early years Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky.Donald (1996), pp. 20‚Äì22. His family attended a Separate Baptists church, which had strict moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.Donald (1996), pp. 22‚Äì24. The family moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana, where slavery was not allowed, and made a new start in then Perry, now Spencer County, Indiana. Lincoln later noted that this move was \\"partly on account of slavery\\" but mainly due to land title difficulties.Sandburg (1926), p. 20. As a young man, he moved west to the free state of Illinois. On January 27, 1838, Abraham Lincoln's Lyceum address was delivered to the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois,and in the address he spoke about slavery.Abraham Lincoln,Lyceum Address,'\\" January 27, 18389 Seven weeks earlier, a mob in Illinois killed Elijah Lovejoy, a Presbyterian minister and editor of a newspaper with strong anti-slavery views. \\"The mood of Illinois when an angry mob killed Lovejoy was pro-slavery, but not only in Illinois. The state legislatures of Connecticut and New York in the mid-1830s passed resolutions stating that slavery was accepted in the U. S. Constitution and that no state had a right to interfere.\\" Lincoln himself had been one of only six in the Illinois House of Representatives to vote against a resolution saying \\"that the right of property in slaves is sacred. . .(that) we highly disapprove of the formation of abolition societies. . . .that the General Government cannot abolish slavery in the District of Columbia.\\" \\"Six weeks later, he and Representative Dan Stone filed a protest to the passage of the resolution-a rarely used device to register strong disagreement.\\"Paul Simon, \\"Essay on Lincoln's Lyceum Speech\\" In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois. She was the daughter of a slaveholder in Kentucky, but she never owned slaves herself and came to oppose slavery as an adult. 1840s‚Äì1850s=Legal and political Lincoln, the leader most associated with the end of slavery in the United States, came to national prominence in the 1850s, following the advent of the Republican Party, whose official position was that freedom was \\"national,\\" the natural condition of all areas under the direct sovereignty of the Constitution, whereas slavery was \\"exceptional\\" and sectional. Earlier, as a member of the Whig Party in the Illinois General Assembly, Lincoln issued a written protest of the Assembly's passage of a resolution stating that slavery should not be abolished in the District of Columbia. In 1841, he won a court case (Bailey v. Cromwell), representing a black woman, Nance Legins-Costley, and her children who claimed she had already been freed and could not be sold as a slave. One of the earliest examples of Lincoln's written views on slavery comes from an 1845 letter Lincoln wrote to his friend Williamson Durley, concerning the annexation of Texas. In it, Lincoln said he took no position on annexation, but he added \\"It is possibly true, to some extent, that with annexation, some slaves may be sent to Texas and continued in slavery, that otherwise might have been liberated. To whatever extent this may be true, I think annexation an evil.\\" He then explained \\"I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free states, due to the Union of the states, and perhaps to liberty itself (paradox though it may seem) to let the slavery of the other states alone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear, that we should never knowingly lend ourselves directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death---to find new places for it to live in, when it can no longer exist in the old.\\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln1/1:373?rgn=div1;view=fulltext This view, that slavery would be most efficiently curtailed by preventing its expansion rather than direct abolition, would be consistent for Lincoln throughout his political career leading up to his election as President in 1860. In 1845, he successfully defended Marvin Pond (People v. Pond) for harboring the fugitive slave John Hauley. In 1847, he lost a case (Matson v. Rutherford) representing a slave owner (Robert Matson) claiming return of fugitive slaves. While a congressman from Illinois in 1846 to 1848, Lincoln supported the Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.Holzer, p. 63. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter.. (Slavery in the District of Columbia was not ended until 1862, when Lincoln was president and there were no Southern senators.) After leaving Congress in 1849 Lincoln largely ignored politics to concentrate on his law practice. He was drawn back by the firestorm over the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854, which reversed a longstanding compromise and allowed territories to decide for themselves whether they would allow slavery. Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery and politically opposed to any expansion of it. At issue was extension into the western territories. On October 16, 1854, in his \\"Peoria Speech\\", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated in his route to presidency.Thomas (2008), pp. 148‚Äì152. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice,White, p. 199. he said the Kansas Act had a \\"declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world...\\"Basler (1953), p. 255. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford appalled Lincoln. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While its author hoped that Dred Scott would end all disputes over slavery in the favour of southern slave-holders, the decision sparked further outrage in the North. Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy to support the Slave Power and believed that the Dred Scott decision, in combination with the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, would enable slavery to potentially spread into the free states. He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal ‚Äúin certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\". Impressed by the strength of anti-black racism, especially in his home states of Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky, Lincoln concluded because whites would never allow blacks to live in America as equals, they would be better off migrating voluntarily to a colony outside the United States, ideally in Central America or the Caribbean. He had little faith in the program of the American Colonization Society, whose goal was to colonize American blacks in Liberia, on the West African coast. In a speech at Peoria, Illinois (transcribed after the fact by Lincoln himself), : a. : b. : c. : d. Lincoln pointed out the immense difficulties of such a task are an obstacle to finding an easy way to quickly end slavery. In a debate in August 1858, he said: According to historian Paul Escott, Lincoln thus favored a system of gradual emancipation that would allow for controlled management of free Negroes.Escott, Paul (2009)\\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\" University of Virginia Press, p. 25. Letter to Joshua Speed In 1855, Lincoln wrote to Joshua Speed, a personal friend and slave owner in Kentucky: Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates, 1858 Many of Lincoln's public anti-slavery sentiments were presented in the seven Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates of 1858 against his opponent, Stephen Douglas, during Lincoln's unsuccessful campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate (which was decided by the Illinois legislature). Douglas advocated \\"popular sovereignty\\" and self-government, which would give the citizens of a territory the right to decide if slavery would be legal there. Douglas criticized Lincoln as being inconsistent, saying he altered his message and position on slavery and on the political rights of freed blacks in order to appeal to the audience before him, as northern Illinois was more hostile to slavery than southern Illinois. Lincoln stated that Negroes had the rights to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" in the first of the Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates. Publicly, Lincoln said he was not advocating Negro suffrage in his speech's both in Columbus, Ohio on September 16, 1859. and in Charleston, Illinois on September 18, 1858 stating on the latter date: ‚ÄùI will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, [applause]‚Äîthat I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.‚Äù This might have been a strategy speech used to gain voters, as Douglas had accused Lincoln of favoring negroes too much as well. A fragment from Lincoln dated October 1, 1858, refuting theological arguments by Frederick A. Ross in favor of slavery, reads in part, \\"As a good thing, slavery is strikingly perculiar [sic], in this, that it is the only good thing which no man ever seeks the good of, for himself. Nonsense! Wolves devouring lambs, not because it is good for their own greedy maws, but because it is good for the lambs!!!\\" 1860 Republican presidential nomination \\"The Rail Candidate\\": Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue‚Äîa slave on the left and party organization on the right. The Republican Party was committed to restricting the growth of slavery, and its victory in the election of 1860 was the trigger for secession acts by Southern states. The debate before 1860 was mainly focused on the Western territories, especially Kansas and the popular sovereignty controversy. Lincoln was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in the election of 1860. Lincoln was opposed to the expansion of slavery into new areas, but agreed with nearly all Americans, including most radical abolitionists, that the federal government was prevented by the Constitution from abolishing slavery in states where it already existed. His plan was to halt the spread of slavery, and to offer monetary compensation to slave-owners in states that agreed to end slavery (see Compensated emancipation). He was considered a moderate within a Republican party that, nevertheless, took the radical position that slavery should be put on a course of \\"ultimate extinction\\" with the help of the federal government. As President-elect in 1860 and 1861 In a letter to Senator Lyman Trumbull on December 10, 1860, Lincoln wrote, \\"Let there be no compromise on the question of extending slavery.\\" In a letter to John A. Gilmer of North Carolina of December 15, 1860, which was soon published in newspapers, Lincoln wrote that the 'only substantial difference' between North and South was that 'You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted.' Lincoln repeated this statement in a letter to Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia on Dec. 22, 1860 On December 15, 1860, Kentucky Senator John J. Crittenden proposed the Crittenden Compromise, a series of constitutional amendments intended to coax the Confederate states into returning to the Union. President-elect Lincoln rejected the Crittenden Compromise out of hand because it would have permitted the expansion of slavery, stating \\"I will suffer death before I will consent or will advise my friends to consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege of taking possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.\\"https://www.coursehero.com/file/p74j1c8/Washburne-on- December-13-1860-Prevent-as-far-as-possible-any-of-our-friends/ On February 22, 1861, at a speech in Independence Hall, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lincoln reconfirmed that his convictions sprang from the sentiment expressed in the Declaration of Independence, which was also the basis of the continued existence of the United States since that time, namely, the \\"principle or idea\\" \\"in that Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time. (Great applause.) It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance. (Cheers.)\\" Presidency (1861‚Äì1865)=Corwin amendment The proposed Corwin amendment was passed by Congress before Lincoln became President and was ratified by two states, but was abandoned once the Civil War began. It would have reaffirmed what historians call the Federal Consensus‚Äîthe nearly universal belief that under the Constitution the federal government had no power to abolish slavery in a state where it already existed. In his First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861, Lincoln explained that while he had not seen the amendment and took no position on amendments in general, \\"holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.\\" The Corwin amendment was a late attempt at reconciliation but it was doomed to fail because southerners knew that it would not stop the federal government from adopting a host of antislavery policies, without actually violating the Federal Consensus.Jenkins, Sally, and John Stauffer. The State of Jones. New York: Anchor Books edition/Random House, 2009 (2010). , p. 72Daniel W. Crofts, Lincoln and the Politics of Slavery: The Other Thirteenth Amendment and the Struggle to Save the Union (2016). Building a demand for emancipation Lincoln's long-term goal was to apply federal pressure on the slave states to get them to abolish slavery on their own, beginning with the four loyal, non-seceding border states of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri. But he also warned that if the slave states seceded from the Union they would forfeit the constitutional protection of slavery, including any claim to the recovery of their fugitive slaves. The American Civil War began in April, 1861, and by the end of May the Lincoln administration approved a policy of not returning fugitive slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states. Such slaves were deemed \\"contraband of war,\\" or \\"contrabands.\\" On August 6, 1861, Congress declared the forfeiture of contraband to be permanent by passing the first of the Confiscation Acts, and two days later Lincoln's War Department issued instructions emancipating all the slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states or owners. By the end of the year thousands of slaves were being emancipated. So as not to alienate the border states, Lincoln was careful to ensure that his generals followed the letter of the law. He encouraged General James K. Lane in western Missouri to emancipate thousands of slaves of disloyal masters who came voluntarily within his lines. But in eastern Missouri, when General John C. Fremont issued a decree emancipating the slaves of disloyal owners in areas the Union did not control, Lincoln ordered the general to revise his decree to conform with the law. Lincoln promoted Lane to Brigadier General, but would later fire Fremont for corruption and military incompetence. In western Missouri Lincoln replaced Fremont with an abolitionist general, David Hunter. The care Lincoln took to distinguish legal from extra-legal emancipation was reaffirmed in May, 1862, when Hunter issued two emancipation proclamations from the area his troops recently occupied off the coast of Georgia. The first proclamation, which was legal, freed all the slaves who came within his lines. The second proclamation freed all the slaves in states, most of them beyond the reach of the Union Army. That second proclamation, like Fremont's, went beyond the law and Lincoln once again reversed it. By the end of 1861 tens of thousands of slaves were emancipated as they came into Union lines at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, the Sea Islands off South Carolina, and in western Missouri. In December the Lincoln administration announced its emancipation policy in a series of annual reports by the president as well as several of his cabinet secretaries. By January Lincoln himself declared that no federal authority, civil or military, could legally return fugitive slaves to their owners. By then the sentiment for a more radical approach to emancipation had been building, and in July Congress authorized the president to issue a more general emancipation proclamation, freeing all the slaves in all areas in rebellion. A few days after Lincoln signed the law‚Äîknown as the Second Confiscation Act‚Äîhe drafted the first version of what would become his Emancipation Proclamation. Because the Constitution could sanction emancipation only as one of the war powers, freeing slaves could only be justified as a means of winning the war and suppressing the Southern rebellion. As a result, until the very end of the war Lincoln claimed that the purpose of the war was the restoration of the Union. Southern leaders denounced Lincoln as a bloodthirsty revolutionary whose emancipation policies proved that the secessionists were right all along about those they labeled \\"Black Republicans.\\" Northern Democrats, meanwhile, denied that emancipation was a \\"military necessity,\\" as Lincoln and the Republicans claimed it was. But Lincoln never deviated from his official position, that because the Constitution recognized slavery in the states the only constitutional justification for freeing slaves was the restoration of the Union. All throughout 1862, the Lincoln administration took several direct actions against slavery. On April 16, Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, which abolished slavery in Washington DC. A few months later on June 19, Congress banned slavery in all federal territories, fulfilling Lincoln's 1860 campaign promise to ban the expansion of slavery.http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/freeterr.htm On July 17, Congress passed the second of the Confiscation Acts. While the initial act did not make any determination on the final status of escaped slaves who fled to Union lines, the second Confiscation act did, stating escaped or liberated slaves belonging to anyone who participated in or supported the rebellion \\"shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.\\" The act also prohibited anyone in the military from returning escaped slaves to their masters, even if the slaves had escaped from a Union slave state.http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/conact2.htm Letter to Greeley  On August 22, 1862 Lincoln published a letter in response to an editorial by Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune, in which the editor asked why Lincoln had not yet issued an emancipation proclamation, as he was authorized to do by the Second Confiscation Act. In his reply Lincoln differentiated between \\"my view of official duty\\" ‚Äî that is, what he can do in his official capacity as President ‚Äî and his personal views. Officially he must save the Union above all else; personally he wanted to free all the slaves: Emancipation Proclamation 1864 Reproduction of Emancipation Proclamation Just one month after writing this letter, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which announced that at the beginning of 1863, he would use his war powers to free all slaves in states still in rebellion as they came under Union control. Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer wrote in this context about Lincoln's letter: \\"Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator.\\"Harold Holzer, Dear Mr. Lincoln: Letters to the President, Southern Illinois University Press, 2006, p. 162 Historian Richard Striner argues that \\"for years\\" Lincoln's letter has been misread as \\"Lincoln only wanted to save the Union.\\" However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time. In his 2014 book, Lincoln's Gamble, journalist and historian Todd Brewster asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war‚Äînot as the mission itself. But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, Edward Bates, for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re- enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the Dred Scott decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment. But a constitutional amendment has to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. There were too many slave states and not enough free states for a constitutional amendment to be ratified, so even as he was preparing to issue his Emancipation Proclamation he proposed a series of constitutional amendments that would make it easier for the federal government to pressure states to abolish slavery on their own, including compensation, a gradual timetable for abolition, and subsidies for blacks willing to colonize themselves outside the United States. None of those constitutional amendments came close to passage. But by 1863 Lincoln had other ways of pressuring the state to abolish slavery: By refusing to return slaves who escaped from loyal masters in loyal states, and by enlisting slaves from loyal states into the Union Army with the promise of emancipation, the Lincoln administration systematically undermined slavery in many of the southern states. Lincoln had begun pressuring the Border States to abolish slavery in November, 1861, with no success. In 1862 he began to warn the states that if they did not abolish slavery on their own, the institution would succumb to the \\"incidents of war\\" and would be undermined by \\"mere friction and abrasion.\\" But the abrasive was no mere incident; it was the policy of emancipation. Beginning in mid-1863 Lincoln intensified the pressure on all the slave states, and in early 1864 the policy began to pay off. Between January, 1864, and January, 1865, three slave states abolished slavery, all under intense pressure from the federal government. By the time the House of Representatives sent the Thirteenth Amendment to the states for ratification the ratio of free to slave states was 27: 9, or three-quarters. West Virginia Early in the war, several counties in Western Virginia that were loyal to the Union formed the Restored Government of Virginia and applied for statehood into the Union. Lincoln required them to have a plan for gradual emancipation as a condition of statehood. In response, West Virginia passed the \\"Willey Amendment\\", which declared \\"The children of slaves born within the limits of this State after the fourth day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, shall be free; and all slaves within this state who shall, at the time aforesaid, be under the age of ten years, shall be free when they arrive at the age of twenty-one years; and all slaves over ten and under twenty-one years shall be free when they arrive at the age of twenty-five years; and no slave shall be permitted to come into the State for permanent residence therin.\\".http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/willeyamendment.html Lincoln considered this satisfactory and West Virginia was granted statehood on June 20, 1863. West Virginia went on to fully abolish slavery on February 3, 1865, roughly three months before the end of the war.http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0203.html#:~:text=On%20February%203%2C%201865%2C%20the,abolishing%20slavery%20in%20the%20state. Conkling letter Lincoln came to appreciate the role that black troops played in this process. In the end some 180,000 blacks served in the Union Army, a disproportionate number of them from the states that ended up abolishing slavery. He made his feeling clear in an eloquent letter a year later to James C. Conkling in August 26, 1863.Allen C. Guelzo, \\"Defending emancipation: Abraham Lincoln and the Conkling letter, 1863.\\" Civil War History 48#4 (2002), p. 313+. onlineFor the full text see Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Donald Yacovone, eds. Lincoln on Race and Slavery (2009) pp 284-290. The timing of the Conkling letter came in August 1863, the month after two great Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, but also at a time when Americans were reading the first reports of black troops fighting courageously in battles at Milliken's Bend and Battery Wagner. It was also in the summer of 1863 that Lincoln initiated his intensified effort to get various slave states to abolish slavery on their own. Lincoln addresses the changes to his positions and actions regarding emancipation in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges.Cuomo and Holzer, Lincoln on Democracy, 1990, \\"If Slavery is not wrong, nothing is Wrong\\", pp. 316‚Äì318 In that letter, Lincoln states his ethical opposition to slavery, writing, \\"I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel. ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling.\\" Lincoln further explained that he had eventually determined that military emancipation and the enlistment of black soldiers were necessary for the preservation of the Union, which was his responsibility as President. Having won re-election to the presidency in November 1864 on a platform of abolishing slavery, Lincoln and several members of his cabinet embarked on a sustained lobbying effort to get the abolition amendment through the House of Representatives. The amendment abolishing slavery everywhere in the United States was ratified by every state that had abolished slavery during the war, and it became part of the Constitution in December, 1865. Reconstruction In December 1863, Lincoln used his war powers and issued a \\"Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction\\", which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting population.Vorenberg, Final Freedom (2001), p. 47. Before the end of the war, Louisiana.https://www.crt.state.la.us/louisiana-state-museum/online- exhibits/the-cabildo/reconstruction-a-state-divided/index Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and West Virginia, abolished slavery.http://edu.lva.virginia.gov/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/convention As Lincoln began to be concerned about the 1864 presidential election and the potential for a new administration to stop emancipation, he turned to Frederick Douglass. He asked Douglass to \\"devis[e] some means of making [slaves in the South] acquainted with [emancipation], and . . . bring[] them into our lines\\", thereby making emancipation an accomplished fact before a potential next administration could take office. Thirteenth Amendment When Lincoln accepted the nomination for the Union party for President in June, 1864, he called for the first time for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to immediately abolish slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. He wrote in his letter of acceptance that \\"it would make a fitting and necessary conclusion\\" to the war and would permanently join the causes of \\"Liberty and Union.\\" He won re-election on this platform in November, and in December, 1864, Lincoln worked to have the House approve the amendment. When the House passed the 13th amendment on January 31, 1865, Lincoln signed the amendment, although this was not a legal requirement, and said in a speech the next day, \\"He thought all would bear him witness that he had never shrunk from doing all that he could to eradicate slavery by issuing an emancipation proclamation.\\" He pointed out that the emancipation proclamation did not complete the task of eradicating slavery; \\"But this amendment is a King's cure for all the evils [of slavery].\\"Cuomo and Holzer, Lincoln on Democracy, 1990, pp. 338‚Äì340Gienapp, William E., \\"Abraham Lincoln and the Border States\\". Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association, Vol. 13 (1992), pp. 13-46. in JSTORHoffecker, Carol E. \\"Abraham Lincoln and Delaware\\". Delaware History (2008) Vol. 32, No. 3, pp. 155‚Äì170. Second inaugural address Lincoln, having gotten the constitutional amendment to abolish slavery through Congress, began his second term. He discussed slavery throughout his second inaugural address, describing it as not only the cause of the civil war, but that slavery considered as an offence to God, drew God's righteous judgement against the entire nation. Compensated emancipation: buy out the slave owners The thirteenth amendment to abolish slavery, which Lincoln ultimately sent to the states provided no compensation but earlier in his presidency, Lincoln made numerous proposals for \\"compensated emancipation\\" in the loyal border states whereby the federal government would purchase all of the slaves and free them. No state government acted on the proposal. President Lincoln advocated that slave owners be compensated for emancipated slaves. On March 6, 1862 President Lincoln, in a message to the U.S. Congress, stated that emancipating slaves would create economic \\"inconveniences\\" and justified compensation to the slave owners. The resolution was adopted by Congress; however, the Southern states refused to comply. On July 12, 1862 President Lincoln, in a conference with Congressmen from Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri, encouraged their respective states to adopt emancipation legislation that gave compensation to the slave owners. On July 14, 1862 President Lincoln sent a bill to Congress that allowed the Treasury to issue bonds at 6% interest to states for slave emancipation compensation to the slave owners. The bill was never voted on by Congress.Lowell H. Harrison, \\"Lincoln and Compensated Emancipation in Kentucky.\\" in Douglas Cantrell et al. eds., Kentucky through the Centuries: A Collection of Documents and Essays (2005).Aaron Astor, Rebels on the Border: Civil War, Emancipation, and the Reconstruction of Kentucky and Missouri (LSU Press, 2012). As late as the Hampton Roads Conference in 1865, Lincoln met with Confederate leaders and proposed a \\"fair indemnity\\", possibly $500,000,000, in compensation for emancipated slaves. Colonization One of several failed colonization attempts during Lincoln's presidency was on √éle √† Vache off the coast of Haiti. Colonization of freed slaves was long seen by many as an answer to the problem of slavery. One of President Abraham Lincoln's policies during his administration was the voluntary colonization of African American freedmen; he firmly opposed compulsory colonization, and in one instance ordered the Secretary of War to bring some colonized blacks back to the United States. The Pre-Emancipation Proclamation offered support for the colonization of free blacks outside of the United States. Historians have debated and have remained divided over whether Lincoln's racial views (or merely his acceptance of the political reality) included that African Americans could not live in the same society as white Americans due to racism. Benjamin Butler stated that Lincoln in 1865 firmly denied that \\"racial harmony\\" would be possible in the United States.Magness and Page (2011), Colonization After Emancipation: Lincoln and the Movement for Black Resettlement, chapter 11. One view (known to scholars as the \\"lullaby\\" theory) is that Lincoln adopted colonization for Freedmen in order to make his Emancipation Proclamation politically acceptable. This view has been challenged with new evidence of the Lincoln administration's attempts to colonize freedmen in British Honduras after the Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863. =Bureau of Emigration= President Lincoln supported colonization during the Civil War as a practical response to newly freed slaves. At his urging, Congress included text in the Confiscation Act of 1862 indicating support for Presidential authority to recolonize consenting African Americans. With this authorization, Lincoln created an agency to direct his colonization projects. At the suggestion of Lincoln, in 1862, Congress appointed $600,000 to fund and created the Bureau of Emigration in the U.S. Department of the Interior. To head that office Lincoln appointed the energetic Reverend James Mitchell, a leader of the American Colonization Party.Magness & Page, Emancipation After Colonization (2011), p. 4. Lincoln had known Mitchell since 1853, when Mitchell visited Illinois. Mitchell's Washington D.C.'s office was in charge of implementing Lincoln's voluntary colonization policy of African Americans. In his annual December message to Congress that year (his second \\"State of the Union\\" Message), he reiterated his strong support for government expenditure on colonization for those who wanted to go, but he also noted that objections to free blacks remaining in the United States were baseless, \\"if not sometimes malicious.\\" In 1862, Lincoln mentioned colonization favorably in his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Much concerning the controversial Bureau of Emigration is unknown today, as Mitchell's papers that kept record of the office were lost after his death in 1903. =Chiriqu√≠ Improvement Company= President Lincoln first proposed, in October of 1861, a colony for blacks in what is today Panama. Several hundred acres of Chiriqu√≠ Province (then a part of Gran Colombia) had in 1855 been granted to the Chiriqu√≠ Improvement Company for coal mining. The Company supplied the US Navy with half-price coal during the war, but required more workers.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 3‚Äì4. \\"As early as October, 1861, Lincoln proposed colonizing Negroes on the Chiriqu√≠ Improvement Company grant in the district of Panama. In 1855 the company had gained control of several hundred thousand acres of rich coal land on the Isthmus of Panama. During the war the company contracted to provide the Navy Department with coal at one half the cost in the United States. In order to meet the demands of the Department of the Navy the company needed laborers for its coal mines. Congress gravitated towards this plan in mid-1862, and Lincoln appointed Kansas Senator Samuel Pomeroy to oversee it. Pomeroy promised 40 acres and a job to willing blacks, and chose 500 of 13,700 who applied.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 4. Lincoln signed a contract with businessman Ambrose W. Thompson, the owner of the land, and made plans to send tens of thousands of African Americans. Pomeroy secured $25,000 from Congress to pay for transportation and equipment. The plan was suspended in early October 1862 before a single ship sailed though, apparently due to diplomatic protests from neighboring Central American governments and the uncertainty raised by the Colombian Civil War (1860‚Äì1862). The plan also violated the 1850 Clayton‚ÄìBulwer Treaty prohibiting US and UK colonization of Central America. Lincoln hoped to overcome these complications by having Congress make provision for a treaty for African-American emigration, much as he outlined in his Second Annual Message of December 1, 1862, but the Chiriqu√≠ plan appears to have died over the New Year of 1863 as revelations of the corrupt interest of his acquaintance Richard W. Thompson and Secretary of the Interior John Palmer Usher likely proved too much to bear in political terms. =Ile √† Vache= In December 1862, Lincoln signed a contract with businessman Bernard Kock to establish a colony on the Ile √† Vache, an island of Haiti. 453 freed slaves departed for the island from Fort Monroe, Virginia. A government investigation had deemed Kock untrustworthy, and Secretary of State William Seward stopped the plan from going forward after learning of Kock's involvement.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 5. Poor planning, an outbreak of smallpox, and financial mismanagement by Kock left the colonists under-supplied and starving, according to early reports. 292 colonists remained on Ile √† Vache in 1865; 73 had moved to Aux Cayes on Haiti. The United States Navy arrived to rescue survivors after less than one year on the island. =British West Indies= In addition to Panama and Haiti, Mitchell's office also oversaw attempts at colonization in British Honduras and elsewhere in the British West Indies. Lincoln believed that by dealing with the comparatively stable British Government, he could avoid some of the problems that plagued his earlier attempts at colonization with private interests. He signed an agreement on June 13, 1863, with John Hodge of British Honduras that authorized colonial agents to recruit ex-slaves and transport them to Belize from approved ports in Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston.Phillip W. Magness and Sebastian N. Page, Colonization after Emancipation: Lincoln and the Movement for Black Resettlement (University of Missouri Press: 2011), Chapter 3 Later that year the Department of the Interior sent John Willis Menard, a free African-American clerk who supported colonization, to investigate the site for the government. British authorities pulled out of the agreement in December, fearing it would disrupt their position of neutrality in the Civil War. No ex-slaves were resettled there.Magness and Page, Colonization after Emancipation, Chapter 5. The question of when Lincoln abandoned colonization, if ever, has aroused debate among historians.For a summary of this debate see Sebastian N. Page, \\"Lincoln on Race,\\" American Nineteenth Century History, Vol. 11, No. 1, March 2010 The government funded no more colonies after the rescue of the Ile a Vache survivors in early 1864, and Congress repealed most of the colonization funding that July. Whether Lincoln's opinion had changed is unknown. He left no surviving statements in his own hand on the subject during the last two years of his presidency, although he apparently wrote Attorney General Edward Bates in November 1864 to inquire whether earlier legislation allowed him to continue pursuing colonization and to retain Mitchell's services irrespective of the loss of funding.Phillip W. Magness and Sebastian N. Page, Colonization after Emancipation: Lincoln and the Movement for Black Resettlement (University of Missouri Press: 2011), p. 98Bates to Lincoln, Opinion on James Mitchell, November 30, 1864, Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress, Retrieved 2011-11-17 An entry in the diary of presidential secretary John Hay dated July 2, 1864, says that Lincoln had \\"sloughed off\\" colonization, though without much elaboration.Michael Burlingame and John R. Ettlinger, eds., Inside Lincoln's White House: The Complete Civil War Diary of John Hay (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1999) In a later report, General Benjamin F. Butler claimed that Lincoln approached him in 1865 a few days before his assassination, to talk about reviving colonization in Panama.Benjamin F. Butler, Autobiography and Personal Reminiscences of Major General Benjamin F. Butler (Boston: A. M. Thayer, 1892), p. 903 Historians have long debated the validity of Butler's account, as it was written many years after the fact and Butler was prone to exaggeration of his own exploits as a general.Mark E. Neely, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Black Colonization: Benjamin Butler's Spurious Testimony,\\" Civil War History 25 (1979), pp. 77‚Äì83 Recently discovered documents prove that Butler and Lincoln did indeed meet on April 11, 1865, though whether and to what extent they talked about colonization is not recorded except in Butler's account.Phillip W. Magness, \\"Benjamin Butler's Colonization Testimony Reevaluated\\" . Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association, Vol. 29, No. 1, Summer 2008 On that same day, Lincoln gave a speech supporting voting-rights for black men who had served in the military, as well as for literate black men. Much of the present debate revolves around whether to accept Butler's story. If rejected, then it appears that Lincoln \\"sloughed off\\" colonization at some point in mid-1864. If it is accepted, then Lincoln remained a colonizationist at the time of his death. This question is compounded by the unclear meaning of Hay's diary, and another article by Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, which suggests that Lincoln intended to revive colonization in his second term. In either case, the implications for understanding Lincoln's views on race and slavery are strong.Gates, Henry Louis, Jr. Lincoln on Race and Slavery Princeton University Press, 2009, foreword Citizenship and limited suffrage In his second term as president, on April 11, 1865, Lincoln gave a speech in which, for the first time publicly, he promoted voting rights for blacks. John Wilkes Booth, a Southerner and outspoken Confederate sympathizer, attended the speech and became determined to kill Lincoln for supporting citizenship for blacks.Swanson, James. Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer. Harper Collins, 2006. p. 6 Booth is reported to have remarked: \\"That is the last speech he will make.\\" He shot and killed Lincoln three days later. In analyzing Lincoln's position historian Eugene H. Berwanger notes: Views on African Americans Known as the Great Emancipator, Lincoln was a complicated figure who wrestled with his own views on race. Through changing times, successive generations have interpreted Lincoln's views on African Americans differently. According to Henry Louis Gates Jr.: \\"To apply 20th century beliefs and standards to an America of 1858 and declare Abraham Lincoln a 'racist' is a faulty formula that unfairly distorts Lincoln's true role in advancing civil and human rights. By the standards of his time, Lincoln's views on race and equality were progressive and truly changed minds, policy and most importantly, hearts for years to come.\\" Lincoln's primary audience was white voters. Lincoln's views on slavery, race equality, and African American colonization are often intermixed. During the 1858 debates with Stephen Douglas, Lincoln expressed his then view that he believed whites were superior to blacks. Lincoln stated he was against miscegenation and allowing blacks to serve as jurors. While president, as the American Civil War progressed, Lincoln advocated or implemented anti-slavery policies including the Emancipation Proclamation and limited suffrage for African Americans. Former slave and leading abolitionist Frederick Douglass unequivocally regarded Lincoln as sharing \\"the prejudices of his white fellow-country-men against the Negro\\", but also observed of Lincoln that \\"in his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color.\\"Douglass, pp. 259‚Äì260. Douglass attested to Lincoln's genuine respect for him and other blacks and to the wisdom of Lincoln's course of action in obtaining both the preservation of the Union (his sworn duty as president) and the freeing of the slaves. In an 1876 speech at the unveiling of the Freedmen's Monument in Memory of Abraham Lincoln (later renamed the Emancipation Memorial), he defended Lincoln's actions: In his past, Lincoln lived in a middle-class, racially mixed neighborhood of Springfield, Illinois; one of his long-time neighbors, Jameson Jenkins (who may have been born a slave), had come from North Carolina and was publicly implicated in the 1850s as a Springfield conductor on the underground railroad, sheltering escaped slaves. In 1861, Lincoln called on Jenkins to give him a ride to the train depot, where Lincoln delivered his farewell address before leaving Springfield for the last time.

Anthony Quinn and Yoko Tani star, with Lee Montague, Marco Guglielmi, Carlo Giustini, Anthony Chinn, and Michael Chow in supporting roles, alongside Peter O' Toole in his film debut. It was adapted from the novel Top of the World by Swiss writer Hans R√ºesch. The film was an international co-production, with British, Italian and French interests involved; in the United States it was released by Paramount Pictures. The film was shot on-location in the Canadian Arctic, with interiors shot in Britain's Pinewood Studios and in Rome's Cinecitt√† studios. It was entered in the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Plot summary An Inuk hunter kills a Christian missionary who rejects his traditional offer of food and his wife's company. Pursued by white policemen, the Inuk saves the life of one of them, resulting in a final confrontation in which the surviving cop must decide between his commitment to law enforcement and his gratitude to the Inuk. The film's themes include Inuit survival in the extreme arctic wilderness, as well as their raw existence and struggle to maintain their lifestyle against encroaching civilization.

Its height is 649 m (2128 ft). There are several walking routes to the summit. Topography The headwaters of the Esk and Duddon are separated by a ridge falling south west from the summit of Crinkle Crags. This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for 15 miles, finally meeting the sea on the slopes of Black Combe. From Crinkle Crags the first fells on this ridge are Hard Knott and Harter Fell, separated by Hardknott Pass. From Harter Fell the ridge continues over Green Crag, Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow and Black Combe. Alfred Wainwright considered the latter hills unworthy of inclusion in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, stating that \\"south and west from Green Crag the scenery quickly deteriorates. This summit has therefore been taken as the boundary of fellwalking country.\\" Later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding and the remainder of the range to their main volumes.Richards, Mark: Southern Fells: Collins (2003): Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland. From the top of the pass a complex series of grassy knolls firms up into a ridge bearing south westward. This steps upward, first over Horsehow Crags and then the impressive gable-end of Demming Crag, before reaching the summit area. Further outcropping rock occurs on all sides, although little of it is of interest to climbers. Notable features are Maiden Castle, Brandy Crag and Mart Crag to the south east and Kepple Crag to the south. To the southwest is a broad and marshy saddle leading onto Green Crag and the moorlands of Birker Fell, the ongoing watershed. The southern and eastern flanks are heavily forested with conifers, legions of Forestry Commission trees sweeping down into the Duddon valley. Harter Fell appears in most views as a conical hill, unsurprising given its broadly circular contours. Wainwright paid it perhaps the ultimate accolade, stating that \\"Not many fells can be described as beautiful, but the word fits Harter Fell, especially so when viewed from Eskdale.\\".Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 4: Summit The summit area bears three rocky tors, the middle one of which is the highest. An Ordnance Survey triangulation column stands on the western outcrop. From its summit each of the ring of fells known as the Eskdale Horseshoe can be clearly seen: Sca Fell, Scafell Pike, Broad Crag, Great End, Esk Pike, Bow Fell and Crinkle Crags. To the south are the sands of the Duddon estuary and Morecambe Bay, and to the west the Irish Sea and Isle of Man. * Panorama Geology Harter Fell offers excellent insights into the structure and composition of the Birker Fell formation of the Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group. The fell is dominantly composed of composite andesite lava flows, with autobrecciated upper surfaces developed in some locations. These are often seen in the field as flat surfaces above steep crags, the crags themselves being formed due to the more crystalline, lower portions of each flow. The dip slope on these flows (~24¬∞ WSW) suggests that the formation is in nearly the same orientation now as when it formed. The summit of the fell is composed of one such lava flow, but only a few metres down slope the underlying lava flow is a portion of the Great Whinscale Dacite. This local marker unit conformably overlies an andesitic lapilli tuff and the Little Stand Tuff, a nodular rhyolitic ignimbrite. Below these distinctive rock units the andesite lava flows are seen again. On the northern side of the fell, at approximately 520 - 540 m elevation, a volcaniclastic sandstone unit is intercalated between the flows. Also on the northern slopes of the fell, and lower still at between 450 - 500 m, the lava flows switch to dacitic composition, with distinctive euhedral plagioclase feldspar phenocrysts (1 - 4 mm). The southern slopes of the fell again display the Great Whinscale dacite-tuff sequence, owing to extensive faulting. The very lowest slopes of the fell again revert to andesitic lava flows. In the north-western corner, near the Spothow Gill, a small vein of copper mineralisation has been worked out, and some of the evidence of this Victorian-era mining activity can still be seen. Ascents From Eskdale Harter Fell can be climbed from Jubilee Bridge in the west or from the summit of Hardknott Pass in the east. From the Duddon, walkers can make use of the car parking at Birks Bridge. This provides a reasonably direct line from the west. An alternative is to start from Fickle Steps and circuit clockwise around the fell to join the path from Jubilee Bridge. Harter Fell forms the final challenge in the Woolpack walk when tackled in its usual direction.

Though he played with the Indianapolis Symphony in 1938, he abandoned his orchestral life shortly thereafter to focus on his increasingly successful compositional career (which earned him two Guggenheim Fellowships during this period). In 1942 he joined the faculty at Yale University as conductor of the university band and instructor of wind instruments, where he began his studies with Hindemith. He also taught at Cornell University and University of Illinois before accepting a position at Smith College, which he held until his death. Notable works include his two woodwind quintets (from 1955 and 1957), a bassoon sonata, the 1963 \\"Quintet for Brass Instruments\\", and \\"Fragments\\" for woodwind quartet.

Amongst them all, her relationship with him lasted the longest. Early life Born in 1442, most likely in Mantua, Vannozza moved to Rome where she was landlady of several inns (Osterie), at first in the Borgo, then in Campo de' Fiori. Before becoming Borgia's mistress, she allegedly had a relationship with Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future Pope Julius II. Relationship with Rodrigo de Borgia Vannozza's relationship with Cardinal Rodrigo de Borgia began sometime between 1466 and 1472. She is believed to have married Domenico d'Arignano, an officer of the Church, perhaps in 1473, possibly at the arrangement of Borgia. She bore four children whom Borgia openly acknowledged as his: * Cesare (1475-1507) * Giovanni (1476-1497), 2nd Duke of Gandia * Lucrezia (1480-1519) * Gioffre (born 1481 or 1482; died 1518) Domenico died before Giovanni was born. In 1480 Borgia arranged Vannozza's marriage to Giorgio di Croce, for whom he had procured a position as apostolic secretary. During the marriage to Giorgio, Vannozza had a son, Ottavio, who did not live long. In 1486 Giorgio died and Vannozza married Carlo Canale. Later life After his elevation to the papacy, Borgia's passion for Vannozza somewhat diminished, and she subsequently led a very retired life. However, Borgia's love for his children by Vannozza remained as strong as ever; it proved, indeed, the determining factor of his whole career. He lavished vast sums on them and lauded them with every honour. She too, remained the matriarch of the Borgia family, and influential during the papacy of Rodrigo Borgia. Vannozza died in 1518 and was buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome. Arnold Mathew wrote: \\"Vannozza breathed her last at Rome, November 26, 1518, at the age of seventy-six. She was buried with conspicuous honours 'almost like a Cardinal' in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo, near her son, the Duke of Gandia. An official character was imparted to the ceremony by the presence of the papal Court. Pope Leo X in this way recognised Vannozza either as the widow of Alexander VI or as the mother of the Duchess of Ferrara.\\" In fiction In the 2006 film The Conclave, she is played by Nora Tschirner. In Showtime's 2011 series The Borgias, she is played by Joanne Whalley. In Borgia, the Canal+ production of the same year created by Tom Fontana, she is played by Assumpta Serna.

Cooper (born March 4, 1931, Oklahoma City) is a doctor of medicine and former Air Force Colonel from Oklahoma, who pioneered the benefits of doing aerobic exercise for maintaining and improving health. He is the author of the 1968 book Aerobics, which emphasized a point system for improving the cardiovascular system. The popular mass market version was The New Aerobics (), published ten years later. His points system is also the basis of the 10,000 steps per day method of maintaining adequate fitness by walking. Career A native of Oklahoma City, Cooper completed a 13-year military career. During his Air Force career, he devised a simple test (the Cooper test, originally the distance run in 12 minutes) which correlated well with the existing concept of VO2max, and so could conveniently be used to quickly establish the fitness level of large numbers of people. He left the Air Force in 1970, when he and his wife, Millie, moved to Dallas to found the Cooper Aerobics Center. Cooper developed the Smart Snack Ribbon guidelines put into use by the convenient fun foods division of PepsiCo, Inc., Frito-Lay. Cooper is the founder of the non-profit research and education organization, The Cooper Institute, which was opened in 1970. Cooper is also the founder of and Chairman at the Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas and McKinney, Texas, which comprises eight health and wellness entities. Cooper has published 18 books that have sold 30 million copies and been translated into 41 languages. Cooper encouraged millions into being active and helped to launch modern fitness culture. He is now known as the \\"father of aerobics\\". He and his wife are parents of a son and daughter. Cooper has written about the importance of Christian religious faith in his life.  Ideas on exercise and training effect  Cooper studied the effect of exercise in the late 1960s and used the term \\"training effect\\" although that term had been used before. The measured effects were that muscles of respiration were strengthened, the heart was strengthened, blood pressure was sometimes lowered and the total amount of blood and number of red blood cells increased, making the blood a more efficient carrier of oxygen. VO2 Max was increased. He published his ideas in a book, \\"Aerobics\\" in 1968. The exercise necessary can be accomplished by any aerobic exercise in a wide variety of schedules - Cooper found it best to award \\"points\\" for each amount of exercise and require 30 points a week to maintain the Training Effect. Cooper instead recommended a \\"12-minute test\\" (the Cooper test) followed by adherence to the appropriate starting-up schedule in his book. As always, he recommends that a physical exam should precede any exercise program. The physiological effects of training have received much further study since Cooper's original work. It is now generally considered that effects of exercise on general metabolic rate (post-exercise) are comparatively small and the greatest effect occurs for only a few hours. Though endurance training does increase the VO2 max of many people, there is considerable variation in the degree to which it increases VO2 max between individuals.

In cases of Salmonella infection, it is a demonstration of the presence of O-soma false-positive result. Test results need to be interpreted carefully to account for any history of enteric fever, typhoid vaccination, and the general level of antibodies in the populations in endemic areas of the world. Typhidot is the other test used to ascertain the diagnosis of typhoid fever. As with all serological tests, the rise in antibody levels needed to perform the diagnosis takes 7-14 days, which limits its applicability in early diagnosis. Other means of diagnosing Salmonella typhi (and paratyphi) include cultures of blood, urine and faeces. These organisms produce H2S from thiosulfate and can be identified easily on differential media such as bismuth sulfite agar. 2-mercaptoethanol is often added to the Widal test. This agent more easily denatures the IgM class of antibodies, so if a decrease in the titer is seen after using this agent, it means that the contribution of IgM has been removed leaving the IgG component. This differentiation of antibody classes is important as it allows for the distinction of a recent (IgM) from an old infection (IgG). The Widal test is positive if TO antigen titer is more than 1:160 in an active infection, or if TH antigen titer is more than 1:160 in past infection or in immunized persons. A single Widal test is of little clinical relevance especially in endemic areas such as Indian subcontinent, Africa and South-east Asia. This is due to recurrent exposure to the typhoid causing bacteria, immunization and high chances of cross-reaction from infections, such as malaria and non typhoidal salmonella. If no other tests (either bacteriologic culture or more specific serology) are available, a fourfold increase in the titer (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:640) in the course of the infection, or a conversion from an IgM reaction to an IgG reaction of at least the same titer, would be consistent with a typhoid infection. A new serological test called the Tubex test is neither superior nor better performing than the Widal test. Therefore, Tubex test is not recommended for diagnosis of typhoid fever.

Tezuka started it as a rivalry with Toei Animation, his former employer, after Tezuka's contract with Toei expired in 1961. The studio pioneered TV animation in Japan, and was responsible for many successful anime television series, such as Astro Boy, Gok≈´ no Daib≈çken, Princess Knight, Kimba the White Lion, Dororo and Ashita no Joe, as well as more adult-oriented feature films such as 1001 Nights, Cleopatra (the first Japanese X-rated animated film) and Belladonna of Sadness. In addition to doing their anime productions, Mushi was best known for its overseas work on five traditionally animated TV projects from Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass' Videocraft International (now Rankin/Bass Productions) in New York, New York, including the Christmas special Frosty the Snowman, with the production artwork being done by Paul Coker, Jr., along with the animation supervision by Yusaku \\"Steve\\" Nakagawa. Morisawa argues that Tezuka \\"proposed an unrealistically suppressed production budget... in an attempt to outbid his competitors\\", a budget that contributed to the Studio's (and industry) low profitability. Mushi, plagued by financial difficulties, declared bankruptcy in 1973 and its assets were divided. Tezuka had already left the company by then, having stepped down as acting director in 1968 and formed a new animation studio, Tezuka Productions (which made such works as Marvelous Melmo and Unico).

Pre-Prodigy history Palmer was born in Peterborough to Jamaican parents. He enjoyed writing poetry and verse and began MC-ing around the age of 14. He gained inspiration from his ten-year older MC brother, Hitman, who introduced him into the Peterborough Reggae Soundsystem Scene. At the age of seventeen he had his first gig in Basingstoke. Ian Sherman, a fellow musician from Nottingham teamed up with Maxim and they formed Maxim and Sheik YanGroove. After recording some tracks together without attracting much attention, Maxim left and went on a three- month travel throughout Europe and North Africa. Upon returning to England he moved to London to get involved in the music and reggae scene. His prior stage name, \\"Maxim Reality\\", was a reference to his interest in lyrics based on real issues. MC of The Prodigy Maxim live in Philadelphia, 2009 Maxim lived near Keith Flint, a fan of Liam Howlett. After convincing Howlett to start a band, Flint recommended Maxim as a manager on the strength of Maxim's experience in the reggae scene and the music contacts he developed. Maxim did not show up at a scheduled meeting but joined them unexpectedly at their next gig, improvising lyrics. After MCing, Maxim contributed lyrics to studio albums after Experience from 1992 (although his vocal contributions were heard in the live track \\"Death of the Prodigy Dancers\\" on Experience). Maxim provided lyrics in the single \\"Poison\\" from Music For the Jilted Generation (1994), \\"Breathe\\", and the canned single release \\"Mindfields\\" both from The Fat of the Land (1997). However, Maxim was absent from the Prodigy album Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned from 2004; Howlett said he believed the band needed to reinvent itself, without vocals from Flint or Maxim. Despite rumors to the contrary, the band did not break up, though Maxim explored a solo career. On Invaders Must Die, Maxim returned as a vocalist, as the band reverted to its prior way of working. Solo projects Maxim live in Philadelphia, 2009After the Prodigy's intense touring to support The Fat of the Land, Maxim worked on his solo projects, and in 1998 he released \\"Dog Day\\" on XL Recordings compilation CD \\"Against the Grain\\", which also featured Howlett's \\"Dirtchamber Remix\\" of \\"Diesel Power\\" (from The Fat of the Land). Also in 1998, Maxim's cover version of the Rolling Stones' \\"Factory Girl\\" was released on Beggars Banquet Record label's \\"21 Beggars Banquet\\" compilation CD. On 9 August 1999 Maxim released the EP My Web, which contained five tracks. In 2000 Maxim collaborated with Skin from Skunk Anansie on the song \\"Carmen Queasy\\", which remains his biggest solo success, peaking at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart in June that year. Maxim released a second single, \\"Scheming\\", on 11 September 2000, which reached number 53 in the UK Singles Chart, and released his debut album, Hell's Kitchen, on 2 October 2000. Maxim's second solo album, Fallen Angel, was released in 2005 and spawned one single, \\"I Don't Care,\\" which failed to chart. The album was released in multiple formats, including a limited edition CD. Maxim has performed as a DJ and in 2013 had his first United States DJ tour. He's quoted as saying, ‚ÄúDJing for me is a completely fresh challenge ‚Äì it gives me the opportunity to play music I‚Äôm into. I love the spontaneity, its freestyle form.‚Äù Maxim's DJing was inspired by trap, and in 2014 he collaborated with Cianna Blaze and producer Blaze Billions to create and release original tracks that he could DJ, released under the name ‚ÄúWe Are Noize‚Äù. In an interview Maxim said that the collaboration was a 'collective' not a new band. In September 2019 Maxim signed an exclusive global publishing deal with Peermusic that includes their partnership on Maxim's \\"Red Room Arts\\" publishing company. In December 2019 Maxim's third solo album Love More was released on \\"Red Room Arts\\" record label. Art Using the pseudonym MM (Double M) for his mixed media artworks, Maxim's first exhibition was named \\"Lepidop Terror\\" and held in September 2011 at INC Space in London's Covent Garden. Some of his artwork is displayed online at Taylor Barnes Gallery. Maxim has donated pieces of his artwork to fundraising causes including in 2020 the \\"heART & Soul Auction\\" for \\"Arms Around the Child\\" and the online anti-racism exhibition \\"United for Change\\" hosted by Artnet to raise funds for the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust in the UK and \\"Underground Museum\\" and \\"For Freedoms\\" in the US.

Make Yourself Comfortable. September 25, 2005. The Cocktail Chronicles. Retrieved on January 1, 2007. Sours are mixed drinks containing a base liquor, lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener ( simple syrup or orgeat syrup). Egg whites are also included in some sours. Description Like the daiquiri, the sidecar evolved from the original sour formula, but while sours are characterized by a bright acidity, sidecars are often drier, combining liqueurs like cointreau with citrus. Sidecars are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness. Types of sours=Gin sour The gin sour is a traditional mixed cocktail that predates prohibition in the United States. It is a simple combination of gin, lemon juice, and sugar. Adding carbonated water to this turns it into a gin fizz. It was popular during the 1940s, and Kevin Starr includes it in \\"an array of drinks (the gin sour, the whiskey sour, the Gin Rickey, the Tom Collins, the Pink Lady, the Old Fashioned) that now seem period pieces, evocative of another era.\\" Pisco sour The classic Pisco Sour recipe contains pisco brandy (usually an un-aged grape brandy from Chile and Per√∫), fresh lime juice, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white, and bitters.Navarro, V. Classic Pisco Sour LA Speakeasy It is shaken, strained, and served straight in a cocktail glass then garnished with the bitters (cinnamon can be used). The addition of egg white creates a foamy head when shaken before serving. While pisco sour is flavoured with key lime by default, pisco is combined with other fruit to create mango sour, maracuya (passion fruit) sour, lucuma sour and so forth. Peru has a National Pisco Sour Day (which lasts a weekend) in mid-February, and Chile has Pisco Day in mid-May. Rum sour The basic Daiquiri, sometimes called a Daquiri sour, is made with rum, lime juice and simple syrup. One account of the drink's origin is that the general manager of the Spanish-American Iron Core Company, which operated the \\"Daiquiri\\" mine, ran out of gin one night when making gin sour for his guests, and switched to rum. This rum sour became known as the Daiquiri. However, earlier printed recipes for rum sour exist such as one from Jerry Thomas from 1887. Whiskey sour The whiskey sour is a mixed drink containing bourbon whiskey, lemon juice, sugar, and optionally a dash of egg white to make it a Boston Sour. It is shaken and served either straight or over ice. The traditional garnish is half an orange slice and a maraschino cherry. A notable variant of the whiskey sour is the Ward 8, which often is based with either bourbon or rye whiskey, both lemon and orange juices, and grenadine syrup as the sweetener. The egg white sometimes employed in other whiskey sours is generally not included in this variation. Other sours * Amaretto Sour: Amaretto liqueur, lemon juice and sometimes egg white, bitters or sugar syrup. * Brandy Sour or Brandy Daisy (Jerry Thomas, 1887): brandy, clear or orange cura√ßao, sugar, lemon juice, shaken and strained into a wine glass. * Caipirinha: Cacha√ßa, sugar, lime, ice in an Old Fashioned glass. * Cypriot Brandy Sour: Cyprus brandy, lemon cordial and bitters, stirred in a tall glass, and topped with soda or lemonade. * Midori Sour: Honeydew melon liquor, grenadine, lemon juice. Poured properly, it resembles a green Tequila Sunrise with visible layers. * Santa Cruz Sour (Jerry Thomas, 1887): Santa Cruz rum, sugar, lemon juice, shaken and strained into a wine glass. * Tequila Sour: Tequila, lemon juice, lime juice, agave nectar, Bittercube Corazon bitters, egg white.

It has been called \\"the best race track in the world\\" by former Formula One Chief Executive Bernie Ecclestone, who held the managing rights of the circuit between 2007 and 2011. The circuit is currently managed by the Turkish company Intercity. Description The venue of the Turkish Grand Prix is located in crossing of boundaries of Pendik and Tuzla districts on the Asian side of Istanbul, close to the junction of Kurtk√∂y on the north side of the O-4 motorway, linking Istanbul to Ankara. It is adjacent to the newly constructed Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport and is surrounded by forests and fields. Aerial view of Istanbul Park The Istanbul Park racing circuit was one of only five circuits running anticlockwise in the 2011 Formula One season, the others being Aut√≥dromo Jos√© Carlos Pace (used for the Brazilian Grand Prix), the Marina Bay Street Circuit (used for the Singapore Grand Prix), the Korea International Circuit (used for the Korean Grand Prix) and the Yas Marina Circuit (used for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix). The circuit is long, with an average width of ranging from , and covers over . With a total of 14 corners, the sharpest with a radius of merely , the circuit runs over four different ground levels with a start/finish straight over in length. The total race distance of the Turkish Grand Prix is over 58 laps. Start of the 2005 Turkish Grand Prix, the first Formula One race at Istanbul Park. The track has capacity for approximately 125,000 spectators. The main grandstand has a seating capacity of 25,000 spectators, with natural ground stands and temporary stands allowing for around 100,000 more people. The paddock buildings are two-level structures; the ground floor reserved for racing teams, the upper floor serving as hospitality areas, with an additional viewing capacity of 5,000 seats. At each end of the paddock, there are two 7-story VIP towers. Another view of the circuit from above Turn 8 (nicknamed \\"Diabolica\\" by some in reference to Monza's Curva Parabolica) particularly caught the imagination. The corner is a fast, sweeping corner with four apexes, similar to one of the multi-apex sections of the old N√ºrburgring. Spectators and drivers alike raved about Turn 8, comparing it to legendary corners such as Eau Rouge and 130R. That eventually became the basis of turns 17 and 18 at the Circuit of the Americas. The circuit itself has already been compared to Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Another notable corner is Turn 1, a sharp downhill left-hander immediately after the front straight. This corner has been nicknamed by some as the \\"Turkish Corkscrew\\" in reference to the famous Corkscrew at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. Both the 2006 F1 and MotoGP races at the circuit featured multiple incidents at this corner. A third noteworthy area is the uphill kink in the middle of the back straight; due to its similarity to Eau Rouge, it has been jokingly referred to as \\"Faux Rouge\\". The circuit is not, however, without its critics. After qualifying, Jenson Button claimed that the track was getting bumpier as the weekend went on, particularly at Turn 8, which was what caused so many drivers to spin off. This harks back to another circuit designed by Hermann Tilke, Shanghai International Circuit, which is said to be sinking in places because it was built on the site of a former swamp. Jarno Trulli was notable for his lukewarm feeling towards the circuit, saying that he felt the circuit was easy to learn, and that good performance was down more to the car than the driver.Trulli unmoved by Istanbul - www.itv-f1.com Major motorsports events A view of the start-finish line A view of the main grandstand pit lane pit lane exit Formula One The first Grand Prix of Turkey took place in 2005.

The club, founded in 1970, plays its home matches at Donegal Celtic Park. Club colours are green and white in Celtic-style hoops. History Mural on the side of the DC social club, beside Donegal Celtic Park Donegal Celtic was formed in 1970 when a group of young men who had a huge interest in football decided to form a team in the Lenadoon district of west Belfast. With no facilities, kits, pitch or equipment, the first few years were spent playing friendlies and entering local summer competitions, which helped to enhance and promote their reputation and name. They registered their chosen name with the Irish Football League, taking the name from the area in which they were based; Lenadoon, Gweedore, Glenveagh are all local areas named after towns in County Donegal, with the Celtic part being taken on due to the massive local following for Scotland's Celtic, and formerly Belfast Celtic. The club has a youth setup, covering boys' age groups U10 ‚Äì U18, and a girl's set-up at U14. Donegal Celtic Ladies senior side won the 'Belfast Cup' in 2004. The club's senior men's team has a chequered and colourful history. After continually applying for Irish League entry they were denied on several occasions and forced to play amateur football, along with County Armagh team Lurgan Celtic. A 1990 cup tie at Linfield involved ground unrest.http://riotonline.com/blog/2010/10/linfield-f-c-donegal-celtic-irisih- cup-1990/ With accusations of a sectarian selection process and with the threat of court action looming, both clubs finally gained entry into the Irish League 2nd Division for the 2002‚Äì03 season. The club managed to finish in 6th place in their first year in the Irish League proper, which due to a league shake-up was enough to earn promotion to the First Division. The club's second season in Irish League football was marred by poor home form and an inability to cope with the change in standard, finishing in 8th place. Donegal Celtic finished the 2004‚Äì05 season in 3rd place losing out on a promotion play-off place to Lurgan club Glenavon and also lost the IFA Intermediate Cup final on penalties to the same team at Stangmore Park, Dungannon. The club's fortunes improved following the establishment of a management structure of Paddy Kelly, Marty McKiernan and Gerard Loughran. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, the club finished as runners-up to Crusaders in the league, earning the right to play over two legs for a place in the Premier League, which they achieved on 10 May 2006 with a 3‚Äì1 aggregate victory against Institute. The team also managed to capture the Intermediate Cup, defeating Coagh United 2‚Äì0 in the final. The next few seasons would see the club going through managerial turmoil, changing managers seven times in four years. Paddy Kelly resigned as manager before the 2009‚Äì10 season started, with former Cliftonville and Coleraine player Pat McAllister replacing him. In June 2010, a few weeks after guiding the club back into the top flight for the 2010‚Äì11 IFA Premiership season with a 1‚Äì0 aggregate win over Institute in the promotion play-off, McAllister agreed a new deal to stay as manager for the 2010‚Äì11 season. However, less than a month later he shocked the club by resigning, citing personal reasons for his decision. Marty Tabb, a former Cliftonville captain and manager, took over for the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season. However, in September 2010, he was sacked after only 74 days in charge. Paddy Kelly then returned to the club for a second spell as manager. He resigned for the second time in January 2012, along with a number of coaches and the entire club committee, due to an internal club dispute. Former Carrick Rangers boss Stephen Small was appointed Kelly's successor a few days later. However, Small's tenure would not be a successful one. The club suffered a run of 15 league games without a win, which included 12 defeats and 3 draws. They were also knocked out of the 2012‚Äì13 Irish League Cup at home, by IFA Championship 1 outfit Harland & Wolff Welders. Small resigned in September 2012, citing poor results and personal pressures as the reasons for his departure. Reserve team manager Declan McGreevy, a former Ards and Ballymena United player, was appointed as the club's next manager on 11 October 2012. Ten days later however, McGreevy was forced to stand down from the post as he did not possess the required UEFA 'A' licence to manage an IFA Premiership club. Former manager Pat McAllister was immediately announced as McGreevy's replacement, returning to the club for a second spell as manager. The club was also involved in some controversy that season, when they were deducted 3 points and fined ¬£500 for fielding a suspended player in a 2‚Äì1 win over Lisburn Distillery ‚Äì the result was changed to a 3‚Äì0 loss. The club maintained that the IFA had given them verbal clearance for the player to take part in the match, but did not appeal the decision. The club ended the season in the relegation play-off place (11th), and faced the runners-up of Championship 1, Warrenpoint Town, for a place in next season's Premiership. The tie ended 2‚Äì2 on aggregate with Warrenpoint Town winning on the away goals rule. This relegated Donegal Celtic to the second tier. In August 2013, five days prior to the start of the 2013‚Äì14 NIFL Championship season ‚Äì the club's first season back in the second tier, manager Pat McAllister along with his entire backroom staff and several first team players all quit the club following a club meeting. McAllister stated that he could no longer work under the conditions and restrictions that were imposed during the meeting as a result of the club's difficult financial situation. Former Donegal Celtic player Paul McAreavey was announced as the club's new manager a few days later. McAreavey left after one season, in which the club finished 11th, to be replaced by Nicky Maye, a member of the coaching staff.Nicky Maye's official Twitter account Under Maye the team continued to struggle, finishing one point above relegation for the 2014‚Äì15 season. Maye continued as manager for the following season, but after a poor start and with the club bottom of the table without a single league win, Maye's departure was announced in October 2015.Club Facebook page Gerry Bradley, a member of the coaching staff and former player for the club, was confirmed as his successor soon afterwards.Club Facebook page However Bradley resigned soon after his appointment.Donegal Celtic hit new low after suffering Ards rout Former Chimney Corner F.C. manager Stephen Hatfield was appointed his successor in late December 2015.Broomhill FC twitter pageHatfield realistic but relishing role as manager at struggling Donegal Celtic However, the team continued to struggle in the second tier, with Celtic's relegation to the third tier confirmed in March 2016 after only 19 games of the 2015‚Äì16 season played. At the time their relegation was confirmed, the team had amassed a meagre 3 points and had failed to win a single league game all season, leaving them 23 points away from safety with only 7 games and 21 points left to play for.

It was established in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa. History The Art Center traces its roots to 1916, when the Des Moines Association of Fine Arts established gallery space at the Public Library of Des Moines on the banks of the Des Moines River downtown. Several exhibitions were shown each year, and works of art were periodically purchased for the association's permanent collection. In 1938, the DMAF moved their collection to a building on Walnut Street. Planning for a permanent building began in 1943 after a sizeable donation from the trust of James D. Edmundson. In 1945, DMAF evolved into the Des Moines Art Center.https://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/webres/Image/Education/Educator%20Guides/Everything%20but%20the%20Art.pdf A site along Grand Avenue in the city's Greenwood Park was designated as the preferred location. Construction began in 1945; the museum itself opened in 1948, with additional wings constructed in 1968 and 1985. In 2009, the Art Center expanded its mission to operate the Pappajohn Sculpture Park, located in Western Gateway Park downtown. Collection Artists included in the permanent collection are Edward Hopper, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Francis Bacon, Georgia O'Keeffe, Gerhard Richter, Claes Oldenburg, Mary Cassatt, Auguste Rodin, Grant Wood, Deborah Butterfield, Paul Gauguin, Eva Hesse, Ronnie Landfield, Roy Lichtenstein, George Segal, Mark Rothko, John Singer Sargent, Joseph Cornell and Takashi Murakami. Some paintings from the collection are well known examples of the artist and/or movement they represent. These include Edward Hopper's Automat from 1927, which was reproduced on a postage stamp as well as used for a cover of Time, Stanton MacDonald Wright's Synchromy which has been reproduced in numerous texts about the artist/movement, Francis Bacon's Portrait of Pope Innocent from 1953 which likewise is considered a signature work by the artist and appeared in Robert Hughes \\"Shock of the New\\" BBC series in the early 1980s. Facilities A large main gallery rotates through several exhibitions throughout the year, most of which are featured from one to three months at a time. These shows include solo shows by internationally recognized artists, travelling shows from other institutions, and group shows organized around a theme. The rest of the museum space highlights the permanent collections in various ways, including small spaces for short-term print and photography shows, a video gallery, and long-term installations organized both chronologically and thematically. Included on the grounds are outdoor sculptures and a rose garden. An external reflecting pool is surrounded on all sides by the museum. The architecture of the original museum wing was designed in a combination of Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles by Eliel Saarinen in 1945 and completed in 1948. The second addition, originally intended for large- scale sculpture, was designed in a Modernist style by I.M. Pei in 1966 and completed in 1968. Legend says that Pei designed the south windows, which look out onto the rose garden, to resemble \\"PEI\\", but he has denied this. The third wing was designed by Richard Meier and completed in 1985. This wing was designed to allow as much natural ambient light in as possible. The Art Center also includes a restaurant and a gift shop. Workshops, film festivals and lectures are conducted on a regular basis through the museums large studio program, with classes available for students of all ages. Museum hours are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday from 11am to 4pm, Thursday from 11am to 9pm, Saturday from 10am to 4pm, and Sunday from noon to 4pm. Admission is free.

This population was listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2008, as it was estimated at 441 to 679 individuals, with no subpopulation larger than 50 individuals and a declining trend. The Sumatran tiger is the only surviving tiger population in the Sunda Islands, where the Bali and Javan tigers are extinct. Sequences from complete mitochondrial genes of 34 tigers support the hypothesis that Sumatran tigers are diagnostically distinct from mainland subspecies. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognizes the living and extinct tiger populations in Indonesia as P. t. sondaica. Taxonomy Felis tigris sondaicus was the scientific name proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1844 for a tiger specimen from Java. The genus Panthera was proposed by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1929, who described a skin and a skull of a tiger specimen from Sumatra using the name Panthera tigris sumatrae. The skull and pelage pattern of tiger specimens from Java and Sumatra do not differ significantly. P. t. sondaica is therefore considered the valid name for the living and extinct tiger populations in Indonesia.  Evolution  Analysis of DNA is consistent with the hypothesis that Sumatran tigers became isolated from other tiger populations after a rise in sea level that occurred at the Pleistocene to Holocene border about 12,000‚Äì6,000 years ago. In agreement with this evolutionary history, the Sumatran tiger is genetically isolated from all living mainland tigers, which form a distinct group closely related to each other. The isolation of the Sumatran tiger from mainland tiger populations is supported by multiple unique characters, including two diagnostic mitochondrial DNA nucleotide sites, ten mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and 11 out of 108 unique microsatellite alleles. The relatively high genetic variability and the phylogenetic distinctiveness of the Sumatran tiger indicates that the gene flow between island and mainland populations was highly restricted.  Characteristics  A wild Sumatran tiger photographed by a camera trap The Sumatran tiger was described based on two zoological specimens that differed in skull size and striping pattern from Bengal and Javan tiger specimens. It is darker in fur colour and has broader stripes than the Javan tiger. Stripes tend to dissolve into spots near their ends, and on the back, flanks and hind legs are lines of small, dark spots between the regular stripes. The frequency of stripes is higher than in other subspecies. Males have a prominent ruff, which is especially marked in the Sumatran tiger. The Sumatran tiger is one of the smallest tigers. Males measure between the pegs in head-to-body length, with the greatest length of skull of and weigh . Females weigh and measure in length between the pegs with a greatest length of skull of .  Distribution and habitat  The Sumatran tiger persists in small and fragmented populations across Sumatra, from sea level in the coastal lowland forest of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on the southeastern tip of Lampung Province to in mountain forests of Gunung Leuser National Park in Aceh Province. It is present in 27 habitat patches larger than , which cover . About a third of these patches are inside protected areas. Sumatran tigers prefer lowland and hill forests, where up to three tigers live in an area of . They use non-forest habitats and human-dominated landscapes at the fringes of protected areas to a lesser degree. In 1978, the Sumatran tiger population was estimated at 1,000 individuals, based on responses to a questionnaire survey. In 1985, a total of 26 protected areas across Sumatra containing about 800 tigers were identified. In 1992, an estimated 400‚Äì500 tigers lived in five Sumatran national parks and two protected areas. At that time, the largest population unit comprised 110‚Äì180 individuals in Gunung Leuser National Park. As of 2011, the tiger population in Kerinci Seblat National Park in central Sumatra comprised 165‚Äì190 individuals, which is more than anywhere else on the island. The park has the highest tiger occupancy rate of Sumatra's protected areas, with 83% of the park showing signs of tigers. Sumatra's total tiger population was estimated at 618 ¬± 290 individuals in 2017.  Ecology and behaviour  Sumatran tiger cub at Chester Zoo Sumatran tigers strongly prefer uncultivated forests and make little use of plantations of acacia and oil palm even if these are available. Within natural forest areas, they tend to use areas with higher elevation, lower annual rainfall, farther from the forest edge, and closer to forest centres. They prefer forest with dense understory cover and steep slope, and they strongly avoid forest areas with high human influence in the forms of encroachment and settlement. In acacia plantations, they tend to use areas closer to water and prefer areas with older plants, more leaf litter, and thicker subcanopy cover. Tiger records in oil palm plantations and rubber plantations are scarce. The availability of adequate vegetation cover at the ground level serves as an environmental condition fundamentally needed by tigers regardless of the location. Without adequate understory cover, tigers are even more vulnerable to persecution by humans. Human disturbance-related variables negatively affect tiger occupancy and habitat use. Variables with strong impacts include settlement and encroachment within forest areas, logging, and the intensity of maintenance in acacia plantations. Camera trapping surveys conducted in southern Riau revealed an extremely low abundance of potential prey and a low tiger density in peat swamp forest areas. Repeated sampling in the newly established Tesso Nilo National Park documented a trend of increasing tiger density from 0.90 individuals per in 2005 to 1.70 individuals per in 2008. In the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, nine prey species larger than of body weight were identified including great argus, pig-tailed macaque, Malayan porcupine, Malayan tapir, banded pig, greater and lesser mouse-deer, Indian muntjac, and Sambar deer.  Threats  People with a trapped tiger in Soepajang, Bovenlanden Padang on Sumatra's west coast, ~ 1895 Major threats include habitat loss due to expansion of palm oil plantations and planting of acacia plantations, prey-base depletion, and illegal trade primarily for the domestic market. Tigers need large contiguous forest blocks to thrive. Between 1985 and 1999, forest loss within Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park averaged 2% per year. A total of of forest disappeared inside the park, and were lost in a 10-km buffer, eliminating forest outside the park. Lowland forest disappeared faster than montane forest, and forests on gentle slopes disappeared faster than forests on steep slopes. Most forest conversions resulted from agricultural development, leading to predictions that by 2010, 70% of the park will be in agriculture. Camera-trap data indicated avoidance of forest boundaries by tigers. Classification of forest into core and peripheral forest based on mammal distribution suggests that by 2010, core forest area for tigers will be fragmented and reduced to 20% of the remaining forest. Sumatra's largest tiger population in Kerinci Seblat National Park is threatened by a high rate of deforestation in its outer regions. Drivers are an unsustainable demand for natural resources created by a human population with the highest rate of growth in Indonesia, and a government initiative to increase tree-crop plantations and high-intensity commercial logging, which ultimately leads to forest fires. The majority of the tigers found in the park were relocated to its center where conservation efforts are focused, but issues in the lowland hill forests of the outskirts remain. While being a highly suitable tiger habitat, these areas are also heavily targeted by logging efforts, which substantially contributes to declines in local tiger numbers. The expansion of plantations is increasing greenhouse gas emissions, playing a part in anthropogenic climate change, thus further adding to environmental pressures on endangered species. Climate-based movement of tigers northwards may lead to increased conflict with people. From 1987 to 1997, Sumatran tigers reportedly killed 146 people and at least 870 livestock. In West Sumatra, Riau, and Aceh, a total of 128 incidents were reported; 265 tigers were killed and 97 captured in response, and 35 more tigers were killed from 1998 to 2002. From 2007 to 2010, the tigers caused the death of 9 humans and 25 further tigers were killed. In 1997, an estimated 53 tigers were killed by poachers and their parts sold throughout most of northern Sumatra. Numbers for all of Sumatra are likely to be higher. Farmers killed many of the tigers to prevent livestock losses. They sold them to gold and souvenir shops, and pharmacies. In 2006, wildlife markets were surveyed in 28 cities and nine seaports in seven Sumatran provinces; 33 of 326 retail outlets offered tiger parts like skins, canines, bones, and whiskers. Tiger bones fetched the highest average price of US$116 per kg, followed by canines. There is evidence that tiger parts are smuggled out of Indonesia. In July 2005, over of tiger bones and 24 skulls were confiscated in Taiwan in a shipment from Jakarta. In 2013‚Äì2014, Kerinci Seblat National Park experienced an upsurge in poaching, with the highest annual number of snare traps being removed for a patrol effort similar to previous years. Evidence is scarce and misunderstood on whether the strategies implemented to diminish poaching are succeeding despite the investment of millions of dollars annually into conservation strategies.  Conservation  Panthera tigris is listed on CITES Appendix I. Hunting is prohibited in Indonesia. In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy addressed the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra. The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 in and around the Way Kambas National Park to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations. By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 were intact enough to contain tigers. In the framework of the STP, a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger- human dimension in the park to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions. In 2007, the Indonesian Forestry Ministry and Safari Park established cooperation with the Australia Zoo for the conservation of Sumatran tigers and other endangered species. The program includes conserving Sumatran tigers and other endangered species in the wild, efforts to reduce conflicts between tigers and humans, and rehabilitating Sumatran tigers and reintroducing them to their natural habitat. Indonesia's struggle with conservation has caused an upsurge in political momentum to protect and conserve wildlife and biodiversity. In 2009, Indonesia's president committed to substantially reduce deforestation, and policies across the nation requiring spatial plans that would be environmentally sustainable at national, provincial, and district levels. Between 2005 and 2015, about US$210 million have been invested into tiger law-enforcement activities that support forest ranger patrols, as well as the implementations of front-line law-enforcement activities by the Global Tiger Recovery Plan, which aims to double the number of wild tigers by 2020. In November 2016, Batu Nanggar Sanctuary was opened in North Padang Lawas Regency, North Sumatra for conservation of Sumatran wildlife. An interview survey among 600 consumers revealed that most were willing to pay consistently more for a \\"tiger-friendly\\" produced good if this product would be conducive to Sumatran tiger conservation.  In captivity  A Sumatran tiger at San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium As of 2013, about 375 captive Sumatran tigers were listed in the global studbook and management plan, with 50 of them housed in 14 zoos in Australia and New Zealand. All of them were offspring of 15 founders. Fourteen cubs showed congenital vestibular dysfunctions such as ataxia, strabismus, nystagmus, head tilting and falling that resolved when they were two years old. The cause for this disorder is most likely their close genetic relation and inbreeding.

The consultants were Brown, Daltas, and Associates as well as LeMessurier in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The city was built to provide lodging for several brigades of Saudi troops, with a design population of 65,000 people. The city is named after former Saudi King Khalid bin Abdul Aziz. Construction The Corps of Engineers King Khalid Military City (KKMC) was as extensive as any of the Kingdom's massive private programs. Saudi Arabia sought and received U.S. Corps assistance in part because it was impressed with the Dhahran civil air terminal and other early projects the Corps built with US funds. The Kingdom also lacked the expertise to manage a huge program at that time. However, equally important was the U.S. corps reputation as an effective and honest public servant. The Saudis preferred entrusting their defence construction to a government agency. Saudi Minister of Defense and Aviation, Prince Sultan, starting in 1964 anticipated the three cantonments; King Faisal Military Cantonment at Khamis Mushayt in the southwest near Yemen; King Abdul Aziz Military Cantonment (later \\"City\\") at Tabuk Province in the northwest near Jordan; and in the spring of 1973, the Ministry approved changing the site of the third cantonment from Qaysumah to Hafar Al-Batin in the north near Iraq. The Engineer Assistance Agreement, effective May 24, 1965, and extended several times, provides the basic framework for much of the Corps activities in Saudi Arabia. The Agreement was entered into pursuant to section 507(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and is currently authorized by section 22 of the Arms Export Act with the Ministry of Defense and Aviation (MODA) further committed the (Mediterranean Division, later the Middle East Division) US Army Corps of Engineers, initially to design and construct three brigade- size military cantonments to house elements of the Saudi Arabian Army. In the spring of 1973, MODA approved changing the location of the third cantonment from Qaysumah to Hafar al Batin and expand the cantonment to a \\"Military City\\". In March 1974 a $1.5 million contract to a joint venture with Sippican Architectural Engineering and Brown Daltas & Associates Rome, Italy office. Over the next 13 months, the joint venture surveyed to location and without estimates to the City's population the venture identified the architectural theme, required utilities, buildings and facilities to MODA in May 1975 with a one brigade troop strength. Prince Sultan, head of MODA, approved the outline and concept and added two more brigade troop strength of 5000 men each. The growing demand for construction created a need to import vast quantities of construction materials and labor. The region had only limited capabilities for dealing with the inflow of goods and workers. When construction began at Khamis Mushayt in 1966, strained Saudi port facilities had barely coped. Nothing had improved by the mid-1970s. U.S. Corps personnel became increasingly concerned about the limited ability of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs ports to handle the volume of shipping needed to sustain the large construction projects under design. As serious discussions began concerning construction of the cantonment at Hafar Al-Batin, the military academy, and the medical research and treatment center at Al Kharj, the division‚Äôs engineers again voiced their concern about port capacity. In late 1974, the division commissioned a study of the port conditions and the transportation facilities needed to support the planned programs. In mid-November 1975, U.S. Corps personnel presented to Prince Sultan the idea of constructing a port on the Saudi east coast at Ra's al Mish'ab near the border with Kuwait. The port would handle only materials imported for the al Batin.In June 1975 tentative approval of a $9 million contract for further design a procurement packages for the City. In the first week of January 1976, MODA named the new city King Khalid Military City in honor of Saudi King Khalid. Planning for the city began in 1974 and, after a new Persian Gulf port was built in Ra's al-Mish'ab to handle all the material being brought in, construction began. Built in collaboration with local national engineers and project managers, various phases of the project were completed throughout the 1980s. The scope of the project was very large with 21 new wells being drilled to provide water, a new port for supplies, 3,387 double story family housing units with utility tunnels, and five, multi-domed mosques and associated facilities. Also, the world's largest pre-cast concrete plant, built on-site, was used and built by the Samwhan Corporation. The city was finally completed in 1987. Gulf War During the Gulf War, KKMC was used to house thousands of American and other coalition soldiers. Its airport was one of the most used during combat operations, along with bases in Dhahran and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. During the war, KKMC was protected from ballistic missiles by the U.S's Patriot missile system. On February 21, 1991 Iraq fired three Scud missiles at King Khalid Military City, which were reportedly destroyed by Patriot interceptors. Present use At its peak, hundreds of US Army Corps engineers and personnel made KKMC their home, and a small American city evolved within the Saudi military city. Today, US presence at KKMC is minimal with only a small number of US government personnel still working and living there as in a few foreigners from different countries also come here to work. There are many expatriates living in the city, some of them born there.The right to live here Saudi Gazetta. 20 November 2013.

Directed by Stuart Burge, the film starred Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Joyce Redman, and Frank Finlay, who all received Oscar nominations, and provided film debuts for both Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon. Background The film retains most of Shakespeare's original play, and does not change the order of scenes, as do Olivier's Hamlet and Richard III. The only major omission is the Fool's scene, although other minor lines are cut here and there (the stage version contained more of the play than the film did). Derek Jacobi (Cassio) and Michael Gambon both made their film debuts in Othello, while Edward Hardwicke (Montano) would go on to work with the National for seven years. The film of Othello used enlarged duplicates of the original stage settings, rather than having elaborate new sets built. Olivier's former backers for his Shakespeare films were all deceased by 1965, and he was unable to raise the money to do a film version on location or on elaborate sets. Nearly a decade earlier, Olivier had been attempting to find financial backing for his own film version of Macbeth after he performed the role in 1955 at Stratford, but ultimately without success.Anthony Davies \\"Macbeth\\" in Michael Dobson & Stanley Wells The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001, p.271-75, 275 The National Theatre Company had already produced a staged film of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya (1963) and would later produce Strindberg's The Dance of Death (1969). The Olivier Othello is the first English-language filmed version of the play made in color (there had been a Russian version in color in 1955) and widescreen. It was the second major film adaption of the work after a production in 1952 by Orson Welles. In the U.S., it did not play the usual several-week run given to most films; instead, it played for only two days. The film was exhibited as a roadshow presentation. Of all Olivier's Shakespeare films, Othello is the one with the least music. Iago and the soldiers sing a drinking song in one scene, and in another, musicians are seen playing briefly on exotic instruments, but, otherwise, the film has no music. Reception Olivier played Othello in blackface. He also adopted an exotic accent of his own invention, developed a special walk, and learned how to speak in a voice considerably deeper than his normal one. Columnist Inez Robb disparagingly compared Olivier's performance to Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer. She described Olivier's performance as \\"high camp\\", and said \\"I was certainly in tune with the gentleman sitting next to me who kept asking 'When does he sing Mammy?\\"Inside Oscar by Damien Boa and Mason Wiley, Ballantine Books, page 383 Film critic Pauline Kael gave the production and Olivier's portrayal one of her most glowing reviews, shaming the major movie studios for giving Olivier so little money to make the film that he and the public had to be content with what was almost literally a filmed stage production, while other films received multimillion dollar budgets.Pauline Kael (1970) Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Marion Boyars Publishers John Simon, while disagreeing with the approach the production's interpretation took, declared that, \\"Olivier plays this misconceived Othello spectacularly, in a manner that is always a perverse joy to behold\\".Stanley Wells. Shakespeare in the Theatre: An Anthology of Criticism. Of particular offence [to whom?], and a device which primarily works in film rather than on-stage, was Olivier's rolling of his eyes: a stock \\"niggerism\\" of early depictions of negroes in blackface films. This device specifically links to Al Jolson and is unconnected to any Shakespeareian stage direction.Blacks in Films, Jim Pines, It is, so far, the only Shakespeare film in which all the principals were nominated for Oscars. Finlay (Iago) was nominated for Best Supporting Actor despite having the role with the most lines in the play: 1117 to Olivier's 856. Olivier did, however, appear on screen three minutes longer than Finlay.

As Volcana, she originally had the ability to convert her entire body into a plasma form, in which she blazes with white-hot intensity, at times setting aflame any surface beneath her. In her human form, the 6'5\\" tall Marsha has long black hair, and usually wears only her magenta- colored swimsuit; her clothing is manufactured from unstable molecules, thus it is not destroyed when she is in her plasma form. The alien technology that empowered her makes her powers totally undetectable when she is in human form. Her plasma form grants her superhuman durability and consists of highly charged particles which surround her in white-hot flame and is able to emit controlled bursts of thermal energy up to 40 feet. She later gained the ability to convert her body into a stone form, a volcanic rock (basalt)-like composition which still enables movement and grants her superhuman strength. She subsequently gained an ash form, a volcanic ash (pumice)-like composition whose configuration she can shift, shape and control at will. Volcana cannot make partial transformations; she can possess the attributes of only one of her forms at a time. Monitoring devices subcutaneously implanted by Doctor Doom can be triggered to stimulate the aggression centers of her brain. In other media=Television Volcana appears in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Villainy Redux Syndrome!\\", voiced by Grey DeLisle. She is shown to be the girlfriend of Molecule Man and aids him into helping Doctor Doom, MODOK, and Abomination break out of the Vault. In the episode \\"When Strikes the Surfer,\\" Volcana was seen with Nebula (whose mouth was removed by Thanos using the Reality Gem) and Molecule Man at a galactic diner. When Volcana discovers that Nebula has no mouth, she has Molecule Man create a new one for her. Nebula tells Molecule Man and Volcana that the Dark Surfer is causing havoc. Doctor Doom approaches the three villains stating that they should band together to trap the Dark Surfer in the machine Doctor Doom once used to drain the Silver Surfer's powers. Volcana joins Doctor Doom into attacking the Dark Surfer. Dark Surfer ends up sending the villains on Doctor Doom's side through a portal.

Segu) is a town and an urban commune in south-central Mali that lies northeast of Bamako on the right bank of the River Niger. The town is the capital of the S√©gou Cercle and the S√©gou Region. With 130,690 inhabitants in 2009, it is the fifth- largest town in Mali. The village of S√©gou-Koro, upstream of the present town, was established in the 17th century and became the capital of the Bambara Empire. History In the middle of the 19th century there were four villages with the name of S√©gou spread out over a distance of around along the right bank of the river. They were, starting from the most upstream, S√©gou-Koro (Old S√©gou), S√©gou-Bougou, S√©gou-Koura (New S√©gou) and S√©gou-Sikoro. The present town is on the site of S√©gou-Sikoro. The village of S√©gou-Koro prospered after Biton Mamary Coulibaly became king in 1712 and founded the S√©gou (or Bamana) Empire. Mungo Park became the first European known to have visited the village in 1796. The empire gradually declined and was conquered by El Hadj Umar Tall's Toucouleur Empire in 1861, then by the French Army Colonel Louis Archinard in 1890. Origin S√©gou has contested origins. Some claim that the word S√©gou come from \\"Sikoro\\", meaning to the foot of a shea butter tree. Others argue that it was named after Cheikou, a marabout who founded the city, while still other theories support the claim that S√©gou was founded by the Bozo fishermen coming from the north, who established their villages along the Niger River. The 11th century CE saw an influx of the Soninke people, who were trying to escape from the expansion of the Ghana Empire, with Mandinka populations following. It is believed that Kaladjan Koulibaly, founder of the Bambara Kingdom's Koulibaly dynasty established the first sedentary villages here at his time. The later Diarra dynasty moved the capital of the Bambara Kingdom to S√©gou. S√©gou Koro S√©gou Koro is located about ten kilometres from S√©gou, on the road to Bamako. Segou Koro was created by the founder of the Bambara dynasty. During the 17th century, Bambara coming from Djenn√©, led by Kaladjan Koulibaly settled along the Niger River.Britannica, S√©gou, britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019 Danfassari, Koulibaly's son continued his father's work by building his city there. After Koulibaly's death, his eldest grandson Mamari‚Äîalso known as Biton‚Äîruled the city and made it flourish. Today the town in some ways conserves the tradition and architecture of the ancient city. Bambara Kingdom The Bambaras from Djenn√© with Kaladjan Koulibaly established their nation along the Niger River and founded the town of S√©gou-Koro, the capital of the Bambara state. Bortolot (2003) says that S√©gou evolved from a simple social structure, characterized by hunting and farming, to a more complex city dominated by a dynasty system. One of Koulibaly's descendants, Mamary Coulibaly, became the chief of the Bi- Ton and later took the name Biton. Biton spread terror, organised the army, and restructured the association into a city. He expanded the territory from Segou Koro to Timbuktu. Under his rule, the Macina and Djenn√© trading centers became a part of S√©gou. Timbuktu was not part of S√©gou. It remained autonomous and paid tribute to Biton. After Biton's death in 1755, one of the Coulibaly family slaves, Ngolo Diarra, obtained power to control the Bambara kingdom and established the Diarra dynasty. Ngolo Diarra ruled S√©gou until the 19th century. He moved the kingdom's capital from Segou-Koro to S√©gou-Sikoro, close to the site of the current city. Diarra continued Biton's conquest and extended the kingdom from Guinea to Timbuktu. Conquest In March 1861, the Muslim Toucouleur leader, El Hadj Oumar Tall, conquered the town. On his death in 1864, he was succeeded by his son Ahmadu Tall. Ahmadu had to deal with Bambara rebellions and challenges from his brothers but he continued to rule until 1890 when the town fell to French forces led by Colonel Louis Archinard. Geography= Location  S√©gou is situated 235 km from Bamako, on the right bank of the Niger River. The urban commune is bordered to the east by the commune of Pelengana, to the west by the commune of S√©bougou and to the south by the commune of Sako√Øba. The commune is subdivided into 15 quartiers: Alamissani, Angoul√™me, Bagadadji, Bougoufi√©, Comatex, Dar Salam, Hamdallaye, M√©dine, Mission Catholique, Missira, S√©gou Coura, Sido Soninkoura, Somono, Sokalakono, Bananissabakoro. Climate S√©gou has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh). The city is irrigated by two important waterways: the Niger and the Bani River. S√©gou has two seasons: a rainy season and a dry season. The rainy season starts in May and lasts about five months until September. S√©gou's dry season includes a cold period and a period of heat. The average yearly rainfall is about 513 mm. The harmattan is the dominant wind in the dry season and it blows from north to south. The monsoon blowing from south to north-west is more frequent during rainy season (hivernage). Demography The S√©gou Region's population was about 2,338,349 in 2009. With a rural population that is largely nomadic semi-sedentary or sedentary, the population consists of many ethnic groups, such as Bambara, Bozo, Fulani, Soninke, Malinke and Toucouleur. Bambaras are mostly farmers and are the most numerous ethnic group. Their language is Bambara or Djoula. The Bozos are the second most populous ethnic group. They typically live near the shore of the Niger river, in small towns of small houses. The Bozo economy is based on fishing. Bozo people have a monopoly on the transport system because of their knowledge of the Niger, its shallows and seasonal lakes, and are regarded as the masters of water. The Somono, also fishermen, are not a distinct ethnic group but a mixture of Bambara, Bozo and Soninke. The Malink√©, Maninka, and Mandinka are closely related to Bambaras: They share costumes, religious beliefs, and practices with the Bambaras. The Marka, Saracoll√© or Soninke are merchants and warriors. The Soninke people are great travelers and Muslims, and have largely conserved their traditions. Art and culture The Bambaras used to transmit their knowledge by oral tradition, hence much of their art and culture is unknown. S√©gou's cultural heritage includes traditional musical instruments, wonderful griots, folkloric groups and the traditional masks and marionettes. The history of the Bambara state's traditional religious practices are ambiguous. They practice animism and fetishism as cultural practices, and also totemic and monism (cult of ancestors). The most famous S√©gou handcrafts are based on pottery, weaving (blankets, wrappers and carpets), manufacturing of Bogolan (a distinctive variation of Mud cloth), painting and sculpture. S√©gou is also regarded as the capital of Malian pottery with a large pottery district in Kalabougou situated on the left bank. Women make the pottery by hand with the clay coming from the Niger River and bring the finished works to the local Monday market.  Education  The University of S√©gou was founded in 2009.  Places of worship  Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‚Äò‚ÄòReligions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices‚Äô‚Äô, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 1793 There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of S√©gou (Catholic Church), √âglise Chr√©tienne √âvang√©lique du Mali (Alliance World Fellowship), Assemblies of God. Architecture S√©gou has two architectural styles: French Colonial and traditional Sudanese and neo-Sudanese. The Sudanese style influenced public building and important residences. Monuments and great mosques are also built according to this style. Many of Sudano- Sahelian's kings built imposing palaces in the cities over which they ruled and most of these buildings are in red clay. The materials used for building are generally quite poor and many of the buildings need to be restored to maintain their state. The CMDT cotton processing plant near S√©gou. Economy Today, S√©gou is known for its pottery, its market and its fishing industry. Attractions in the old town of S√©gou-Koro included a mosque, Coulibaly's tomb and an ancient tree. In the city center, the main landmark is the water tower. The most important economic activities are fishing, cattle herding and small scale farming. The main crop is rice pearl millet but sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and black-eyed peas are also grown. The yields are generally low.. There are two factories processing cotton: Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (COMATEX) and Compagnie malienne pour le d√©veloppement du textile (CMDT). Commerce consists mostly of the small scale exchange and sale of products from the primary sector, sold weekly at the large Sudano-Sahelian market, drawing customers from far outside of the city. The main products sold are vegetables, pottery, cotton, leather, fruit, ovens, cattle and cereals. The headquarters of the Office du Niger is based in the town. The Office du Niger is a semi- autonomous government agency that administers a large irrigation scheme in the S√©gou Region to the north of the Niger River. Notable residents Notable people from S√©gou include Adame Ba Konare, Fanta Damba, Garan Fabou Kouyate, Mountaga Tall,\\"Pr√©sidentielles: 24 SUR LA LIGNE DE D√âPART\\", L'Essor, April 8, 2002 . and Bassekou Kouyate.

Retrieved 2011-07-29. she intended to complete their plans. The Myth Adventures are noted for and popular for their whimsical nature, myriad characters, and liberal use of puns. After the first book, every title turns on the similarity between the word \\"myth\\" and the prefix \\"mis-\\" or the word \\"miss\\". The inaugural title, Another Fine Myth, puns on the phrase \\"another fine mess\\". Chapters are usually headed by made-up quotes by famous or semi- famous persons. The first book was advertised under that title, Another Fine Mess, from Oliver Hardy's often-used catchphrase directed towards his film comedy partner Stan Laurel, supposedly \\"This is another fine mess you've gotten me into.\\" (The actual catchphrase referred to \\"another nice mess\\".) After it was too late to change the catalog, Asprin decided that using \\"Myth\\" would be much better if the book would become a series. They changed the title and claimed a typo in the catalog.Author's Introduction from \\"M.Y.T.H. INC. LINK\\" by Robert Asprin. (unconfirmed) According to Asprin, the original inspiration for the Myth Adventures was the \\"Road to...\\" comedy movie series, which stars Bing Crosby and Bob Hope as wandering con-artists/adventurers. Characters The stories mostly revolve around the adventures of a few central characters: * Skeeve, a youngish journeyman magician from the backwater dimension of Klah. * Aahz, a green, scaly \\"demon\\" (short for \\"dimension traveler\\") from the dimension of Perv, a world known for its foul- tempered reptilian humanoid inhabitants. Aahz (short for Aahzmandius) takes Skeeve on as his apprentice, despite having lost his powers through a prank pulled by Skeeve's now-deceased mentor, Garkin, at the beginning of the first novel. Later on, he and Skeeve dissolve their mentor/apprentice relationship and become partners in a magician-for-hire enterprise called M.Y.T.H. Inc. * Gleep, Skeeve's excitable pet, a baby dragon with a one-word eponymous vocabulary (\\"Gleep!\\") that belies his incredible intellect. However, in the twelfth book Gleep speaks simple, short phrases. * Massha, a woman of truly monumental girth with bright orange hair and a gaudy fashion sense; she begins the series as \\"only\\" an expert user of magical weapons and tools, but eventually apprentices herself to Skeeve. * Guido and Nunzio, a pair of hulking and highly capable bodyguards attached to Skeeve as a favor from the interdimensional Mafia's Fairy Godfather, Don Bruce. Nunzio seldom talks, while Guido speaks in a Runyonesque dialect, which is explained as being an aftereffect of having been in a production of Guys and Dolls. Both are much more intelligent than their stereotype suggests. * Chumley, an enormous but quite gentle and erudite Troll whose professional persona is a monosyllabic muscle-for-hire called Big Crunch. * Tananda, a.k.a. Tanda, a professional assassin and Chumley's nymphish Trollop sister. * Bunny, Don Bruce's beautiful niece and Skeeve's assigned moll; she is an accomplished and intelligent accountant and is in love with Skeeve (though he does not know it). * Markie, a small doll-like girl who is actually a character assassin in disguise. Cupys (small, doll-like people) are from the Cupid dimension. The Phil Foglio comics based on the books also involve The Winslow: A small fuzzy alligator which happens to be utterly indestructible and presumably immortal, and figures prominently one way or another into fully three-fourths of the galaxy's known religions. Known dimensions Many of the names, like so much else in this series, are puns; see the parenthetical comments. *Klah: Backwater dimension from which Skeeve hails. General populace (Klahds) are afraid of demons and magik. Kingdom of Possiltum and Twixt are the only places worth mentioning. (\\"clod\\", slang for \\"stupid person\\".) *Deva: Merchant capital of the dimensions. Inhabited by the Deveels, traders supreme. As Aahz puts it, \\"if you think you've gotten a good deal from a Deveel, first count your fingers, then your limbs, then your relatives\\". The Bazaar at Deva is the only place of interest, a dimension-wide round-the-clock flea market which sells every conceivable magikal device and artifact. (\\"Devil\\") *Perv: High-tech dimension where Magik and technology are equal. Pervish cooking is one of the worst smells in all the dimensions (besides Gleep's breath). Pervects are short- tempered and disquieting rumors circulate about them, which Pervects encourage so that people do not visit. Do not ever call them \\"Perverts\\". *Limbo: Dark dimension filled with vampires and were-things, such as werewolves, werebears, weresnakes, and weretigers. Chief city is Blut, notable people are Vilhelm the Dispatcher, and Drahcir and Idnew: the Woof Writers, a husband and wife team of werewolves (homages to Wendy and Richard Pini). The low amount of force- lines limit magik here, and offworlders are viewed as terrifying monsters by the older vampires. Skeeve's house in the Bazaar has a back door which opens into Limbo. (Limbo) *Jahk: Humanoid dimension where the average inhabitants are either short and obese or extremely thin. Every year, the Big Game is played to determine whether Veygus or Ta-Hoe is the capital of the dimension. Players are practically another species, extremely muscled and large. The winner of the Big Game used to claim the Trophy, but the hideous thing is now in the possession of Aahz, after the Skeeve-founded team \\"The Demons\\" won it in a three-way brawl. Following their victory and subsequent confiscation of the Trophy (and with it Jahk's method of selecting their capital) a Common Council was put together to rule the dimension. (\\"Jock\\", \\"Vegas\\", \\"Tahoe\\") *Avis: Dimension full of sentient birds. No areas of interest. Do not visit Avis unless you can fly and you like foods of the crawly variety. (Latin for \\"bird\\". Tanda also makes references to Rentals, which mystifies Skeeve, this comes from the Avis Rent a Car System.) *Gastropo: A dimension full of snail- like inhabitants. The preferred mode of transport is walking, although that takes hours just to move a block. Unadvisable to visit. As Tananda would put it, they have no cargo but plenty of es-cargo(t). (In biological categorization, snails are gastropods. \\"Escargot\\" is French for \\"snail\\"; the \\"t\\" is silent, so it rhymes with \\"cargo\\".) *Arcadia: A pleasant dimension \\"controlled\\" by a hard-working \\"philanthropist\\" named Hoos. Apparently populated by people that he's bailed out of tight situations, it's implied that behind the scenes Hoos was largely responsible for putting them in the situations they were so grateful for having been rescued from. (Arcadia, a poetic byword for an idyllic vision of unspoiled wilderness.) *Kow-Tow: An extremely remote dimension that superficially resembles the American \\"Wild West\\", but is actually a breeding ground for humans so that the vampire cows can suck their blood. Contains a huge nexus of magic force-lines. *Scamaroni: A dimension with a smell-oriented race that has a reputation for being made up of suckers. (\\"Scam\\" = con game.) *Kobol: A dimension of technology enthusiasts. (\\"COBOL\\", and possibly also \\"kobold\\".) *Ronko: A dimension filled with televisions and advertising. (\\"Ronco\\") *Wuh: Rural dimension that is home to cowardly, sheep-like shopaholics called Wuhses. (\\"Wuss\\".) *Sear: A bleak desert dimension inhabited by tiny soil-dwelling critters. (\\"Sear\\", \\"sere\\") *Ori: A dimension whose inhabitants resemble house cats. *Walt: The natives look a bit like a mix between storks and ostriches, and are famous for their dancing prowess. (\\"waltz\\") *Febrile: Coolest temperature is over 120 ¬∞F. (\\"Febrile\\"= \\"feverish\\") *Molder: A dark, damp place where everything always seems to be changing. Even the ground seems to grow and move under your feet. (\\"Molder\\") *Etc.: One long, straight road with identical buildings on both sides. Inhabited by creatures that look and dress identical. Gray suits, gray hair, gray face, two arms. All move at the identical time and in the same direction. *Bumppp: Wide meadow filled with thick plants and orange flowers. blue sky and pink mountains. Inhabited by large snake creatures that appear to be hostile. *Mall: Its where the Bill collectors came from where Skeeve apparently ran up 350,000 gold pieces in debt. Myth-Taken Identity Dimensions that have been mentioned but not explicitly depicted: *Imper: Not much is known about Imper except that it is close to Deva and the Imps were wiped out financially by the Deveels. The Imps have since tried to mimic the Deveels (whom they physically resemble) with only marginal success. The kindest thing anyone has said about Imps is that they are snappy dressers. (\\"Imp\\") *Trollia: Chumley and Tanda's home dimension. The males are Trolls, and the females are Trollops. (\\"Troll\\", \\"trollop\\") *Rinasp: A dimension that suffered a ghastly fate when Tanda was hired to go there on a collection job. (Apparently a syllable-swap of \\"Asprin\\".) *Archiah: The dimension that \\"invented archery\\". *Zoorik: Home of the Gnomes, who are implied to be financial wizards. (\\"Gnomes of Z√ºrich\\", pronounced in English.) *Ratislava: Whose rat inhabitants created an extremely powerful magical device that was then stolen and taken off- dimension. *Mantico: Home of the formidable Manticore race. *Djinger: Home and base of operations for the Djinns. The Djinns, like the Imps, were hit hard by the cut-throat tactics of the Deveels, so they started providing emigrant magickal labor in bottles and lamps. Males are Djinns, females are Djeanies. (\\"Djinn\\", \\"genie\\", I Dream of Jeannie, probably also \\"ginger\\") *Trofi: A dimension that has no businessmen, instead, everything is won in contests. It is also the dimension known for matchmaking. Many dimension travelers want a Trofi wife. (\\"Trophy\\", \\"trophy wife\\") *Cupid: Home of small doll-like people. They appear as young Klahds, when they are actually fully grown. *Caf: A dimension of Gorgon-ish creatures with living hair that brew the best coffee in all the known dimensions. *Mini: Home to the tiny, diminutive Minikins.

In 2010, Baen Books published a collection of Asprin's short myth-stories under the title Myth-Interpretations. Illustrated novels The first novel was adapted into an eight-part WaRP Graphics comic book series in the mid-1980s. Illustrated and heavily rewritten by Phil Foglio, the series was later collected into two full-color graphic novels published by Starblaze Graphics, and in 2007 Airship Entertainment (the Foglios' publishing concern) reprinted the material in a single volume. Four more issues followed, featuring an original story by Asprin and artist Jim Valentino which attempts to bridge the action between the first and second novels in the series. (Apple Comics took over the second series halfway through.) In 2010, Airship Entertainment began re-releasing the story as a web comic. The second novel was later adapted into another eight-part comic series by Ken and Beth Mitchroney and published by Apple from 1987 through 1989. Neither of these two later series enjoyed a graphic novel collection. Foglio has also done the cover art and accompanying illustrations for the first editions of most of the novels. Before he started the cover illustrations, Kelly Freas did the covers of the first editions of the earliest books of the series. Film and theater Short-lived rumors circulated in the 1980s that Wendy and Richard Pini, owners of WaRP Graphics, were considering turning their adaptation of Another Fine Myth into a feature- length movie after doing so with their own property, Elfquest, though the latter has yet to even make it past concept to this day. The board game A board game called \\"Myth Fortunes\\" was developed by Mayfair Games. Featuring more of Foglio's artwork, the game assigns each player an identity from the series, which they attempt to keep hidden from the other players as they work their way around the board. It includes a \\"subgame\\" which offers the opportunity to play the infinitely complicated card game \\"Dragon Poker\\" from the series entry Little Myth Marker. Designers included Micki Niebling, John Danovich, Matt Forbeck and Bryan Winter.

News Corporation, of Rupert Murdoch, began acquiring Star TV in 1993. In March 1994, the BBC and Star TV reached a deal after an out of court settlement, that would gradually drop BBC World Service Television from the satellite broadcaster's offerings. BBC WSTV would be dropped from the channel line-up for the Northeast Asia by mid-April that year, but would be available in the rest of Asia until 31 March 1996.\\"Murdoch's STAR TV to drop BBC\\" UPI March 22, 1994Dawtrey, Adam \\"BBC, Star TV to split in parts of Asia\\" Variety March 21, 1994Look what happened in Asia: The BBC's World Service Television is a sure winner, but it needs better backing if it is to keep its audiences, says Jonathan Eyal, The Independent, 27 March 1994 BBC World Service Television programming was also carried in Africa on M-Net, launched on 15 April 1992, for 11 hours a day.Africa Research Bulletin: Political, social, and cultural series, Volume 29, Blackwell, 1992, page 10559 In Canada, its bulletins were carried on CBC Newsworld several times a day.BBC Worldwide The BBC World Service Magazine, Issues 9-14, November 1993 Presentation The channel from 1991 until c.1994 used the presentation device of a rotating world: the Computer Originated World, which had previously been used on BBC One between 1985 and 1991.

He led Spartan forces during the Persian Wars from 490 BC to 478 BC. Born in Sparta around 545 BC, Leotychidas was a descendant of the Royal House of the Eurypontids (through Menamus, Agesilaus, Hippocratides, Leotychides, Anaxilaus, Archidamos, Anaxandridas I and Theopompus) and came to power in 491 BC with the help of the Agiad King Cleomenes I by challenging the legitimacy of the birth of Demaratus for the Eurypontid throne of Sparta. Later that year, he joined Cleomenes' second expedition to Aegina, where ten hostages were seized and given to Athens. However, after Cleomenes' death in 488 BC, Leotychidas was almost surrendered to Aegina. In the spring of 479 BC, following the death of his co-ruler Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae, Leotychidas commanded a Greek fleet consisting of 110 ships at Aegina and later at Delos, supporting the Greek revolts at Chios and Samos against Persia. Leotychidas defeated Persian military and naval forces at the Battle of Mycale on the coast of Asia Minor in the summer of 479 BC (possibly around mid-August). In 476 BC, Leotychidas led an expedition to Thessaly against the Aleuadae family for collaboration with the Persians but withdrew after being bribed by the family. Upon returning to Sparta he was tried for bribery, and fled to the temple of Athena Alea in Tegea. He was sentenced to exile and his house burned. He was succeeded by his grandson, Archidamus II, son of his son Zeuxidamus, called Cyniscus, who had died in his father's lifetime. Leotychidas died some years later, around 469 BC. Leotychidas is not to be confused with another Eurypontid, Leotychides, who was the (allegedly illegitimate) son of Agis II. Further reading *Andrew R.

Sikaso) is a city in the south of Mali and the capital of the Sikasso Cercle and the Sikasso Region. It is Mali's second largest city with 225,753 residents in the 2009 census. History Sikasso was founded at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Mansa Douala. The town was a small village until 1876 when Tieba Traor√©, whose mother came from Sikasso, became King of the K√©n√©dougou Empire and moved its capital there. He established his palace on the sacred Mamelon hill (now home to a water tower) and constructed a tata or fortifying wall to defend against the attacks of both the Malinke conqueror Samori Ture and the French colonial army. The city withstood a long siege from 1887 to 1888 but fell to the French in 1898.L-G. Binger, Du Niger au golfe de Guin√©e, Hachette, 1892, p. 88 Rather than surrender to the colonial army, Tieba's brother Babemba Traor√©, who had succeeded him as king, committed suicide, honoring the famous Bamanankan saying \\"Saya ka fisa ni maloya ye\\" (literally: death is preferable to shame). Attractions today include the large market, Mamelon hill, the remains of Tieba Traor√©'s tata, and the nearby Missirikoro Grotto. The festival Triangle du balafon takes place every June, celebrating the traditional Malian instrument. Sikasso's sister city is Brive- la-Gaillarde, France. Geography Located southeast of Bamako, north of C√¥te d'Ivoire, and west of Burkina Faso, Sikasso acts as a crossroads between the coastal countries (Togo, B√©nin, Ghana, C√¥te d'Ivoire) and the landlocked Mali and Burkina Faso. Sikasso's ethnic groups include the Senufo Bamana,(mainly the Supyire), the Bobo (or Bobo Fing, lit. 'black Bobo'), and the Minianka (Mamara Senufo). Sikasso has abundant agriculture. Sikasso's fruit and vegetable production guarantees the city's self-sufficiency, sparing it from reliance on international food aid. Climate Sikasso features a tropical wet and dry climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification. The city receives just under of rain each year, most of which falls between May and October.

The steps, in order, are trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice analysis, and route assignment. Trip distribution's zonal interchange analysis yields a set of origin destination tables that tells where the trips will be made. Mode choice analysis allows the modeler to determine what mode of transport will be used, and what modal share results. The early transportation planning model developed by the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) focused on transit. It wanted to know how much travel would continue by transit. The CATS divided transit trips into two classes: trips to the Central Business District, or CBD (mainly by subway/elevated transit, express buses, and commuter trains) and other (mainly on the local bus system). For the latter, increases in auto ownership and use were a trade-off against bus use; trend data were used. CBD travel was analyzed using historic mode choice data together with projections of CBD land uses. Somewhat similar techniques were used in many studies. Two decades after CATS, for example, the London study followed essentially the same procedure, but in this case, researchers first divided trips into those made in the inner part of the city and those in the outer part. This procedure was followed because it was thought that income (resulting in the purchase and use of automobiles) drove mode choice. Diversion curve techniques The CATS had diversion curve techniques available and used them for some tasks. At first, the CATS studied the diversion of auto traffic from streets and arterial roads to proposed expressways. Diversion curves were also used for bypasses built around cities to find out what percent of traffic would use the bypass. The mode choice version of diversion curve analysis proceeds this way: one forms a ratio, say: : \\\\frac{c_\\\\text{transit} } {c_\\\\text{auto} } = R where: :cm = travel time by mode m and :R is empirical data in the form: Figure: Mode choice diversion curve Given the R that we have calculated, the graph tells us the percent of users in the market that will choose transit. A variation on the technique is to use costs rather than time in the diversion ratio. The decision to use a time or cost ratio turns on the problem at hand. Transit agencies developed diversion curves for different kinds of situations, so variables like income and population density entered implicitly. Diversion curves are based on empirical observations, and their improvement has resulted from better (more and more pointed) data. Curves are available for many markets. It is not difficult to obtain data and array results. Expansion of transit has motivated data development by operators and planners. Yacov Zahavi‚Äôs UMOT studies, discussed earlier, contain many examples of diversion curves. In a sense, diversion curve analysis is expert system analysis. Planners could \\"eyeball\\" neighborhoods and estimate transit ridership by routes and time of day. Instead, diversion is observed empirically and charts drawn. Disaggregate travel demand models Travel demand theory was introduced in the appendix on traffic generation. The core of the field is the set of models developed following work by Stan Warner in 1962 (Strategic Choice of Mode in Urban Travel: A Study of Binary Choice). Using data from the CATS, Warner investigated classification techniques using models from biology and psychology. Building from Warner and other early investigators, disaggregate demand models emerged. Analysis is disaggregate in that individuals are the basic units of observation, yet aggregate because models yield a single set of parameters describing the choice behavior of the population. Behavior enters because the theory made use of consumer behavior concepts from economics and parts of choice behavior concepts from psychology. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley (especially Daniel McFadden, who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his efforts) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Moshe Ben-Akiva) (and in MIT associated consulting firms, especially Cambridge Systematics) developed what has become known as choice models, direct demand models (DDM), Random Utility Models (RUM) or, in its most used form, the multinomial logit model (MNL). Choice models have attracted a lot of attention and work; the Proceedings of the International Association for Travel Behavior Research chronicles the evolution of the models. The models are treated in modern transportation planning and transportation engineering textbooks. One reason for rapid model development was a felt need. Systems were being proposed (especially transit systems) where no empirical experience of the type used in diversion curves was available. Choice models permit comparison of more than two alternatives and the importance of attributes of alternatives. There was the general desire for an analysis technique that depended less on aggregate analysis and with a greater behavioral content. And there was attraction, too, because choice models have logical and behavioral roots extended back to the 1920s as well as roots in Kelvin Lancaster‚Äôs consumer behavior theory, in utility theory, and in modern statistical methods. Psychological roots Distribution of perceived weights Early psychology work involved the typical experiment: Here are two objects with weights, w1 and w2, which is heavier? The finding from such an experiment would be that the greater the difference in weight, the greater the probability of choosing correctly. Graphs similar to the one on the right result. Louis Leon Thurstone proposed (in the 1920s) that perceived weight, :w = v + e, where v is the true weight and e is random with :E(e) = 0. The assumption that e is normally and identically distributed (NID) yields the binary probit model. Econometric formulation Economists deal with utility rather than physical weights, and say that :observed utility = mean utility + random term. The characteristics of the object, x, must be considered, so we have :u(x) = v(x) + e(x). If we follow Thurston's assumption, we again have a probit model. An alternative is to assume that the error terms are independently and identically distributed with a Weibull, Gumbel Type I, or double exponential distribution. (They are much the same, and differ slightly in their tails (thicker) from the normal distribution). This yields the multinomial logit model (MNL). Daniel McFadden argued that the Weibull had desirable properties compared to other distributions that might be used. Among other things, the error terms are normally and identically distributed. The logit model is simply a log ratio of the probability of choosing a mode to the probability of not choosing a mode. : \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac{P_i } {1 - P_i } \\\\right) = v(x_i ) Observe the mathematical similarity between the logit model and the S-curves we estimated earlier, although here share increases with utility rather than time. With a choice model we are explaining the share of travelers using a mode (or the probability that an individual traveler uses a mode multiplied by the number of travelers). The comparison with S-curves is suggestive that modes (or technologies) get adopted as their utility increases, which happens over time for several reasons. First, because the utility itself is a function of network effects, the more users, the more valuable the service, higher the utility associated with joining the network. Second because utility increases as user costs drop, which happens when fixed costs can be spread over more users (another network effect). Third technological advances, which occur over time and as the number of users increases, drive down relative cost. An illustration of a utility expression is given: : \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac{P_A } {1 - P_A } \\\\right) = \\\\beta _0 + \\\\beta _1 \\\\left( c_A - c_T \\\\right) + \\\\beta _2 \\\\left( t_A - t_T \\\\right) + \\\\beta _3 I + \\\\beta _4 N = v_A where :Pi = Probability of choosing mode i. :PA = Probability of taking auto :cA,cT = cost of auto, transit :tA,tT = travel time of auto, transit :I = income :N = Number of travelers With algebra, the model can be translated to its most widely used form: : \\\\frac{P_A } {1 - P_A } = e^{v_A } : P_A = e^{v_A } - P_A e^{v_A } : P_A \\\\left( 1 + e^{v_A } \\\\right) = e^{v_A } : P_A = \\\\frac{e^{v_A } } {1 + e^{v_A } } It is fair to make two conflicting statements about the estimation and use of this model: #it's a \\"house of cards\\", and #used by a technically competent and thoughtful analyst, it's useful. The \\"house of cards\\" problem largely arises from the utility theory basis of the model specification. Broadly, utility theory assumes that (1) users and suppliers have perfect information about the market; (2) they have deterministic functions (faced with the same options, they will always make the same choices); and (3) switching between alternatives is costless. These assumptions don‚Äôt fit very well with what is known about behavior. Furthermore, the aggregation of utility across the population is impossible since there is no universal utility scale. Suppose an option has a net utility ujk (option k, person j). We can imagine that having a systematic part vjk that is a function of the characteristics of an object and person j, plus a random part ejk, which represents tastes, observational errors and a bunch of other things (it gets murky here). (An object such as a vehicle does not have utility, it is characteristics of a vehicle that have utility.) The introduction of e lets us do some aggregation. As noted above, we think of observable utility as being a function: : v_A = \\\\beta _0 + \\\\beta _1 \\\\left( c_A - c_T \\\\right) + \\\\beta _2 \\\\left( t_A - t_T \\\\right) + \\\\beta _3 I + \\\\beta _4 N where each variable represents a characteristic of the auto trip. The value Œ≤0 is termed an alternative specific constant. Most modelers say it represents characteristics left out of the equation (e.g., the political correctness of a mode, if I take transit I feel morally righteous, so Œ≤0 may be negative for the automobile), but it includes whatever is needed to make error terms NID. Econometric estimation Figure: Likelihood Function for the Sample {1,1,1,0,1}. Turning now to some technical matters, how do we estimate v(x)? Utility (v(x)) isn‚Äôt observable. All we can observe are choices (say, measured as 0 or 1), and we want to talk about probabilities of choices that range from 0 to 1. (If we do a regression on 0s and 1s we might measure for j a probability of 1.4 or ‚àí0.2 of taking an auto.) Further, the distribution of the error terms wouldn‚Äôt have appropriate statistical characteristics. The MNL approach is to make a maximum likelihood estimate of this functional form. The likelihood function is: : L^* = \\\\prod_{n = 1}^N {f\\\\left( {y_n \\\\left {x_n ,\\\\theta } \\\\right.} \\\\right)} we solve for the estimated parameters : \\\\hat \\\\theta \\\\, that max L*. This happens when: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial L} {\\\\partial \\\\hat \\\\theta _N } = 0 The log-likelihood is easier to work with, as the products turn to sums: : \\\\ln L^* = \\\\sum_{n = 1}^N \\\\ln f\\\\left( y_n \\\\left x_n ,\\\\theta \\\\right. \\\\right) Consider an example adopted from John Bitzan‚Äôs Transportation Economics Notes. Let X be a binary variable that is equal to 1 with probability Œ≥, and equal to 0 with probability (1 ‚àí gamma). Then f(0) = (1 ‚àí Œ≥) and f(1) = Œ≥. Suppose that we have 5 observations of X, giving the sample {1,1,1,0,1}. To find the maximum likelihood estimator of Œ≥ examine various values of Œ≥, and for these values determine the probability of drawing the sample {1,1,1,0,1} If Œ≥ takes the value 0, the probability of drawing our sample is 0. If Œ≥ is 0.1, then the probability of getting our sample is: f(1,1,1,0,1) = f(1)f(1)f(1)f(0)f(1) = 0.1√ó0.1√ó0.1√ó0.9√ó0.1 = 0.00009 We can compute the probability of obtaining our sample over a range of Œ≥ ‚Äì this is our likelihood function. The likelihood function for n independent observations in a logit model is : L^* = \\\\prod_{n = 1}^N {P_i ^{Y_i } } \\\\left( 1 - P_i \\\\right)^{1 - Y_i } where: Yi = 1 or 0 (choosing e.g. auto or not- auto) and Pi = the probability of observing Yi = 1 The log likelihood is thus: : \\\\ell = \\\\ln L^* = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\\\left[ Y_i \\\\ln P_i + \\\\left( 1 - Y_i \\\\right)\\\\ln \\\\left( 1 - P_i \\\\right) \\\\right] In the binomial (two alternative) logit model, : P_\\\\text{auto} = \\\\frac{e^{v(x_\\\\text{auto} )} } {1 + e^{v(x_\\\\text{auto} )} } , so : \\\\ell = \\\\ln L^* = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\\\left[ Y_i v(x_\\\\text{auto} ) - \\\\ln \\\\left( 1 + e^{v(x_\\\\text{auto} )} \\\\right) \\\\right] The log-likelihood function is maximized setting the partial derivatives to zero: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ell}{\\\\partial \\\\beta} = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\\\left( Y_i - \\\\hat P_i \\\\right) = 0 The above gives the essence of modern MNL choice modeling. Additional topics Topics not touched on include the ‚Äúred bus, blue bus‚Äù problem; the use of nested models (e.g., estimate choice between auto and transit, and then estimate choice between rail and bus transit); how consumers‚Äô surplus measurements may be obtained; and model estimation, goodness of fit, etc. For these topics see a textbook such as Ortuzar and Willumsen (2001). Returning to roots The discussion above is based on the economist‚Äôs utility formulation. At the time MNL modeling was developed there was some attention to psychologist's choice work (e.g., Luce‚Äôs choice axioms discussed in his Individual Choice Behavior, 1959). It has an analytic side in computational process modeling. Emphasis is on how people think when they make choices or solve problems (see Newell and Simon 1972). Put another way, in contrast to utility theory, it stresses not the choice but the way the choice was made. It provides a conceptual framework for travel choices and agendas of activities involving considerations of long and short term memory, effectors, and other aspects of thought and decision processes. It takes the form of rules dealing with the way information is searched and acted on. Although there is a lot of attention to behavioral analysis in transportation work, the best of modern psychological ideas are only beginning to enter the field.

He founded the Stewart-Warner Corporation. In his lifetime he founded or purchased several companies and held 82 patents. Biography He was born in 1870 in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. He married Julia Pearl Butler in 1896, the couple had three daughters. In what became training for their futures in manufacturing, Stewart and Thomas J. Clark worked at a factory in New Hampshire that produced horse clipping machinery. The lifelong friends later moved to Providence, Rhode Island and worked for the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company. Then, in approximately 1890, the two traveled to Chicago, Illinois where they entered into partnership and manufactured horse clippers, sheep clippers, bicycle handle bars and flexible shafts among other products. He died on June 1, 1916 in New York City. Companies founded=Chicago Flexible Shaft Company In 1893 Stewart & Clark founded the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company (incorporated 1897) to manufacture flexible driveshafts and mechanical sheep shears. Stewart and Charles Timson of Wm. Cooper & Nephews partnered in founding the Cooper-Stewart Sheep Shearing Machinery Co in 1896 and sold the sheep shearing products through this new company. In 1903 Wm. Cooper & Nephews purchased 50% ownership of the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company. In 1908 Wm. Cooper & Nephews purchased the remaining 50% of Chicago Flexible Shaft Company for $400,000. Julia Stewarts nephew remained the president of Chicago Flexible Shaft Company after the sale. In 1910, the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company introduced its first home appliance, an electric iron, under the brand name Sunbeam. The Sunbeam Mixmaster was introduced in 1930. By 1946, Sunbeam appliances had become so successful and widely sold that the company name would change formally to Sunbeam Corporation. Sterk Manufacturing Company Around 1896 Stewart and Clark founded the Sterk Manufacturing Company which produced speedometers and automobile horns. The flexible shafts from the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company were used in the production of cables needed for the speedometers. Stewart & Clark Manufacturing Company In 1905 Stewart & Clark Manufacturing Company was founded and acquired all assets of the Sterk Manufacturing Company. The partners erected a small manufacturing plant on Diversey Parkway in Chicago. This plant would eventually grow to a one million square foot (93,000 m¬≤) manufacturing and headquarters facility for Stewart-Warner until the company left Chicago in 1988. Due to his patents, Stewart collected $311,000 in royalties, which were calculated at $5 per speedometer sold in 1909. Unfortunately, Clark was killed while demonstrating the Stewart speedometer in a Packard during the 1907 Glidden Tour #.Untitled Document at www.vmcca.org Stewart acquired Clarks' share of the company. J.K. Stewart Manufacturing Company Due to the need for the blades of clippers & shears to last longer and remain sharp, Stewart worked with Edward Larson to build a heat treatment furnace for tempering steel. In 1906 the two formed the E.A. Larson & Brothers Company to take advantage of the processes they developed to provide die casting for speedometer production as well as other companies in the area. In 1908, E.A. Larson was reorganized as the J.K. Stewart Manufacturing Company. Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corporation Stewart and rival instrument manufacturer, Warner Instrument Company, were in heated legal battles over patent infringements by both parties. All lawsuits ceased when Stewart bought the Warner Instrument Company in 1912. Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corporation was formed the same year by consolidating the Warner Company with the Stewart & Clark Manufacturing Company. Once again the name changed in 1929 to Stewart- Warner Corporation. Stewart Phonograph Company A lover of music, Stewart ventured into the phonograph market in 1915. Eventually becoming a division of Stewart-Warner, the phonograph company expanded to include radios, televisions, and the required accessories such as speakers. Miscellaneous * John K Stewart dictated, onto 18 business phonograph cylinders, instructions for the construction of a oceangoing personal yacht. This yacht was built and named The Sialia. * Wm. Cooper & Nephews declined the opportunity to purchase a portion of Stewarts' speedometer company, believing the product was too speculative. - Starting in 1908 Stewart Speedometers were installed in Fords Model-Ts. * In 1916, Leander H. La Chance, Mrs. Stewart's half-nephew, was president of Chicago Flexible Shaft and in 1910 the company produces its first household appliance the Princess Electric Iron under the brand name of Sunbeam, a brand that still provides appliances today.

In mathematics, the transfer operator encodes information about an iterated map and is frequently used to study the behavior of dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, quantum chaos and fractals. In all usual cases, the largest eigenvalue is 1, and the corresponding eigenvector is the invariant measure of the system. The transfer operator is sometimes called the Ruelle operator, after David Ruelle, or the Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius operator, in reference to the applicability of the Frobenius‚ÄìPerron theorem to the determination of the eigenvalues of the operator. Definition The iterated function to be studied is a map f\\\\colon X\\\\rightarrow X for an arbitrary set X. The transfer operator is defined as an operator \\\\mathcal{L} acting on the space of functions \\\\\\\\{\\\\Phi\\\\colon X\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\\\\\} as :(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\Phi)(x) = \\\\sum_{y\\\\in f^{-1}(x)} g(y) \\\\Phi(y) where g\\\\colon X\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{C} is an auxiliary valuation function. When f has a Jacobian determinant J, then g is usually taken to be g=1/J. The above definition of the transfer operator can be shown to be the point-set limit of the measure-theoretic pushforward of g: in essence, the transfer operator is the direct image functor in the category of measurable spaces. The left-adjoint of the Frobenius-Perron operator is the Koopman operator or composition operator. The general setting is provided by the Borel functional calculus. As a general rule, the transfer operator can usually be interpreted as a (left-)shift operator acting on a shift space. The most commonly studied shifts are the subshifts of finite type. The adjoint to the transfer operator can likewise usually be interpreted as a right-shift. Particularly well studied right-shifts include the Jacobi operator and the Hessenberg matrix, both of which generate systems of orthogonal polynomials via a right-shift. Applications Whereas the iteration of a function f naturally leads to a study of the orbits of points of X under iteration (the study of point dynamics), the transfer operator defines how (smooth) maps evolve under iteration. Thus, transfer operators typically appear in physics problems, such as quantum chaos and statistical mechanics, where attention is focused on the time evolution of smooth functions. In turn, this has medical applications to rational drug design, through the field of molecular dynamics. It is often the case that the transfer operator is positive, has discrete positive real-valued eigenvalues, with the largest eigenvalue being equal to one. For this reason, the transfer operator is sometimes called the Frobenius- Perron operator. The eigenfunctions of the transfer operator are usually fractals. When the logarithm of the transfer operator corresponds to a quantum Hamiltonian, the eigenvalues will typically be very closely spaced, and thus even a very narrow and carefully selected ensemble of quantum states will encompass a large number of very different fractal eigenstates with non-zero support over the entire volume. This can be used to explain many results from classical statistical mechanics, including the irreversibility of time and the increase of entropy. The transfer operator of the Bernoulli map b(x)=2x-\\\\lfloor 2x\\\\rfloor is exactly solvable and is a classic example of deterministic chaos; the discrete eigenvalues correspond to the Bernoulli polynomials. This operator also has a continuous spectrum consisting of the Hurwitz zeta function. The transfer operator of the Gauss map h(x)=1/x-\\\\lfloor 1/x \\\\rfloor is called the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing (GKW) operator and due to its extraordinary difficulty, has not been fully solved. The theory of the GKW dates back to a hypothesis by Gauss on continued fractions and is closely related to the Riemann zeta function.

Her father was the youngest of four children born to Admiral Frederick Maxse and Cecilia Steel. Her siblings were Gen. Sir Ivor Maxse (1862‚Äì1958), a British Army officer of the First World War; Leopold Maxse (1864‚Äì1932), editor of the National Review, and Olive Hermione Maxse (1867‚Äì1955), a model for Edward Burne-Jones. She married, firstly, Lord Edward Cecil, son of the British Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne- Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, on 18 June 1894. She exchanged letters with the British statesman Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner during his time in South Africa as High Commissioner, and alongside Violet Markham she established the Victoria League in 1901 to promote Milner's imperial vision of the British Empire. Lord Edward died in 1918 of the Spanish flu, and she married Lord Milner on 26 February 1921. The Viscountess was a staunch advocate of Lord Milner. The two were married 28 February 1921, upon his retirement from Prime Minister Lloyd George's government on 14 February 1921, and on 22 May 1928 she turned over important information relating to World War I and Lord Milner's role at the Doullens Conference in France to the Public Record's Office. Lady Milner took over as editor of the conservative journal National Review after the death of her brother Leopold Maxse in 1932, having supported the publication since he fell ill in 1929. The magazine was known for its opposition to imperial Germany prior to World War I, and to appeasement in the interwar years. Its editor was staunchly defended by conservative leader Bonar Law.Beaverbrook, Lord, The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George, New York: Duell, 1963, pgs. 194-195 Viscountess Milner was present in France on November 11, 1933, the 15th anniversary of the Armistice, where she dedicated a marble bust of her late husband, Alfred, in a conference room on the second floor of Doullens Town Hall.

He was the national president of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1980The Canberra Times, 9 September 1980 (p.1) to 1986 and chairman of both the Lionel Murphy Foundation and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) from 1986 to 1991. Early years Wran was born in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, the eighth and last child of Joseph Wran and his wife Lillian (n√©e Langley). He was educated at Nicholson Street Public School, Balmain, Fort Street Boys High and the University of Sydney, where he was a member of the Liberal Club, and from which he gained a Bachelor of Laws in 1948. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1951, called to the Bar in 1957, and became a Queen's Counsel in 1968. Political career Wran began his political career in 1970 when he became a member of the upper house of the Parliament of New South Wales, the Legislative Council. Three years afterwards, he moved to the lower house, the Legislative Assembly, in the seat of Bass Hill. Support for this move had been organised by the General Secretary of the FMWU, Ray Gietzelt. He then challenged Pat Hills for the state leadership of the Labor Party (which Hills had held since 1968). In this challenge he had cross-faction support from right-wing powerbroker John Ducker and left-winger Jack Ferguson. There were two rounds to the leadership vote which resulted in a tie between Hills and Wran in the second ballot. However, under Labor Party rules of the time, in the event of a tie in the second ballot, the candidate who won the most votes in the first ballot would be the winner. Since Wran had won one vote more than Hills in the first ballot, Wran was therefore declared the new leader. In May 1976, six months after Gough Whitlam's federal Labor government's dismissal, Wran led Labor to victory, narrowly defeating the Liberal Party premier, Sir Eric Willis. Wran's win was not assured until it became clear that Gosford and Hurstville had fallen to Labor by only 74 and 44 votes respectively, giving Wran a one-seat majority. In 1978, campaigning with the slogan \\"Wran's our Man\\", his government won a 13-seat swing, popularly known as the \\"Wranslide.\\" This came on the back of 57.7 percent of the primary vote, the largest primary vote for any party in a century. The Opposition Leader on that occasion, Peter Coleman, lost his seat. In 1981, Wran won a second \\"Wranslide\\", picking up a six-seat swing for what is still NSW Labor's largest proportion of seats in Parliament (69 out of 99 seats, 69.7 percent of the chamber). The Opposition Leader, Bruce McDonald, failed to be elected to the seat that he contested, marking the second time in a row that an Opposition Leader had failed to be elected to Parliament. Labor also reduced the Liberals to 14 seats, the same as its nominal junior partner, the National Country Party. He won a fourth term in 1984; although he suffered an 11-seat swing, he still won a larger majority than any of the victories won by the Liberals' Sir Robert Askin in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1977, Wran supported Al Grassby, former Federal Immigration Minister, in allowing Domenico Barbaro, a Mafia figure in the Griffith region of New South Wales, back into Australia after having been earlier deported because of his criminal record. However, as journalist David Hickie explains, Wran attempted to undermine the influence of organised crime, particularly in the area of illegal casinos. Wran was also very popular, at one stage rating over 80 per cent approval in opinion polls. He was often talked about as a national political leader and rated highly in national polls as an alternative Labor Leader to Bill Hayden. He featured in Hayden's 1980 federal election campaign, along with Bob Hawke. 200px Wran's first half of his tenure as a Labor premier came at a time when most Australian governments were held by conservative coalitions, a trend subsequently reversed in the early 1980s following the elections of Labor governments to both federal and state parliaments. During his 10 years as Premier of New South Wales, the government embarked on a program of reform and change. Priorities were public transport (with the exception of the Warringah Transport Corridor which was cancelled despite a recommendation by Justice Michael Kirby that it be built), the environment, consumer protection and job creation. He also achieved significant electoral institutional reform such as a democratic Legislative Council, four-year terms, public funding and disclosure laws and a pecuniary interests register for members of parliament. He called on Edwin Lusher, firstly while a QC and then as a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, to chair commissions of inquiry into police administration and gambling.State Library of New South Wales Catalogue He also undertook the state's largest capital works program and refurbished many iconic places in Sydney. His government also built the modern-day Darling Harbour precinct. In 1983, Wran faced the Street Royal Commission over claims by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) current affairs show Four Corners that he had tried to influence the magistracy over the 1977 committal of Kevin Humphreys, who had been charged with misappropriation of funds. His Corrective Services Minister, Rex Jackson, was jailed in 1987 for accepting bribes for the early release of prisoners. In 1984, Neville Wran introduced a private members bill to decriminalise adult gay male sex, and the bill passed the NSW Parliament. This was the first time in recorded history a conscience vote was both introduced and passed by the NSW Parliament. Wran resigned both the premiership and his seat in Parliament on 4 July 1986, after continuously holding office longer than any other premier in the history of New South Wales until that time (10 years and 81 days). Bob Carr has since broken that record. (Henry Parkes served longer than both Wran and Carr in total, serving for 11 years and 278 days over five terms between 1872 and 1891.) The by-election for Wran's seat of Bass Hill was narrowly won by Michael Owen for the Liberal Party‚Äìa harbinger of his party's heavy defeat at the state election two years later. Wran is remembered by the phrase \\"Balmain boys don't cry\\". Personal life Wran in 2010 Wran's first marriage was in 1946 at the age of 20, to Marcia Oliver, a showgirl at the New Tivoli Theatre. Oliver had a young son, whom Wran adopted, and they had one other child, a daughter. In 1976, a month after his divorce was finalised and three months after becoming Premier of New South Wales, Wran married Jill Hickson, and they had two children together. Wran and Hickson separated several times, first briefly in 2006, then in August 2011 after Hickson said she had been \\"frozen out\\" of her husband's personal affairs by his daughter Kim and his friend and business partner Albert Wong. They had reconciled by December 2011. A severe throat infection in 1980 required injections of teflon to strengthen his damaged vocal cords, resulting in his characteristic croaky voice. Death In his later years, Wran had dementia and from July 2012 had been under special care at the Lulworth House aged care facility in Elizabeth Bay. He died there on 20 April 2014 at the age of 87. He was survived by his wife Jill and four children. A state funeral was held at the Sydney Town Hall on 1 May 2014. Honours * In June 1987 he was appointed an Officer in the Order of the Golden Ark (Netherlands) \\"for his contribution to the environment\\". * In October 1987 he was appointed a Grand Officer (2nd Class) of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the President of Italy, Francesco Cossiga. * He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia on 26 January 1988 \\"For service to government and politics and to the New South Wales Parliament\\". * On 6 May 1995 the University of Sydney awarded Wran the degree of Doctor of Laws (honoris causa). * In the 2010 New Year Honours, Wran was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to New Zealand‚ÄìAustralia relations.

Unlike the Ch√¢teau, however, the Lord Elgin was built to primarily serve short-stay guests, particularly those who were in Ottawa on government and military business during the Second World War, especially after the recent loss of the nearby Russell Hotel. As a result, the hotel did not originally contain any ballrooms or elegant restaurants, as would have been expected in a large hotel at that time, and the guest rooms were relatively small. The building features stone walls which are complete with broken courses and are finished by flattened oriel windows and modernistic chevrons. The building is topped by a steep copper chateauesque roof, which, William Lyon Mackenzie King apparently urged the architects to include to reflect the Parliament buildings copper roof. In the 1970s and 1980s, the hotel's impressive facade hid the decline in its fortunes due to changes in the economy, increased competition from international hotel chains also located in the downtown core, and new demands from an ever- evolving younger traveling business class. Significant renovations in the 1990s and 2000s resulted in the construction of large additions to the north and south of the building, the refurbishment and enlargement of existing rooms, and the addition of 60 new guestrooms, new meeting rooms and a new fitness facility which was finished in 2002.Fletcher, 156.

While normal circumstances allow cadavers to be quickly embalmed, cremated, or buried, natural and man-made disasters can quickly overwhelm and/or interrupt the established protocols for dealing with the dead. Under such circumstances, the decomposition and putrefaction of cadavers goes unchecked, and raises a series of health, logistical, and psychological issues. After disasters with extensive loss of life due to trauma rather than disease--earthquakes, storms, human conflict, etc.--many resources are often expended on burying the dead quickly, and applying disinfectant to bodies for the specific purpose of preventing disease. Specialists say that spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower, that \\"resources that should be going into establishment of water supply, sanitation, shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors are being applied to digging mass graves\\", and that \\"Time and time again, eminent and authoritative experts have pointed out that dead bodies do not constitute a health hazard\\". False risks According to health professionals, the fear of spread of disease by bodies killed by trauma rather than disease is not justified. Among others, Steven Rottman, director of the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, said that no scientific evidence exists that bodies of disaster victims increase the risk of epidemics, adding that cadavers posed less risk of contagion than living people. In disasters involving trauma where there is competition for resources, efforts should be focused on establishment of water supply, sanitation, shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors, not digging mass graves. Spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower. Indiscriminate burial of corpses demoralises survivors and the lack of death certificates can cause practical problems to survivors. Other considerations which are very important, but not directly relevant to the topic of health risks, include religious and cultural practices, the stench, and the effect on morale. Roots of incorrect notion The incorrect notion that all dead bodies inherently cause diseases is consistent with: #The incorrect historical miasma theory of disease, which held that diseases are spread by foul air--in this case fouled by the stench of decomposing corpses. #Confusion between normal decay processes and signs of disease; and the incorrect idea that microorganisms responsible for decomposition are dangerous to living people. \\"Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic\\". #After a major disaster disease among survivors is indeed a problem, but is actually due to living in harsh conditions with poor sanitation. \\"Survivors present a much more important reservoir for disease [than cadavers]\\". #Noting that corpses of those who died from certain contagious diseases (for example, in epidemics) do, indeed, spread disease, such as is the case with ebola, smallpox, and the 1918 flu, and incorrectly generalising this to all corpses. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) \\"concern that dead bodies are infectious can be considered a 'natural' reaction by persons wanting to protect themselves from disease\\" although \\"the risk that bodies [of those killed in a natural disaster] pose for the public is extremely small\\". Real risks Contamination of water supplies by unburied bodies, burial sites, or temporary storage sites may result in the spread of gastroenteritis from normal intestinal contents.Disposal of dead bodies in emergency conditions. WHO Technical Note 8 According to a PAHO article on the Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters:Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others. The substances cadaverine and putrescine are produced during the decomposition of animal (including human) bodies, and both give off a foul odor. They are toxic if massive doses are ingested (acute oral toxicity of 2 g per kg of body weight of pure putrescine in rats, a larger dose for cadaverine); there are no effects at all for a tenth of that dose. While figures for humans are not available, allometric scaling, which takes into account body surface area, is often used to compare doses in different animals, with useful results. Online allometric scaling calculator, with explanation and source. Scaling 2g/kg from rats suggests that a 60 kg (132 lb) person would be significantly affected by Using allometric calculator cited, with rat weight=0.15kg, usual exponent of 0.75 of pure putrescine. For comparison the similar substance spermine, found in semen, is over 3 times as toxic.

They are currently managed by Mervyn Pattison. The club won the inaugural Irish Cup in 1881. History Moyola Park was formed during season 1879‚Äì80 under the patronage of Lord Spencer Chichester, the landlord of the Moyola Park estate. The first recorded game was a friendly at home against Cliftonville, on 14 February 1880, in which the visitors recorded a 3-0 victory. Lord Spencer Chichester was the inaugural president of the Irish Football Association, which was formed in November 1880. On 9 April 1881, Moyola Park became the first winners of the Irish Cup, defeating Cliftonville 1‚Äì0 in the final.Moyola Park Association Football Club - A Potted History After those prestigious early days the club became less prominent and did not become a senior club, playing as a junior club outside the Irish League. In the early years of the twentieth century, the club played in a local league in south Londonderry and it continued to do so until the Second World War, with the exception of the 1929‚Äì30 season during which the club participated in the Belfast-based Minor League. After the war, Moyola Park was a founding member of the Ballymena and District Junior League in 1948‚Äì49, where it played until season 1977‚Äì78 (with the exception of 1950‚Äì51, when it participated in the Irish Football Alliance). During this time, the club won the league championship outright on five occasions: 1948‚Äì49, 1949‚Äì50, 1973‚Äì74, 1976‚Äì77, 1977‚Äì78, and shared the championship in 1959‚Äì60 with Ballymoney United. The club also won the Irish Junior Cup in 1972‚Äì73 and 1973‚Äì74. In 1978, the club was elevated to intermediate status upon joining the newly established Northern Ireland Intermediate League. In 1991, Moyola Park gained admission to the Irish League B Division. A successful spell under manager Kenny Shiels saw the club win the Smirnoff Cup (1999‚Äì2000) and the Craig Memorial Cup (2000‚Äì01), and finished as runners-up in the (renamed) Second Division (2000‚Äì01) and Irish Intermediate Cup. The club‚Äôs greatest modern success followed in 2001‚Äì02 when, under new manager Eric Halliday, Moyola Park won the Second Division title (as well as retaining the Craig Memorial Cup.

The portion of I-290 from I-294 to its east end is officially called the Dwight D. Eisenhower Expressway. In short form, it is known as \\"the Ike\\" or the Eisenhower. Before being designated the Eisenhower Expressway, the highway was called the Congress Expressway because of the surface street that was located approximately in its path and onto which I-290 runs at its eastern terminus in the Chicago Loop. I-290 connects I-90 (Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) in Rolling Meadows with I-90/I-94 (John F. Kennedy Expressway / Dan Ryan Expressway) near the Loop. North of I-355, the freeway is sometimes known locally as Illinois Route 53 (IL 53), or simply Route 53, since IL 53 existed before I-290. However, it now merges with I-290 at Biesterfield Road. In total, I-290 is long.  Route description = Jane Addams Memorial Tollway to Veterans Memorial Tollway  This section is long and runs from Rolling Meadows to Addison. It is the portion of I-290 more locally known as \\"Route 53.\\" Here, I-290 runs largely above-grade through Schaumburg and Elk Grove Village, and at or below grade through Itasca and Addison. The northern of this highway were reconstructed in 2003‚Äì04. A left shoulder and an auxiliary lane between ramps were added, as well as improved lighting. The highway is four lanes wide (not counting the auxiliary lane) north of the Elgin‚ÄìO'Hare Expressway / Thorndale Avenue (mile marker 5), and five lanes wide with a wide left shoulder south to the exit to I-355. Between mile markers 0 and 4, IL 53 overlaps this section of the Eisenhower Expressway.  Eisenhower Extension  This section is long and runs from Addison to Hillside. It took its name when the Eisenhower was extended northwest from Hillside. The highway runs largely at-grade or above-grade for this length. U.S. Route 20 (US 20) overlaps I-290 around Elmhurst from mile markers 12 to 13, and runs parallel to the rest of this section between mile markers 7 and 18. This section of I-290 varies in width from two lanes at the ramp east from the I-290/I-355 split, to three lanes between I-355 and US 20, to three lanes plus two exit lanes at US 20/IL 64 (Lake Street / North Avenue) (exit 13B). After exit 13B, the highway reverts to three through traffic lanes. Exit 15 to southbound I-294 is a frequent point of congestion due to ramp traffic backing up onto the mainline highway, often as long as . This is because the ramp is not isolated from the mainline, only one lane in width, is a low-speed ramp (marked as a ramp), and is relatively short () while carrying a high volume of truck traffic south to Indiana from North Avenue. Additionally, the sudden appearance of the exit tends to cause accidents when cars in the center lane try to aggressively turn into the right lane, particularly at the mouth of the I-294 exit. Finally, there is a dangerous high-volume weaving situation at the end of the ramp to I-294 with southbound I-294 traffic exiting to westbound I-88. As of 2006, there are no plans to overcome any of these problems with new construction. The western of this section are blacktop, while east of IL 83 (exit 10) the original concrete is still in place.  Tri-State Tollway to Austin Boulevard  I-290 in Oak Park This section of I-290 is long, and it runs from Hillside to the western border of Chicago. This section is sometimes referred to as \\"The Avenues\\". As of 2002, it is the third-most-congested stretch of highway in the Chicago area, behind the Circle Interchange area and the intersection of the Dan Ryan Expressway and the Chicago Skyway. It is known for having a high volume of traffic on ramps through the Avenues, and high volumes of traffic on left-side ramps in Forest Park and Oak Park. I-290 runs above grade west of Mannheim Road, and at or below grade east of Mannheim Road. Eastbound at Mannheim Road (exit 17), the highway splits into two express and one local lane; they are joined by two onramps from I-88 and form express lanes three lanes wide and local lanes to Mannheim Road two lanes wide. After Mannheim Road, the highway immediately narrows to three lanes in width, causing mile-long (1.6 km) backups. It remains three lanes to Austin Boulevard. Westbound, I-290 merely is three lanes wide to Mannheim Road, and then four lanes wide to the I-88/I-290 split. Exits at Harlem Avenue (exit 21B) and Austin Boulevard (exit 23) are inverted single-point urban interchanges (inverted SPUIs), with left offramps and onramps. These cause backups as trucks switch lanes to exit, and a large volume of traffic enters on the left side of the highway. In 2001‚Äì02, this section between mile markers 15 and 18 was reconstructed in the first phase of an attempt to untangle the \\"Hillside Strangler\\", adding the local lanes and extra on-ramp to I-290. The second phase, reconstruction of the highway between mile markers 18 and 23 (Mannheim Road to Austin Boulevard), is still in the preliminary engineering phase of construction as of April 2009.  Austin Boulevard to Chicago Loop  I-290 at mile marker 28, looking east toward downtown Chicago The easternmost section of I-290 is long and runs entirely through the city of Chicago to the terminus at I-90/I-94. It runs below grade for its entire length. This highway is four lanes wide in both directions for its entire length, and most on-ramps and off-ramps are located just two blocks apart. Therefore, an exit in one direction may be marked one street (ex. Laramie Avenue), while the same exit in the other direction may be marked another (ex. Cicero Avenue), even though the streets are only a block apart. This configuration results in most exits on this portion of the road being marked as A/B exits. Eastbound congestion is lighter here than through the \\"Avenues\\", generally limited to congestion on the tight onramps to the Kennedy and Dan Ryan Expressways (the Circle Interchange) at the eastern terminus or blind onramps at Kostner Avenue and at Homan Avenue. Westbound, congestion is heavy starting at Laramie due to the left-hand exit at Austin (which combines a \\"perfect storm\\" of a four-down-to-three lane reduction, an unfamiliar left-hand exit, and entrance and in-merging traffic of the central onramp). Most afternoons, this bottleneck can skyrocket the \\"Post Office to Wolf (Road)\\" commute time to over an hour (up from 16 mins with no traffic). The Eisenhower Expressway runs along blacktop pavement for the length of the section, except between Kostner Avenue and Independence Boulevard, where it runs on concrete pavement. The eastern terminus of I-290 is the Circle Interchange with I-90/I-94. After this junction, the route becomes elevated and continues as a highway until LaSalle Street, at which point it passes under LaSalle Street Station and comes out the other side as a city street (Ida B. Wells Drive). The Congress Parkway (Ida B. Wells Drive) route continues east until the street is stopped by Buckingham Fountain. I-290 at Halsted Street The Blue Line operates in the median of the Eisenhower from Halsted Street to Cicero Avenue. After Cicero, the line leaves the median and runs on the south side of the Eisenhower for the remainder of its route to Des Plaines Avenue, Forest Park.  History  An expressway along the alignment of the Eisenhower Expressway was foreshadowed by Daniel Burnham's plan of 1909, which described a west side boulevard. The passageway under the old Post Office was designed to preserve the right-of-way for the future road. The expressway is named for the former President and creator of the Interstate Highway System, Dwight D. Eisenhower; it originally was called the Congress Expressway because it begins on Congress Parkway (now called Ida B. Wells Drive) in Chicago. The political columnist Mike Royko joked that it is Chicago's only Republican expressway, since the others all named after Democrats (though since that observation Bishop Louis Henry Ford, a non- political figure, had a freeway named in his honor). The first segment, in length opened from Mannheim Road to 1st Avenue in December 1955. On December 15, an additional was opened, from Ashland Avenue (1600 West) to Laramie Avenue (5200 West). During the 1960s and 1970s, the Eisenhower Expressway was extended to Lake Street and North Avenue. In 1963, the first working example of ramp metering took place on the Eisenhower Expressway, based on successful metering through New York City tunnels and data from ramp closures in Detroit, Michigan. The first implementation utilized a police officer at the top of an entrance ramp, stopping and releasing vehicles onto the highway at a predetermined rate. Another section opened in 1972, to a north‚Äìsouth expressway in Addison, Illinois. At the time, this expressway was a short spur from the Eisenhower Expressway, and it was referred to as Illinois Route 53, which continued north to Schaumburg. Construction on Illinois 53 had finished in 1970. Until 1978, the Eisenhower Expressway was marked as a part of I-90. In 1978, the I-90 designation was moved onto the John F. Kennedy Expressway and the Northwest Tollway, replacing IL 194\\\\. The Eisenhower Expressway was then renumbered as I-290. Because the segment from I-294 to IL 53 was built last, that portion of the highway is referred to as the Eisenhower Extension. The Eisenhower Expressway, extension included, is long. If the IL 53 portion of I-290 is added to that, the highway is long. In 2003‚Äì04, the first of I-290 out of Schaumburg were rebuilt, replacing pavement that had well-exceeded its estimated 20-year lifetime. (The original pavement was built in stages from 1963 through 1970 as part of IL 53.) A fifth auxiliary lane was added between the entrance and exit ramps of exits 1, 4, and 5. The most important safety upgrade was the demolition of the raised grassy median between the westbound and eastbound lanes, and its replacement with a permanent concrete median and wide shoulders. Inbound I-290 at the Hillside Strangler Diagram of the Hillside Strangler * Hillside Strangler: Named after the Chicago suburb of Hillside, it refers to a major merge with I-88, and almost always is used when referring to inbound (eastbound) traffic. It is at this point that I-88 terminates eastbound. It was called the Strangler because, before its reconstruction in the early 2000s, seven through lanes were forced to merge to three, creating large backups. Reconstruction widened part of this area to nine lanes (five inbound; three through; two local; and four through lanes outbound). This allowed direct exits to Mannheim Road (US 12/US 20/US 45) from I-88, the ramp also serving for an I-88 truck access to eastbound I-290; created an inbound collector‚Äìdistributor ramp for Mannheim Road; and added a timed gate that closed a ramp from Roosevelt Road (IL 38) to inbound I-290 during the afternoon rush hours. These improvements helped congestion at the site, but they also pushed pre-existing congestion further east to the six- lane portion of the highway. The Hillside Strangler is located at about mile marker 18. * The Avenues: The portion of the highway between Mannheim Road at mile marker 17 and First Avenue in Maywood, a stretch of . Named because all of the crossroads between these two exits are named numerically, in ascending order traveling outbound (westbound). 1st Avenue (IL 171) is exit 20. There are exits to 9th Avenue, 17th Avenue, and 25th Avenue to the west. These exits are spaced about three-quarters of a mile (1200 m) apart. This stretch is notorious for being very congested. * The Eisenhower Extension or 290 Extension: The of road between current-day mile marker 7 (I-355 south to US 20/Lake Street) and North Avenue (IL 64), mile marker 15. This section was built in the late 1970s. * The Circle Interchange: The eastern terminus of I-290 where it meets I-90/I-94, which overlap through Chicago. North of this interchange I-90/I- 94 is called the Kennedy Expressway, while south of it I-90/I-94 is called the Dan Ryan Expressway. The interchange itself consists of eight heavily used, very tight ramps that wind around each other, giving the interchange a distinct circle shape when looked at from above. This design, adequate when first built in the 1950s, forces drivers to slow down to speeds of about due to its tightly wound curves. Not only does this lead to the worst congestion in the Chicago area, a 2010 study of freight congestion (truck speed and travel time) by the Federal Highway Administration ranked this section of the I-290 as having the worst congestion in the United States; the average truck speed just . The interchange, rechristened the Jane Byrne interchange is currently being reworked with an estimated completion date of 2022  Post Office  Drivers coming out from under the Post Office Just east of the I-290‚ÄìI-90/94 Junction in downtown Chicago, the Old Chicago Main Post Office is a building that stretches over Ida B. Wells Drive. If one drives eastbound on I-290 and continues past I-90/I-94, the highway ends and becomes Ida B. Wells Drive. The Post Office was a landmark that was sometimes used in referring to the end of I-290 in downtown Chicago. For example, a traffic reporter might say \\"...forty minutes from Mannheim to the Post Office\\". This large building was used by the United States Postal Service until 1996. The building itself was built from 1921 to 1933 in the Art-Deco style, and it is in size. The building built several decades before the expressway that passes through it, was originally designed to accommodate a roadway‚Äîrequiring only minimal work to remove walls in the base for the freeway to pass through. In spite of its unused state, the building is still known to visitors and commuters alike as the unofficial gateway into the Chicago Loop area. In late August 2009, the United States Postal Service announced an auction was to be held to sell the facility to the highest bidder. The winning bid ($40 million) was from an English real estate developer, Bill Davies.

She is best known today for her artistic relationship with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, supporting him financially for thirteen years, so that he could devote himself full-time to composition, while stipulating that they were never to meet. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Symphony No. 4 in F minor to her. She also gave financial support to several other musicians, including Nikolai Rubinstein and Claude Debussy.  Life = Childhood  Nadezhda von Meck began life as Nadezhda Filaretovna Frolovskaya, in a family which owned great landed estates. Her father, Filaret Frolovsky, embraced his love of music from an early age, while from her mother, Anastasia Dimitryevna Potemkina, she learned energy, determination, and business acumen. In her youth a serious student of music, Nadezhda became a capable pianist with a good knowledge of the classical repertoire. She also mastered some foreign languages, learned to appreciate the visual arts, and read widely in literature, history, and philosophy, especially the work of Arthur Schopenhauer and the Russian idealist Vladimir Solovyov.  Marriage  At seventeen, Nadezhda was married to Karl Otto Georg von Meck, a 27-year-old engineer and the son of Major Otto Adam von Meck by his marriage to Wilhelmine Hafferberg ‚Äì Baltic Germans from Riga. Together they had thirteen children, of whom eleven survived to adulthood. As a government official, Karl von Meck's life was uneventful, and his work was poorly paid. With several children quickly added to his responsibilities, however, he was reluctant to make a break with a steady post. Nadezhda von Meck saw things very differently. To her, filling the roles of mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a government organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging him to make a break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction. Meck finally gave in to his wife's urgings and resigned from the civil service, at which point they had an income of only twenty kopecks a day on which to live. Nadezhda was right, though, to trust her husband's talent as an engineer. In 1860, there were only 100 miles of railroad track laid in Russia. Twenty years later, there were over 15,000 miles of lines. Much of this explosion was due to Karl von Meck, and his investments made him a multi- millionaire. The railway lines for which he was responsible included that from Kursk to Kiev and the highly profitable Moscow to Ryazan line, with its effective monopoly of grain transportation from the Black Earth Region of Central Russia. In 1876, Karl von Meck died suddenly, leaving a will which gave Nadezhda control of his vast financial holdings. This included two railway networks, large landed estates, and several million rubles in investments. With seven of their eleven children still at home, Nadezhda von Meck concentrated on her business affairs and on the education of the children still dependent on her. She sold one of Meck's railway companies and ran the other one with the help of her brother and her eldest son, Vladimir.  Withdrawal from society  Nikolai Rubinstein. After the death of her husband, Nadezhda von Meck took no part in social life, withdrawing into almost complete seclusion. She even refused to meet the relatives of those whom her children were going to marry, and she never attended any of their weddings. By all accounts, Nadezhda von Meck was imperious by nature, presiding over her household despotically. She expected to have her own way, so surrounded herself only with people who would give it to her, and she ruled her children's lives in every detail. As they grew into adulthood, she arranged their marriages, bought houses for them, and even chose furniture for their houses. When she wanted to see her married children, she summoned rather than invited them. Understandably, her children were not always grateful for the extreme degree of their mother's care (or meddling, depending on the viewpoint of the person concerned). Nadezhda von Meck was always compulsively busy. She took her elder servants on periodic inspection tours of her house, from cellar to roof, and cellar to roof never remained quite the same. String was saved for her to untangle and wind. Books were bought so that she might cut the pages. She purchased quantities of wool, which she then wound into balls and sent to her daughter, Countess Bennigsen. While engaging in this business, she would summon her daughter Julia to come and read to her. Julia did not mind. Of all the Meck children, she was the one most eager to please her mother, who demanded everything from her‚Äîand got it. Meck was probably well aware that she was hard to tolerate. She wrote to Tchaikovsky, \\"I am very unsympathetic in my personal relations because I do not possess any femininity whatever; second, I do not know how to be tender, and this characteristic has passed on to my entire family. All of us are afraid to be affected or sentimental, and therefore the general nature of our family relationships is comradely, or masculine, so to speak.\\"Tchaikovsky, P. I., Perepiska s N. F. fon Mekk (1876‚Äì1890) [Correspondence with N. F. von Meck], ed. Zhdanov, Vladimir and Zhegin, Nikolai (Moscow and Leningrad, 1934‚Äì1936), 3:197. As quoted in Poznansky, 197. Personal views Nadezhda von Meck was a professed atheist, which was not unusual in aristocratic Russia in the 1870s. Her fierce need for independence, on the other hand, was very unusual for a woman of the time. Her division between that and concern for her family resulted in contradictions between her beliefs and actions. Her views on affairs of the heart were strictly moral, but she did not believe in marriage as a social institution and regularly professed her hatred of it to Tchaikovsky. \\"You may think, my dear Pyotr Ilyich, that I am a great admirer of marriage,\\" she wrote on 31 March 1878, \\"but in order that you not be mistaken in anything referring to myself, I shall tell you that I am, on the contrary, an irreconcilable enemy of marriages, yet when I discuss another person's situation, I consider it necessary to do so from his point of view.\\"As quoted in Poznansky, p. 198. On another occasion, she stated more genially but no less forcefully, \\"The distribution of rights and obligations as determined by social laws I find speculative and immoral.\\" Even with her views on matrimony, Nadezhda von Meck was resigned to it as a means of social stability and procreation, and her own marital experience may have forced her to recognize its benefits. This realization may have also been why she strove to marry off her children as soon as possible‚Äîto ensure their stability in the event of her demise. Even in marriage, though, she considered sexual relations between men and women to be mutual exploitation. Russian radical thinkers of the period, such as Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Dmitry Pisarev, espoused views not far removed from Nadezhda von Meck's. Both men considered marriage to be a pillar of bourgeois society and called for its abolition. Meck especially respected Pisarev's work, as well as 19th-century positivism in general.  Support of the performing arts  With her great wealth and her passion for music, Nadezhda von Meck became a major mover in the Russian performing arts. The sole exception to her general reclusiveness was the series of Russian Musical Society concerts given in Moscow, which she attended incognito, sitting alone in the balcony. Through these concerts she made the acquaintance of Nikolai Rubinstein, with whom she maintained a complex relationship. While she respected Rubinstein's talents and energy, that did not stop her from disagreeing strongly with him at times. While her husband was still alive, Nadezhda von Meck began actively supporting and promoting young musicians, several of whom she continually employed, living in her household and playing her favorite works. She hired Claude Debussy as a music tutor for her daughters, and he wanted to marry one of them. She would not give her permission, preferring her daughters to marry men of her own choosing, which they did, but their marriages all ended in divorce. In February 1880, Meck came to the assistance of the Polish violinist Henryk Wieniawski, who had been taken ill in Odessa while on a concert tour. She moved him into her house and arranged medical treatment for him, but he died a few weeks later in Moscow.Classical ArchivesDavid Mason Greene, Greene‚Äôs Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers Relationship with Tchaikovsky Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky In 1877, one of the musicians she supported was violinist Iosif Kotek, with whom she played chamber music. Kotek was a former student and friend of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, recommended to Meck by Nikolai Rubinstein. She had already been impressed with Tchaikovsky's music such as his symphonic poem The Tempest, and she asked Rubinstein at length about him. She wrote to the composer. Introducing herself as a fervent admirer, she commissioned some pieces for violin and piano to be played at her house. Tchaikovsky quickly obliged. One of her first commissions was for a funeral march, which was never published and is now considered lost. They continued writing even as his marriage followed its brief though tortuous course. As their relationship developed, she subsequently provided him with an allowance of 6,000 rubles a year, large enough that he could leave his professorship at the Moscow Conservatory to focus on creative work full-time. This was a substantial income. A minor government official in those days had to support his family on 300‚Äì400 rubles a year. Tchaikovsky was grateful for von Meck's financial support. Nevertheless, it created some emotional discomfort and an underlying tension, but they both eventually handled this awkwardness with considerable delicacy. Still, Tchaikovsky could not help feeling vaguely uncomfortable about the favors with which Meck showered him. He wrote to her frankly about this: \\"... in my relations with you there is the ticklish circumstance that every time we write to one another, money appears on the scene.\\"Tchaikovsky, P.I., Perepiska s N.F. fon Mekk (1876‚Äì1890) [Correspondence with N. F. von Meck], ed. Zhdanov, Vladimir and Zhegin, Nikolai (Moscow and Leningrad, 1934‚Äì1936), 1:14. As quoted in Poznansky, 200. Epistolary friendship They carried on a significant correspondence, exchanging over 1,200 letters between 1877 and 1890. The details they shared were extraordinary for two people who never met. He was more open to her about much of his life and his creative processes than to any other person. Her feedback became so important to him that, after the critics lambasted his Fifth Symphony, she provided him with the support to persevere with his composing.While these letters have proved invaluable to Tchaikovsky researchers over the years, many of them suffered from cuts made by previous editors. A collection currently being published by Musik Produktion International is planned to include all surviving letters in full, including many new letters which have been discovered recently. Meck died believing these letters had all been destroyed. However, when Tchaikovsky received her request to do so, he assured her that he had destroyed them, but then filed that letter with all the rest for posterity to find. Nadezhda von Meck remained a devoted supporter of Tchaikovsky and all his works, but her bond with him depended on not meeting him. This was not simply because he would not live up to her expectations. She desired to think of Tchaikovsky as her ideal of a composer-cum-philosopher, much like the √úbermensch or Superman about whom Friedrich Nietzsche would write. Tchaikovsky understood this, writing to Meck, \\"You are quite right, Nadezhda Filaretovna, to suppose that I am of a disposition sympathetic to your own unusual spiritual feelings, which I understand completely.\\" Letter to Nadezhda von Meck, . As quoted in Holden, p. 139. The two did meet each other on one occasion, purely by chance, in August 1879, while Tchaikovsky was staying at the Meck estate at Simaki. He had gone for his daily walk in the forest somewhat earlier than usual, unaware that she was late for her daily drive through that same area with the rest of her family. As a result, they came face to face for a few moments; he tipped his hat politely, she was nonplussed, but no words were spoken. He wrote to her the same evening to apologise for the inadvertent breach of their arrangement. She responded, saying there was nothing to apologise for, and she even invited him to visit her home to see her new paintings, but at a time when she would be away.Poznansky, p. 344 The previous year, while staying at her villa in Florence, Tchaikovsky had seen her and her entourage pass by every morning;Poznansky, pp. 319‚Äì20 and they also glimpsed each other once at the opera, but only from a distance. Alexander Poznansky says of this last encounter: \\"It is not clear whether their both being at the theater was wholly accidental or arranged by Mrs. von Meck in order to see him, as seems not unlikely.\\"Poznansky, pp. 316-17 Dedication of Fourth Symphony Tchaikovsky, as a sign of appreciation, dedicated his Symphony No. 4 to her. This was important because, due to the nature of artistic patronage in Russian society, patron and artist were considered equals. Dedications of works to patrons were expressions of artistic partnership. By dedicating the Fourth Symphony to Nadezhda von Meck, he was affirming her as an equal partner in its creation.Maes, pp. 140‚Äì41. Symbolic‚Äîand strained‚Äîunion Anna von Meck, Tchaikovsky's niece, with her husband Nikolai In 1883, Nadezhda von Meck's son Nikolai married Tchaikovsky's niece Anna Davydova, after five years of matchmaking efforts by Meck and Tchaikovsky. Meck, who was in Cannes at the time, did not attend the wedding, thus staying true to her custom of avoiding all contact with the families of her children's spouses. However, Tchaikovsky did attend, meeting the rest of the Meck clan. At first both Meck and Tchaikovsky rejoiced in this event, seeing in it a symbolic consummation of their own relationship, but later events would make them question their intentions. Anna, extremely strong-willed herself, dominated her husband. She also opposed her mother-in-law regarding family matters‚Äîmost tellingly in a feud between her eldest son and business partner, Vladimir, and the rest of the family. Rather than bringing Nadezhda von Meck and Tchaikovsky closer together, Anna and Nikolai's union may have helped drive a wedge between them. Tchaikovsky virtually disowned his niece in an effort to avert a falling-out, while Meck hid from him her true feelings about what was taking place. The break In October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's allowance in advance, along with a letter ending her patronage. She claimed bankruptcy. Most surprising about the break was its extreme suddenness. Barely a week beforehand, she had sent him a typically intimate, loving and confessional letter. The letter dealt in large part with how her children were squandering their future inheritance. This was a persistent irritation for Meck and not necessarily a warning of her cutting off her patronage of Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, one logical explanation of giving him a year's allowance at once would be that she feared not having the funds to send later, in their usual arrangement of monthly installments. Others discount this idea. Most tellingly, Meck asked Tchaikovsky, in her final letter, not to forget her. Two facts contributed to Nadezhda von Meck's decision to make the break: #By 1890, she was gravely ill. She was in the latter stages of tuberculosis and would succumb two months after Tchaikovsky's death. An atrophy of her arm made writing nearly impossible.This problem was not news to Tchaikovsky. The growing atrophy, accompanied by sharp cramping in the hands, had continued to worsen since the summer of 1882. It had already slowed the pace of Meck's correspondence tremendously, as it made every line, then every few words, physically painful to write. She had made him aware of it in past letters. Dictating letters via a third party would have been awkward‚Äîespecially messages as frank, informal and personal as the ones she and Tchaikovsky had exchanged. #She was under intense family pressure to end the relationship. Her children were embarrassed by her closeness with Tchaikovsky. There was society gossip about the composer and \\"La Meck.\\" Increasingly, at least in the eyes of hostile relatives, the situation seemed scandalous. Worse, to them, he continued to take Meck's money freely even after he had received a generous pension from Tsar Alexander III.This state pension, granted in 1888, totaled 3,000 rubles a year. While only half the amount Tchaikovsky received annually from Meck, it was still ten times the annual salary of the average public servant. As the children's own financial situations worsened, they grew more resolved to end the arrangement between their mother and Tchaikovsky. By mid- to late 1890, over a two-month period, she had been visited by all but one of her elder children and may even have been given a final ultimatum. The final letter and payment from Meck to Tchaikovsky were delivered by a trusted servant of hers, Ivan Vasilyev, for whom he held warm feelings. She had never sent anything to him this way before and had always sent letters and checks by post. Von Meck also knew that Tchaikovsky was often in need of cash, despite the large sums she gave him. Tchaikovsky was a poor manager of money and would ask her for the next year's allowance several months in advance. Knowing of this habit, she might have anticipated his needing the money. Brotherly jealousy Modest Tchaikovsky One person who may have welcomed the break was Tchaikovsky's brother Modest. When the two brothers discussed Meck's action, Modest did not try to explain her behavior. Instead, he stated his opinion that what had been to Tchaikovsky the unique and mutual relationship of two friends had been for Meck merely the passing fancy of a wealthy woman. Possible reconciliation Galina von Meck ‚Äî daughter of Nadezhda von Meck's son Nikolay and Tchaikovsky's niece Anna ‚Äî maintained that the rift was secretly healed. In September 1893, only weeks before Tchaikovsky's death, Anna was about to leave for Nice, where Nadezhda von Meck was dying, and Anna was travelling there to nurse her. Tchaikovsky asked her to beg his former friend for forgiveness for his own silence. This apology was reportedly accepted wholeheartedly by Meck and reciprocated. The Tchaikovsky biographer Dr. David Brown maintains that Galina's account \\"contains much hearsay and a good deal that is romantically heightened.\\" Regardless of this, he concedes some plausibility in her account, especially since Galina received the story directly from her mother.Brown, David, Tchaikovsky: The Final Years (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1992), pp. 292‚Äì93  Financial problems  Nadezhda von Meck's claim of bankruptcy was not entirely untrue. Along with his fortune, Karl von Meck had left a sizable amount of debt upon his death, and this debt proved to be far more extensive than his wife had previously known. Rumors of this debt started circulating publicly in the early 1880s. Tchaikovsky had questioned her about it in his letters. The problem of the debts was compounded by the financial mismanagement of Nadezhda von Meck's business affairs by her son Vladimir. While he was as gifted in public relations as his father had been in engineering, Vladimir proved as extravagant as his mother in spending. He was the favorite among the Meck children, which may have been why his mother tolerated his ways as long as she did. Unfortunately, it was also largely what pitted her and Vladimir against his siblings and sister-in- law, Anna (Tchaikovsky's niece). They claimed, among other things, that he was pocketing company funds for his own use. Regardless of the truth of these charges, the Meck estate was in serious financial peril. In 1890, Vladimir von Meck suffered a nervous breakdown, and that summer his mother relieved him of his position. His replacement was his mother's personal assistant W≈Çadys≈Çaw Pachulski. Originally employed as a musician, Pachulski became a member of the family by marrying Julia von Meck. He was also far more experienced in financial management than Vladimir had been, and was able to save the Meck estates from bankruptcy.There is also some conjecture that, as Nadezhda von Meck's assistant, he had been in a position to enforce the family's wishes by intercepting any letters to or from Tchaikovsky. However, the full extent of his efforts in this regard cannot be determined with certainty until more archival evidence is unearthed. Meanwhile, Vladimir was found to have an advanced case of tuberculosis, the same disease from which his mother suffered, and he would die from it in 1892.  Death  Nadezhda von Meck died from tuberculosis on January 13, 1894 in Nice, in the south of France, barely two months after Tchaikovsky's demise. After her mother-in-law's death, Anna von Meck was asked how the late patroness had endured Tchaikovsky's death. She replied, \\"She did not endure it.\\" Vospominanya (1980).

Donation by Galina Nikolayevna von Meck  In 1985 Galina von Meck donated to Columbia University a collection including her translation of 681 letters written by Tchaikovsky to his family.

It is the fourth book published and sixth chronologically in the Redwall series. Plot summary US cover of Mariel of Redwall  Book 1: The Maid from the Sea  The story opens by introducing Gabool the Wild, the nefarious King of Searats, who stands at the top of a cliff and watches as a small mousemaid frantically tries to survive in the seas at the bottom of the cliff. The pirate king returns to his fortress, Fort Bladegirt, where one of his captains named Bludrigg demands plunder. Gabool feigns an air of compliance, but suddenly beheads Bludrigg. After this short incident, he interrogates Joseph the Bellmaker and attempts to force him to build a bell tower for the enormous bell he captured. Failing in this, he successfully persuades the Bellmaker to interpret the symbols on the bell in exchange for the latter's daughter. He then shoves the old mouse off of a cliff. In the meantime, the mousemaid is rendered unconscious when a piece of flotsam strikes her on the head. She washes up onto the shores, wakes up, and unties the rope around her neck. Suffering from severe thirst, the mousemaid searches for water, finds a small pool of it, and fends off another gull with her trusty rope. Cogitating on her forgotten identity, the amnesiac mouse names herself Storm Gullwhacker. When weary Storm awakens, she finds herself surrounded by trident-wielding toads, led by one disgruntled Oykamon. The mousemaid launches a trenchant attack, but is stabbed. She is rescued by Colonel Clary, Brigadier Thyme, and Hon Rosie, hares of the Long Patrol. They decide to bring her to Redwall. A reclusive, pedant squirrel, Pakatugg is concerned about security and secrecy to an extreme degree. At Terramort Isle, Saltar the corsair, brother of Bludrigg, arrives with the Darkqueen. Saltar duels Gabool, but is treacherously killed in a trap. Immediately afterward, the report comes in that Captain Greypatch has stolen the Darkqueen, Gabool's flagship. Gabool tells his captains that whoever kills Greypatch will be made second-in-command of all searats. = Redwall = Storm and Pakatugg are obdurate and intransigent creatures, and they soon part ways, none too peacefully. She attempts to find the way to Redwall by herself, and meets an eccentric hare named Tarquin L. Woodsorrel. The two reach Redwall without further incident, and Tarquin converses with the badger mother Mellus while Storm gets acquainted with Dandin and Saxtus, two mice. Despite the mousemaid's aversion of baths, Storm quickly grows accustomed to life at Redwall. That night, Dandin, Saxtus, and Storm enjoy themselves at the Abbot's Jubilee Feast until Saxtus recites a strange, prophetic poem. The mousemaid lets out a sudden cry and falls unconscious. The poem, coincidentally, told the story of Storm's life. The blind herbalist, Simeon, convinces Storm to tell them her newly remembered life-story. Storm reveals that her real name is Mariel, and recounts her peregrination aboard the Periwinkle with her father, Joseph the Bellmaker. The Periwinkle is bound on a course for Salamandastron to deliver a massive bell to the current badger lord, Rawnblade Widestripe. Unfortunately, they are overtaken and boarded by a pirate ship under Saltar, who kills the Periwinkle crew after a brief struggle. Joseph and Mariel are taken to Terramort, and she is forced to serve at Gabool's table. One day, Gabool picks a fight with a pirate named Skullgor, and Mariel unintentionally collides with the pirate king. Gabool finishes off Skullgor and comes after the hapless mousemaid. Mariel snatches up Skullgor's sword from the ground and manages to stun Gabool, but is knocked out herself by the villain's henchmen. Embarrassed by his unexpected loss to a mere mousemaid, Gabool ties a heavy rock to Mariel's leg and throws her into the sea. The rock is dashed to pieces on another rock during her fall, and Mariel concludes her intriguing narrative. = The Quest Begins = Northwest of Redwall, Greypatch lands in Mossflower Woods aboard the Darkqueen, and is hotly pursued by Garrtail aboard the Greenfang. Greypatch easily massacres the crew of the Greenfang and burns the ship. Pakatugg spots the ship and follows the searat scouts, but is captured. When he is interrogated, the squirrel cracks under the pressure and reveals the location of Redwall. Back at Redwall, Mariel attempts to immediately leave to slay Gabool. Dandin, Mother Mellus, Tarquin, and Simeon convince her to search for information on the whereabouts of Terramort before starting. All the inhabitants of Redwall search the gatehouse for a helpful clue, and a scroll by Fieldroan the Traveler is finally found. Mariel plans to leave the next day, alone. However, Martin the Warrior has other plans. During the night, his spirit visits Simeon and prompts the herbalist to give Dandin his deadly sword. Early the next morning, Mariel starts off on her quest and meets Tarquin L. Woodsorrel along the path. She adamantly insists that she must make the trip alone, but the hare accompanies her anyway. About lunchtime, they walk into Dandin, who has been waiting for them with a full picnic ready. As they continue down the road, they meet up with Durry Quill, a Redwall hedgehog. Though furious initially, Mariel finally resigns herself to the fact that the trio will come with her, no matter what she says. The travellers come to a river and are abruptly confronted by a murderous heron named Iraktaan. The travellers' combined efforts are sufficient to subdue the vicious bird, and Durry nearly loses his life crossing the pike-infested ford. After a nerve-wracking encounter with an adder and long hours of walking, the four find the \\"otter and his wife,\\" monolithic sculptures that were mentioned in the Terramort poem.  Book 2: The Strange Forest  The Flitchaye = After making their report to Lord Rawnblade, Clary, Thyme, and Rosie investigate the wreck of the Greenfang and trace its destruction to the Darkqueen, which has been left unguarded by Greypatch. Greypatch arrives at Redwall and parleys with the Abbot in a bid to have the Abbey's gates opened, but is injured by a lapideous turnip. An opprobrious troublemaker named Bigfang inveigles the crew to abandon Greypatch and return to the '‚ÄôDarkqueen'‚Äô. However, the Darkqueen has been commandeered by the three hares, who loose arrows at the approaching searats. After a long standoff, in which both sides manoeuvre to gain the upper hand, Kybo the searat convinces the crew to abandon the Darkqueen and return to Greypatch. Mariel and her companions follow the path and enter a dense forest. In this forest, they detect a strange, cloying smell that causes heavy drowsiness. The party fall asleep, and they wake up to find themselves trussed to a tree, surrounded by creatures shrouded in barkcloth and weeds, captured by a tribe called the Flitchaye, led by their leader Snidjer. Mariel breaks them free of their bonds and they beat furiously on the oak. Help soon arrives in the form of a massive barn owl, Stonehead McGurney. The aptly named owl uses his head as a battering ram to fling the hapless weasels over the treetops. After introducing them to his savage wife Thunderbeak and their four ravenous chicks, Stonehead offers to take them to the \\"swampdark\\" mentioned in the poem the next morning. Down south in Salamandastron, Lord Rawnblade is missing. The Waveblade, under Captain Orgeye, is grounded near Salamandastron and the badger lord comes out of his mountain to do battle. Full of the Bloodwrath, Rawnblade slays the entire corsair crew singlehandedly and sets the ship on a course for Terramort. = Swampdark and the Sea = Near Redwall, the crew returns to Greypatch, who has formulated a fail-proof plan to take Redwall. The assault begins and the Redwallers are ready. Greypatch sends Bigfang to burn the gates with a shield of oarslaves. The pirate Kybo goes to the east wall with grappling hooks to mount a surprise attack, while Greypatch's company fires a barrage of projectiles as a distraction. The feint attack appears to be working, and Kybo's crew scales the east wall unnoticed. Unfortunately for the searats, three naughty Dibbuns equipped with knives appear and decide to save the Abbey. In their element, the deadly Dibbuns gleefully slice through the searats' ropes. It is a long drop to the forest floor below... The Terramort questers are guided to swampdark, where Stonehead leaves them. The dim-lit swamp is treacherous, and Dandin almost loses his life in a bog. They reach the edge of the swamp, but are followed by silent lizards, who watch their every move. Mariel tries to challenge and intimidate them, but the lizards make no move. They leave the swamp and traverse some hills to reach the coastline. There, they meet a kindly old dormouse named Bobbo, who brings them home for tea. After introducing them to his pet newt Firl, Bobbo tells them his life story‚Äîhe was captured by Gabool the Wild and became a galley slave, but was left for dead on shore. As the rest turn in for the night, Mariel asks Bobbo for directions to Terramort. Bobbo tells her about a swallow ornament that \\"cannot fly south,\\" a primitive compass. The next day, Bobbo leads them to a deep pool. At the bottom, the desired swallow is trapped between two rocks, guarded by an enormous lobster. The five animals throw food into the water to satiate the crustacean's appetite, and Mariel and Dandin descend into the murky, forbidding depths to retrieve the swallow.  Book 3: The Sound of a Bell!  The Search for the Swallow = After suffering an ignominious defeat, Greypatch hatches a new plan to attack the Abbey: fire-swingers! Greypatch convinces his sceptical minions to create scores of miniature boulders wrapped in flammable substances. Tied to vines and swung like oversized bolas, they make formidable incendiary weapons. Since none of their weapons can match the range of a fire-swinger, the Redwallers are defenceless against the onslaught of missiles. However, Colonel Clary, Brigadier Thyme, and Hon Rosie make their way to the Abbey and construct special arrows out of yew staves. The well-trained hares stand on the Abbey ramparts and fire their far-reaching longbows, felling several of Greypatch's rats. Pandemonium breaks out among the searats, and they retreat out of range of the Abbey. As the beasts of the Abbey put up a valiant defence, Dandin and Mariel encounter unexpected difficulties in their pursuit of the swallow. Dandin, with sword in paw, protects Mariel as she tries to dislodge the swallow. Mariel finds that the metal swallow is wedged firmly between two rocks, and her vigorous motions attract the attention of the lobster. During the frenzied melee between Dandin and the lobster, the mouse drops the Sword of Martin and is immobilised, with the creature's claws at his back. Mariel catches up the sword and deals the lobster a terrible blow, allowing Dandin to be hauled up on the rope around his waist. Unfortunately, the lobster wheels around and locks onto the Sword of Martin. A tug-of-war ensues as Mariel is pulled up by her rope and the indomitable lobster clutches doggedly onto the opposite end of the sword. However, the fearsome creature capitulates after being pelted by several rocks from the surface. Mariel and Dandin gasp for air on the shore, without the swallow. With a twinkle in his eye, Bobbo hands them the swallow, explaining that Firl retrieved the swallow during the confusion. Bobbo then directs them to the burned out hulk of Greenfang, which remains seaworthy. After a tearful farewell, the four questers set sail for Terramort, directed by the magnetic swallow. In the aftermath of Greypatch's attack, the hares and Mother Mellus discuss strategy. Though Redwall is secure from any pirate assault, Mother Mellus voices her concern about the mistreated oarslaves held captive by Greypatch. With considerable aplomb, Clary readily agrees to do whatever he can to free them. In the twilight, the three hares embark on a covert mission to the pirate camp. As the vitriol mounts, Hon Rosie cannot contain her mirth and lets off a tremendous ‚ÄúWhoohahahahooh,‚Äù her signature, high-decibel laugh. All activity ceases and the hares are forced to flee. However, on the upshot, they rescue two shrews during the turmoil. Greypatch is infuriated at the incident and orders tripwires and other sundry traps to be set around the camp perimeter. Upon discovering these devices, Clary has Foremole dig a tunnel to the oarslaves. In the middle of the night, sleepy rats are surprised to see pairs of slaves vanishing straight into the ground! Needless to say,. The conflict escalates into a duel between Bigfang and Greypatch.. Greypatch forces Bigfang into a campfire and kills him with a swift spear throw. = Diverging Roads to Terramort = Meanwhile, the travellers to Terramort are having problems of their own. In the thick fog wreathing the ocean, Mariel and Tarquin are unable to see a large ship bearing down on them. One of Gabool's ships named the Seatalon rams the Greenfang, and all four travellers are thrown into the sea. Dandin and Durry are captured by the pirate ship, and Mariel and Tarquin tread water, using the hare's harolina as a float. The Seatalon‚Äôs captain, Catseyes, takes Dandin‚Äôs sword for himself and consigns Dandin and Durry to the galleys as oarslaves. The two are treated cruelly by slavemaster Blodge and his puny assistant Clatt, who force the slaves to row for Terramort. At night, however, a hooded mouse with silvery fur comes aboard and hands out files to the slaves. He approaches Captain Catseyes, claiming to be a courier from Gabool. The eccentric mouse slays Catseyes with a thrust from a dagger, and leads a revolt to take over the Seatalon. Only then does he reveal his identity: Joseph the Bellmaker! As for Mariel and Tarquin, they struggle to stay afloat and hold an animated conversation until they are lifted aboard the Waveblade by Lord Rawnblade. They array themselves in searat regalia and land at Terramort without being identified, despite a harrowing encounter with two pirate ships. = Last Stand of the Long Patrol = In the meantime, Colonel Clary, Brigadier Thyme, and the Honorable Rosie have run out of options. With Greypatch reaffirmed as leader, the oarslaves and Pakatugg find themselves in a resilient cage made of branches. The hares decide that they can only free the oarslaves at the cost of their lives. Heavily armed, they approach Greypatch‚Äôs camp and order Oak Tom, Treerose, and Rufe Brush to spirit away the oarslaves at their signal. Entering the camp, they loose shaft after shaft into the charging corsairs from their deadly longbows. Clary tosses Pakatugg a knife, and the lean squirrel bravely volunteers to die with the hares. When the hares finally exhaust their supply of arrows, they fight with their lances. The hares and Pakatugg brandish their lances and charge straight into the middle of the pirate crew with one last cry of ‚ÄúEulaliaaaa!‚Äù Weeping, the three squirrels make their way to Redwall with the last of the oarslaves. Upon hearing the news of the long patrol's last stand, Mother Mellus and Flagg set out in the direction of the searat camp. They stumble upon two searats preparing to deliver the coup de grace to Hon Rosie, but kill them before they have a chance. With the aid of Oak Tom and Rufe Brush, they carry Hon Rosie to Redwall and struggle to keep her alive. Left with eighteen corsairs out of his former hundred, Greypatch decides to pack up and return to the Darkqueen. At Terramort, Gabool and his captains see the large form of Lord Rawnblade from afar. Three searat crews are dispatched to slay the badger. Now ashore, Rawnblade, Mariel, and Tarquin spot Dandin and Durry. They meet up, with the hordes of searats just behind them, and run among some large rocks. Durry pushes aside a massive boulder, revealing the tunnel to Joseph's secret hideout. = The Final Battle = As Durry breaks the news to Mariel that her father is alive, the exuberant mousemaid, thrilled beyond measure, snatches the party's only torch and rushes down the tunnel. The newcomers meet the hundreds of Terramort Resistance Against Gabool fighters. Joseph relates his story and the two organised a large army of oarslaves dedicated to the destruction of Terramort. After an argument over who will kill Gabool, Joseph uncovers his plan for a three-pronged assault on Fort Bladegirt through several tunnels. Mariel and Joseph will attack the fort from opposite sides as Tarquin batters down the main gates with a ram. Lord Rawnblade plans to break through the walls with a massive boulder and charge in. At first, the plan works perfectly and the searats are completely caught off guard. As Mariel and Joseph's slingers are cut down by arrow fire, Tarquin provides a loud distraction by ramming the gates. As Gabool fearfully watches, Rawnblade enters the battle. Assailed by three searats at once, Joseph would have lost his life, were it not for the timely intervention of Mariel's Gullwhacker. = Into Gabool's Lair = When the path is clear, Dandin, Mariel, Joseph, Durry, and Tarquin rush into the fort after Rawnblade, who went in before them. Rawnblade, full of the bloodwrath, fearlessly bangs on Gabool's bell, challenging the pirate king. Gabool attempts to engage Rawnblade, but quickly retreats further into his lair after thrusting a sharp dagger into the badger's chest. Fortunately, Rawnblade has a resilient breastplate that absorbs the impact. Mariel and the rest arrive as Rawnblade splits the door into two halves and sets hard on the heels of Gabool. In the meantime, Gabool has set a trap. As his pursuers confront him, he taunts Rawnblade, who furiously charges toward him. When the badger steps on a carpet between him and Gabool, he plummets down into a dark pit. A scorpion, Skrabblag, resides in the pit, and quickly moves to attack. The spirit of Martin, however, takes control of Rawnblade and prompts the badger to fling the poisonous creature out of the pit and onto the face of Gabool. The scorpion strangles the searat with its twin claws, striking his cranium with its lethal stinger. Skrabblag detaches himself from Gabool's head as the former pirate king convulses and dies from the arachnid's venom. Dandin quickly kills the creature before it can do further harm, and the party leaves Terramort forever. Durry, Tarquin, Dandin, and Joseph each commandeer one of the abandoned pirate ships, and they set sail for Redwall with the Trag warriors and the bell aboard. When they reach their destination, all Redwall comes to greet them. An enormous feast is prepared, thereafter known as the Feast of the Bell Rising, so named for Rawnblade's generous gift to the Abbey. Dandin's friend Saxtus becomes Abbot, and Rufe Brush ties Martin's sword to the roof of the Abbey, where it is found by Samkim in the book Salamandastron. The famed Gullwhacker becomes the bellpull for the new Joseph Bell, and its owner goes with Dandin to seek out new adventures.  Translations  The Dutch translation by Annemarie Hormann does not include the final two chapters. Also, due to some alterations to the ending, the heroes never capture the Nightwake, the book ends with three ships sailing away as opposed to the four in the original version.

Customary use Today the fashion remains common in Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga and parts of Melanesia and Micronesia. It is worn by men and women in uses from school uniforms to business attire with a suit jacket and tie. Many people of Oceanic ethnicity wear the lavalava as an expression of cultural identity and for comfort within expatriate communities, especially in the United States (notably Hawaii, Alaska, California, Washington, and Utah), Australia, and New Zealand. Attire The lavalava is secured around the waist by an overhand knotting of the upper corners of the cloth; women often tuck the loose ends into the waistband, while men usually allow them to hang in front. Women generally wear ankle-length lavalava while men's wraps often extend to the knee or mid-calf depending on the activity or occasion. History Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the Pacific Ocean, the most prestigious lavalava were made by wrapping the body in a 'ie toga with fine mats (finely woven textiles of pandanus leaves) or siapo (tapa cloth) pounded from paper mulberry or wild hibiscus bark. The Samoans also created lavalava from traditional materials such as flower petals, leaves, feathers and seashells tied to a wrap-around backing of plaited plant fibers. Calico and loomed cotton cloth had largely replaced woven or barkcloth lavalava as articles of daily use (though ie toga and siapo wraps are still used today for ceremonial and festive occasions and dance performances). Samoan men who bear the pe'a body tattoo, as well as Samoan women who bear the malu leg tattoos often roll the waistband of the lavalava or tuck in the sides and rear portion(s) of the lavalava to expose their tattoo during dance performances or ceremonial functions (such as 'ava ceremonies), a style referred to as agini. Current forms Specially tailored linen lavalava which extend mid-calf, often with pockets and ties / buckles, are worn by men at special occasions or to church; these are always solid colors (in contrast to the bright patterns of everyday lava-lava) and are known as sulu (Fijian), ie faitaga (Samoan), or tupenu (Tongan). Similar ankle-length skirts form the lower half of the two-piece formal dress worn by Samoan and Tongan women (called puletasi and puletaha, respectively). On special occasions the Tongan tupenu and puletaha are usually associated with a tapa cloth or waist-mat called ta'ovala and some Samoans still wear a tapa cloth vala sash in similar fashion (though the vala is generally restricted to ceremonial / festive regalia of orators or people acting / dressing as taupou maidens and manaia beaus). The formal, tailored linen lavalava styles of Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji originated with the Fijian noble Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna who introduced the buckled sulu to Fiji in 1920 following his military service and university education in Europe. Samoan family. Loudly colored lavalava made from materials such as satin, velvet, polyester, and sequins have recently been popularized among performance dance groups and village, church, or school- based choirs. Related names and garments In English, such garments are generically called sarong, but that word is actually Malay, whereas lavalava is Samoan, being short for  ªie lavalava (cloth that wraps around). Another common name for the Polynesian variety is pƒÅreu (usually spelled pareo), which is the Tahitian name. In New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna, lavalava are called \\"manou\\". A similar simple kind of clothing is the lap-lap worn in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, which is completely open at both sides.

It demonstrates the isotopic evolution as the sample ages from t0 to t1 to t2. Isochron dating is a common technique of radiometric dating and is applied to date certain events, such as crystallization, metamorphism, shock events, and differentiation of precursor melts, in the history of rocks. Isochron dating can be further separated into mineral isochron dating and whole rock isochron dating; both techniques are applied frequently to date terrestrial and also extraterrestrial rocks (meteorites). The advantage of isochron dating as compared to simple radiometric dating techniques is that no assumptions are needed about the initial amount of the daughter nuclide in the radioactive decay sequence. Indeed, the initial amount of the daughter product can be determined using isochron dating. This technique can be applied if the daughter element has at least one stable isotope other than the daughter isotope into which the parent nuclide decays. Basis for method All forms of isochron dating assume that the source of the rock or rocks contained unknown amounts of both radiogenic and non-radiogenic isotopes of the daughter element, along with some amount of the parent nuclide. Thus, at the moment of crystallization, the ratio of the concentration of the radiogenic isotope of the daughter element to that of the non-radiogenic isotope is some value independent of the concentration of the parent. As time goes on, some amount of the parent decays into the radiogenic isotope of the daughter, increasing the ratio of the concentration of the radiogenic isotope to that of the daughter. The greater the initial concentration of the parent, the greater the concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope will be at some particular time. Thus, the ratio of the daughter to non-radiogenic isotope will become larger with time, while the ratio of parent to daughter will become smaller. For rocks that start out with a small concentration of the parent, the daughter/non-radiogenic ratio will not change quickly as compared to rocks starting with a large concentration of the parent.  Assumptions  An isochron diagram will only give a valid age if all samples are cogenetic, which means they have the same initial isotopic composition (that is, the rocks are from the same unit, the minerals are from the same rock, etc.), all samples have the same initial isotopic composition (at t0), and the system has remained closed. Isochron plots The mathematical expression from which the isochron is derived is {\\\\mathrm{D*}} = {\\\\mathrm{D}}_{\\\\mathrm{0}} + \\\\mathrm{n} \\\\cdot (e^{\\\\lambda t}-1), where : t is age of the sample, : D* is number of atoms of the radiogenic daughter isotope in the sample, : D0 is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the original or initial composition, : n is number of atoms of the parent isotope in the sample at the present, : Œª is the decay constant of the parent isotope, equal to the inverse of the radioactive half-life of the parent isotope times the natural logarithm of 2, and : (eŒªt-1) is the slope of the isochron which defines the age of the system. Because the isotopes are measured by mass spectrometry, ratios are used instead of absolute concentrations since mass spectrometers usually measure the former rather than the latter. (See the section on isotope ratio mass spectrometry.) As such, isochrons are typically defined by the following equation, which normalizes the concentration of parent and radiogenic daughter isotopes to the concentration of a non-radiogenic isotope of the daughter element that is assumed to be constant: \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D*}}{\\\\mathrm{D}_{ref}}\\\\right)_{\\\\mathrm{present}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D_0}}{\\\\mathrm{D}_{ref}}\\\\right)_{\\\\mathrm{initial}} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{P_t}}{\\\\mathrm{D}_{ref}}\\\\right) \\\\cdot (e^{\\\\lambda t}-1), where :D_{ref} is the concentration of the non-radiogenic isotope of the daughter element (assumed constant), : :D* is the present concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope, : :D_0 is the initial concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope, and :P_t is the present concentration of the parent isotope that has decayed over time t. To perform dating, a rock is crushed to a fine powder, and minerals are separated by various physical and magnetic means. Each mineral has different ratios between parent and daughter concentrations. For each mineral, the ratios are related by the following equation: :{\\\\mathrm{D}_0 + \\\\Delta{P}_t \\\\over D_{ref} } = {\\\\Delta{P}_t \\\\over P_i-\\\\Delta{P}_t } \\\\left ( { P_i-\\\\Delta{P}_t \\\\over D_{ref} }\\\\right ) + {D_0 \\\\over D_{ref}} (1) where :P_i is the initial concentration of the parent isotope, and : :\\\\Delta{P}_t is the total amount of the parent isotope which has decayed by time t. The proof of (1) amounts to simple algebraic manipulation. It is useful in this form because it exhibits the relationship between quantities that actually exist at present. To wit, P_i-\\\\Delta{P}_t, D_0+\\\\Delta{P}_t and D_{ref} respectively correspond to the concentrations of parent, daughter and non-radiogenic isotopes found in the rock at the time of measurement. The ratios \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D*}}{\\\\mathrm{D}_{ref}}or D_0+\\\\Delta{P}_t \\\\over D_{ref} (relative concentration of present daughter and non-radiogenic isotopes) and \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{P_t}}{\\\\mathrm{D}_{ref}} or { P_i-\\\\Delta{P}_t \\\\over D_{ref} } (relative concentration of present parent and non-radiogenic isotope) are measured by mass spectrometry and plotted against each other in a three-isotope plot known as an isochron plot. If all data points lie on a straight line, this line is called an isochron. The better the fit of the data points to a line, the more reliable the resulting age estimate. Since the ratio of the daughter and non-radiogenic isotopes is proportional to the ratio of the parent and non-radiogenic isotopes, the slope of the isochron gets steeper with time. The change in slope from initial conditions‚Äîassuming an initial isochron slope of zero (a horizontal isochron) at the point of intersection (intercept) of the isochron with the y-axis‚Äîto the current computed slope gives the age of the rock. The slope of the isochron, (e^{\\\\lambda t}-1) or \\\\Delta{P}_t \\\\over P-\\\\Delta{P}_t, represents the ratio of daughter to parent as used in standard radiometric dating and can be derived to calculate the age of the sample at time t. The y-intercept of the isochron line yields the initial radiogenic daughter ratio, \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{D_0}}{\\\\mathrm{D}_{ref}}. Whole rock isochron dating uses the same ideas but instead of different minerals obtained from one rock uses different types of rocks that are derived from a common reservoir; e.g. the same precursor melt. It is possible to date the differentiation of the precursor melt which then cooled and crystallized into the different types of rocks. One of the best known isotopic systems for isochron dating is the rubidium‚Äìstrontium system. Other systems that are used for isochron dating include samarium‚Äìneodymium, and uranium‚Äìlead. Some isotopic systems based on short-living extinct radionuclides such as 53Mn, 26Al, 129I, 60Fe and others are used for isochron dating of events in the early history of the Solar System. However, methods using extinct radionuclides give only relative ages and have to be calibrated with radiometric dating techniques based on long- living radionuclides like Pb-Pb dating to give absolute ages. Application Isochron dating is useful in the determination of the age of igneous rocks, which have their initial origin in the cooling of liquid magma. It is also useful to determine the time of metamorphism, shock events (such as the consequence of an asteroid impact) and other events depending of the behaviour of the particular isotopic systems under such events. It can be used to determine the age of grains in sedimentary rocks and understand their origin by a method known as a provenance study.

Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court decision that reformulated the standard for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The Court held that cross-examination is required to admit prior testimonial statements of witnesses who have since become unavailable.  Background Michael Crawford and his wife Sylvia Crawford confronted Kenneth Lee over an allegation that Lee had attempted to rape Mrs. Crawford. Michael Crawford stabbed Lee in the torso. Crawford claimed he had acted in self-defense when he believed Lee had picked up a weapon. Lee denied doing anything that might make Crawford believe he was trying to attack him. Both Mr. and Mrs. Crawford were questioned by police after receiving a Miranda warning. Mr. Crawford said to the police that he was not sure if Mr. Lee had a weapon, but that Crawford believed at the time that Lee did. Mrs. Crawford, being interrogated separately, at first said that she had not seen the attack, but under further questioning said that she had seen the attack and that Lee was not holding a weapon.  Trial proceeding  At trial, Mrs. Crawford could not be compelled to testify by the state, since under Washington's spousal privilege law, a spouse cannot testify in court without the accused spouse's consent (except when a spouse is a complainant). The deputy prosecutor, Robert Lund, sought to introduce Mrs. Crawford's statement to the police as evidence that Mr. Crawford had no reasonable belief that he was in danger from Mr. Lee. Generally, out-of-court statements by persons other than the accused are excluded as hearsay. Here the court allowed the statement to be admitted on the basis that the statement was reliable, as it was partially corroborated by Mr. Crawford's statement to police. Defense counsel objected to the admission of the wife's statement, on the ground that Mr. Crawford would be unable to confront (i.e., cross-examine) Mrs. Crawford on her statement without waiving spousal privilege, and that this would be a violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The statement was allowed into evidence at the trial, and the prosecution relied on it heavily in its closing argument.  Procedural history  Michael Crawford was convicted. The Washington Court of Appeals overturned the decision of the trial court. After applying a nine-factor test to determine whether Sylvia's statement was reliable, and therefore admissible under the doctrine of Ohio v. Roberts, the court determined it was not, and gave several reasons why. However, the Washington Supreme Court reinstated the conviction, ruling that the witness's statement was reliable under Roberts. In particular, the court noted that Michael and Sylvia Crawford's statements interlocked, and therefore concluded that Sylvia's statements were admissible. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Discussion  The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment (applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment) provides: \\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right‚Ä¶ to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\\" This right has a very specific purpose. The focus of the Clause is on getting the truth out of a witness, and allowing a trier of fact to determine whether the witness indeed told the truth. Even given these important goals, this right is not absolute. Admission of out of court statements, therefore, is and has been possible. For over 20 years prior to Crawford, the controlling standard for admitting statements that unavailable witnesses made to other persons was that of Ohio v. Roberts. According to the Court in Roberts, if a witness is unavailable, that witnesses' testimony can be admitted through a third person if it bears \\"adequate indicia of reliability.\\" This was true if a statement fell within a \\"firmly rooted hearsay exception\\" or had \\"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\\" When Michael Crawford was accused of stabbing Kenneth Lee on August 5, 1999, the Roberts standard was still controlling law. Crawford and his wife, Sylvia, were questioned separately by police regarding a stabbing incident that had taken place at Lee's home. The statements of the two were generally corroborating, but while Michael had claimed self-defense, Sylvia implied that Michael was not protecting himself when he stabbed Lee. At trial, the state moved to admit Sylvia's statement under Roberts. The trial court admitted the evidence, \\"noting several reasons why it was trustworthy.\\"  Supreme Court decision and rationale  The United States Supreme Court held that the use of the spouse's recorded statement made during police interrogation violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against the defendant where the spouse, because of the state law marital privilege, did not testify at the trial and so was unavailable. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, expressed concern over the inconsistent results reached by courts under Ohio v. Roberts, the standard used by the Washington state courts. He thought the Crawford decisions of the various levels of Washington state courts epitomized this problem. Justice Scalia gave a thorough history of the Confrontation Clause, explaining how the Clause became part of the Constitution using famous English cases, such as that of Sir Walter Raleigh. He then described the context in which the Constitutional Framers drafted the clause, and displayed how early American courts interpreted the clause. This history, Scalia concluded, clearly shows that the Confrontation Clause was directed at keeping \\"ex parte\\" examinations out of the evidentiary record. Specifically, the Confrontation Clause applies to \\"witnesses\\" against the accused, meaning those who \\"bear testimony.\\" Relying on this and the historical record, Scalia stated, \\"the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross- examination.\\" Scalia determined that a prior opportunity for cross-examination was mandatory, and dispositive of whether or not testimonial statements of an unavailable witness are admissible. Testimonial statements are formal declarations, i.e., those made to law enforcement or government personnel. \\"Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.\\" The Crawford Court determined that where non-testimonial statements are involved, the Confrontation Clause allows a court to use its discretion to determine the reliability of the statements. \\"Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination. . . . [T]he only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\\" Concurrence Chief Justice William Rehnquist concurred in the result, but would have decided the case on narrower grounds, within the older Roberts framework. Rehnquist, joined by O'Connor, stated he would not have expanded the right of defendants to exclude out-of-court statements on the basis that they could not confront the witness.  Subsequent developments  This decision had an immediate, profound effect upon the ability of prosecutors to prove their cases through the use of evidence that had previously been admissible via various exceptions to the hearsay rule. Justice Scalia's opinion explicitly states that any out-of-court statement that is \\"testimonial\\" in nature is not admissible, unless the declarant is unavailable to testify in court, and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him or her. However, the opinion does not define \\"testimonial,\\" which has allowed courts across the country to determine that issue for themselves. Legal scholars' main criticism of the decision was its failure to define \\"testimonial.\\" One of the main areas in which lower courts struggled to resolve this issue was the use of 911 calls during the course of trial where the caller is not available to testify. This was the factual situation in Davis v. Washington, in which the Court laid out a definition of \\"testimonial.\\" Other cases have dealt with the issue of the previously common practice of admitting certain types of certified documents under the business records or public records exception to the hearsay rule. Crawford, and the decisions following it, also radically changed the handling of domestic violence cases by curtailing evidence-based prosecution, a common practice allowing the accused to be prosecuted without the participation of their accusers in the criminal court process. Evidence-based prosecution relies heavily on admission of statements under hearsay exceptions to reproduce the evidentiary effect of a victim testifying in court. The Crawford Court's decision renders most of these statements inadmissible without the accuser coming to court and testifying against the person he or she is accusing.

A part of Indonesia, the island is the most important home for the Mentawai people. The western half of the island was set aside as the Siberut National Park in 1993. Much of the island is covered with rainforest, but is subject to commercial logging. Smaller islands adjacent to Siberut include Karamajet and Masokut which lie in the Bungalaut strait at the south of the island. The island is known for its range of primates, including the Kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), pig-tailed langur (Simias concolor), Siberut langur (Presbytis siberu) and Mentawai macaque (Macaca pagensis). Siberut was affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami, but without any known loss of human life. One report stated that the island may have been raised up to two metres by the earthquake. Geography Siberut Island has a hot and humid tropical rainforest climate, with an annual rainfall of . Temperatures range from , and humidity averages 81‚Äì85%. The east coast has many islets, bays and coral reefs, and is covered with mangrove forest extending up to wide before giving way to nipah forest. The west coast features mainly Barringtonia forests and is difficult to get to because of rough seas and steep cliffs. The hilly interior elevates to , with many streams eventually forming rivers in the sago-grove lowlands and swamp forests. There are also areas of dipterocarp primary forest. Biodiversity Siberut has been isolated from the mainland Sunda shelf since the Middle Pleistocene. This isolation has led to a much biodiversity, with about 900 species of vascular plants and 31 mammal species. Sixty-five percent of mammals and fifteen percent of other animals are endemic at some taxonomic level, making Siberut unique. Of the 134 bird species found on Siberut, 19 are endemic at some taxonomic level. There are four endemic primates: the bokkoi (Macaca pagensis), lutung Mentawai/joja (Presbytis potenziani siberu), bilou (Hylobates klossii) and simakobu (Simias concolor siberu).Siberut World Biosfer Environment Siberut was recognized as a biosphere reserve in 1981. In 1993, the western part of the island was designated as a national park, covering an area of . About 70% of the remaining forest outside the reserve is subject to logging concessions, some operative and others pending. In 2001, UNESCO brought in a new phase of its Siberut Programme, with the intention of protecting the ecosystem through local development. This phase involves creating a partnership of local communities, conservation groups and local government, an approach which appears to be popular locally. However, poor governance and corruption has led to substantial illegal logging.\\"Business as usual in the Mentawais\\", in Down to Earth, no.50, August 2001 Culture Some anthropologists believe that several thousand years ago, the Bataks of North Sumatra may have been the first to settle here.

It is the oldest debating society in the world and one of the oldest speaking gatherings of any kind. History and concept 1880s depiction of the Cogers' Discussion Hall in Shoe Lane. The image is based on an 1870 illustration, but the costume of the participants has been anachronistically aged to incorrectly make the scene appear earlier. The name \\"Cogers\\" comes from Descartes' famous assertion, Cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am). As a \\"Society of Thinkers\\", the Cogers is dedicated to the philosophy of letting everyone express their thoughts. The aims of the Cogers were the promotion of the liberty of the subject and the freedom of the Press, the maintenance of loyalty to the laws, the rights and claims of humanity and the practice of public and private virtue. The first meeting in 1755 was at the White Bear Inn (now St Brides Tavern), Fleet Street. Meetings were held on Saturday evenings. In around 1850 it moved to Discussion Hall, Shoe Lane, and in 1871 migrated to the Barley Mow Inn, Salisbury Square, E.C.1, where it remained until the 1960s. Attendances went into decline during the 1970s and 80s. By the mid-90s, the original society had split into two rival factions. In July 1997 Magnus Nielsen opened a third meeting in Cornhill on the 2nd Monday of each month. This meeting has now moved location to the Old Bank of England in the Strand. The two Saturday night societies have since closed. Previous members and visitors to the society include founding member John Wilkes, Charles Dickens, William Ewart Gladstone, Benjamin Disraeli, Daniel O'Connell,King Dan the Rise of Daniel O'Connell 1775-1829, Patrick Geoghegan, Gill and Macmillan, 2008. and many others throughout its 250-year history.

It covers roughly 4,408 square kilometers in area, or about the size of Madura; it is the 129th largest island in the world and Indonesia's 19th largest in area. History First minister of Buton In the precolonial era, the island, then usually known as Butung, was within the sphere of influence of Ternate. Especially in the sixteenth century, Buton served as an important secondary regional center within the Ternaten empire, controlling regional trade and collecting tribute to be sent to Ternate. Sultan Murhum, the first Islamic monarch on the island, is remembered in the name of the island's major harbor, Murhum Harbor, in Baubau. Geography Its largest town is Baubau, where the Wolio and Cia-Cia languages are spoken. Major nearby islands include Wawonii (to the north), Muna and Kabaena (to the west) and Siumpu (to the southwest). The Tukangbesi Islands lie just to the east where Tukang Besi is spoken, and is separated by the Gulf of Kolowana Watabo (Teluk Kolowana Watabo). Batuatas Island is to the south. Also the Bouton Passage(as it was known in the pre- Independence era) was an important inter-island navigational location of the northern Flores Sea.Goodall, George (Editor)(1943) Philips' International Atlas London, George Philip and Son map 'East Indies' pp.91-92 Ecology The island is largely covered by rainforest and is known for its wildlife. It is one of only two habitats of the anoa, a type of buffalo.  People  Portrait of a delegation from Buton The languages spoken on Buton include Wolio, Cia- Cia, various dialects of Muna, Tukang Besi, Kumbewaha, Lasalimu, Kamaru, Pancana, Busoa, Taloki, Kulisusu and Kioko. The Indonesian language, the national language of Indonesia, is also widely used and taught in schools. In 2009, the Cia-Cia tribe in Baubau city began to use the Korean Hangul alphabet for their language, based on textbooks created by the Hunminjeongeum Society, a linguistic society in Seoul. Economy The island has a massive reserve of natural asphalt and several other minerals. Asphalt from Buton can be utilized as bitumen modifiers as well as a substitute for petroleum asphalt. As a result, natural asphalt can be used to reduce dependency on conventional fossil based resources. Administration Buton Island is administratively divided into five second level administrative divisions (Daerah Tingkat II): Baubau City, Buton Regency, South Buton Regency (which includes several smaller islands to the west and south of Buton), North Buton Regency and (part of) Muna Regency. However, the eponymous archipelago is administered under an additional four regencies: the rest of Muna Regency, together with West Muna Regency, Wakatobi Regency, Central Buton Regency (which does not include any portion of Buton Island), and (part of) Bombana Regency.

The supply hot water temperature is modulated up and down range in an inverse linear ratio to outside air temperature. The typical range for conventional boilers is to vary the supply water temperature from as the outside temperature varies from . Implementation The control system can be made to modulate the supply water temperature in two different ways: #By acting as an operating control on the boiler burners, either modulated on/off, high/low fire, or fully modulating fire, depending on the burner construction. When modulating the actual boiler temperature lower, water temperature needs to have a low limit and be maintained above the flue gas condensation temperature for non-condensing type boilers, typically above . Condensing type boilers can be made to operate at temperatures below the flue gas condensation limit and raise stated efficiencies from the range. #By acting as an operating control on a three-way powered mixing valve or proportional injection pump system that modulates the supply distribution hot water temperature. The mixing valve or mixing pump system recirculates the return water temperature and adds proportionally supply hot water from the boiler for tempering to achieve the desired supply water temperature. Another method is to adjust boiler temperature from thermostat activity. This indoor reset control. It is more responsive to real needs inside the building.

Most of his works were issued under his working name of Edwin Lester Arnold. Life and literary career Arnold was born in Swanscombe, Kent, as son of Sir Edwin Arnold. Most of his childhood was spent in India, but he returned to England to study agriculture and ornithology. He became a journalist in 1883, and published his first books A Holiday In Scandinavia (1877) and Bird Life In England (1887) before writing his first novel The Wonderful Adventures of Phra the Phoenician, the adventures of a warrior who goes in and out of an unexplained state of suspended animation in order to be a witness to invasions or attempted invasions of England. Phra was first published in 24 parts in the prestigious Illustrated London News, and later published in book form in the United States and the United Kingdom. Arnold later wrote other novels, including Rutherford the Twice-Born (1892) and Lepidus the Centurion: A Roman of Today (1901), both of which flopped commercially. In 1905 Arnold published his best known novel, Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation, also known as Gulliver of Mars, (1905). Its initial reception was lukewarm, leading Arnold to stop writing fiction altogether. Legacy Arnold's Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation is considered important to 20th century science fiction literature, in that it may have inspired the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom series, which was written six years later. Indeed, both Gullivar and Burroughs's character John Carter, first seen in A Princess of Mars (1917), are military men from the Southern United States who arrive on Mars and have numerous adventures, including falling in love with a Martian princess. The character of Carter, however, has more in common with Arnold's earlier creation, Phra. Critics would say that Arnold's Martian adventure was not as well written, and the fact that Gullivar doesn't quite defeat his enemies or get the girl in the end helps explain why his novel not as popular as Burroughs', which was followed by ten sequels. Ace Books reprinted Arnold's Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation in 1964, retitling it Gulliver of Mars . A more recent Bison Books edition was issued as Gullivar of Mars, adapting the Ace title to Arnold's spelling. Marvel Comics did a brief comic version of Gullivar of Mars during the early 1970s, possibly as a reaction to DC gaining the rights to publish Burroughs' John Carter during this time. With art by Gil Kane, it ran in several issues of Creatures on the Loose. Marvel's Gullivar was a Viet Nam vet, and the series started in modern times. Though the series used many of Arnold's characters and concepts, the series was not a strict adaptation of the original book. Both Gullivar and John Carter make an appearance at the beginning of volume two in Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book series.

Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), was the first case where the United States Supreme Court ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.. Background The immigration of Chinese to California began in 1850 at the beginning of the Gold Rush. They soon began to branch out to jobs in agriculture and made up a large group of railroad workers. As the Chinese became more successful, tensions with Americans grew. Californians were wary of the cultural and ethnic differences.Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. US Department of State, 2010. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many pieces of legislation put into place to keep people from China from entering the United States.Chinese Exclusion Act (1882). Harvard University Library. The government of California worked to prevent Chinese immigrants from working by requiring certain permits that they could not obtain, and passed legislation to prevent naturalization. Many turned to the laundry business and in San Francisco about 89% of the laundry workers were of Chinese descent. It was often the only job they could find. In 1880, the elected officials of the city of San Francisco passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors. The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city's 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two- thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese people. Although most of the city's wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, only one permit was granted of the two hundred applications from any Chinese owner, while virtually all non-Chinese applicants were granted a permit.only one out of approximately eighty non-Chinese applicants was denied a permit Yick Wo (ÁõäÂíå, Pinyin: Y√¨ H√©, Cantonese Yale: Yik1 Wo6, Americanization: Lee Yick), was a laundry facility owned by Lee Yick. Lee Yick immigrated to California in 1861. After twenty-two years of managing the facility, provisions set out by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors said that he could not continue to run it in a wooden building. He continued to operate his laundry and was convicted and fined ten dollars for violating the ordinance. He sued for a writ of habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine. San Francisco ordinance Order No. 156, passed May 26, 1880 : SEC. 1. It shall be unlawful, from and after the passage of this order, for any person or persons to establish, maintain, or carry on a laundry within the corporate limits of the city and county of San Francisco without having first obtained the consent of the board of supervisors, except the same be located in a building constructed either of brick or stone. : SEC. 2. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, build, or maintain, or cause to be erected, built, or maintained, over or upon the roof of any building now erected or which may hereafter be erected within the limits of said city and county, any scaffolding without first obtaining the written permission of the board of supervisors, which permit shall state fully for what purpose said scaffolding is to be erected and used, and such scaffolding shall not be used for any other purpose than that designated in such permit. : SEC. 3. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this order shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail, not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Issue before the Court The state argued that the ordinance was strictly one out of concern for safety, as laundries of the day often needed very hot stoves to boil water for laundry, and indeed laundry fires were not unknown and often resulted in the destruction of adjoining buildings as well. The petitioner pointed out that prior to the new ordinance, the inspection and approval of laundries in wooden buildings had been left up to fire wardens. Yick Wo's laundry had never failed an inspection for fire safety. Moreover, the application of the prior law focused only on laundries in crowded areas of the city, while the new law was being enforced on isolated wooden buildings as well. The law also ignored other wooden buildings where fires were common‚Äîeven cooking stoves posed the same risk as those used for laundries. Opinion of the Court The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as an attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed. Legacy Yick Wo had little application shortly after the decision. In fact, it was not long after that the Court developed the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson,. in practice allowing discriminatory treatment of African Americans. Yick Wo was never applied at the time to Jim Crow laws which, although also racially neutral, were in practice discriminatory against blacks. However, by the 1950s, the Warren Court used the principle established in Yick Wo to strike down several attempts by states and municipalities in the Deep South to limit the political rights of blacks. Yick Wo has been cited in well over 150 Supreme Court cases since it was decided. Yick Wo is cited in Hirabayashi v. United States. to recognize that: \\"Distinctions between citizens solely based because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. For that reason, legislative classification or discrimination based on race alone has often been held to be a denial of equal protection.\\" However, the US Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Gordon Hirabayashi, the Japanese American who tested the curfew law and refused to register for the forced internment of people of Japanese descent during World War II. In San Francisco there is a public school named Yick Wo Alternative Elementary School in honor of Yick Wo.
