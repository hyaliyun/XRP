The film won the Nastro d'Argento for best screenplay. For his performance Marco Messeri won the Ciak d'oro for best supporting actor.  Plot  The story takes place in the fascist era. Camillo, a barber of Acquasalubre, suffers from a psychosomatic illness: he has in fact lost the use of his legs without having any organic lesion and his doctor indicates the cause in the finished love between him and Vittoria, a girl of French origin long time resident in Italy. In the train returning from Lourdes, Camillo knows Orlando, who is really paralytic. The two chat, and Camillo tells him about his doctor, who also acts as a psychoanalyst who is a follower and admirer of a certain Sigmund Freud, who however does not read his letters, because they are trashed by a maid who, mindful of the defeat of Austria in the still recent first world war, he hated Italians. A few days later, Camillo discovers that Vittoria has engaged with another, a Frenchman named Bernard, but she has not interrupted her relationship with Camillo, since they are still meeting. After their meeting, Bernard discovers it and argues with Vittoria, since he can't stand having her meet again after leaving. To the joy of their possible rapprochement, Camillo heals and returns to walk, but decides to keep quiet about his recovery so as not to displease Orlando and ruin his friendship, revealing him only to Vittoria and his brother Leone, also a barber and he too is in pain, which, as he will finally admit, exists only to care for his sick brother. To try to get Orlando out of his profound state of solitude, Camillo organizes with Vittoria a meeting in which he pretends to meet the girl casually, accompanied by his friend Anita who, according to Camillo, would approach Orlando's tastes, in order to favor a possible relationship. However, Anita declares herself a fervent admirer of the Duce and leaves the tearoom in disgust after a joke from Camillo about Mussolini. Orlando, moreover, instead of d'Anita, falls in love with Vittoria and reveals it to his friend. A few days later, seeing him by chance coming out of the tub alone, Orlando discovers Camillo's recovery. The next day, Camillo goes to Rome to patent two lotions of his invention, one against baldness and one against pain, but the fascist hierarch who presides over the patent office Cosimo Cinieri haranks him, almost with contempt, saying that according to the Duce (who was bald!) the way of salvation is \\"marked by pain and suffering\\". So Camillo returns disappointed and bitter to the country. On his return he will be arrested because of the joke addressed to Anita, who has been a spy and sent a punitive expedition. He will remain in prison for two years, where he will fall ill again. It will come out thanks to Orlando, meanwhile become an important party official. Orlando assures him that there has never been anything beyond friendship between him and Vittoria, and that he is also preparing to go on a trip to Ethiopia. On his return home, he will find a letter from Vittoria containing a photograph in which the girl is wearing a straw hat, which Camillo recognizes as he previously donated to Orlando and is convinced, also by a malicious insinuation by Leone, that Orlando and Vittoria live together in Paris. Once in the transalpine capital, after having found it, he discovers that his were just jealousies (Orlando in turn gave the straw hat to Vittoria before the final leave) and the two can finally return together.

This name was promoted in its time by press favorable to Cuza.  Background  Although at the first analysis a coalition between the political centrists (radicals) and the political right (conservatives) seems unnatural in the context of 19th century politics of Romania, it was logical within the political context of the time: the personal authoritarian regime introduced by Cuza. Authoritarian tendencies began to be manifested by the ruler early in 1863, and the personal regime was installed after the coup of 2 May 1864. He increased his own power at the expense of other institutions. On 10 May, Cuza amended, through plebiscite, the Paris Convention which had hitherto functioned as Constitution for the United Principalities, transforming it into Developing Statues of the Paris Convention. The most important change was the redistribution of state organization so that the ruler should have more powers. From this point, the political scene was divided into two camps: Cuzists and opposition. Moreover, the ruler understood to govern over political groups with trustworthy people, of moderate shades, as Mihail Kogălniceanu or Nicolae Crețulescu.Smeu, Georgeta, Dicționar de Istoria Românilor, Bucharest, Trei Publishing House, 1997 The leaders of this coalition were the radical C. A. Rosetti, conservative Lascăr Catargiu and the moderate Ion Ghica.  Consequences  The \\"monstrous coalition\\" was supported by large landowners and businessmen who were not satisfied with the policy of the ruler. Coalition emerged after the National Assembly elections in Romania, second convocation, in 1864, and was chaired by Ion C. Brătianu. Mihail Kogălniceanu remained loyal to Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In 1866, the coalition gave a coup d'etat. On the morning of 11 February, five o'clock, a group of soldiers entered the Royal Palace and forced the ruler to accept the abdication. Cuza was forced to swear that he will abdicate, after seven years of reign, to leave the throne to a foreign prince, as is required in one of the provisions of ad-hoc divans of 1857.Lieutenant Colonel Popescu Lumină, Universul, 17 August 1932 The unionist press related that the argument of this heinous act was the charge that the elected ruler would have betrayed the interests of the country to a foreign power. Two days later, on 13 February, Cuza leaves Bucharest, taking the road of Vienna, and, after him, on 10 May 1866, Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is proclaimed ruler of Romania, under the name of Carol I. Subsequently, Carol was asked to allow Cuza return home. The monarch sent the request to the Council of Ministers that rejected it.

Located in the Portland metropolitan area, it is owned by Providence Health & Services. Opened in 1968, it was originally Dwyer Memorial Hospital, a private hospital, before becoming a community hospital a few years after opening. History There were competing plans for a hospital in Milwaukie in the mid-1960s, with one being Milwaukie General Hospital to be built at Stanley and Railroad avenues, while Dwyer Memorial Hospital was planned for 32nd and Harrison streets. Plans for the Dwyer Memorial Hospital won out, with construction starting in May 1967 on what was to be an $800,000, 60-bed facility. The new 62-bed hospital opened in July 1968. The $1.5-million private hospital was named in honor of A J. Dwyer, an lumberman in Clackamas County. Dwyer was then transferred in July 1971 to North Clackamas Community Hospital, Inc., a non-profit organization established to run the formerly for- profit institution as a community hospital. In 1980, a new emergency department opened with 10 examination rooms. The hospital changed its name to Dwyer Community Hospital in January 1982. The North Clackamas Community Hospital, which operated as Dwyer Community Hospital, started talks in January 1986 with then Providence Health Care System about merging into Providence, which was consummated later that year. The market share of the hospital was 1.5% for the Portland area in 1988. The hospital added a new surgical wing and entrance in 1997, part of a $15 million expansion project. Prior to the expansion, the hospital was only licensed for 56 beds. Providence Milwaukie started construction on a three-story, building to house the Healing Place in February 2001. Labor strife with nurses over 19-months, including a one-day strike, ended in November 2003 with a new contract for the nurses. In May 2002, construction started on a new emergency department that was expected to cost $9 million and add to the existing ER. Providence Milwaukie was named one of the top 100 hospitals in 2004 by Solucient. Details The hospital is licensed for 77 beds, but as of 2013 only had 66 beds available. Services at Providence Milwaukie include radiology, surgery, emergency, cancer treatment, pediatrics, nuclear medicine, and sleep disorders, among others. For 2012, the hospital had a total of 3,129 acute care discharges, with 9,266 patient days, and 30,399 emergency department visits. For the fiscal year ending in 2011, the hospital had total revenues of $95 million and a profit of $10.6 million. That year Providence Milwaukie also provided $11.3 million in charity care.

He is known for his research on cancer etiology, to which he contributed by helping to define the role of tobacco, diet, viral infections, and other lifestyle factors in cancer development.  Biography  Renato Talamini was born in Vittorio Veneto, Italy, into a locally well-known family of bakers. He studied biology at the University of Padua, where he graduated in 1976. In 1977, he joined the Oncology Division of the General Hospital in Pordenone (Italy), where he started working on breast cancer clinical trials. In those years, he was introduced to cancer etiology, starting his first investigation of breast and prostate cancer risk factors. From 1983 to 1984, he attended the Mario Negri Institute in Milan as a visiting scientist. Here he met Drs Silvia Franceschi and Carlo La Vecchia with whom he laid the foundations of a long- lasting scientific collaboration and friendship. In 1984, he moved to the National Cancer Institute Centro di Riferimento Oncologico in Aviano (Italy) – officially established the same year – to set up the Unit of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. In 1988, he earned his post graduate Degree in Epidemiology and Medical statistics at the University of Pavia, (Italy). Between 1998 and 2011 he directed the subunit of Clinical Epidemiology of the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico. Since the beginning of his scientific activity, Renato Talamini has been involved in the conduction of epidemiological studies to elucidate cancer etiology, with a focus on lifestyle factors. Besides being well known for his studies on the role tobacco smoking and alcohol abuse in cancer risk, Renato Talamini also devoted a relevant part of his scientific activity to dietary habits and to the study of the role of Hepatitis B and C viruses in the etiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and liver cancer. He is appreciated for his pragmatic approach to scientific investigation. During his working years he has collaborated to several international studies, including ARCAGE studies coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. His academic activities include collaborations as appointed Lecturer and Teacher with several Italian Universities among which the Universities of Catania, Udine, and Padua. Renato Talamini is also an appreciated divulger of science; he has been active in educational programs for the youth (in schools) and for the general population. See also *Tommaso A.

The town is situated to the southeast of the centre of Kandy. The population is about 150,000. History King Vira Parakrama Narendra Sinha, the last Sinhalese King of Kandy decided in 1710 to move his palace from Kandy to Kundasale. He instructed the local governor, Ramukwelle Dissawe, to construct the palace complex. Rambukwelle Dissawe engaged the services of a builder, Devendra, who built the palace completely out of wood on top of a hill in a garden, Narikele. The palace is purported to have been more a summer palace rather than a royal palace. He was the first and the last king to have Kundasale as the capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. The king died in May 1739 and in 1804 British troops under the command of Captain Arthur Johnson attacked the palace, plundered its valuables and burnt it to the ground. The building's remnants were used in the construction of the nearby Sri Narendrasinhe Rajamaha Viharaya. The two stone elephant carvings at the main entrance, Mahawahalkada, of Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) are said to have come from the ruins of the Kundasale Palace.

G., & Shah, P. (2002). Toward a model of knowledge-based graph comprehension. In M. Hegarty, B. Meyer, & N. H. Narayanan (Eds.), Diagrammatic representation and inference (pp. 59–141). Berlin, Germany: SpringerShah, P., & Freedman, E. G. (2011). Bar and line graph comprehension: An interaction of top-down and bottom-up processes. Topics in Cognitive Science, 3, 560–578 Although related, graph literacy is distinct from other forms of literacy (e.g., general health literacy or numeracy) in the sense that it relates more specifically to one's ability to obtain meaning from information presented graphically. It can include the storage of mental representations in long-term memory, knowledge about the properties of different types of formats, and procedures to interpret them. However, similar to other types of literacy, higher graph literacy is associated with higher education levels and suggests that developing the skills required to interpret graphical information requires knowledge that is acquired through formal education and experience.Galesic, M., & Garcia-Retamero, R. (2011). Graph literacy: A cross-cultural comparison. Medical Decision Making, 31, 444–457 Graph literacy is very important in everyday life: graphs appear throughout the published media, in newspapers and magazines, on TV and on the internet, and are used to provide information for many important decisions including medical, nutritional, financial and political choices. Yet many people can have difficulty understanding even the simplest graphs. Up to one third of the general population lacks the skills needed to understand basic numerical formats (e.g., percentages or ratios) and basic graphic displays (such as bar or pie charts, line graphs, or icon arrays). While graphical displays can improve understanding and comprehension of quantitative information, such as the risks and benefits of medical treatments, they may not be helpful for everyone.Ancker, J. S., Senathirajah, Y., Kukafka, R., & Starren, J. B. (2006). Design features of graphs in health risk communication: A systematic review. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 13, 608–618Garcia-Retamero, R., & Cokely, E. T. (2013). Communicating health risks with visual aids. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 22, 392–399 Visual displays may be of greater help to people with low numeracy whereas numbers may be better for people who have poor graph literacy.Gaissmaier W, Wegwarth O, Skopec D, Müller A-S, Broschinski S, Politi M: Numbers can be worth a thousand pictures: Individual differences in understanding graphical and numerical representations of health-related information. . Health Psychology 2012, 31(3):286–296 Determining what type of information displays lead to better comprehension of information, and for whom, is an ongoing topic of research, particularly within the area of risk communication.Lipkus, I. M. (2007). Numeric, verbal, and visual formats of conveying health risks: Suggested best practices and future recommendations. Medical Decision Making, 27, 696–713Spiegelhalter, D., Pearson, M., & Short, I. (2011). Visualizing uncertainty about the future. Science, 333, 1393−1400  Graph comprehension  Graphical displays can contain a vast amount of information such as information contained within the title, labels and axes, but also within features of the display (e.g., size, spacing, patterns in the data) that can vary in their complexity (e.g., multiple variables).Meyer, J., Shinar, D., & Leiser, D. (1997). Multiple Factors that Determine Performance with Tables and Graphs. Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 39(2), 268–286 Both perceptual and cognitive processes are required to interpret the information contained within a graphic display. Different processes are required to extract information depending on the task or goal, such as extracting a specific value or making inferences based on the data (e.g., predicting future trends). Graph comprehension depends not only on people's knowledge, familiarity or experience with reading graphic displays but also on the way in which the graphic is designed. For example, some features of graphs make use of spatial-to-conceptual mappings that are grounded in our everyday experience, such as the tendency for higher bars to relate to greater or larger quantities.Okan, Y., Garcia-Retamero, R., Galesic, M., & Cokely, E. T. (2012). When higher bars are not larger quantities: On individual differences in the use of spatial information in graph comprehension. Spatial Cognition & Computation, 12, 1–25 However, other aspects need to be learned, such as arbitrary graph conventions (e.g., axis labels and scales). Graph literacy can affect how people attend to and encode some of these features.  Graph literacy scale  The Graph Literacy Scale consists of 13 items and measures three abilities related to graph comprehension (see Friel, S. N., Curcio, F. R., & Bright, G. W. (2001). Making sense of graphs: Critical factors influencing comprehension and instructional implications. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 32, 124–158) (1) the ability to read the data, that is, to find specific information in the graph; (2) the ability to read between the data, that is, to find relationships in the data as shown on the graph; and (3) the ability to read beyond the data, or make inferences and predictions from the data. The scale was validated in a survey conducted on probabilistic national samples in Germany and the USA. Previous measures of graph comprehension have tended to focus on the comprehension of specific features or types of graphs (e.g., line or bar graphs), incorporate relatively complex items, or have been developed in the context of examining the effects of teaching methods on the acquisition of graph skills (e.g.,Kramarski, B., & Mevarech, Z. R. (2003). Enhancing mathematical reasoning in the classroom: The effects of cooperative learning and metacognitive training. American Educational Research Journal, 40, 281–310). Some numeracy scales include a few items related to the comprehension of graphical information but these are limited in their ability to measure a range of graphs, features, or tasks.Schapira, M. M., Walker, C. M., Cappaert, K. J., et al., (2012). The Numeracy Understanding in Medicine Instrument: A Measure of health numeracy developed using Item Response Theory.

The installation consists of two garden chairs around a round table, usually with a tree going through its middle. The rim of the table has the Havel Quote 'truth and love shall prevail over lies and hatred' inscribed along its rim. Origins The original idea for Havel's Place came from Petr Gandalovič, the Czech Ambassador to the United States. He invited Bořek Šípek, an architect and designer, to create a piece of public art to represent Havel and his democratic views. Šípek had overseen a decade-long renovation of the interior of Prague Castle as President Havel's Head Architect in the 1990s, and made a number of artworks for his close friend. In the 2008 documentary about Havel, Citizen Havel, by Pavel Koutecký and Miroslav Janek, the President stated that he would like people to subconsciously connect his person with Bořek Šípek's design and art.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qubx6bsixOI Šípek came up with a design symbolising \\"Democratic Debate\\", comprising two metal garden chairs placed around a table around a linden tree, the national tree of the Czech Republic. His idea was to create a gathering place in a public space to promote dialogue, discussion and freedom of speech. Bořek Šípek named the installation \\"Democracy Talks\\" and described it as \\"a place where people can meet and exercise their freedom of speech in a democratic dialogue with others\\". Tomáš Halík, a close friend of Havel, told Czech Radio on 5 October 2013 that \\"the bench with the two chairs symbolises the willingness to sit down at a table and talk. That is, in my opinion, another important message left by Václav Havel: Even as people of different opinions, different political beliefs and different religions, it is still immensely important to sit down at a table and talk to one another in search for the truth.\\" Partner cities Havel's place in University of South Bohemia The first Havel's Place was installed in the grounds of Georgetown University in Washington D.C on 2 October 2013, with the support of Georgetown University, the Czech Embassy, Václav Havel Library and American Friends of Czech Republic. It was dedicated by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Dagmar Havlová, Havel's widow. At a meeting in Prague a few days after the installation of the Havel's Place bench in Georgetown, Sipek met with Art for Amnesty founder Bill Shipsey who proposed that further Havel's Places would be installed in cities around the world. It was decided to start with Dublin Shipsey's home town. The Dublin \\"Havel's Place\\" was installed in St. Patrick's Park (adjacent to St. Patrick’s Cathedral) in Dublin, Ireland on Human Rights Day, 2013 (10 December) by the Lord Mayor of Dublin Oisin Quinn and Karel Schwarzenberg Havel's former Chancellor.http://www.mzv.cz/dublin/en/news_and_activities/havel_s_place_in_dublin_10_12.html The Dublin project was conceived and promoted by Bill Shipsey with support from the City of Dublin and the Czech Ambassador to Ireland Tomas Kafka.http://www.radio.cz/en/section/one-on-one/havel-was-a-hero-who-didnt- disappoint-says-art-for-amnestys-bill-shipsey The next Havel's Place, \\"Espai Havel\\", (\\"Havel's Place\\" in Catalan) was dedicated in Barcelona by the Mayor of Barcelona, Xavier Trias, and Karel Schwarzenberg on 15 February 2014 in the Parc de la Ciutadella beside the Catalan Parliament building. This Havel's Place was also conceived and promoted by Bill Shipsey. On May 1, 2014 the fourth Havel's Place was dedicated in Maltese Square in Havel's home town of Prague. On June 11, 2014 the fifth Havel's Place was unveiled in the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, as part of an international project of public places dedicated to the late Czech president. On September 27, 2014 the sixth 'Havel's Place' was unveiled on the Campus of Venice International University, San Servolo Island. Venice in the presence of Ambassador Umberto Vattani, President of Venice International University; Petr Burianek, Czech Ambassador to Italy; Honorary Consul of the Czech Republic, Giorgio Boatto; and Professor Agar Brugiavini, the Dean of Venice International University.

There are very few historical records of her life, but legends about her are widespread in Thailand. Many Thais revere her as a national heroine or even as a popular deity.  Biography and legend  She was the daughter of Maha Thammaracha, viceroy of Phitsanulok and later King of Ayutthaya and his wife Wisutkasat; elder sister of the princes Naresuan and Ekathotsarot who later both became kings of Ayutthaya, too. On her maternal side she was a granddaughter of King Chakkraphat and Queen Suriyothai. In 1564, her father became a vassal of King Bayinnaung of Pegu in Burma. Her brothers were taken to the Peguan court to serve as pages and guarantee for the loyalty of their father, as was usual at the time. Thai narrative According to the common narrative in Thailand, in 1571, Suphankanlaya agreed to marry Bayinnaung to become one of his minor wives. This bond, too, should consolidate her father's allegiance to the Burmese king. Her brothers, instead, could return home. She had two children with Bayinnaung. After the king's death in 1581, she became the wife of his son and successor Nanda. In 1584, her father revolted against Nanda. He revoked the oath of allegiance to the Burmese king and it came to war. After her father's death in 1590, her brother Naresuan carried on the fight. In 1593, Naresuan defeated and killed Nanda's son Mingyi Swa in a legendary duel on elephants' backs. When Nanda learnt of his son's death, according to the common narrative in Thailand, he became enraged and stroke Suphankanlaya, who was eight months pregnant with his child, dead. Burmese records The Burmese chronicles mention her only in passing. According to the records, her title was Bya Eindra Dewi (, )Modern Burmese pronunciation given here. The name \\"\\" is an archaic Mon language-derived Burmese version of Thai \\"Phra Intha Thewi\\" (; ). Per (Pan Hla 2004: 176), the spelling is of Mon origin, and means Sakra (Inda/Indra), the ruler of the in Buddhist cosmology. Her title means Her Highness Royal Queen Consort of Sakra, and may be translated as \\"\\" (Eindra Dewi Mibaya, ) in modern Burmese. and her personal name was Amyoyon (, ). She was presented to the king at the Pegu court on 22 January 1567.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 296): 13th waning of Tabodwe 928 ME = 22 January 1567 They had a daughter named Min A-Htwe (, ).Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 72 Moreover, the chronicles make no mention of her subsequent marriage to Nanda. Her name does not appear in the chronicles' list of queens, junior queens or concubines of Nanda.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 103  Popular cult  In official accounts of the Siamese and Burmese history, Suphankanlaya is only mentioned in passing, if at all. However, her story entered the Thai national mythology. Legends of her have often been depicted in popular culture. During and after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, she became part of the \\"pantheon\\" of Thai national deities. A businesswoman first claimed that Suphankanlaya had saved her from bankruptcy. She then asked a historian to research the chronicles for accounts of the princess and a successful romantic novelist to popularise Suphankanlaya's story in an easy-to-read way. The historian insisted that historic depictions of the princess are very sparse and the story of her gruesome death rather legend than historically traceable. This did not stop large parts of the Thai public from developing a cult around the supposed heroine, worshipping her images and votive objects. As no authentic portrayal of the historic person has survived, the pictures were modelled on the look of former beauty queens. Suphankanlaya, like her brother Naresuan, was established as a symbol of national assertiveness and self-sacrifice. In Thai folk beliefs, the spirits of murder victims are attributed exceptional powers. The spread of Suphankanlaya worship has to be seen in the context of the rise of Thai nationalist (particularly anti-Burmese) sentiments at that time of economic crisis. It is similar to the emergence of a cult around her grandmother Queen Suriyothai who is (ahistorically) venerated as a strong warrior heroine who sacrificed herself for the sovereignty of the nation, as well. The popular reverence for Suphankanlaya was seized on by Thai authorities and the military. The Third Army command in her presumed native city of Phitsanulok was the first to erect a monument to her and commissioned a biography in 1998, in which the alleged cruelty of her Burmese husband was emphasised. In 2004, a film was made of her legend.

Legat was born in Musselburgh, Midlothian and educated in Edinburgh where he was awarded a B.Sc. (Agriculture), also taking courses in field geology, botany and zoology. He came to South Africa in 1898 and took up an appointment with the Cape Forestry Department, was transferred to the Transvaal in 1902, and promoted to Conservator of Forests in 1904. In 1913 he succeeded Joseph Storr Lister as Chief Conservator and immediately set about seeking a solution to the woodcutter problems in the Southern Cape forests. A considerable population of woodcutters had become financially dependent on these forests, leading to over-exploitation in order to keep them supplied with timber. The passing of the Forest Act of 1913 restricted woodcutting to those who were actually engaged in the practice at the time of the Act.Our Green Heritage - South African Book of Trees - Immelman, Wicht & Ackerman (Tafelberg, 1973) In 1914, Legat was asked by the Smuts government to prepare a proposal on how poor whites could be employed in an afforestation scheme. This scheme was designed specifically to assist those woodcutters who had become unemployed because of the 1913 Act. It was accepted that higher wages would be paid than the black workers had been receiving. This placed Legat in the awkward situation where government wanted Forestry to be profitable, yet at the same time make use of the most expensive labour. The onset of World War I delayed implementation of the scheme, but in 1916 it was revived and two settlements were proposed – one at French Hoek just outside Franschhoek and the other at Jonkersberg north of Great Brak River. The workers were to be provided with a house on a small plot of land, free medical care and paid a wage, while soldiers returning from World War I, many of whom were classed as poor whites, also prompted the launching of the program. In 1928, Legat represented South Africa at the Forestry Conference held in Perth, Australia. Legat returned to the United Kingdom after his retirement and settled in Farnham, Surrey. He was appointed Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1939 for services to the Empire Forestry Association. In 1943, he served as Vice- Chairman of the Empire Forestry Association and was a member of the Governing Council. He died in Surrey in 1966.

The project began in 2009 as a one-armed welding robot modified to be able to paint. The robot’s arm can interchange between different brushes and pens, and is equipped with a distance sensor to measure exactly how far the arm is from the canvas. e-David features two main painting methods: predefined stroke candidates and dynamically generated strokes.  Development  e-David was developed by Prof. Dr. Oliver Deussen, Thomas Lindemeier, Mark Tautzenberger, and Dr. Sören Pirk of the Department of Computer and Information Science. The goal for the project was to build a robot that mimics the manual painting process: painting in iterations until the desired image is achieved. This differs from earlier painting robots because instead of computing the perfect set of strokes and painting once, the robot paints in iterative steps, moving the optimization process from the computer to the canvas. e-David implements features from earlier works, including AARON, a robot developed by Harold Cohens to paint abstract art. However unlike AARON, e-David focuses on representing an input image accurately rather than generating abstract art. More recent developments include the ability of e-David to reproduce single strokes or writing from a reference, as painted by a human. The robot is also able to iteratively improve on its reproduction attempts: as the brush is a flexible tool, it introduces a certain positioning error in the brushstroke on the canvas. e-David now compares the difference between the stroke it paints and the prototype stroke and computes an updated brush trajectory, to minimize the error. Results are stored, and the machine builds a database of movement trajectories and resulting brushstrokes.  Painting Process  e-David takes in an input photograph and generates a set of brushstrokes which vary in length and width. The algorithm implements a visual feedback loop. The loop follows these steps: * paints a set of computer generated strokes * checks to see if the painted strokes accurately represent the input image * generates the next set of strokes to more accurately match the input image This process mimics the human painting process, just as a painter would lighten and darken a painting to satisfaction rather than paint a perfect painting in one attempt. This also allows the robot to autonomously correct mistakes caused by dripping paint, deformed brushes etc, as such a defect is spotted when comparing the input image with the current canvas state.  Stroke Generation Methods  e-David utilizes two different stroke generation methods: Predefined strokes, and Dynamically generated strokes.  Predefined strokes  This method chooses the new strokes from a set of 3 different lengths, 3 different widths, and 60 different directions, resulting in 540 different possible strokes. At each location in the image all of the 540 possible stroke candidates are “tried-out”, and e-David chooses the stroke that matches the image at that point with the highest quality. During each iteration of the feedback loop, e-David paints 300 predefined strokes. The resulting brushstrokes are short in comparison to dynamically generated strokes.  Dynamically generated strokes  This method uses the image gradient to create longer brushstroke paths rather than many shorter strokes which are used in the predefined strokes method. The image gradient is how the color or intensity of an image is changing at any particular location. For example, if at a particular pixel in an image, the image is transitioning between a lighter color to a darker color, the gradient at that location will indicate which way the image is brightening/darkening and how fast it is brightening/darkening. e-David generates a collection of brushstrokes perpendicular to the gradient’s direction, resulting in lines along paths of similar color intensity. e-David takes all of these dynamically generated strokes, and chooses the paths that do not overlap. The chosen brushstrokes, usually longer and smoother than predefined strokes, result in dark and expressive paintings.  Comparison of styles  Predefined strokes result in very clean paintings, however the shorter preset brushstrokes seem more robotic than paintings created by dynamically generated strokes. One way to improve upon this painting style is to include longer and more varied brushstrokes, but this could slow down the process due to the larger number of predefined brushstrokes to \\"try out\\" choose from. In dynamically generated strokes, areas of the painting with high detail are often too dark. However, dynamically generated strokes look more complex and artistic than predefined strokes due to the unique brushstrokes. One way to improve upon the dynamically generated strokes is to prevent the creation of dark spots by filtering fine lines in high detail areas.  Public appearances  The artist Liat Grayver uses e-David to create contemporary art, which has been displayed at several venues in Germany and Israel. A mobile demonstrator of the e-David system has been exhibited in Leipzig and Zurich.

Above the castle island the surviving, L-shaped chancery may be made out in the centre of the outwork The shelling of Bremervörde and its castle (right) in 1657  From medieval castle to stately home  The first castle on the site of the subsequent stately home was built in the early 12th century, between 1112 and 1122, at the behest of Lothair III. Because there was a ford here over the River Oste and the site was on the historic Ox Road, the location was of strategic importance. The castle, known in Latin documents as Castrum Voerde (\\"Vörder Castle\\"), fell into the hands of various owners as a result of disputes. For example, it went from the counts of Stade to Henry the Lion and finally, in 1219, to the Archbishopric of Bremen. Roughly located in the centre of the bishopric, the castle grew during the course of the centuries that followed, into the greatest fortress in the region and the headquarters of the central administration of the episcopal estates and the district advocates. The castle was used as a residenz by several of the bishops of Bremen and gradually extended and converted into a stately home or schloss. From the 16th century onwards, the construction material used for the castle came mainly from the brickworks in the neighbouring town of Bevern. At the outset of the Thirty Years' War the castle consisted of a fortified island in the Oste, which protected the ostentatious, multi-winged, Renaissance house. The castle island opposite had an outwork protected by bastions and south and east of the castle were several courtly pleasure gardens and vegetable gardens. The old chancery building which houses the Bachmann Museum today The rear of the old chancery building During the course of the war, the town and the castle were besieged in 1627 and 1646 and badly damaged. The castle endured a further siege in 1657 in the Dano-Swedish War. During the period of Swedish rule the new lords moved their seat of government to Stade and into the newly built country house of Agathenburg, so the older, very extensive castle in Bremervörde waned in importance. In 1682, much of the fortress was slighted and the ruins of the house and defensive works were dismantled. Some of the construction material thus made available was used to build the Swedish Warehouse (Schwedenspeicher) in Stade.

They were generally careful essays in Classical Chinese and their presentation was a formal affair directed by government officials. Submission of a memorial was a right theoretically available to everyone from the Crown Prince to a common farmer, but the court secretaries would read them aloud to the emperor and exercised considerable control over what was considered worthy of his time. They were used in imperial China as a means of regulating corrupt local officials who might otherwise have escaped oversight.Brook, 33. Han dynasty Under the Han dynasty, generally, the reception of memorials was the responsibility of the Imperial Secretary tasked with overseeing provincial administration. He generally needed to present any formal memorials, but could reject them for improper formatting.Wang (1949), 148-149. Masters of Writing under the Minister Steward then copied and processed these prior to submission to the emperor.Bielenstein (1980), 9. Under Emperor An, however, Zhang Heng was placed in charge of reception of the memorials as part of his post as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards.Crespigny (2007), 1049 & 1223.Yan (2007), 128. Ming dynasty During the early Ming dynasty, an Office of Report Inspection was established in 1370\\\\. In 1375, Ru Taisu, a bureau secretary of the Ministry of Justice, was flogged by the Hongwu Emperor for the annoyance of his 17,000-character memorial. At the time he was summoned for his punishment, however, the emperor had only gotten to the 16,370th one. Having the remainder read aloud the next day, the emperor instituted four of Ru's proposals and praised the last 500 characters as a model memorial for all future submissions. Ru was nonetheless again castigated for having forced the emperor to listen to thousands of words before getting to the substance of his request.Brook, 32. Two years later in August 1377, the Hongwu Emperor disbanded the existing Office of Report Inspection and created an Office of Transmission (, Tōngzhèngsī). By the height of the Ming dynasty, codes and statutes had been drawn up specifying the style and diction appropriate for each level of official concerning each type of problem. When petitions arrived in the imperial capital, multiple copies were made of the original by the Office of Transmission. The copies would be filed with the archives at the Office of Supervising Secretaries and the original sent to the emperor. Criminal codes specified punishments for mistranscriptions or violations of the imperial naming taboo. Replies varied from Ru's flogging in the Hongwu Emperor's presence to personal replies both handwritten and dictated. Most often, emperors or their secretaries would annotate the memorials with vermillion ink, whether \\"forward to the proper ministry\\", \\"noted\\", or a series of circles. These functioned as checkmarks, indicating that he had read the petition.Wilkinson, 534-535. Qing dynasty Memorial to the Kangxi Emperor from the Viceroy of Liangguang about the Thirteen Factories in Guangzhou, with imperial reply in red (1719) Under the Qing dynasty, memorials were received constantly, detailing personnel evaluations, crop reports, local prices, weather predictions, and local gossip at the national, provincial, and county levels.Spence, 70-71 & 87.

Communication and Imperial Control in China: Evolution of the Palace Memorial System, 1693-1735\\\\. Harvard University Press (Cambridge), 1970. . Because this great (largely Han Chinese) bureaucracy might interrupt, conceal, or lose information important to their Manchu rulers, the Kangxi Emperor developed a supplemental system of \\"Palace Memorials\\" () in the late 17th century. This system delivered local officials' memorials to him directly and, under various forms, it continued to be practiced by his successors. A \\"Folding Memorial\\", for instance, was to be written on pages small enough for the emperor to hold them in his hand and read without being observed.Elliott, 161-164.

In 1906 he purchased a 6 hp De Dion car and drove it to The Hermitage hotel near Mount Cook; and subsequently dissolved his first firm and formed the \\"Mount Cook Motor Co Ltd\\" with four Darraq cars to provide transport for tourists to The Hermitage and from 1912 Queenstown also. When the Lakes County Council tried to stop motor cars on the Queenstown route by banning any vehicle propelled by its own power from a critical two mile stretch, he hired men with horses to pull the cars with passengers over the section. After the Great War he purchased five war surplus British aircraft and formed \\"The New Zealand Aero Transport Co\\" in 1921, the precursor to Mount Cook Airline. He was also a notable mountaineer, making the first ascent of Mount Cook in mid-winter with two guides, on 11–12 August 1923.

Biography  Kurt Gies was born the son of Heinrich Gies, an administrator of the local sports facilities Am Kahlenberg. While his three elder brothers Johann, Wilhelm and Heinrich worked as tennis coaches, Kurt's father hoped his fourth son would pursuit a different career. However, Kurt joined the local tennis club at an age of 13 and was quickly recognized an outstanding tennis talent. In 1938 and 1939, he won the German boys championships. From 1939, he was coached by Hans Nüsslein. In 1940, Gies won the German championships in mixed doubles along with Ulla Rosenow. In the same year, Gies was sent on a trip to Japan together with former French champion Henner Henkel, where they played a couple of exhibition matches as well as four Japanese-German competitions. In 1941, Gies won the German championships at Braunschweig by beating favorite Adam Baworowski in the final in five sets. He was also successful in doubles, along with Henner Henkel. He also captured the title at the Danish indoor championships where he beat Anker Jacobsen in the final. Gies was later drafted into the German army which prevented him from defending his German title in 1942. In 1943, he was granted vacation and took part in a tennis competition between Germany and Hungary at Berlin which the Hungarian team won. He was able to win his second German title at Braunschweig by beating Engelbert Koch in the final. Again, he also won the doubles championship, this time with Koch. Only a few weeks after his victory at Braunschweig, the young lieutenant was killed in action on the Eastern Front on 23 November 1943.

He began his biological studies at the Jagiellonian University in 1959. After graduating in 1964, he was employed as an Assistant in the Department of Systematic Zoology and Zoogeography under the leaderships of Professor Stanisław Smreczyński. Throughout the 1960s and in the early 1970s he was particularly involved in the activities of the Polish Mountaineering Association. He presented his Ph.D. thesis in 1971. It concerned the morphology of the family Adelidae. Soon after gaining the title of doctor habilitatus at the beginning of the 1980s, he was appointed Head of the Zoological Museum of the Jagiellonian University. Immediately afterwards, he was offered a contract to teach at a university in Nigeria. Between 1982 and 1986, Janusz taught zoology and entomology at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka. One of the scientific result of his stay in Nigeria was the description of a new morphological organ in the ants of the genus Oecophylla, pretarsal pads, which allow these insects to push large prey on smooth and almost vertical surfaces. After returning from Nigeria, he continued his research in the field of entomology. In 1991, he published a textbook on the ethology of insects, which is the only such comprehensive treatment of this topic in the Polish language to date. In 1994, he received a professorial nomination from the President of the Republic of Poland, Lech Wałęsa. From the mid-1990s, Wojtusiak concentrated on the mountainous areas of South America, participating in or organising more than ten scientific expeditions into the Andes, which resulted in more than 100 scientific publications and descriptions of more than 400 new species of butterflies and moths, principally belonging to the family Tortricidae, in co-authorship with Professor Józef Razowski.nekrolog Janusz Wojtusiak References Polish entomologists 1942 births 2012 deaths Scientists from Kraków Jagiellonian University alumni Polish expatriates in Nigeria University of Nigeria faculty ","title":"Janusz Wojtusiak"},{"id":"41223173","text":"Bignall is a surname.

It grows intertidally in temperate waters around the world. In South Africa it is part of a mutualistic relationship with a limpet. Description Ralfsia verrucosa forms roughly circular patches that grow outwards from the centre with the central parts sometimes becoming detached from the substrate. The thallus is deep brown or blackish-brown and is about thick. It has a distinct, often pale-coloured, margin which is formed from erect filaments which are fused together and that curve upwards from other prostrate filaments. The patches of thalli are thick, some in diameter and often coalescing to form larger patches. The surface is smooth and hard. Distribution and habitat Ralfsia verrucosa is a cosmopolitan species and is found in temperate waters in northern and western Europe, Mediterranean Sea, Iceland, Greenland, Canada, New England, Argentina, round the coasts of Africa, India, Japan, Korea, China, Russia, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. It grows on rock in pools in the intertidal zone. Biology The brown colour of this seaweed results from the dominance of the xanthophyll fucoxanthin which masks the other pigments that are present, namely chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, beta-carotene and other xanthophylls. The tissues contain polyphenols which act as a deterrent to herbivores. Round the coasts of South Africa, Ralfsia verrucosa enjoys a mutual relationship with the limpet Scutellastra longicosta. This limpet clears an area of rock by intensive grazing, and allows Ralfsia verrucosa to settle on it while excluding other species of algae. The limpet then cultivates its \\"garden\\", grazing the algal turf to a moderate level and fertilising it with faeces and mucus.

Eagan was the son and only child of John Joseph and Mary V. Russell Eagan of Georgia. His father died of tuberculosis on July 19, 1870. His uncle William Russell, who owned the W. A. Russell Tobacco Company in Atlanta, moved Mary and John to Atlanta. John was studious and excelled in school, studied the Bible and was active, along with his mother, in Christian ministry at Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. The Eagans also lived for periods of time with Mary's sister in Cartersville and on the farm of a family friend. At age 16, Eagan left school and returned to Atlanta. He worked at a grocery store briefly until starting work at his uncle's tobacco store. At age 21, John inherited $6,000 from his grandmother. He invested the money and by 1899 had a fortune of over $73,000. When Eagan was 29, he inherited a $750,000 bequest from his uncle Russell. Eagan continued investing in property, stocks and a few businesses. Humbled by his blessings, Eagan tithed to the church, supported numerous charities benefiting the poor, and used his business influence to improve conditions for workers. A May 13, 1900 entry in Eagan's diary included this prayer: \\"O Lord show me how to invest Thy wealth to promote Thy glory, so that I may bear much fruit.\\" Although Eagan had prospered in the tobacco business inherited from his uncle, he did not believe this should be his life's work. In an April 7, 1901 diary entry, Eagan wrote: \\"My chief end is to glorify God. I believe there are fields of endeavor where I can glorify Him more than in this business. Therefore it is my duty to get into the field where I can glorify Him most.\\" In 1905, Charlotte Blair, secretary of Dimmick Pipe Company in Anniston, Alabama, along with her brother James W. Blair, interested several southern businessmen in the idea of starting a new pipe plant in Birmingham, Alabama. With its natural resources, access to raw materials and rail transportation, Birmingham was considered a well suited location. Eagan was one of five charter investors in the Birmingham pipe plant, which was named American Cast Iron Pipe Company and came to be recognized by the acronym ACIPCO. He served as the company's president from 1905 until 1915, when James McWane was named president and Eagan became chairman of the ACIPCO Board of Directors. McWane left ACIPCO in 1921 and Eagan began a second term as president, serving in this office until days before his death in 1924. In accord with his Christian beliefs, and influenced by social and industrial reform movements of the day, Eagan developed a business model at ACIPCO based on the \\"Golden Rule\\". He paid good wages and kept shifts to nine hours or less with overtime and sick leave, invested in worker safety programs, and treated all employees with fairness. He also constructed affordable housing for workers, as well as schools, churches, a medical clinic, a library, a bank, and an employee-operated store. He shared the company's profits with employees. While developing his plan for ACIPCO, Eagan bought back all the common stock of the company to become its sole owner by the end of 1921. In April 1923, Eagan added a codicil to his will placing all the company stock in a trust for employees. In Eagan's words, his object was to ensure \\"service both to the purchasing public and to labor on the basis of the Golden Rule.\\" When he died on March 30, 1924, ACIPCO became an employee-owned business, electing its own members to the company's board. Eagan had suffered from tuberculosis for many years and died from one of its common complications—meningitis. Eagan and his wife, the former Susan Baum Young, had two children, Bill and Ann. Eagan died in Asheville, North Carolina, where he had traveled in hopes of regaining his health. He is buried at Westview Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia. Eagan was inducted into the National Management Association Hall of Fame in 1998, the Kiwanis Club Birmingham Business Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2014, Weld for Birmingham listed him among \\"50 Who Shaped Birmingham.\\" The former John J. Eagan School in Birmingham's Acipco-Finley neighborhood was named in his honor. References Lewis, W.

It housed corpses until they started to decompose, so their graves would not be desecrated by resurrectionists and body-snatchers digging them up to sell the cadavers to medical colleges for dissection. Bodies were permitted to be stored for up to three months before burial. The circular mort house was designed with a revolving platform and double doors. After the passage into law of the Anatomy Act 1832 Udny Mort House gradually fell into disuse; minutes of the committee responsible for its operation cease in about July 1836. Background In the 18th and 19th centuries body-snatchers, also known as resurrectionists, shush-lifters or noddies, excavated graves to meet the increasing demand from medical colleges for bodies to dissect, as not enough were being supplied from executions. Precautions were taken to protect the bodies and various methods were used to prevent access to graves. In Scotland, vaults, watch houses, mort houses and mortsafes were used. Grave-robbing was a widespread problem and in 1821, the minister for West Calder, Reverend W. Fleming wrote: Bodies were securely kept in locked buildings until the process of natural decomposition rendered the cadavers useless for dissection. History The outer door A group of 15 local gentlemen held a meeting in Udny Green on 21 January 1832 to discuss constructing a vault within the churchyard to hold dead bodies until they could be buried. Agreement was reached and a decision was made to use a plan that had been submitted by John Marr of Cairnbrogie. Formally adopted the following week, an advertisement was placed in the Aberdeen Journal on 15 February 1832, inviting tenders for the construction of the mort house. Applications were also invited from potential subscribers to use the facility. The contracts to undertake the building work were awarded on 17 March 1832; however, difficulties were encountered collecting the subscriptions (which were to be used to cover the building costs), so the plans were altered to reduce costs. Construction was to be completed by 1 September 1832 but was delayed after arguments took place with the mason. The contractors received final payments on 26 January 1833 and the formal \\"Regulations for the management of the vault at Udny\\" were agreed on 23 February. The regulations are likely to be similar to those applied to other mort houses, although records of other structures are not generally available. Rules included stipulations as to the construction of coffins, which had to be made from well-seasoned fir inches thick and completely air-tight. Additionally, any bodies considered to be \\"infectious or otherwise dangerous\\" had to be wrapped in tin plate or lead. A penalty of two pounds was levied on the maker of a coffin that did not conform to the requirements. Bodies were permitted to remain in the mort house for up to three months. Non-subscribers were allowed use of the vault by paying between five and twenty shillings, at the committee's discretion. Four members of the committee were key bearers, and it was compulsory for them to be present to open and close the vault whenever necessary, although they were to be given twenty-four hours notice that they were required. Architecture Built from ashlar granite in 1832 to the design of John Marr of Cairnbrogie; the masonry work was undertaken by Alexander Wallace of Smiddyhill. Thomas Smith of Oldmeldrum completed the carpentry work. The roof is slated rather than the more common covering of turf. There is a thick oak outer door accompanied by an iron inner door. Three feet above the floor inside was a revolving circular oak platform, on which the coffins were placed. The structure has no windows. The interior has a domed stone roof and lath and plaster walls. After the passing of the Anatomy Act 1832, the mort house gradually fell into disuse. The minutes of the committee meeting held on 4 July 1836 record that the key-bearers were warned they must be present when the doors were being opened, or they could be fined. Udny Mort House is described as a \\"rare and important structure\\" by the Scottish Church Heritage Research. Historic Scotland allocated it a Category B listing in April 1971. Some restoration work was undertaken in 1976–77. A further inspection by Aberdeenshire Council officials in July 1998 suggested it required further work, particularly highlighting the need for re-pointing and some roof slate replacement. The dead house in Ontario, Canada, built in about 1868, is a very similar structure to Udny Mort House. It seems to have been used to store bodies until weather conditions improved sufficiently to allow burial to take place.

Description and significance  Microbiologist Benjamin Elazari Volcani first discovered Haloferax volcanii, a self-named extremophile, in the 1930s. H. volcanii is a halophilic mesophile archaeon that can be isolated from hypersaline environments such as: the Dead Sea, the Great Salt Lake, and oceanic environments with high sodium chloride concentrates. Haloferax volcanii is noteworthy because it can be cultured without much difficulty, rare for an extremophile. H. volcanii is chemoorganotrophic, metabolizing sugars as a carbon source.Oren, A. \\"The Order Halobacteriales.\\" The Prokaryotes: A Handbook on the Biology of Bacteria. 3rd ed. New York: Springer. 2006. pp. 113-164. It is primarily aerobic, but is capable of anaerobic respiration under anoxic conditions.Zaigler, A., Schuster, S.C., and Soppa, J. \\"Construction and usage of a onefold-coverage shotgun DNA microarray to characterize the metabolism of the archaeon Haloferax volcanii.\\" Molecular Microbiology. 2003. Volume 48, Issue 4, pp. 1089–1105. Recently an isolate of this species was studied by researchers at University of California, Berkeley, as part of a project on the survival of haloarchaea on Mars.  Genome structure  The genome of H. volcanii consists of a large (4 Mb), multicopy chromosome and several megaplasmids. The complete genome, DS2, of H. volcanii consists of about 4130 genes. The genome has been completely sequenced and a paper discussing it was published in 2010. The molecular biology of H. volcanii has been extensively studied for the last decade in order to discover more about DNA replication, DNA repair and RNA synthesis. The archaeal proteins used in these processes are extremely similar to Eukaryotic proteins and so are studied primarily as a model system for these organisms. H. volcanii undergoes prolific horizontal gene transfer through a mechanism of \\"mating\\"- cell fusion.  Cell structure and metabolism  Reproduction among H. volcanii occurs asexually by binary fission. This practice is similar to that of other Archaea and, indeed, that of bacteria. H. volcanii cells have no cell wall and, like many archaea, therefore use their exterior S-layer for structure. An individual H. volcanii archaeon can vary from 1-3 micrometers in diameter.Garrity, G.M., Castenholz, R.W., and Boone, D.R. (Eds.) Bergey's Manual of Systemic Bacteriology, Volume One: The Archaea and the Deeply Branching and Phototrophic Bacteria. 2nd ed. New York: Springer. 2001. p. 316. They are typically recognisable by their 'dished crisp' shape, but are somewhat pleiomorphic so may be seen in other shapes including coccoid. Haloferax volcanii grown in laboratory conditions and imaged using a phase contrast microscope. Cells were mounted on an agar pad. The membranes of this organism are made of the typical ether linked membrane lipids found solely in archaea and also contain a high level of carotenoids including lycopene, which gives them their distinctive red colour. H. volcanii use a salt in method to maintain osmostasis, rather than the typical compatible solutes method seen in bacteria. This method involves the maintenance of a high degree of potassium ions in the cell to balance the sodium ions outside. For this reason H. volcanii has a complex ion regulation system and is chemoautotrophic. H. volcanii will optimally grow at 42 °C in 1.5-2.5 M NaCl and complex nutrient medium. It will still grow at 37 °C, but still requires the concentrated NaCl and complex medium. Due to the salt in method cytoplasmic proteins are structured to fold in the presence of high ionic concentrations. As such they typically have a large number of charged residues on the exterior section of the protein and very hydrophobic residues forming a core. This structure increases their stability in saline and even high temperature environments considerably, but comes at some loss of processivity compared to bacterial homologs. H. volcanii respire as their sole source of ATP, unlike several other halobateriacae, such as Halobacterium salinarum they are incapable of photophosphorylation as they lack the necessary bacteriorhodopsin.  Ecology  Isolates of H. volcanii are commonly found in high-salinity aquatic environments, such as the Dead Sea. Their precise role in the ecosystem is uncertain, but the carbohydrates contained within these organisms potentially serve many practical purposes. Because of their ability to maintain homeostasis in spite of the salt around them, H. volcanii could be an important player in advancements in biotechnology. As it is likely that H. volcanii and comparable species are ranked among the earliest living organisms, they also provide information related to genetics and evolution.See the NCBI webpage on Haloferax. Data extracted from the  Dead Sea  The Dead Sea contains a very high concentration of sodium, magnesium, and calcium salts. This combination makes the sea an ideal environment for extremophiles such as H.volcanii.Oren, A. \\"Population dynamics of halobacteria in the Dead Sea water column.\\" Limnology and Oceanography. 1983. Volume 28, issue 6, pp. 1094-1103. The Dead Sea has a diverse community of microorganisms, though the field tests completed by Kaplan and Friedman reported that H.volcanii had the largest numerical presence within the community.MULLAKIIANBIIAI, M. F., AND H. LARSEN. 1975. Halobacterium volcanii spec. nov., a Dead Sea halobacterium with a modcrate salt requirement. Arch. Mikrobiol. 104: 207-214. It is common to find higher numbers of the halophile during the summer, as the Dead Sea is much warmer, averaging around 37 degrees Celsius, and thus more conducive to bacterial blooms.NEEV, D., ANI) K. 0. EMERY. 1967. The Dead Sea- Depositional processes and environments of evaporites. State of Israel-Min. Develop.-Gcol. Surv. Bull. 41. Unfortunately, the Dead Sea is becoming less hospitable to extremophiles such as H. volcanii due to increasing salinity, credited to both natural factors and human activities. As the predominant environment for Haloferax volcanii, the change in salinity places the species at risk. DNA damage and repair In prokaryotes the DNA genome is organized in a dynamic structure, the nucleoid, which is embedded in the cytoplasm. Exposure of Haloferax volcanii to stresses that damage the DNA cause compaction and reorganization of the nucleoid. Compaction depends on the Mre11-Rad50 protein complex that is employed in the homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Delmas et al. proposed that nucleoid compaction is part of a DNA damage response that accelerates cell recovery by helping DNA repair proteins to locate targets, and by facilitating the search for intact DNA sequences during homologous recombination. Genetic exchange H. volcanii cells can undergo a pairwise process of genetic exchange which involves cell fusion resulting in a heterodiploid cell (containing two different chromosomes in one cell). Cells of a related species, Haloferax mediterranei, can similarly undergo genetic exchange with each other. H. volcanii has an average nucleotide sequence identity with H. mediterranei of 86.6%. At a reduced frequency, cells of these two species may also interact to undergo genetic exchange. During this process a diploid cell is formed that contains the full genetic repertoire of both parental cells, and genetic recombination is facilitated. Subsequently, the cells separate, giving rise to recombinant cells. Astrobiology The conditions Haloferax volcanii survives in, high salinity and high radiation, are very similar to the conditions found on Mars' surface. Consequently, the organism is currently being used to test the survivability of earth native extremophiles on Mars. Advances in this field could lead to a greater understanding of the possibility and time line of extraterrestrial life.DasSarma, S. \\"Extreme Halophiles Are Models for Astrobiology.\\" Microbe Magazine. 2006.

She served as överhovmästarinna to queen Christina of Sweden from 1639 to 1647. Life Beata Oxenstierna was born to Baron Erik Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (1540s-1594) and Bengta Gera. Her father had been a courtier to Princess Cecilia Vasa of Sweden, and governor in Swedish Livonia, and she was born in Reval in Livonia during his tenure as governor there. She served as maid of honor to the queen of Sweden, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp, in 1610-1613. In 1613, she married Erik Göransson Ulfsparre af Broxvik (1577-1631), but as was the custom at the Swedish nobility up until the late 18th century, she kept her name even after her marriage. Her spouse served as governor in Stegeborg 1615-18, Norrköping 1618-21, Kronoberg 1621-26, and Östergötland 1627-1631; Beata Oxenstierna was widowed in 1631. Court life On 2 February 1639, she was appointed överhovmästarinna (mistress of the Robes) to queen Christina. After the death of the queen's foster mother and aunt Catherine of Sweden, Countess Palatine of Kleeburg, the Royal Regency Council under Axel Oxenstierna saw a need to appoint a new foster mother to the underage monarch (her mother being exiled), which resulted in a reorganization of the queen's household. In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, in 1639 Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag was appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title Upptuktelse- Förestånderska ('Castigation Mistress'), while Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of Hovmastarinna.Marie-Louise Rodén: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62 This signified a permanent reorganization of the Swedish Royal Household: previously, there had been only one Mistress of the Robes with the title Hovmästarinna ('Court Mistress'), but now, Beata Oxenstierna was additionally given the newly invented title of Överhovmästarinna ('Chief Court Mistress'), and from the reign of Christina onward, there where to be one or two Hovmästarinna and one Överhovmästarinna at the Swedish Royal Court. Ebba Leijonhufvud was the mother-in-law to the son of the Regent of the Guardian Government, Axel Oxenstierna, and Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was also connected to the Oxenstierna Party, which is believed to have played a part in their appointments.Erik Petersson: Maktspelerskan : drottning Kristinas revolt (2011) The Royal Council's method of giving queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person seems to have been effective: Christina dies not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and does not seem to have formed any attachment to either of them, nor do they seem to have played any part at court after their term in service ended. With some exceptions, such as Ebba Sparre, Lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in any her female courtiers whatsoever, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than them.Marie-Louise Rodén: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) page 62 In 1639 she mentions her attitude toward her ladies in waiting in regard to Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter, maid of honor Märta Ulfsparre: \\"The Mistress of the Robes Lady Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter arrived just now. The more of them that comes here the worse it is\\" [...] \\"I despised everyone in my surroundings, particularly the women of my household, from whom I could not stand the smallest reproach.\\" Eva Österberg, red (1997).

Reception In 2011 and 2013, Film Sack won People's Choice Podcast Awards in the film category. The show has received positive and negative reviews among bloggers. In 2012 Timothy Wetzel wrote, \\"It is rare to find a podcast with four people have this good of chemistry and don't feel like they're trying to hog listening time over each other or don't talk enough. Plus, each episode is very entertaining and the comedy always has me in fits of giggles, sometimes in really awkward situations.\\" Bill Thompson of Bill's Movie Emporium disapproved in 2011, writing \\"The show tries to bring humor into the mix, and it has really good audio quality. Yet I really didn't like Film Sack, and it's not that it was bad but it's that I found my time with the podcast completely forgettable.\\" Thompson recommended, \\"Unsubscribe.\\" The Filmwerk blog wrote that among film podcasts, \\"Film Sack is one of the better to choose from – and their choice of films can often help make them appeal more as they cover films that have notoriety but are not huge films\\". Filmmaker/blogger Phil Hobden recommended the podcast in 2011, as did blogger Craig Tisinger.

The town hall, which is the headquarters of Waltham Forest London Borough Council, is a Grade II Listed Building. History town hall in Orford Road which subsequently became part of the Connaught Hospital The building was commissioned to replace an earlier Italianate style town hall erected in Orford Road in 1866. After the area became an urban district in 1895 and then a metropolitan borough in 1929, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built town hall: the site chosen for the new building had previously been occupied by Chestnuts Farm, also known as Clay Farm. They decided that the new town hall would be flanked to the south east by an assembly hall which would be built in the same architectural style and at the same time as the town hall. The foundation stone for the new building, in which contemporary artifacts were placed, was laid in 1938. The building was designed by Philip Dalton Hepworth in the stripped classical style. Construction of the building, which was built of Portland Stone, was interrupted by the Second World War and not completed until 1942.Novotny, Lukas. Page 34. Modern London. White Lion Publishing; 2018. . The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with 19 bays facing onto Forest Road with the end bays projecting forwards; the central section featured a three-bay full-height portico with piers supporting a frieze above containing the words \\"Walthamstow Town Hall\\"; there was a tall copper-clad clock tower at roof level. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber which projected to the rear of the building: five statues carved by John Francis Kavanagh were installed on the external walls of the council chamber and six relief sculptures, also by Kavanagh, were erected on the portico piers. The assembly hall, which was also completed in 1942, was used as a British Restaurant during the Second World War. The town hall continued to serve as the local seat of government after the expanded Waltham Forest London Borough Council was formed in 1965. The assembly hall hosted a concert performance by Yehudi Menuhin in January 1960 and by Plácido Domingo in July 1974. The council approved an extensive programme of renovation works to the town hall and the assemby hall in October 2019; the works authorised also included improved landscaping with water jets, night-time illumination and a reflection pool.

Founded in 2008, it is owned by Somali-American twin fashion designers Ayaan and Idyl Mohallim. The brand is noted for its global sensibility and accent on ready- to-wear elegance. Founders Ayaan and Idyl Mohallim were born in Alabama to Somali parents. They moved to Somalia at an early age, where they would spend their first nine years. When the civil war broke out there in the early 1990s, they returned to the United States. Settling in northern Virginia, just outside Washington D.C., the sisters developed an interest in fashion after their mother would buy them fashion magazines. Their family put an emphasis on education, envisioning the girls' studying at top schools in preparation for professional careers. Upon graduation from college, the twins moved to New York City to pursue their goal of becoming fashion designers. Idyl quickly secured an internship with Betsey Johnson, where she acquired skills in design technique and color. Ayaan also landed a production job at Jill Stuart. There, she in turn learned how to infuse classic forms and vintage fabrics with a contemporary flair. Fashion line Iman's cosmetic line (2013) Mataano specializes in contemporary read-to-wear pieces for women. It began mainly with dress production, with an accent on comfort. Plans were also in the works to branch out into other areas. To establish a foothold in the fashion market, Ayaan and Idyl focused on ensuring their wear was ready for distribution. They then retained the services of a PR firm to help them advertise their brand, in the process sending out press releases and look books, as well as establishing a website. Their marketing efforts eventually earned the designers an invitation to the Oprah Winfrey Show to Skype with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. The Mohallim sisters have also been invited to showcase in Sweden, South Africa, Jamaica and at New York Fashion Week. Ayaan and Idyl speaking at the Nordic Somali Youth Summit 2013 Mataano showcased its premier collection for Spring 2009 in New York City. Consisting of ten dresses, it attracted widespread attention in the fashion industry and received enthusiastic reviews. The brand has since launched six other collections during New York Fashion Week. The Somali filmmaker Idil Ibrahim later directed Mataano's official promotional video for the fashion line's 2009 Fall collection. She likewise directed the official promotional video for the company's 2010 Spring collection. In Spring 2012, supermodel and fellow Somali Iman also signed Ayaan and Idyl as brand ambassadors for her cosmetics line. Mataano is noted for its global sensibility and emphasis on elegance. The Mohallim twins strive to incorporate their experiences and influences as Somali Americans into their designs, reflecting both cultures in their work. Mataano's Spring 2013 collection in part drew inspiration from Los Angeles' beaches, featuring light silks and organzas. According to co-founder Ayaan, the sisters ultimately design for the multicultural woman like themselves. The silks and colorful hues that adorn the fashion line are consequently typical of Somali female attire. In terms of other fashion designers, Ayaan and Idyl's primary influences include Tracy Reese and Carolina Herrera, whom they feel have an international appeal. They also admire the work of Donna Karen and Oscar de la Renta. As of 2013, Mataano is designed and manufactured in New York City.

It is a village of Union Council Garlat of tehsil Balakot to the south east of the Balakot city. It is a beautiful hill station but unfortunately a neglected potential tourist destination. It lies in the series of mountains connecting the Neelum Valley in Pakistani-held Kashmir to the Kaghan Valley. Etymology According to the oral traditions, the word Kanshian is after the name of a person \\"Kansha Ram\\". He is said to have been the Hindu merchant who lived here in about British Period. However, there is no rigid evidence for this assumption there are strong reference of the existence of such Hindu community in the region during Sikh and British Period. This community established Hatti ہٹـی (Small shop) in the area. Name 'Kashi' can be seen while zooming in this map of Kashmir, in Kalhana's Rajatarangini, A Chronicle of the Kings of Kashmir by Marc Aural Stein The 1900s British Army maps mention its name as 'Kashi' Geography The village consists of rugged mountainous terrain. Topography comprises mounds, steeps and large area covered and washed by the hill streams. There is very small plain area in the village. It virtually carries its boundaries to the spurs of surrounding mountains. To the east, it is shaded by two peaks, Lo-e-Dandi and Butti, 10,465 and 10,890 feet above the sea level respectively. Between these two, from Gehal (a beautiful plain area, a summer pasture), are the passes allowing travelers to Kutla Valley, a sub valley of the Neelum Valley (Azad Jammu and Kashmir). Weathers goes very cold in winters by an average 0.5 to 1 foot of snow, however it is very pleasant in the summers. Two major hill streams joins in the center of the village. In the moon-soon (15 June to 15 August) rushing torrents often make it wild and it floods dangerously. Accessibility Before 1985, the only way to get to Kanshian was on foot and then a dirt road was built. People use to go there on foot carrying their luggage or mount it on mules, horses and donkeys, they specially kept for the purpose. After the construction of dirt road, the same process is there to this day in small hamlets of the village. People of Kutla Valley, (Azad Jammu and Kashmir) used the same path to reach the market in Kanshian for known times till they got connected to Muzafarabad by road. History Though there is no authentic reference but still acceptable traditional theory of the origin of its habitation, is that it was approximately inhabited in the second half of the seventeenth century CE. However some of the archaeological site of Hindu Shahi Period are found by the archaeologists of Hazara University. British rule is also witnessed by the elders of the village. The orthodox Sunni Muslim population of the village taken part in the skirmishes fought against the forces of the \\"Maharaja of Kashmir\\", Hari Singh in different villages near to it in 1948. The stories of the valour of same are still enjoyed by the villagers. Department of Archaeology, Hazara University, Mansehra is working for establishing the occupational chronology of the area. There are finds reported of the same culture which existed in the Kaghan Valley http://unesco.org.pk/culture/documents/publications/Mapping%20and%20Documentation%20of%20the%20Cultural%20Assets%20of%20Kaghan%20Valley,%20Mansehra.pdf A panorama of Lower Kanshian 3 years after October Earthquake 2005 Literacy Even though the village is lacking in basic facilities with Medical and infrastructure in particular, still the population is well known for higher literacy rate. Roughly 50% of the males are graduates however females education trend is raising. First schools The first primary schools in Kanshian was mobile to meet the demands of the seasonally migrating population in the 1930s as per told by the old generation. The first permanent school started working in the 1940s in Tangri, a hamlet of the village. Only few students were enrolled there till the 1970s. That time some other primary schools also started. Students for matriculation classes use to go to Balakot about 10 km to north-west. In the 1990s a middle school for boys was started which soon elevated to the status of High School. Administration The village of Kanshian is administratively comes under Union Councils: Garlat . Language Hindko is the major language of the area with sharing its dialect to the Hindko of Balakot. Second language is Gojri. Gojri is spoken only the Gojar tribe. Kanshian in Mansehra District Cultural festival In summer inhabitants use to migrate seasonally on the high pastures. There they organize games. Initially these were traditional games but currently Cricket and Volley Ball are famous. Traditions and Traditional Games Map of hamlets in Kanshian Traditional games are very rich in nature, Gatka (Stick Fighting), Itti Danda which is Gulli Danda in Urdu,Budkar (Weight Lifting),etc. were common games however the young generations is more interested in international games. Among these, Gatka and Budkar was famously played on the marriage ceremonies. The hosts at the house of bride used to bound the companions of bridegroom to lift the weight which they did in front of them. The stone is said as Budkar, a weight. Another famous tradition like same was the requirement of firing at a target set by bridsiders. It is known as Tammanr (Urdu ) and hence the name of the game. After the earthquake of 8 October 2005, many people migrated to Mansehra and currently these traditions are almost died. Myths There are some of the mythic stories belonged to the local places. Zare ali Tehairi  There is a hill of red sand to the north of the village. A mound detaches to it is known as Zare ali Tehairi which means in Hindko \\"The mound of treasure\\". Accordingly, the Hindu community of the area buried their treasures beneath this mound while they were leaving the country in hurry after partition to India. An extension of the myth says that there is a two headed snake protecting the deposit. When the snake drinks from the nearby hill stream through head at one end, it dries. Bazurgan ali Gatti  There is a huge stone in the midst of the village. It was also said to have been covering the treasures of the pre- partition Hindu traders. However, after the earthquake of 2005, it is replaced uncovering none. Inhabitants The people of the village are distributed diversely in the different hamlets but still one can count for their origin by the way they are distributed. There are many casts but majority can be observed for the Gujjar tribe. They claim to be the earliest known inhabitants of the village. There are Mughals linking them to Mughal dynasty, Kashmiris relating themselves to Dogras, Sayeds, Swatis and very few Pathans. Subsistence Patterns Initially people depended totally on the poor farming and herding till 60s. Currently people are mostly employed and economic trends are getting changed Pathra Pasture, Kanshian Major Events Earthquake of October 2005 The village was struck hard as it was roughly on the fault line of the October Earthqake of 2005. Government and NGOs helped the locals to rehabilitate. Catastrophic event inflected a great loss of life, property and infrastructure. It was also a devastating blow to the rich culture and traditions which died with it. Shakening was so strong that it has changed the topography to a great deal. In hamlet, 'Khaitan (Hindko)', some people also claim that they can witness clearly the change in shade which is caused by nearby peak, particularly in winters.

The source code for the package is distributed freely and compiled binaries are available for Linux, macOS and Windows platforms. As of 2017, the Genome Biology paper describing the original Bowtie method has been cited more than 11,000 times. Bowtie is open-source software and is currently maintained by Johns Hopkins University. History The Bowtie sequence aligner was originally developed by Ben Langmead et al. at the University of Maryland in 2009. The aligner is typically used with short reads and a large reference genome, or for whole genome analysis. Bowtie is promoted as \\"an ultrafast, memory-efficient short aligner for short DNA sequences.\\" The speed increase of Bowtie is partly due to implementing the Burrows–Wheeler transform for aligning, which reduces the memory footprint (typically to around 2.2GB for the human genome); a similar method is used by the BWA and SOAP2 alignment methods. Bowtie conducts a quality-aware, greedy, randomized, depth-first search through the space of possible alignments. Because the search is greedy, the first valid alignment encountered by Bowtie will not necessarily be the 'best' in terms of the number of mismatches or in terms of quality. Bowtie is used as a sequence aligner by a number of other related bioinformatics algorithms, including TopHat, Cufflinks and the CummeRbund Bioconductor package. Bowtie 2 On 16 October 2011, the developers released a beta fork of the project called Bowtie 2. In addition to the Burrows-Wheeler transform, Bowtie 2 also uses an FM-index (similar to a suffix array) to keep its memory footprint small. Due to its implementation, Bowtie 2 is more suited to finding longer, gapped alignments in comparison with the original Bowtie method. There is no upper limit on read length in Bowtie 2 and it allows alignments to overlap ambiguous characters in the reference.

It was initially established in 1997 by the Wintter family. It is a power trio, formed by Elliot Wintter (lead vocal, bass, keyboards and synth pedals), Gabriel Wintter (guitar, acoustic guitar, Synth Pedals and Back vocal) and Thiago Wintter (Drums and vocals). Biography The band started in 1997 when brothers Gabriel and Thiago got together with their father Elliot to play for fun in their house. They used to cover progressive rock bands who have influenced their current work. They became well known in their hometown for being the only Rush cover band around, playing as a power trio just like the original band. Through the years, the band created their own identity and developed their own characteristics. These are evident in their first studio album, Wings. Musical style Wintter is known for being a hard rock/progressive band that brings to their music various influences. They are eager to bring to their listeners strong characteristics with a powerful sound, combined with elaborate vocal and melodic lines that are easy to memorize. WINGS album The band Wintter debuts its work Wings with partner WM Records. It was first released on November 11, 2013. The piece is the first album of the Wintter family, with members Elliot, Gabriel and Thiago. Their sound has evolved for years and resulted in the tendencies shown in the disc. Each song brings different expressions of feelings and emotions. These songs guide the listener through different times and situations, telling stories and sometimes highlighting the adrenaline rush of flying airplanes. Because the work was slowly developed step by step, it is a compilation of songs that show the band's maturity and also an opportunity to value each piece as a mean of sharing emotions and, eventually, some criticism too. It is a powerful album, which surely is going to state Wintter's strong presence in the world of rock. The album was recorded and mixed at the CIA DO SOM studio (www.companhiadosom.com.br) in Jundiai-SP Brazil, by Ricardo Cecchi (main engineer) and Fernando Gambini (auxiliary engineer).

It was first published in German in 1806 and the first English printing was in 1902. Herbart emphasized education as the way for an individual to fulfill his potential and created a scientific method to help him do so. The Science of Education advocated a five-step methodology that appeals to learner’s interests and applies content back to morals and daily life.American Association for the Advancement of Science (December 29, 1893), \\"Book Reviews: The Science of Education\\", Science (in English) 22 (269): 362, JSTOR https://www.jstor.org/stable/1767208 Teachers can be found in Germany, England, and the United States who are still implementing this pedagogy today.  Overview  Herbart's theory of education was called Herbartanism. He held that the psychological process of learning should be taken into account when devising curricula and goals for education. He emphasized the importance of using social and physical environments to promote learning in the classroom. Herbart held that there were five formal steps to teaching: * Relate new material to relevant past ideas in order to engage the students. * Present new material through experience and/or manipulative. * Associate new ideas to old through comparison of similarities and differences. * Generalize material, especially with younger students to show the relationships between ideas and objects in the world. * Apply acquired knowledge in a relevant way to clearly interpret life. In this step, the student must make this connection his/her own, applying it to his/her own life Because Herbart believed that a science of education was possible, he supported the idea that education should be an acceptable area of study in higher education.  Summary  Book I In the first book Herbart discusses the general aim of education. The teacher is a guide to moral development of students and must create a relationship with the students that enables them to construct an inner censor for good and evil.English, Andrea (2011), \\"Critical Listening and the Dialogic Aspect of Moral Education: J.F. Herbart’s Concept of the Teacher as Moral Guide\\", Educational Theory (in English) 61 (2): 171–192, doi:10.1111/j.1741-5446.2011.00398.x Herbart also discusses the role of the authority in the education of children. He concluded that there are two kinds of children, those who will fear punishment and want to avoid it and those whose desires will overcome their fear of authority. Learners should be taught to fear authority but also take risks so that boys can become men.Herbart, John Friedrich; Felkin, Henry & Emmie (1908), Science of Education: Its General Principles Deduced from its Aim and the Aesthetic Revelation of the World tr. From German (in English), Boston: D. C. Heath & Co., Publishers, p. 296 The first book also includes Herbart's discussion on the individuality of students and the many different elements that play into a child's morality. Book II The second book examines the many sides of learners—the multitude of influences and characteristics that each learner brings to the table. Educators need to understand that the only influence they have over learners is the freedom of choice. Educators can influence their students by giving options to potentially more profitable inquiry. Learners come with many different backgrounds, desires, and talents, and the educator needs to facilitate learner's growth in many respects as opposed to just their interests. Herbart argues that interests are similar to desires and therefore can be used to help children obey authority. Knowledge and sympathy must be taken into account when choosing which choices to give learners especially when it comes to instruction. The purpose of instruction is to marry nature and humanity. Instruction weaves together the gaps in our experiences and our feelings, but instruction must be systematic as to not confuse the learner. Book III Book three addresses Herbart's deep relationship with morality. He believed that the moral man commands himself. The book discusses the positive and negative sides of morality as well as moral judgement. The categorical imperative expresses a judgment of oneself in light of one’s recognition of the other. Herbart defines how moral character reveals itself when presented with different situations and how our character forms as a result of these natural experiences. Finally, Herbart addresses discipline and how it can affect the formation of one's character as well as the proper ways to employ it.

Guan means \\"official\\" in Chinese and Guan ware was, most unusually for Chinese ceramics of the period, the result of an imperial initiative resulting from the loss of access to northern kilns such as those making Ru ware and Jun ware after the invasion of the north and the flight of a Song prince to establish the Southern Song at a new capital at Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. It is usually assumed that potters from the northern imperial kilns followed the court south to man the new kilns.Vainker, 105 In some Asian sources \\"Guan ware\\" may be used in the literally translated sense to cover any \\"official\\" wares ordered by the Imperial court.For example, in Koh In April 2015, Liu Yiqian paid US$14.7 million for a Guan ware vase from the Southern Song. Dating and kiln sites The new Southern Song court was established in Hangzhou in 1127, but some time probably elapsed before the kiln was established; this may not have been until after hostilities with the invaders were concluded in 1141. According to Chinese historical sources, the first kiln was actually within or beside the palace precinct, described as in the \\"back park\\", and was called or was at \\"Xiuneisi\\".Gompertz, 126–127; Valenstein, 105; Vainker, 105–106 Various places around the city have been explored, and ceramic remains found, but perhaps because of subsequent building on the site, the location of this kiln remained uncertain, and it is now thought that the name might refer to the controlling office rather than the actual kiln site.Gompertz, 126–128; Vainker, 105–106; Krahl Following excavations in starting in 1996 it is now thought that the site has been found, as the Laohudong or Tiger Cave Kiln [老虎洞窑] on the outskirts of the city. An old Yue ware dragon kiln had been revived, but the official wares were made in a northern-style mantou kiln, rare this far south.Kerr, Needham & Wood, 260–262 A second kiln was established later at Jiaotanxia (\\"Altar of Heaven\\" or \\"Suburban Altar\\"), on the outskirts of the new capital; this has been identified and excavated. In Chinese contemporary sources these wares were regarded as rather inferior to those from the first kiln, and the excavated sherds are very similar to those of the nearby Longquan celadon kilns.Gompertz, 126–138; Vainker, 105–106; Krahl; Valenstein, 105 Indeed, Longquan may have helped out when the Guan kilns could not fulfill orders by themselves.Vainker, 106 The end date of Guan ware is uncertain, but it probably persisted until 1400 or later, as the Ge Gu Yao Lun, a fourteenth century Ming dynasty manual on ceramics by Cao Zhao, seems to treat it as being still produced.Medley, 158 Characteristics Bowl with type 2 crackle and lobed rim Guan ware is not difficult to distinguish from the Ru ware which it perhaps tries to imitate, but wares from the second site can be very similar indeed to Longquan ware, and it has been suggested that some was made there.Vainker, 106 Crackled glaze is usual, but perhaps was not at this time a desired effect, as it certainly became in imitations centuries later.Vainker, 107–108 Alternatively it was originally produced accidentally, but within the Guan period became deliberate.Medley, 156 In surviving examples the effect is probably often more striking than it would have been originally, either because collectors have chemically enhanced them, through gradual oxidation over time, or from staining in use.Vainker, 107–108; Gompertz, 145–146 Three qualities of the ware are recorded in old sources, and can be identified in surviving examples. The best had a grey-blue glaze on a thin body, with wide crackle, followed by a greener glaze with a denser crackle, then finally \\"almost a pale grey brown\\" with a \\"very dark close crackle on a dark grey body\\" that was rather thicker; all are illustrated here, with the types indicated by 1–3 (which is not a standard terminology).Medley, 154 The crackle arises during cooling, when the coefficient of expansion differs between the glaze and the body.Medley, 156 There are several layers of glaze, and the glaze is often thicker than the clay body, as can be seen in sherds.Vainker, 107; Gompertz, 143; Medley, 156 The crackle does not occur through all layers. Most shapes were wheel thrown, but moulds and slab-building were also used.Medley, 156 Less usual shapes include those derived from ancient ritual bronzes and jade congs.Medley, 157–158 Bowls and dishes often have \\"lobed or indented rims\\".Krahl Imitations Guan ware is \\"the most frequently copied of all Chinese wares\\",Krahl and the imitations began immediately, at the many southern kilns producing Longquan celadon and other wares. Imitations in Jingdezhen porcelain seem to have begun under the Yuan dynasty and continue to the present day; these are often hard to date.Krahl Notes References *Gompertz, G.St.G.M., Chinese Celadon Wares, 1980 (2nd edn.), Faber & Faber, *Kerr, Rose, Needham, Joseph, Wood, Nigel, Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 12, Ceramic Technology, 2004, Cambridge University Press, , 9780521838337 *Koh, NK, Koh Antiques, Singapore, \\"Guan wares\\" (covering official wares) *Krahl, Regina, Oxford Art Online, \\"Guan and Ge wares\\", section in \\"China, §VIII, 3: Ceramics: Historical development\\" *Medley, Margaret, The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, *Vainker, S.J., Chinese Pottery and Porcelain, 1991, British Museum Press, 9780714114705 *Valenstein, S.

Works *John Crow's Devil (2005) *The Book of Night Women (2009) *A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014) *Black Leopard, Red Wolf (2019), Book 1 in the Dark Star Trilogy  Themes  Themes in James’s work span religion and the supernatural, sexuality, violence, and colonialism. Often, his novels display the struggle to find an identity, whether it be as a slave or a postcolonial inhabitant of Jamaica. John Crow's Devil (2005) In John Crow's Devil, his first novel, James explores postcolonial Jamaica through a religiously-charged, archetypal battle of good and evil. His characters in this novel represent, through their archetypal portrayals, many facets of humanity including hope. Despite the particular setting, the novel \\"conveys archetypal situations that reside in the collective unconsciousness.\\" Additionally, this piece of Caribbean gothic reveals the power of guilt and hypocrisy both in a person and in a community, and generally reveals truths of human nature. The ghosts of colonialism are more subtle, but the instability and struggle for identity is clear to the reader. The Book of Night Women (2009) In The Book of Night Women, James challenges the traditional slave narrative by presenting a protagonist (Lilith) who approaches her enslavement with complex duality, despite the constant description of antagonism between slaves and masters on a plantation in Jamaica. Lilith hates the masters, but much of the novel deals with how she \\"aspires to obtain a privileged stature within plantation society by submitting to the sexual subjugation of a white overseer, Robert Quinn\\". This is additionally challenged by Lilith and Robert's \\"love\\", leading the reader to question the limits of love and relationships. James intends to have readers root for Robert and Lilith, but then catch themselves, as Robert Quinn has a reputation as a brutal, violent overseer—even ordering Lilith to be severely whipped. The situation for the reader is further complicated because Quinn is Irish, another population that was looked down upon during the time period. While this at times brings him sympathy, his whiteness overshadows his Irishness. Additionally, the novel explores the complexity of what it is to be a woman, with some characters having deep connections to Obeah and Myal spiritualism. The female slaves are portrayed as strong-willed and intelligent, while the male slaves are often portrayed as weak, thoughtless, and even traitorous. \\"Rape, torture, murder and other dehumanizing acts propel the narrative, never failing to shock in both their depravity and their humanness. It is this complex intertwining that makes James’s book so disturbing and so eloquent\\". The novel \\"defies hegemonic notions of empire by pointing out the explosive and antagonistic relationship between colonizers and colonized.\\" A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014) James's 2014 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings, portrays \\"a passionate, often angry account of postcolonial society struggling to balance identity and a burgeoning criminal element.\\" The novel has twelve narrators, contributing to the \\"excess\\" that Sheri-Marie Harrison explores in her article \\"Excess in A Brief History of Seven Killings\\". She explains: \\"James's rejection of a purely nationalist tradition, like that of other authors in his cohort, concretizes his critique of the ways nationalism distracts us from the increased deregulation of global capital and its production of material inequality around the globe. This disruption of privileged tropes in the interest of turning attention onto the transnational forces that structure inequality helps to explain James's use of 'a poetics of excess.' His experimentation with form functions to rework now familiar paradigms and themes that have been central to the literary imagination of postcolonial realities for a little over half a century.\\" Black Leopard, Red Wolf (2019) His most recent book, Black Leopard, Red Wolf (2019) — characterized as \\"an African Game of ThronesFeldman, Lucy (5 February 2019), \\"How Marlon James Built a New World in His 'African Game of Thrones'\\", TIME. — is the first instalment of a planned trilogy.Preston, Alex (17 February 2019), \\"Marlon James: 'You have to risk going too far'\\", The Observer. It has been described by NPR journalist Ari Shapiro as \\"an epic fantasy quest — full of monsters, sex, and violence, set in a mythic version of ancient Africa.\\"\\"Marlon James Builds A New World From Old Stories In 'Black Leopard'\\", All Things Considered, NPR, 5 February 2019. According to TIME magazine, the novel \\"joins the ranks of those by authors like Tomi Adeyemi and N.K. Jemisin, whose works push back against stereotypes about the types of figures who 'should' appear in fantasy fiction.\\"  Influences  James's influences include authors as well as musicians. In his acceptance speech for the Man Booker Prize in 2015, James explained: \\"The reggae singers Bob Marley and Peter Tosh were the first to recognize that the voice coming out our mouths was a legitimate voice for fiction and for poetry.\\" In other words, these singers empowered other artists such as James to create. In his popular 2015 essay \\"From Jamaica to Minnesota to Myself\\", published in the New York Times Magazine, James describes reading Salman Rushdie's novel Shame (1983): \\"Its prose was so audacious, its reality so unhinged, that you didn't see at first how pointedly political and just plain furious it was. It made me realize that the present was something I could write my way out of.\\" James has said that he re-read Ben Okri's 1991 novel The Famished Road while writing Black Leopard, Red Wolf: \\"Okri is such an influence on me. I’ve read Famished Road like four times.\\"  Tone and style  James's work carries a unique style, often referred to as disturbing, brutal, and violent, leading him to be compared in one review to Quentin Tarantino, who is known for his excessive use of violence in his films. James does not hold back in his graphic descriptions of sexual and violent acts, which contributes to the raw nature of his writing. \\"James does not set out to entertain, he does not want readers to be entertained by shocking events: he believes they should be rightly horrified…\\" His work is challenging and lyrical, and he often uses Jamaican Patois in dialogue, and often uses multiple dialects for different characters. His style strays from traditional and expected Caribbean Literature by \\"creating wild and risky new possibilities for thinking about the region's place in our contemporary reality.\\" James has stated that he commits offences in his writing that he would not allow his students to commit, \\"such as writing seven-page sentences.\\" James's writing has been compared to that of Toni Morrison, William Faulkner, and Gabriel García Márquez.  Reception  Reception of James's novels has been conflicted—the same elements that some critics find to be strengths, others believe are his weaknesses. The conflicting nature of how readers and reviewers respond stems from reactions to the often upfront brutality juxtaposed with the mechanical elements that James uses to tell his stories. One critic writes: \\"The linguistic and stylistic excess which dominates A Brief History of Seven Killings both elevates it and burdens it.\\" Another reviewer explained, \\"I have had conversations with fellow Caribbeanists and students in which they have used terms like 'orgiastic' and 'masturbatory' to describe James's writing.\\" When reviewing The Book of Night Women, another critic explains: \\"Rape, torture, murder and other dehumanizing acts propel the narrative, never failing to shock in both their depravity and their humanness.

While it can be applied to most high-dimensional data sets, it has been most widely used in genomic applications. It allows one to define modules (clusters), intramodular hubs, and network nodes with regard to module membership, to study the relationships between co-expression modules, and to compare the network topology of different networks (differential network analysis). WGCNA can be used as a data reduction technique (related to oblique factor analysis), as a clustering method (fuzzy clustering), as a feature selection method (e.g. as gene screening method), as a framework for integrating complementary (genomic) data (based on weighted correlations between quantitative variables), and as a data exploratory technique. Although WGCNA incorporates traditional data exploratory techniques, its intuitive network language and analysis framework transcend any standard analysis technique. Since it uses network methodology and is well suited for integrating complementary genomic data sets, it can be interpreted as systems biologic or systems genetic data analysis method. By selecting intramodular hubs in consensus modules, WGCNA also gives rise to network based meta analysis techniques.  History  The WGCNA method was developed by Steve Horvath, a professor of human genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and of biostatistics at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and his colleagues at UCLA, and (former) lab members (in particular Peter Langfelder, Bin Zhang, Jun Dong). Much of the work arose from collaborations with applied researchers. In particular, weighted correlation networks were developed in joint discussions with cancer researchers Paul Mischel, Stanley F. Nelson, and neuroscientists Daniel H. Geschwind, Michael C. Oldham (according to the acknowledgement section in). There is a vast literature on dependency networks, scale free networks and coexpression networks.  Comparison between weighted and unweighted correlation networks  A weighted correlation network can be interpreted as special case of a weighted network, dependency network or correlation network. Weighted correlation network analysis can be attractive for the following reasons: * The network construction (based on soft thresholding the correlation coefficient) preserves the continuous nature of the underlying correlation information. For example, weighted correlation networks that are constructed on the basis of correlations between numeric variables do not require the choice of a hard threshold. Dichotomizing information and (hard)-thresholding may lead to information loss. * The network construction is highly robust results with respect to different choices of the soft threshold. In contrast, results based on unweighted networks, constructed by thresholding a pairwise association measure, often strongly depend on the threshold. * Weighted correlation networks facilitate a geometric interpretation based on the angular interpretation of the correlation, chapter 6 in. * Resulting network statistics can be used to enhance standard data-mining methods such as cluster analysis since (dis)-similarity measures can often be transformed into weighted networks; see chapter 6 in . * WGCNA provides powerful module preservation statistics which can be used to quantify whether can be found in another condition. Also module preservation statistics allow one to study differences between the modular structure of networks. * Weighted networks and correlation networks can often be approximated by \\"factorizable\\" networks. Such approximations are often difficult to achieve for sparse, unweighted networks. Therefore, weighted (correlation) networks allow for a parsimonious parametrization (in terms of modules and module membership) (chapters 2, 6 in ) and .  Method  First, one defines a gene co-expression similarity measure which is used to define the network. We denote the gene co-expression similarity measure of a pair of genes i and j by s_{ij}. Many co-expression studies use the absolute value of the correlation as an unsigned co-expression similarity measure, s^{unsigned}_{ij}=cor(x_i,x_j) where gene expression profiles x_{i} and x_{j} consist of the expression of genes i and j across multiple samples. However, using the absolute value of the correlation may obfuscate biologically relevant information, since no distinction is made between gene repression and activation. In contrast, in signed networks the similarity between genes reflects the sign of the correlation of their expression profiles. To define a signed co-expression measure between gene expression profiles x_{i} and x_{j} , one can use a simple transformation of the correlation: s^{signed}_{ij}=0.5+0.5 cor(x_i,x_j) As the unsigned measure s^{unsigned}_{ij} , the signed similarity s^{signed}_{ij} takes on a value between 0 and 1. Note that the unsigned similarity between two oppositely expressed genes (cor(x_i,x_j) = -1) equals 1 while it equals 0 for the signed similarity. Similarly, while the unsigned co-expression measure of two genes with zero correlation remains zero, the signed similarity equals 0.5. Next, an adjacency matrix (network), A=[a_{ij}] , is used to quantify how strongly genes are connected to one another. A is defined by thresholding the co- expression similarity matrix S = [s_{ij}] . 'Hard' thresholding (dichotomizing) the similarity measure S results in an unweighted gene co- expression network. Specifically an unweighted network adjacency is defined to be 1 if s_{ij}>\\\\tau and 0 otherwise. Because hard thresholding encodes gene connections in a binary fashion, it can be sensitive to the choice of the threshold and result in the loss of co-expression information. The continuous nature of the co-expression information can be preserved by employing soft thresholding, which results in a weighted network. Specifically, WGCNA uses the following power function assess their connection strength: a_{ij} = (s_{ij})^\\\\beta , where the power \\\\beta is the soft thresholding parameter. The default values \\\\beta=6 and \\\\beta=12 are used for unsigned and signed networks, respectively. Alternatively, \\\\beta can be chosen using the scale- free topology criterion which amounts to choosing the smallest value of \\\\beta such that approximate scale free topology is reached. Since log (a_{ij}) = \\\\beta log (s_{ij}) , the weighted network adjacency is linearly related to the co-expression similarity on a logarithmic scale. Note that a high power \\\\beta transforms high similarities into high adjacencies, while pushing low similarities towards 0. Since this soft-thresholding procedure applied to a pairwise correlation matrix leads to weighted adjacency matrix, the ensuing analysis is referred to as weighted gene co-expression network analysis. A major step in the module centric analysis is to cluster genes into network modules using a network proximity measure. Roughly speaking, a pair of genes has a high proximity if it is closely interconnected. By convention, the maximal proximity between two genes is 1 and the minimum proximity is 0. Typically, WGCNA uses the topological overlap measure (TOM) as proximity. which can also be defined for weighted networks. The TOM combines the adjacency of two genes and the connection strengths these two genes share with other \\"third party\\" genes. The TOM is a highly robust measure of network interconnectedness (proximity). This proximity is used as input of average linkage hierarchical clustering. Modules are defined as branches of the resulting cluster tree using the dynamic branch cutting approach. Next the genes inside a given module are summarize with the module eigengene, which can be considered as the best summary of the standardized module expression data. The module eigengene of a given module is defined as the first principal component of the standardized expression profiles. Eigengenes define robust biomarkers, and can be used as features in complex machine learning models such as Bayesian networks. To find modules that relate to a clinical trait of interest, module eigengenes are correlated with the clinical trait of interest, which gives rise to an eigengene significance measure. Eigengenes can be used as features in more complex predictive models including decision trees and Bayesian networks. One can also construct co-expression networks between module eigengenes (eigengene networks), i.e. networks whose nodes are modules. To identify intramodular hub genes inside a given module, one can use two types of connectivity measures. The first, referred to as kME_i=cor(x_i,ME) , is defined based on correlating each gene with the respective module eigengene. The second, referred to as kIN, is defined as a sum of adjacencies with respect to the module genes. In practice, these two measures are equivalent. To test whether a module is preserved in another data set, one can use various network statistics, e.g. Zsummary.  Applications  WGCNA has been widely used for analyzing gene expression data (i.e. transcriptional data), e.g. to find intramodular hub genes. Such as, WGCNA study reveals novel transcription factors are associated with Bisphenol A (BPA) dose-response. It is often used as data reduction step in systems genetic applications where modules are represented by \\"module eigengenes\\" e.g. Module eigengenes can be used to correlate modules with clinical traits. Eigengene networks are coexpression networks between module eigengenes (i.e. networks whose nodes are modules) . WGCNA is widely used in neuroscientific applications, e.g. and for analyzing genomic data including microarray data, single cell RNA-Seq data DNA methylation data, miRNA data, peptide counts and microbiota data (16S rRNA gene sequencing). Other applications include brain imaging data, e.g. functional MRI data.  R software package  The WGCNA R software package provides functions for carrying out all aspects of weighted network analysis (module construction, hub gene selection, module preservation statistics, differential network analysis, network statistics). The WGCNA package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), the standard repository for R add-on packages.

At it is the city's largest park. Much of the park is wooded, providing for passive recreational opportinuties such as hiking. The southwestern section of the park, nearest to North Street, is developed, with ballfields, a bath house, pond, and Springside House, an Italianate mansion whose early construction dates to c. 1856. Some of the parklands are also used for the Hebert Arboretum. Through the 1960s the City of Pittsfield operated a ski rope tow and provided ski lessons at the park. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History Springside House In the early 19th century, the area that is now Springside Park was farmland, much of which belonged to the Strong family. In 1808, Asahel Strong sold water rights to springs on land that may now be in the park to the Pittsfield Water Works Company. Sometime in the late 1840s or early 1850s, Abraham Burbank established a gentleman's farm on land purchased from a Strong descendent. A portion of Burbank's land, including the house, was sold in the 1850s to a private boarding school operated by Charles Abbott. Around this time, Burbank apparently began construction on Elmhurst, the building that is now called Springside House. It was further enlarged in the 1870s by John Davol, a businessman who purchased Burbank's farm in 1872. It was acquired by Clarence Stephens in 1904, and became part of Springside Park in 1938. The formation of the park was spearheaded by former mayor Kelton Miller, who began purchasing land near the Burbank/Davol/Stephens estate in 1908. He and his wife Eva donated land south and east of the estate to the city in 1910, and continued to make land donations afterward. The Stephens estate was acquired by Miller's sons in 1938 and donated to the city, and the city also acquired from the William Alton Pierce family a 39 acre \\"cow pasture\\" on the north side of the estate the same year, making the park over in size. Development of the park's infrastructure began in the years following this acquisition. The park was reduced in size when the nearby school was built, but the city compensated by making additional land acquisitions, eventually bringing the park to its present size.

The law's numbers are then used to compare the efficacy of different legal systems, and how these numbers correlate with particular goals such as economic growth or employment. History The term leximetrics was first coined by Robert Cooter and Tom Ginsburg, drawing on their comparative law studies.“Leximetrics: Why the Same Laws are Longer in Some Countries than Others” (2003), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=456520 The first attempt to assign numerical values to rules in different legal systems, to evaluate their perceived strength or weakness, was made by a group of finance economists called Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez de Silanes, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny. In work that was commissioned by the World Bank, and with views consistent with the Washington Consensus, they collated information on a select number of shareholder rights. They believed they could show that the protection of shareholder rights correlated with, and probably caused, more efficient market economies. They also argued that, according to their legal origins theory, common law systems were better at protecting shareholder rights than civil law jurisdictions, on the whole. With other people involved later, these studies were extended to labour law, and constitutional law protections for property, and other issues which concerned the researchers. La Porta, Lopez, Shleifer and Vishny's studies, although picked up by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, were widely criticised for failing to disclose their methodology adequately, misunderstanding the law in multiple jurisdictions, oversimplifying complex legal problems, and bias. Before long other researchers, such as those at the Cambridge Judge Business School, Centre for Business Research, led by Simon Deakin, began undertaking parallel studies. These sought to do the same work but more accurately, and usually came to the opposite conclusions. For example, it was found that when measured more accurately, and over time, common law countries were not outperformed by civil law countries in various shareholders' protection measures, and that labour law was in fact positive for economic development in most cases. The field of work has continued to attract substantial academic interest. Methodology and criticism A common criticism of leximetrics, particularly among the legal profession, is that it fails to capture the complexity of legal issues, and by reducing the \\"strength\\" of laws to a numerical value, may well miss the practical effects of the law. For example, as the corporate law Professor John C. Coffee has put it, put it, public enforcement of directors' duties remains necessary despite the work carried out by Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez de Silanes, Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny, because it is more effective. \\"This is a description,\\" says Coffee, \\"quite at odds with LLS and V, who favor private enforcement (but do not understand it)...\\"JC Coffee, 'The Law and the Markets: the Impact of Enforcement' (2007) 156(2) University of Pennsylvania Law Review 229, 304-305 Leximetric studies usually involve researchers with limited amounts of time to spend on each country's law that they examine, the researchers may or may not be lawyers, and may or may not be acquainted with the dozens of jurisdictions they study, even if the person leading the research is themselves a highly qualified lawyer. Even then, the assessment of whether a law is strong or not depends on an independent judgement. Numbers tend to indicate an objective quality, when in fact they are all subjective assessments of the relative efficacy of a law, and open to reinterpretation. Once the aggregated data and number have been determined by the researcher, and these are correlated with data on a country's economic development, it is then also criticised that no normative conclusions can be drawn. Correlations do not mean causation, and even very close correlations in the understanding of econometrics is not the same as causation. Regression analysis which shows, for example, a country raising its minimum wage has coincided exactly with a period of economic growth would neither demonstrate that a minimum wage ought to be raised in a different country. Defenders of the leximetrics methodology contend that although there may be many qualifications and limitations, the work can nevertheless be useful despite its abstracted nature. It is preferable to have some information and basis for comparison rather than none at all, and the only question is whether or not the work is carried out accurately or with integrity. The more transparent the researchers' choices are, the better the work is likely to be. As more data is released, other researchers can build on and perfect the work which is done.

It was assigned to the 52nd (Lowland) Division to replace I Lowland Brigade, RFA (T.F.) and joined the division in Egypt. The brigade was reformed as horse artillery in July 1917, redesignated as XX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (Territorial Force) and joined the Yeomanry Mounted Division (later 1st Mounted Division and 4th Cavalry Division). The brigade saw active service in World War I in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1917 and 1918. It remained in Palestine on occupation duties after the end of the war and was finally disbanded in November 1919. History Formation The pre-war Territorial Force infantry divisions were generally supported by four field artillery brigades. These were numbered I, II, III and IV within each division and consisted of three gun brigades (each of three batteries, equipped with four 15-pounder guns) and a howitzer brigade (two batteries of four 5\\" howitzers). When the 52nd (Lowland) Division was ordered to Gallipoli in May 1915, it left two of its field artillery brigades behind in the UK on the Forth Defences. III Lowland Brigade, RFA (T.F.) (1st, 2nd and 3rd Glasgow Batteries and Brigade Ammunition Column) rejoined the division in Egypt in March 1916, but I Lowland Brigade, RFA (T.F.) (1st and 2nd Edinburgh and Midlothian Batteries and Brigade Ammunition Column) proceeded to France in October 1915 where it was re-equipped with 18 pounders and joined 51st (Highland) Division. V Lowland Brigade, RFA (T.F.) was formed on 13 January 1916 at Leicester to replace I Lowland Brigade, RFA in 52nd Division. It consisted of the Essex, Hampshire and West Riding RHA Batteries and a Brigade Ammunition Column (BAC). Before departing for the Middle East, each of the batteries were re-equipped with four 18 pounders. 52nd (Lowland) Division British artillerymen loading an 18 pounder gun at Romani in 1916 The brigade embarked between 15 and 18 February 1916 at Devonport and arrived at Port Said on 2 March. It joined 52nd (Lowland) Division at El Qantara on 17 March in the Suez Canal Defences. The brigade was renumbered as CCLXIII Brigade, RFA (T.F.) on 28 May and Hampshire RHA as A Battery, Essex RHA as B Battery, and West Riding RHA as C Battery on the same date. On 15 September, the brigade was renumbered as CCLXIV Brigade, RFA (T.F.) and on 30 December back to CCLXIII Brigade, RFA (T.F.). Also on 30 December, C Battery (formerly West Riding RHA) was broken up: one section went to A Battery (formerly Hampshire RHA) and the other section to B Battery (former Essex RHA). The brigade now consisted of two batteries of six 18 pounders each. While with 52nd (Lowland) Division, the division took part in the Battle of Romani (4 and 5 August 1916) and the First (26 and 27 March 1917) and Second (1719 April 1917) Battles of Gaza. Conversion to horse artillery At the end of June 1917, arrangements were made to reform the brigade as a horse artillery brigade. On 5 July 1917, the brigade exchanged its 18 pounders for 13 pounders and was redesignated as XX Brigade, RHA (T.F.). Essex and Hampshire Batteries RHA were reformed with four 13 pounders each; West Riding Battery RHA was not reformed at this point. The brigade (with the Hampshire Battery) joined the Yeomanry Mounted Division at Khan Yunis on 5 July. Essex Battery, RHA remained with 52nd (Lowland) Division until 17 September 1917 when it joined 7th Mounted Brigade which had returned to Egypt from Salonika on 29 June. Yeomanry Mounted / 1st Mounted / 4th Cavalry Divisions Berkshire, RHA (four 13 pounders) joined the Yeomanry Mounted Division with 6th Mounted Brigade on 27 June 1917 and transferred to XX Brigade when it joined the division on 5 July 1917. Likewise, Leicestershire, RHA (also four 13 pounders) transferred from ANZAC Mounted Division on 20 June 1916 and joined the brigade on 5 July 1917. The brigade remained with the division when it was restructured and indianized as the 1st Mounted Division (from 24 April 1918) and later renamed as 4th Cavalry Division (23 July 1918). During its time with the Yeomanry Mounted Division, the division served as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. From 31 October it took part in the Third Battle of Gaza, including the Battle of Beersheba (in GHQ Reserve) and the Capture of the Sheria Position under the Desert Mounted Corps (DMC). Still with the DMC, it took part in the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 13 and 14 November and the Battle of Nebi Samwil from 17 to 24 November. From 27 to 29 November, it withstood the Turkish counter-attacks during the Capture of Jerusalem. Once the division was restructured and renamed, it served with the DMC for the rest of the war, taking part in the Second Transjordan Raid (30 April to 4 May 1918) and the Final Offensive, in particular the Battle of Megiddo (19 to 25 September) and the Capture of Damascus (1 October). The 4th Cavalry Division remained in Palestine on occupation duties after the end of the war. However, demobilization began immediately and most of the British war time units had left by May 1919. The Berkshire and Leicestershire batteries were reduced to cadre in Egypt on 14 October 1919. The Headquarters was disbanded on 2 November 1919.

In 1936, its creator, Giovanni Dalmasso, stated that the grape was a crossing of two Vitis vinifera Piedmontese varieties, Nebbiolo and Dolcetto, but DNA profiling in 2009 showed that the French wine grape Chatus and Dolcetto were the parent vines.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 1110-1111 Allen Lane 2012 History and relationship to other grapes Valentino nero was created by the Italian grape breeder Giovanni Dalmasso at the Conegliano research center in the Veneto region in 1936. When Dalmasso released the variety, he claimed that it was a crossing of Nebbiolo (a grape notable for its use in Barolo and Barbaresco) and Dolcetto (another Piedmontese variety). The grape was officially approved for the use in Italian wine production in 1977. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis showed that the \\"Nebbiolo\\" used to sire Valentino was not the notable Nebbiolo grape of Barolo but rather an obscure French grape from the Ardèche region, Chatus, that is known as Nebbiolo di Dronero in the Piedmont region. While Dolcetto was still confirmed to be one of the parent varieties, Valentino nero's parentage of Chatus x Dolcetto makes it a full sibling to the Veneto wine grape Passau and San Martino. Wine regions The Ardèche region in France where Valentino nero's other parent variety, Chatus, originated While Valentino nero was first created in the Vento region, today it is almost exclusively found in the Piedmont region with very limited plantings.

He is known for designing and building the dam and textile mill complex in Lawrence, Massachusetts.  Biography  Charles Storer Storrow was born in Montréal, Canada, on March 25, 1809. From age 9 to 15 he attended Collége Royal de Bourbon (now Lycée Condorcet) in Paris, France, where his father had a business. In 1824 he returned to America and completed his secondary education at the Round Hill School. He entered Harvard College as a sophomore in 1826 and graduated at the top of his class in 1829. His thesis was entitled Of the Celestial Motions. On the advice of America's leading civil engineer at the time, Loammi Baldwin, he returned to Paris and spent two years (1830-1832) as an auditeur libre at École des Ponts et Chaussées where he studied hydraulics under Gaspard de Prony and applied mechanics under Claude-Louis Navier. Returning to America in 1832, Storrow joined the engineering staff of the Boston and Lowell Railroad and went on to become the railroad's business agent in 1836. In 1845 Storrow left the Boston and Lowell to become the chief engineer at the Essex Company, a company organized to harness the water power of the Merrimack River downstream from Lowell, Massachusetts. Storrow designed and built the Great Stone Dam across the Merrimack river, canals to distribute the water, several large textile mills, and a city, Lawrence, to house the mill workers. He came up with the idea to make roads that go to the mills in Lawrence, allowing him to become the first mayor of Lawrence in 1853. Storrow's book, A Treatise on Water-Works for Conveying and Distributing Supplies of Water; with Tables and Examples, introduced American civil engineers to the mathematical theory of hydraulics and put America hydraulic engineering on a strong scientific basis. Storrow also authored an extensive report on the Hoosac Tunnel and contributions to Lowell Hydraulic Experiments, a book by his protégé, James Bicheno Francis. James J. Storrow, after whom Boston's Storrow Drive is named, was Charles Storrow's grandson.

Her character was conceived by showrunner Joe Weisberg and is portrayed by Keri Russell. Elizabeth is a KGB agent who, with her husband Philip (Matthew Rhys), is an illegal, posing as a travel agent in Washington D.C. Character history Background Elizabeth was born Nadezhda in Smolensk, the daughter of a coal miner and a bookkeeper for the local Communist Party committee. Her family suffered great privation both during and after the Great Patriotic War, in which her father was killed during fighting in Stalingrad. Elizabeth grew up believing her father to be one of the honored war dead, until her mother revealed that he had actually been shot as a deserter. When she was 14 her mother was bedridden with diphtheria, forcing Elizabeth to nurse her while still attending school. As a teenager, the KGB approached Elizabeth as a candidate for the Illegals Program. Although prohibited from telling anyone, Elizabeth surreptitiously managed to consult with her mother about her decision, who unhesitatingly told her that she must do her duty for her motherland. She trained to become an undercover agent until the age of 22. During this time, she was raped by one of her captains in the KGB, Timoshev. In 1962, Elizabeth and fellow KGB agent \\"Phillip Jennings\\" (Mischa) were assigned to each other to pose as husband and wife in America. In 1965 they move to America under false identities and take up work in a travel agency. Elizabeth meets and recruits civil rights activist Gregory to the KGB and has an ongoing affair with him. She gives birth to her and Phillip's first child, Paige, in 1967, and their second child, Henry, in 1970. Season one In 1981, Elizabeth Jennings lives with her husband Philip in suburban Falls Church, Virginia. They are revealed to be a pair of sleeper agents working for the KGB. They have two U.S.-born children, Paige and Henry, both of whom are completely unaware of their parents' true identities. The Jenningses run a small travel agency in Dupont Circle as a cover for their illegal activities. After a failed forced exfiltration, Elizabeth and Philip kidnap Timoshev, a defected KGB agent, who raped Elizabeth when she was in training. At the time of Timoshev's kidnapping, counter-intelligence FBI agent Stan Beeman moves next door, causing Philip to suggest defecting themselves. Elizabeth declines and Philip murders Timoshev when he finds out he raped her. Despite a marriage arranged by the KGB, Elizabeth tells Philip that she is beginning to feel love for him for the first time in their 16-year relationship and they try to become a real married couple. However, Philip is hurt upon discovering Elizabeth had an ongoing affair with Gregory Thomas (Derek Luke), a black militant. After planting a bug in Caspar Weinberger's study, the Jenningses listen for vital intelligence. When the KGB begin to suspect a mole in their midst, they send operatives posing as FBI agents to kidnap and torture Elizabeth and Philip in order to test their loyalty. Elizabeth is hurt and angry that the people to whom she has devoted her life could treat her with such distrust, while Philip accuses Elizabeth of incurring the KGB's suspicions by reporting to them he had considered defecting. She denies this, admitting only that she had told their handlers that he liked living in the U.S. more than he should. Elizabeth and Philip later reconcile, but subsequently separate when Elizabeth discovers Philip had an affair with his former girlfriend, Irina. Philip moves out and into a motel. Philip accidentally murders Stan's partner, Amador, during a botched operation, which causes Gregory to fall under the suspicion of the FBI regarding his involvement in the killing. Unwilling to go along with the KGB's plan to send him out of the country, Gregory spends a final night with Elizabeth and then commits suicide by cop to deflect attention from her. Later, Elizabeth's mentor, General Victor Zhukov, is assassinated under orders from a CIA officer, whom Elizabeth and Philip track down. Elizabeth brings him into a bathroom for sex, and she and Philip kidnap him and bring him to a warehouse, but Elizabeth, still upset about Zhukov's death, decides to let him go, whereupon the CIA officer gives the FBI a vague description of her and Philip. Elizabeth learns from her informant, Sanford Prince, that he has secured a meeting with a United States Air Force colonel who has information on the SDI project. The FBI learn of the bug in Weinberger's study and provide the KGB with disinformation through it. Philip is unsure of the meeting with the Colonel and attends in her place (against her wishes), while Elizabeth goes to pick up the Weinberger tape. Philip finds out Elizabeth's mission is compromised and picks her up just as the FBI are closing in on her, but she is shot by Stan when the FBI begin firing on them. After Elizabeth's surgery, she tells Philip in Russian to \\"come home\\". Season two Elizabeth recovers at a remote safe-house and returns home in time for Henry's 11th birthday. However, the celebration is cut short, as she and Philip must go meet the Connors, another spy couple, but promise a \\"birthday weekend\\" at an amusement park. The Connors surprise Philip by involving him (and, unwittingly, Henry) in a supposedly safe mission during their visit, handing him a key to their hotel room to rendezvous when the operation is complete. When Elizabeth and Philip find all but one of the Connors family shot to death in their room, they become paranoid. Elizabeth locks down the house and suggests Philip tries to glean information from Martha, his FBI informant. Meanwhile, Elizabeth learns that her daughter, Paige, has become deeply involved in a church that is active in liberal political causes. Elizabeth's reactions are mixed; on the one hand, she is pleased with Paige's growing awareness, but remains uncomfortable with its religious overtones. Upon discovering that her daughter has given all her savings to the church, Elizabeth punishes her by waking her up at 2 AM on a school night and forcing her to clean the house. In the season finale, Elizabeth is shocked to learn of the Center's plans to create a second generation of illegals composed of the U.S.-born children of KGB operatives indoctrinated and trained to infiltrate the American security agencies. The Connors' son, Jared, was the first to be contacted, with disastrous results—when his parents strenuously objected to his involvement in their espionage work, he killed them and his sister to protect his mission. Despite this tragedy, the Center tells the Jennings that it intends to continue with the program and that it expects them to begin grooming Paige. Both of the Jennings are horrified at first, but Elizabeth begins to warm to the idea, reasoning that Paige needs a cause to devote her life to and that she should know her parents' true identities and, by extension, her own. Personality Elizabeth grew up in poverty, and she developed a hard and icy exterior like her mother. The first 15 years of her marriage with Philip were relatively loveless. Elizabeth finally opens up to him after he kills her rapist. Initially, her newfound love for Philip is a conflict of interest to her because she has trouble constructively expressing and making sense of her own emotions. When Philip feels betrayed by her, they become dishonest with one another and briefly separate. It's only when Elizabeth is shot that she realizes how important Philip is in her life, and she realizes she can trust him with anything. She is intelligent, physically fit, attractive, and potentially sociopathic, despite her deep personal attachments. She is willing to use these qualities to manipulate people into giving her the information she needs. She is not hesitant to kill and does so often. She puts the Soviet Union and her mission before all other considerations, including her family. Even though Elizabeth struggles to find a balance between making decisions with her newfound emotion versus the logic that has gotten her so far in her career, Philip is able to help her reach a collaborative decision; as they have become close friends and confidants as the show has progressed. Paige's adolescence is challenging for Elizabeth, particularly due to Paige becoming curious about her parents' activities. Elizabeth is a protective mother, and is around for her kids when they need her most despite being absent from the house most of the day working for the KGB. Elizabeth doesn't seem to have many hobbies, but she does enjoy bowling. Casting Former Felicity star Russell spoke about the decision to work on another television series: \\"I thought the pilot script was just so interesting. It was so far from a procedural. And [originally,] I didn't know that I wanted to do it. I always say no to everything. I never want to do anything. [Laughs.] But I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I read it...and I kept trying to figure it out, because it's so not clear. It's still not clear to me. But there's so many different levels to it.\\" Reception For her portrayal, Russell has been nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Drama twice, three Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, three Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Actress in a Drama Series, one Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama, one Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television, and the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama.

It follows the life of a boy who lives in a society where almost all people his age have supernatural powers called Iris in their eyes. As the only student in the school who has no Iris at all, he must make use of his intellect to help his friends see through the incidents that keep popping up. Plot In a world where 99% of every boy and girl has a special power called Iris, Toru, who is in the 1% as a result of not having any kind of special power from a young age, lives by his motto, \\"Minimal Exposure\\" - to live without standing out. But his peaceful school life changes when he receives a certain \\"confession\\" from the school's most popular girl, Koyuki, and his motto begins to shake. Characters ; : The title character of the series, Toru is one of the few students at his school who does not have an Iris ability. He is usually ostracized by his peers and thus keeps a low profile in school. After he helps Koyuki with her situation, he begins to befriend others as he helps resolve their problems. As a child, Toru pretended to have an Iris ability to identify the Irises of his peers, but when Asahi exposed his secret, the students shunned him. ; : The heroine of the series, she is a kind and beautiful girl with the ability to discern whether someone can help her with a task by visualizing a circle or X above their head. Although she is esteemed as a school idol, she is the first to come to Toru and openly ask him out, raising suspicions and jealousy among her classmates, but actually, she wants his help to find a qualified candidate for the next student council president. When Koyuki helps her, she and the council come to the realization that she herself is the most qualified. She thanks Toru by hanging out with him as a close friend, and dragging him against his will to deal with situations only he could handle. She is one of the few people who are not bothered that Toru is an Iris Zero, and admits she is a little jealous that he can see the world without filters. She is in love with Toru even though he tries not to reciprocate for fear of tarnishing her reputation of hanging out with an Iris Zero. However, Harumi observes that they both like each other the most. ; : Yuki is Koyuki's friend who also used to be Toru's childhood friend until an incident where she reveals Toru's identity as an Iris Zero. Her Iris ability allows her to see when someone tells a lie, as indicated by the appearance of a devil's pointed tail. She aspires to become a police officer, but when her guidance counselor lies and says she would be good for that, she gets offended and slaps her, putting herself at risk of expulsion. After Toru saves her by explaining the situation, she is able to reconcile with the teacher and be more friendly towards Toru. Piroshiki notes that she detects just the honesty of the person, and that a person can be sincere but wrong about something and not sprout a tail, whereas a deceitful person would immediately show the tail. ; : Hijiri is Toru's classmate with a laid-back attitude, and Toru's only friend before meeting Koyuki. His Iris ability allows him to see when someone is close to death, in the form of butterflies that converge near the person: a swarm of butterflies would indicate that the person will die very soon. He and Toru become friends after he helps him protect a girl important to him by preventing her death upon exposing the person who was after her life. ; : Kuga is Toru's classmate who is introduced as a shy girl that joins Toru's group at a field trip. She is capable of evaluating other people's feelings using her Iris that allows her to see fairy-like wings on them whose colors vary according to their emotional state. Because of her ability, she sometimes acts selfishly, where she steals Koyuki's Japanese clothing, and then serves as an antagonist in the Iris Hunter story-line where she psychologically manipulates her peers into not using their Irises and has them think they lost their abilities. ; : Harumi is Toru's classmate and a calm and collected boy who wears glasses, who is Kuga's childhood friend and always looks after her. His Iris manifests itself in the form of a halo above someone's head with an arrow pointing to whomever the person likes, with its length indicating how much they like that person. During the Iris Hunter storyline, he tries to protect Kuga by redirecting the blame to Toru. He reveals that some years ago, he and Kuga made a promise to not abuse their powers, but after Kuga relapses, he saves her from killing herself. He has an animosity against Toru because he and Kuga had been helping their friend Houjou become more popular by having him run for Student Council President, only to be upended by Koyuki's sudden popularity. Concept and development In the afterword of volume 1, the author mentions a past idea where the protagonist could see the red strings of fate but could not fall in love. This changed to a protagonist who does not exhibit special powers among his peers who do. He does not want to stand out for fear of being bullied but acts a bit like a detective to help his friends. In a bonus chapter, the characters comment about the lack of showing underwear in the series in comparison to other titles in the magazines. In the afterword of volume 4, the author mentions that they originally planned to just make a series of one-shots with five of the main characters sketched out, but the editor wanted to stretch it out into a series. The editor also picked the title tentatively but it stuck in the final version. Media Manga The manga started serialization on 2009 but in 2012 it went on hiatus for a year and a half while Takana was hospitalized, only resuming on October, 2013. In June 2014, Digital Manga Publishing announced that it had added Iris Zero to its releases.

Many Anapithecus fossils come from the site of Rudabánya, in northern Hungary, where Anapithecus lived alongside the ape Rudapithecus'. Anapithecus hernyaki is named after Mr. Gabor Hernyák, chief geologist of the Iron Ore Works of Rudabánya. Classification and phylogeny Anapithecus belongs to the clade Pliopithecoidea, an extinct group of primates that inhabited Eurasia during the Miocene epoch (17-7 million years ago). Pliopithecoids are catarrhine primates, sharing a common ancestor, and many physical characteristics, with both apes and old world monkeys. Evolutionarily speaking pliopithecoids are considered to be a primitive side-branch of the catarrhine family tree, which diverged over 20 million years ago, prior to the split between apes and old world monkeys. Among the pliopithecoids, Anapithecus is classified as a crouzeliine. The crouzeliines are characterized by having molars with high, sharp crests and deep occlusal basins. These crests have been suggested to be indicative of folivory. Physical characteristics Anapithecus weighed approximately 15 kg, about the same size as large adult gibbon. Similar to other pliopithecoids Anapithecus had a relatively short face, broad orbits with projecting rims, low cheekbones, and a globular skull. Although similar in size to a gibbon, the jaw bone of Anapithecus is much deeper and more robust. Anapithecus is defined by a series of unique dental characteristics. Most notable among these is the distinctive system of crests found on the first lower molar. The crests form a Y shape between the cusps of the teeth (although this is not to be confused with Y-5 pattern found on the lower molars of apes). Less is known about postcranial morphology of Anapithecus, as the majority of fossils consist of teeth. Still, analyses have determined that Anapithecus was most likely a suspensory arboreal primate, which swung below from tree branch to tree branch, akin to an ape. This stands in contrast to the smaller pliopithecoids which were thought to walk atop the branches of trees, more similar to monkey. Paleoecology and life history The site of Rudabánya, at which the majority of Anapithecus fossils have been discovered, is located in north-eastern Hungary. During the late Miocene, Rudabánya was a humid subtropical forested swamp. A diverse collection of fauna have been collected from Rudabánya, including flying squirrels, tree squirrels, hamsters, weasels, beavers, reptiles, mastodons, rhinoceroses, as well as the primitive “bear-dog” Amphicyon, and the three-toed horse Hippotherium. Anapithecus also shared its habitat with the Miocene ape, Rudapithecus. Although the elongated sharp crested molars of Anapithecus suggest a folivorous diet, more rigorous analyses have determined that both Anapithecus and Rudapithecus were both primarily frugivorous. Anapithecus likely supplemented its diet with leaves, whereas Rudapithecus likely consumed pericarp fruits as a fall back. Analysis of the enamel micro-structure of Anapithecus shows that its dental development was similar in rate to that of Old World monkeys (particularly macaques). The first lower molar erupts at 1.45 months, then the second and third molars erupt at 2.2 and 3.2 years. This eruption time is faster than any living catarrhine primate of similar size.

Background When the English captured Jamaica from the Spanish in the 1655 Invasion of Jamaica, the latter freed their slaves, who fled into the mountainous forests of the interior, where they established free and independent communities, and fought a guerrilla war against the English. It is likely that these early Spanish Maroons were descended from both escaped African slaves and Taino men and women.Agorsah, E. Kofi, \\"Archaeology of Maroon Settlements in Jamaica\\", Maroon Heritage: Archaeological, Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives, ed. E. Kofi Agorsah (Kingston: University of the West Indies Canoe Press, 1994), pp. 180–1. Juan de Bolas and his Maroon community was based primarily around the town of Guanaboa Vale. The Spanish attempted to retake the island, and to this end Don Christobal de Ysasi relied on his alliance with the Spanish Maroons to secure this victory.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-17 Juan switches sides However, Governor Edward D'Oyley succeeded in persuading one of the leaders of the Spanish Maroons, Juan de Bolas, to switch sides and join the English along with his Maroon warriors. In 1660, when Ysasi realised that de Bolas had joined the English, he admitted that the Spanish no longer had a chance of recapturing the island, since de Bolas and his men knew the mountainous interior better than the Spanish and the English. Ysasi gave up on his dreams, and fled to Cuba.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796, pp. 17-20.C.V. Black, History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), p. 54. The English named two rivers and a mountain after him to commemorate his assistance in expelling the Spaniards and bringing an end to Spanish Jamaica, as well as capturing hostile Maroons. The English appointed him Colonel of the Black Militia and guaranteed his palenque land and liberties \\"for ever\\".W. Noel Sainsbury (editor), \\"America and West Indies: February 1663,\\" Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies, Volume 5: 1661-1668 War with other Maroons and Death There was at least one other group of Spanish Maroons who did not agree to terms with the English authorities, led by a Maroon named Juan de Serras. The English called this group the Karmahaly Maroons, because they came from Los Vermejales. The English colonial authorities then used de Bolas and his \\"Black Militia\\" to hunt de Serras and his Maroons.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796, pp. 17-24. De Bolas was killed in an ambush by an unaligned palenque in 1664. Some historians believe that de Bolas was killed by Maroons from the group led by de Serras. Following the death of de Bolas, his group of Black Militia Maroons faded from history, while de Serras and his community continued to trouble the English authorities for years to come.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796, pp. 25-26.  Legacy  De Bolas is mentioned in Segu, an historical novel from Guadeloupean author Maryse Condé. Jamaican novelist Victor Stafford Reid wrote an historical novel entitled The Jamaicans in 1976, and the main character was Juan de Bolas.

He supported Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, (1122–1190) in his unsuccessful struggle for supremacy over the northern Italian states and the papacy. He was also involved in a dispute over jurisdiction with the Patriarch of Grado where he was ultimately successful. Early years Ulrich was the son of Count Wolfrad I von Treffen, ruler of the town of Treffen in Austria. His mother Hemma was the daughter of Margrave Starchand. Ulrich became Patriarch of Aquileia in 1161, succeeding Pellegrino di Ortenbourg. Dispute with Grado The metropolitan sees of Aquileia and Grado had long been rivals. Their dispute dated to the invasion of the Huns, when the Patriarch of Aquileia took refuge in Grado. He brought the relics of two saints that Saint Mark the Evangelist had baptized. Grado claimed this showed that ecclesiastical authority had been transferred to the \\"new Aquileia\\". In 1024 Poppo of Treffen, patriarch of Aquileia, used force to subjugate Grado at a time when the Patriarch Ursus of Grado and the doge Otto Orseolo of Venice were in exile. He reclaimed the relics of saints Hermagoras and Fortunatus. Three years later Pope John XIX declared that Grado was just a parish of Aquileia, which was metropolitan of all Venice. However, in 1044 Pope Benedict IX recognized the Patriarch Ursus of Grado as head of the New Aquileia, demoting the prelate of Aquileia to bishop of Friuli. In 1053 Pope Leo IX recognized Grado as metropolitan of all of Venetia and Istria. In 1155 Pope Adrian IV granted the patriarch of Grado jurisdiction over parts of the coast of Dalmatia, causing renewed tension. Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor, aimed to bring northern Italy into his domains. Barbarossa entered Italy with his armies in 1154, and in 1161 established control of the mainland around Venice. In 1162, while Venice was involved in a war with Padua and Ferrara, Patriarch Ulrich of Aquileia attacked Grado. Ulrich led forces from the region of Friuli into Grado, which he declared to be a precinct of Aquileia. Enrico Dandolo, the Patriarch of Grado, was forced to flee to Venice. Ulrich's move was clearly part of a campaign to bring Venice under German subjugation. The doge, Vitale II Michiel, responded forcefully. He sent a powerful fleet to Grado, which he surrounded and captured. He took Ulrich prisoner and destroyed several of his castles in Friuli. He brought Ulrich and twelve of his canons back to Venice, with seven hundred captives. Eventually Pope Alexander III intervened to make a peace. The patriarch and the twelve canons were released in exchange for payment of an annual tribute of a bull, twelve pigs and 300 loaves of bread. The animals would be slaughtered in a public ceremony to commemorate the victory. This ceremony persisted as an element of the Venetian carnival for hundreds of years. Later years Ulrich II continued to support the rival popes of the emperor until late in the 1160s, when he transferred his allegiance to Alexander III. On 29 May 1176 Frederick Barbarossa was defeated at the Battle of Legnano. On 24 July 1177 Sebastiano Ziani, the doge of Venice, and Ulrich II von Treven escorted the emperor from San Nicolò al Lido into Venice, where he met the pope and was reconciled in an emotional public scene in front of St Mark's Basilica. The Treaty of Venice, ratified on 1 August 1177, temporarily resolved the differences between the emperor, the papacy and the north Italian city-states of the Lombard League. The emperor formally acknowledged Pope Alexander III as pope. Ulrich II, as a confidant of both the pope and the emperor, had been instrumental in reconciling the two and healing the division in the church. For this, Frederick confirmed and extended the secular jurisdiction of the patriarchate of Aquileia. In 1177 Alexander III confirmed that Aquileia had metropolitan authority with jurisdiction over sixteen bishoprics. On 24 July 1180 Patriarch Dandolo of Grado agreed to a final and formal resolution of the ancient disputes with the patriarchate of Aquileia. The patriarchate of Grado arose in the VI century from the patriarchate of Aquileia, and separated from it due to a theological conflict. Since 1105 it was actually based in Venice and the see was under Venetian control (in 1451 it became the \\"Patriarchate of Venice\\"). In 1420 Venice defeated militarily and occupied the core lands of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and from then on the Patriarchate was under their control, both for secular and ecclesiastical matters. The Patriarchate of Aquileia ended formally in 1751 with the 6 July bull Injunctio Nobis by pope Benedict XIV. In the presence of Alexander III and Ulrich II of Aquileia, Dandolo renounced his claims to the disputed dioceses in Istria and to the relics and treasures that Poppo of Aquileia had taken from Grado at the start of the 11th century. Ulrich died in 1181. He was succeeded by the Patriarch Goffredo di Hohenstaufen.

A party of Polish insurgents commanded by Marian Langiewicz, heading towards the border with Austrian Galicia, clashed with units of the Imperial Russian Army. After the Battle of Malogoszcz, Polish insurgents with Langiewicz reached on March 3 the Pieskowa Skala Castle, where they decided to rest. On the same day Langiewicz, who was military leader of the districts of Krakow and Sandomierz, issued an appeal to the residents of Austrian Poland. Polish insurgents were followed by three Russian units, who surrounded Pieskowa Skala. The Russians were stationed in Olkusz, Miechow and Myszkow. In the night of March 3/4, the Russians carried out a surprise attack on those rebels who slept in a building outside of the castle. Alarmed, the insurgents fought them, losing 2 men and then retreating from Pieskowa Skala. Those who failed to withdraw were killed by the Russians, and the castle itself was ransacked. In the morning of March 4 the clash continued, as more Russian troops arrived to the area of Pieskowa Skala, chasing the insurgents, who tried to escape towards nearby Galicia. Among those insurgents who were killed in the battle was a Ukrainian revolutionary, Andrij Potebnia. Another skirmish at Pieskowa Skala took place on August 15, 1863, when 400 Polish insurgents commanded by Count Krukowiecki attacked a Russian infantry company.

Early life Born on 2 September 1824 at 3 Gray's Walk, Lambeth, he was a younger son (in a family of 13 children) of Joseph Ebsworth and Mary Emma Ebsworth, writer for the stage; Thomas Woodfall, son of Henry Sampson Woodfall, was his godfather. In 1828 the family moved to Edinburgh. At 14 Ebsworth entered the board of trustees' school of art, where he studied successively under Charles Heath Wilson, Sir William Allan, and David Scott. In 1848 he went to Manchester to serve as chief artist to Faulkner Bros., a firm of lithographers who were busy with railway plans during the Railway Mania. He soon left for Glasgow, where he became a master at the School of Design. In July 1853 Ebsworth started on a solitary walking tour through central Europe and Italy. He returned to Edinburgh in 1854, and busied himself until 1860 with painting, engraving, and writing prose and verse for the press. Clergyman and scholar Then his plans changed; and Ebsworth matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1864 and M.A. in 1867. On 31 July 1864 he was ordained deacon, and in 1868 priest. He was successively curate of Market Weighton (1864-5), of St. Stephen's, Bowling, near Bradford (1866-7), and of All Saints (1868-9) and Christ Church (1870-1), both in Bradford. In January 1871 Ebsworth became vicar of Molash near Ashford. The parishioners were few and poor, and he raised money outside the parish to build a vicarage. Most of his time at Molash was spent on literary work, and research in the British Museum. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1881. Last years In 1894 Ebsworth retired from Molash vicarage to live privately at Ashford. There he died on 7 June 1908; he was buried in Ashford cemetery. His library was sold in 1907. A portrait in early life was painted by Thomas Duncan. Works In 1849 Ebsworth exhibited for the first time at the Scottish Academy, sending four large water-colour views of Edinburgh. One of these pictures (the north view) he engraved privately. In 1850 he sent a picture illustrating Alfred Tennyson's Locksley Hall. Ebsworth published at Edinburgh two collections of prose and verse, Karl's Legacy (2 vols. 1867) and Literary Essays and Poems (1868). He then produced a series of reprints of popular poetic literature. In 1875, he published editions of The Westminster Drolleries of 1671 and 1672, and The Merry Drolleries of 1661 and 1670. The Choyce Drolleries of 1656 followed next year. For the Ballad Society, Ebsworth edited the Bagford Ballads from the British Museum (2 pts. 1876-8), together with the Amanda Group of Bagford Poems (1880). His major work for the Ballad Society was the completion of its edition of the Roxburghe collection of ballads in the British Museum. William Chappell had edited three volumes (1860–79); from 1879 onwards Ebsworth continued Chappell's work and published volumes iv. to ix. of the Roxburghe collections between 1883 and 1899. The separate pieces numbered 1400, and Ebsworth classified them under historical and other headings, bringing together, for example, Early Naval Ballads (1887), Early Legendary Ballads (1888), Robin Hood Ballads (1896), and Restoration Ballads (1899). Ebsworth added introductions, and notes reflecting his Tory politics, as well as original verse, and his hand woodcuts after the original illustrations. He printed in 1887, for private circulation, 150 copies of Cavalier Lyrics for Church and Crown. Other works were: *an edition of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream of 1600 (Furnivall's Facsimile Texts, 1880); *Poems by Thomas Carew (1892); *Poems of Robert Southwell (1892); and *Samuel Butler's Hudibras (1892, 3 vols.). With Julia H. L. De Vaynes, Ebsworth edited The Kentish Garland (2 vols. 1881-2). He also wrote for the Dictionary of National Biography. Family On 29 May 1865 Ebsworth married Margaret, eldest daughter of William Blore, rector of Goodmanham, East Yorkshire. She died on 18 April 1906, leaving no issue.

Synthetic antibodies include recombinant antibodies, nucleic acid aptamers and non- immunoglobulin protein scaffolds. As a consequence of their in vitro manufacturing method the antigen recognition site of synthetic antibodies can be engineered to any desired target and may extend beyond the typical immune repertoire offered by natural antibodies. Synthetic antibodies are being developed for use in research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Synthetic antibodies can be used in all applications where traditional monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are used and offer many inherent advantages over animal-derived antibodies, including comparatively low production costs, reagent reproducibility and increased affinity, specificity and stability across a range of experimental conditions. Recombinant antibodies Recombinant antibodies are monoclonal antibodies generated in vitro using synthetic genes. Recombinant antibody technology involves recovering the antibody genes from the source cells, amplifying and cloning the genes into an appropriate vector, introducing the vector into a host, and achieving expression of adequate amounts of functional antibody. Recombinant antibodies can be cloned from any species of antibody-producing animal, if the appropriate oligonucleotide primers or hybridization probes are available. The ability to manipulate the antibody genes make it possible to generate new antibodies and antibody fragments, such as Fab fragments and scFv in vitro. This can be done at the level of the whole combining site by making new combinations of H and L chains. It can also be done by mutating individual CDRs. Display libraries, commonly expressed in phage or yeast, can be analysed to select for desirable characteristics arising from such changes in antibody sequence. Non-immunoglobulin derived synthetic antibodies These molecules typically differ in structure to that of an antibody and can be generated either from nucleic acids, as in the case of aptamers, or from non- immunoglobulin protein scaffolds / peptide aptamers, into which hypervariable loops are inserted to form the antigen binding site. Constraining the hypervariable binding loop at both ends within the protein scaffold improves the binding affinity and specificity of the synthetic antibody to levels comparable to or exceeding that of a natural antibody. Common advantages of these molecules compared to use of the typical antibody structure include a smaller size, giving improved tissue penetration, rapid generation times of weeks compared to months for natural and recombinant antibodies and cheaper costs.  Affimer proteins Affimer proteins are small robust affinity reagents, with a molecular weight of 12-14kDa. They are engineered to bind to their target proteins with high affinity and specificity and as such are a member of the synthetic antibody family. The Affimer protein scaffold is derived from the cysteine protease inhibitor family of cystatins. Within the protein scaffold there exist two variable peptide loops and a variable N-terminal sequence that provide a high affinity binding surface for the specific target protein. Affimer binders have been produced to a large number of targets including ubiquitin chains, immunoglobulins and C-reactive protein for use in a number of molecular recognition applications. Affimer technology has been commercialised and developed by Avacta Life Sciences, who are developing Affimer binders as reagents for research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.  Applications Synthetic antibodies have shown their utility in a number of applications. Their use within the field of research lies predominantly in the life sciences as reagents for protein capture and as protein inhibitors. Within diagnostics they have been utilised in applications ranging from infection and cancer screening to mycotoxin detection in grain samples. Synthetic antibodies are currently the fastest growing class of therapeutics.

Also referred to in the US Navy diving Manual as compression pains. Compression arthralgia has been recorded as deep aching pain in the knees, shoulders, fingers, back, hips, neck and ribs. Pain may be sudden and intense in onset and may be accompanied by a feeling of roughness in the joints. Onset commonly occurs around 60 msw (meters of sea water), and symptoms are variable depending on depth, compression rate and personal susceptibility. Intensity increases with depth and may be aggravated by exercise. Compression arthralgia is generally a problem of deep diving, particularly deep saturation diving, where at sufficient depth even slow compression may produce symptoms. Peter B. Bennett et al. showed that the use of trimix could reduce the symptoms. Fast compression (descent) may produce symptoms as shallow as 30 msw. Saturation divers generally compress much more slowly, and symptoms are unlikely at less than around 90 msw. At depths beyond 180m even very slow compression may produce symptoms. Spontaneous improvement may occur over time at depth, but this is unpredictable, and pain may persist into decompression. Symptoms may be distinguished from decompression sickness as they are present before starting decompression, and resolve with decreasing pressure, the opposite of decompression sickness. The pain may be sufficiently severe to limit the diver's capacity for work, and may also limit travel rate and depth of downward excursions. Mechanism The mechanism of compression arthralgia is not known. Treatment The symptoms generally resolve during decompression and require no further treatment.

All fifty states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Texas voters chose 29 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Texas was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with incumbent Vice President and former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Texas, with nearly all of the electorate voting for either the Democratic or Republican parties, and only three candidates formally appearing on the ballot. The vast majority of counties in Texas voted mainly for the Republican candidate, a particularly strong turn out in this typically conservative leaning state. This is one of the last elections where many rural counties in the Texas Panhandle voted Democratic, especially near Dickens County. There is also one of the last elections with prominent Democratic strength in East Texas. Texas weighed in for this election as 5 points more Republican than the national average. , this is the last time El Paso County voted for a Republican presidential candidate. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Texas with a resounding 27 point sweep-out landslide. This election, aided by having Texas native George H. W. Bush on the ticket, established Texas as voting reliably Republican during presidential elections. The recently Democratic-leaning state of Texas, had, for the previous two decades been making a transition toward the Republican party, which was solidified under Reagan and Bush into the Republican stronghold seen during the subsequent decades. The election results in Texas are also reflective of a nationwide re-consolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American South at large, as Reagan did. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\"Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this claim to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Texas, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with the Soviet Union, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan’s 1984 landslide victory, in Texas and elsewhere.Reagan delivering his acceptance speech at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas.

Her skills are unmatched but her stubbornness and tough exterior tend to hold back her personal relationships. When we first meet Mercy she is scraping by on bounties from tracking down criminals the over-taxed police can’t reach. As the series progresses, Mercy's journeys carry her farther from her home city into blasted wastelands, other cities and the stars. As her world expands, she becomes aware of the forces that shape her role in the greater playing field of interstellar human society. In the midst of this morally ambiguous and complex universe, Mercy gets the sense that she has a larger role to play. Molly Sundowner Mercy’s best friend and owner of a modest music store in New Gelaph. Molly is self-possessed and blessed with a generous outlook on life—something she tries, often unsuccessfully, to transfer to the stony Mercy. On the surface, they seem oddly matched, but ultimately no one is more important to the emotionally distant Trekker. Paul Clemmons Mercy's erstwhile boyfriend. A cop on the New Gelaph force, Paul is surprisingly emotional for an officer of the law and is hellbent on getting Mercy to open up to him. Thompson Richards An academic living in Mercy's apartment complex. He assists her with some crucial research in \\"The Trail to Scarmen's Burn\\" (Trekker #2, July 1987), but his motives seem more rooted in romantic attraction than scholarly altruism. Roger Vincent A rival Trekker who butts in on Mercy's business in \\"Rules of the Game\\" (Trekker #3, October 1987). While Roger is eager to collaborate in catching a crook, Mercy is adamant in her policy of working alone. However, when Vincent cons Mercy of her share of the bounty he jumps to the top of her hit list. The two cross paths again in \\"Vincent's Share\\" (Dark Horse Presents #21, August 1988) with unexpected results. Lt. Alex St. Clair Mercy’s uncle, a lieutenant on the New Gelaph police force. Alex is Mercy’s only surviving blood relative. He does what he can to help his headstrong and impulsive niece. Alex tends to rely on Mercy for assistance when the bureaucracy of the police force prevents him from making progress on a case. Scuf Mercy’s pet dox (a dog/fox cross breed). Scuf is becoming ancient, but remains Mercy’s only connection to her early days. Lasmusi An underworld thug, but often an ally and reliable source for Mercy. They share a mutual respect, but both know that trust can only extend so far in their world. Jason Bolt An agent of the mysterious resistance organization Rigel. Bolt and Rigel use non-lethal methods to resist the powerful government forces. Mercy dismisses their efforts quixotic, their methods naive and Bolt a hopeless idealist—yet he keeps reappearing in her life and adventures. It’s clear that Rigel has its eye on the young Trekker, regardless of her opinion of them.  Reception  In January 2013 the Trekker webcomic collection received an extensive write-up on science fiction news site io9.

A German-Jewish young woman and Polish young man fall in love and escape a Nazi concentration camp. As the film prologue notes, it is based on the true story of Jerzy Bielecki and Cyla Cybulska. Plot The film's story intercuts between a Nazi concentration camp in Poland, in 1944 and New York City in 1976. In 1944, Tomasz Limanowski, a captured member of the Polish resistance, manages to aid the resistance from inside a concentration camp, where his slave labor includes supervising distribution of loaves of bread. His resistance task in the camp has been to capture photos of the horrifying war crimes taking place and smuggle out the negatives that will reveal the crimes to the outside world. This is unknown to Hannah Silberstein, a young German Jew in the work camp with whom Tomasz is in love and who has recently discovered she is pregnant. Every night, Tomasz buys off his officemate with a bottle of vodka so that he and Hannah can be alone together in the office in which Tomasz works with the SS, and they share bread that Tomasz has stolen for them. In 1976, interwoven scenes open the story on the day that Hannah Levine, living in Brooklyn, New York with a successful husband and their grown daughter, discovers that Tomasz, who for 30 years she had believed was dead, is alive. While preparing for a celebratory dinner party for her husband and running an errand at a local dry cleaners, Hannah sees Tomasz in an interview on TV and instantly recognizes him as he shares his story about their love with the interviewer. In a daze, Hannah rushes home, experiencing reactivated trauma that she had shelved, unable to keep her mind on the evening's party and raising the concerns of her family and guests at her distractedness. She desperately calls the Red Cross that day, for the first time since 1946, when her initial search for Tomasz had led to a dead end. Cutting back to 1944, we see Tomasz implementing a plan for their salvation with the help of fellow inmates, gaining access to an SS uniform and paperwork. On the day of the escape, terrified that it is happening too quickly to be fully prepared, Tomasz dresses up as an SS officer and demands that Hannah follow him, all the while terrified that he will be exposed as a Polish prisoner. Tomasz walks her to the exit of the camp where another SS officer comments that he'd like to rape her; Tomasz barely holds his cover and coldly insists that he have Hannah first. The guard, not picking up on Tomasz's limited German, acquiesces, and Tomasz and Hannah successfully march down the road until out of sight and run off into the woods. They run for weeks, ending up in Tomasz's hometown, at his mother's house. Tomasz's mother, Stefania, does not approve of Hannah, as the latter is both German and a Jew, and furiously insists that Hannah will cause trouble for their family. Hannah, weak and distressed by the outburst, miscarries the same night that a car is ready to take Tomasz to Warsaw, where he must deliver the photos to his brother, who is in the homeland army. With no other option, Tomasz leaves Hannah in his mother's care and tells his neighbor and family friend, Janusz, to take Hannah to the home of Tomasz's sister-in-law, Magdalena, where Hannah can hide more safely. Tomasz assures Hannah he will only be gone for a few days. Tomasz winds up being gone for a long while. During her recovery at Stefania's, Hannah comes to experience the woman's full animosity when Stefania attempts to have a German officer discover Hannah, but Hannah suspects her motives and hides. Disgusted at this betrayal, Hannah leaves immediately afterward, taking a photo of Tomasz that his mother had kept framed in a place of honor. Hannah goes to Magdalena's home to wait for Tomasz but is still forced to hide from the world. When Czeslav, Tomasz's brother, returns home from Warsaw, hopes for Tomasz's return are high. However, after a month of the three living together, Czeslav comes to believe that Tomasz must be dead, a belief that Hannah refuses to accept. Things are tense but harmonious until Stefania shows up at their home, claiming that the Russians took over her home. She soon turns against Magdalena, accusing her of having brought misfortune to the family and criticizing her for letting Hannah live in the house. Shortly afterward, the Russians show up at their home and take Czeslav and Magdalena to a Soviet work camp; Stefania and Hannah are left behind. Hannah cannot stay with Tomasz's mother, knowing she cannot trust her, and believes it will be for the best if she returns home to Berlin. She trudges off in winter snow and nearly dies but for a passing Red Cross van that happens upon her. Back to 1976, Hannah has success - the Red Cross has tracked Tomasz down in Poland. She works up the courage to call him; both are in complete shock that the other has survived. Tomasz initially thinks it is a hoax, but Hannah persists. They speak briefly, and Hannah tells him for the first time that she had been pregnant, a revelation too much for her to bear herself, and she hangs up, promising to call again. A brief flashback reveals that long after Hannah returned to Berlin, Tomasz returned home to find only his mother, who told him that Czeslav and Magdalena had been sent to a work camp, and (disingenuously) that Hannah had died. Back in 1976, after a wrenching outing of her secret search that anguishes her husband and daughter, Hannah's husband encourages her to go see this man who saved her. Hannah travels to Poland to visit Tomasz, who has a grown daughter of his own and is separated from his wife. The movie ends with Hannah and Tomasz seeing each other after Hannah has just gotten off the bus and Tomasz has come by car to pick her up.

However, her research unearthed four instances of couples who escaped the camp in 1944, the year in which Remembrance is set, and she incorporated into the script some of the facts she found.

Yapets Yacopeen), born 19 April 1951, is the CEO of J&J; Design, a pleasure boat design company, based in Slovenia, which he founded in 1983, together with his brother Jernej. Jakopin is most known as a yacht concept designer.  Early life and education  Jakopin was born in 1951 in Brežice, Slovenia. The family lived in the nearby village of Leskovec pri Krškem. Japec began diving at the age of six and learned to sail by the age of 13. After graduating from the Medical school at the University of Ljubljana in 1974 he pursued an academic career at that school's Institute of Physiology and at the University Medical Centre, Department of Intensive Internal Medicine. In 1977 he obtained a master's degree in cardiology, of problems connected to cardiac arrest, also during freediving, in 1980 a PhD and in 1981 the title academic specialist in cardiology. In 1983 he resigned from his academic (and medical) career because of political issues.  Yacht design  During his academic years Jakopin spent his weekends in the Croatian seaside town of Punat building do-it-yourself boats, and later learned the charter yacht business. After leaving the medical profession in 1983 Japec, together with his younger brother Jernej, founded J&J; Design studio, for production yacht design. In 1983 they designed the Elan 31 sailing boat for the Elan sporting goods factory of Begunje, Slovenia, followed by Elan 33. Between 1983 and 1987 Elan sold 940 units of the Elan 31, Elan 33 and Elan 43, increasing its marine sales from DEM 2 million to DEM 32 million. In 1987, Japec took a marketing and sales manager job at the French sailboat and powerboat builder Jeanneau where he stayed until 1990. In the meantime J&J; Design continued designing boats for Jeanneau and several other European boatyards.  Expansion into boat development and production  In 1989 the two brothers founded Seaway, also in Slovenia, to expand J&J; Design activities to engineering, tooling and prototyping for boat manufacturers. By 2000 Seaway became the only independent company outside major yacht builders that could engage in the entire development process - from design to prototype and final moulds, and its revenue grew to 6.6 million euros. The list of clients included Bavaria, Beneteau and Jeanneau. In 2001 KD Group, the largest Slovenian private finance group, invested 3 million euros in the company, for a 50% share and a request for change of strategy to own boat production. Investment enabled the purchase of a robot for precise prototype and mould production, required by Seaway's customers and acquisition of new, larger premises for installation of the new tool. Shipman 80 carbon yacht sailing in apparent wind Seaway produced a limited number of high-class yachts and powerboats, the Shipman carbon sailboat line from 2002 and Skagen powerboat line from 2004. The Shipman 50 and Shipman 63 won the 2003 and 2006 European Boat of the Year Award at the Boot Düsseldorf boat show. In 2009 a hybrid powerboat with diesel, electric and solar propulsion was developed and produced, the 33 feet (10 m) long Greenline Hybrid 33. It also won the 2010 European Boat of the Year Award at the Boot Düsseldorf boat show. Its main appeal besides the hybrid propulsion with zero-emission and no-noise sailing was the constant availability of 110/230 VAC power for appliances. It sold 400 units by 2015, claimed to be the best-selling 10 m boat in 2010 and 2011, and was followed by larger models, GL 40 in 2011, Greenline Ocean Class 70 in 2012 and GL 48 in 2014. Greenline Hybrid 33, stern view with photovoltaic cells on the roof Hybrid technology was also applied to a Seaway's sailing boat, to the Shipman 59 Carbon, designed together with Doug Peterson and the French naval architect Guillaume Verdier. In 2014 Seaway was in no shortage of orders for boats, but the enduring credit crunch after the 2008 crisis crippled further production and in 2015 both divisions of the company went out of business.  J&J; Design revived  In the meantime Jakopin brothers reestablished J&J; Design as an independent company while the boatbuilding part of Seaway (Greenline and Shipman families) was taken over by SVP Yachts (Vladimir Zinchenko). The renewed venture continued to provide design as well as boat engineering and production process engineering for vessels from 20 to 80 feet, to major volume boatbuilders in the power and sailing area, including the Greenline builder SVP Yachts. Since 1983 J&J; Design produced over 300 designs from which 60.000 boats were built, by 63 boatbuilders in 26 countries. They won over 110 Boat of the Year, Design or Environmental awards.  Other contributions  Jakopin was engaged in promoting new ideas in naval design, especially in the area of hybrid boat propulsion and environment friendly technologies, through lectures, public presentations and work in professional associations such as the Slovenian Academy of Engineering.

It is named after Hirofumi Uzawa and was originally introduced in the context of concave programming.  Basic idea  We consider a saddle point problem of the form : \\\\begin{pmatrix} A & B\\\\\\\\\\\\ B^* & \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} b_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ b_2 \\\\end{pmatrix}, where A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. Multiplying the first row by B^* A^{-1} and subtracting from the second row yields the upper-triangular system : \\\\begin{pmatrix} A & B\\\\\\\\\\\\ & -S \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} b_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ b_2 - B^* A^{-1} b_1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, where S := B^* A^{-1} B denotes the Schur complement. Since S is symmetric positive-definite, we can apply standard iterative methods like the gradient descent method or the conjugate gradient method to : S x_2 = B^* A^{-1} b_1 - b_2 in order to compute x_2. The vector x_1 can be reconstructed by solving : A x_1 = b_1 - B x_2. \\\\, It is possible to update x_1 alongside x_2 during the iteration for the Schur complement system and thus obtain an efficient algorithm.  Implementation  We start the conjugate gradient iteration by computing the residual : r_2 := B^* A^{-1} b_1 - b_2 - S x_2 = B^* A^{-1} (b_1 - B x_2) - b_2 = B^* x_1 - b_2, of the Schur complement system, where : x_1 := A^{-1} (b_1 - B x_2) denotes the upper half of the solution vector matching the initial guess x_2 for its lower half. We complete the initialization by choosing the first search direction : p_2 := r_2.\\\\, In each step, we compute : a_2 := S p_2 = B^* A^{-1} B p_2 = B^* p_1 and keep the intermediate result : p_1 := A^{-1} B p_2 for later. The scaling factor is given by : \\\\alpha := p_2^* a_2 /p_2^* r_2 and leads to the updates : x_2 := x_2 + \\\\alpha p_2, \\\\quad r_2 := r_2 - \\\\alpha a_2. Using the intermediate result p_1 saved earlier, we can also update the upper part of the solution vector : x_1 := x_1 - \\\\alpha p_1.\\\\, Now we only have to construct the new search direction by the Gram–Schmidt process, i.e., : \\\\beta := r_2^* a_2 / p_2^* a_2,\\\\quad p_2 := r_2 - \\\\beta p_2. The iteration terminates if the residual r_2 has become sufficiently small or if the norm of p_2 is significantly smaller than r_2 indicating that the Krylov subspace has been almost exhausted.  Modifications and extensions  If solving the linear system A x=b exactly is not feasible, inexact solvers can be applied. If the Schur complement system is ill-conditioned, preconditioners can be employed to improve the speed of convergence of the underlying gradient method. Inequality constraints can be incorporated, e.g., in order to handle obstacle problems.

The Benghazi burner or Benghazi cooker was the nickname of an improvised petrol stove or brazier, used by British Army troops and their Commonwealth and Imperial allies in the Second World War, during and after the North African Campaign. The Western Desert Campaign The Benghazi burner itself consisted of a single empty steel fuel can - usually a 4 gallon (18 litre) type, known as a \\"flimsy\\" – or a biscuit tin. The sides of the top half would have some holes pierced in it, and the bottom half would be filled with sand. Petrol (gasoline) would be stirred into the sand and it would then be ignited. A second can of the same size could be placed on top and used as a cooking vessel. It was used because the standard pressure stove issued to armoured vehicle crews, known as the \\"Cooker, Portable No 2\\", was prone to blockages caused by sand. The Benghazi burner had the advantages that it was silent, fast and that empty cans, sand and fuel were readily available in the desert. The disadvantage was that it was unpredictable and the fuel would often burn out too early; it was tempting to add petrol to the hot sand with explosive results. An additional use was as a beacon to illuminate desert airstrips. The importance of the Benghazi burner in the desert campaign was, at least in part, due to the fact that the water supplied to the front line was often transported in fuel cans; the resulting foul taste could be remedied by making tea with it. Although tea drinking was a long established custom in the British Army (one account describes tea being liberally distributed on the morning of the Battle of Waterloo), the act of \\"brewing-up\\" (i.e., making tea) soon became \\"almost a ritual\\" in the desert campaign. Besides providing most of the men's hydration, the act of making and drinking tea also aided bonding and morale. One soldier recorded that morale was directly proportional to the \\"supply of brews\\" and that \\"tea had become as a drug to us\\". A battalion could use almost a hundred gallons (about 450 litres) of fuel per day in making tea. Recognising this, the British Government bought all the black tea available on the European market in 1942. The burners were also used to cook field rations; tinned corned beef - known as \\"bully beef\\" - could be fried and hardtack biscuits could be crushed and made into a kind of porridge known as \\"burgoo\\" or \\"biscuit la-la\\". During extended periods of low rations a British soldier interviewed after the war noted to have used the burner for cooking an assortment of objects saying, \\"With the right mish-mash of spices, or whatever you could get your hands on, you could turn even the vilest of rat into something edible.\\" Later developments A Churchill AVRE crew, brewing up with a Benghazi burner in November 1944, during the Liberation of the Netherlands. The burners were subsequently used during the Italian Campaign and in the North-West Europe Campaign. During Operation Market Garden at the Nijmegen Bridge American Lieutenant Colonel Tucker famously exclaimed What in the Hell are they doing? We have been in this position for over twelve hours, and all they seem to be doing is brewing tea. Why in Hell don't they get on to Arnhem?. In a British tank crew the radio operator and hull machine-gunner had the additional job of making tea whenever there was an opportunity. The sign \\"WHEN IN DOUBT BREW-UP\\" was common in the British Army. Right at the end of hostilities, the latest Centurion tank was fitted with a boiling vessel or \\"BV\\" which supplied hot water heated by the tank's electrical system.Ware, Pat (2012).

He ran only six times, winning twice, in a racing career which lasted from October 1979 until July 1980. As a three-year- old he was promoted to second after a controversial race for the 2000 Guineas but showed his best form in summer when he established himself as one of the leading milers in Europe with wins in the St James's Palace Stakes and Sussex Stakes. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and had some success as a sire of winners. Background Posse was a chestnut horse with a white star, bred in Kentucky by his owner Ogden Mills Phipps. His sire Forli was a champion in his native Argentina before becoming a successful breeding stallion in the United States. His best-known offspring was Forego, the three- time American Horse of the Year, but he was also successful in Europe with hores such as Thatch. His dam, In Hot Pursuit, bred and raced by Phipps, was a leading two-year-old the United States in 1973 when her wins included the Fashion Stakes. She produced several other winners including the Posse's Grade Three winning full-brothers Late As Usual (Swoon's Son Stakes) and Hot Rodder (Oettingen-Rennen). Phipps sent the colt to race in England where he was trained by John Dunlop at Arundel, West Sussex. Racing career 1979: two-year-old season Posse made his only appearance as a two-year-old in October 1979 when he contested the Houghton Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Starting at odds of 14/1 he produced a strong late run but showed his inexperience (\\"ran very green\\") in the final furlong and finished second, beaten two and a half lengths by the Irish-trained Night Alert with the future Epsom Oaks winner Bireme three lengths back in third. 1980: three-year-old season On his three-year-old debut, Posse was sent to Newbury Racecourse in England for the Greenham Stakes, an important trial race for the 2000 Guineas. In an exceptionally strong field for a Group Three event he finished strongly to take third, beaten a neck and half a length by Final Straw and 1979's leading juvenile Moteverdi. The Middle Park Stakes winner Known Fact finished fourth with the William Hill Futurity winner Hello Gorgeous in fifth. On 3 May Posse started at odds of 12/1 for the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile with the undefeated French colt Nureyev being made the 13/8 favourite. Eddery tracked the leaders on Posse and appeared to have a good chance three furlongs from the finish when he was badly hampered and almost fell when Philippe Paquet on Nureyev barged his was through the centre of the field to make his challenge. Posse recovered well and made up a great deal of ground in the final furlong to finish third, beaten a neck and three-quarters of a length by Nureyev and Known Fact. An inquiry by the racecourse stewards ruled that Paquet had been guilty of \\"reckless\\" riding and, under the rules of racing at the time, had no option but to disqualify the favourite and relegate him to last place. The race was awarded to Known Fact, with Posse being promoted to second. Two weeks later, Posse started 7/2 second favourite behind Monteverdi for the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh, despite having performed poorly in a training gallop. He appeared the likely winner two furlongs from the finish but eventually finished fourth behind Nikoli, Last Fandango and Final Straw, beaten less than a length. While some observers felt that Posse had failed through lack of courage, Timeform suggested that the colt had not recovered sufficiently from his exertions at Newmarket. Posse reappeared in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. Shortly before the race a half-share in the colt was sold for $1 million to the Derisley Wood Stud, despite the fact that he was still a maiden after four races. At Ascot he was again opposed by Last Fandango and Final Straw, but the lightly-raced Dalsaan was made the odds-on favourite, with Posse starting the 11/2 third choice in the betting. Eddery rode the colt with great confidence, restraining him towards the back of the field and he was still only in fifth place with a furlong and a half to run. Posse then moved up on the outside, and produced what Timeform described as a \\"dazzling turn of speed\\" to overtake Final Straw well inside the final furlong and win very easily by one and a half lengths. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July, Posse was matched against older horses for the first time, but Final Straw appeared to be his most serious opponent and he was made the 8/13 favourite. Eddery again held the colt up for a late challenge but in the straight he appeared unlikely to obtain a clear run as he was trapped on the inside. In the closing stages Posse was switched to the outside and again produced a striking burst of acceleration to catch Final Straw in the last stride and win by a head. There was considerable anticipation of a race between Posse and either Known Fact or Kris the leading miler of 1979, both of whom had missed the summer with training problems. Shortly after his win at Goodwood however, Posse contracted a respiratory infection from which he failed to recover sufficiently for him to take part in the major autumn races. He did not run again and was retired to the Derisley Wood Stud. Assessment In 1979, the independent Timeform organisation gave Posse a rating of 108 p, the \\"p\\" indicating that he was likely to make more than the normal improvement between two and three years of age. The prediction proved true as Posse was rated 130 by Timeform in 1980, seven pounds below their top-rated horse Moorestyle. In the official International Classification he was rated the fifth-best three-year-old colt in Europe behind Moorestyle, Argument, Known Fact and Nureyev, and the ninth-best horse of any age. Stud record Posse began his stud career in England where he was based for six years before being exported to Japan. Despite the fact that he had been known as a miler, Posse's offspring tended to thrive over longer distances. The best of his progeny was probably Sheriff's Star, who won the Coronation Cup and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud as a four-year-old in 1989. Other good winners included Sally Brown, Altayan (Prix Maurice de Nieuil) and Linpac West (John Porter Stakes). Through his daughter Batave, Posse was the damsire of the leading miler Bigstone. Posse was \\"put out of stud\\" in Japan on 11 January 1991.

Criticism Since taking over the loans, Erudio has faced criticism from current loan holders and also from financial commentator Martin Lewis for not being able to cope with the large volume of deferral requests and for mistakenly taking cash from loan holders' accounts. According to the Guardian, some Erudio customers have noted an attempt to change loan conditions. Whereas the SLC could only pass on details of payments in default, Erudio has written to these deferred loan holders asking them to agree to let the company pass on details to credit agencies. This potentially prevents them from taking out loans in the future. In April 2016, another error saw the company demanding repayments after it failed to send out 250,000 deferral forms, with some customers declaring themselves \\"bewildered by Erudio’s administrative problems\\".

Penny Lane was to be used to \\"turn\\" particular captives into double agents, who would be released, to penetrate terrorist organizations, and inform on them, from within.

He was first elected to the Assembly's 3rd Milwaukee County district in 1932, at which time he was in the real estate business, unseating Republican incumbent Allen Busby. He received 7,728 votes; Busby 5,234; Socialist Frank Puncer 3,757, and independent Grace Brown 165.Witte, Edwin E.; Kelly, Alice, eds. The Wisconsin blue book, 1933 Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printer, 1933; p. 553 He was a Democrat, but in the Wisconsin Blue Book for 1933 described himself specifically as a \\"Progressive Democrat\\", in a state where the term \\"Progressive\\" had a special significance. He was assigned to the standing committee on labor, serving as its chairman. Busby in turn defeated Balzer in 1934 by 65 votes, running as a candidate of the newly organized Wisconsin Progressive Party, with 4,793 votes to Balzer's 4,728, Puncer's 2,740, and Republican Bruce Randolph's 965.Ohm, Howard F.; Bryhan, Leone G., eds.

(In the 1938 election, he actually tied the Progressive, but under the existing law was seated after his name was drawn from a hat.\\"Would Contest Tie Vote Still: Luebke, Who Lost to Balzer for Assembly, Goes to Legislature Next.\\" Milwaukee Journal January 27, 1939; p. 3, col. 1) This time, he listed himself as a \\"Liberal Democrat\\" in the Blue Book. In 1940, he ran for the Wisconsin Senate as a Republican, but lost in the primary. He ran as a write-in candidate for his Assembly seat, but lost to William Luebke, the Progressive was defeated two years before, with Balzer coming in a distant fourth in a five-way race. He was elected once more in 1954 from the newly created 21st Milwaukee County Assembly district (the 3rd Ward of West Allis, the Town of Wauwatosa, and the 7th and 8th Wards of the City of Wauwatosa) as a Democrat, defeating former Republican Assemblyman Louis Hicks.

His work left the town of Seguin, Texas, with a large concentration of 19th-century concrete structures. Early years John E. Park was born in 1814, in Eatonton, Putnam County, Georgia, to James and Martha (Yandell) Park. About 1835, he married Rebecca Rosella Hubbard (1808-1877); they had seven children.Park Family Network (http://parkfamilyreunion.net/JohnEstenPark.htm) He studied at the Louisville Medical Institute in Kentucky. His interest in concrete construction may have come from familiarity with the burgeoning Louisville cement industry, spurred by the widespread use of concrete able to harden under water for dams, locks, sewers, and other construction along the Ohio River. Dr. Park took his family to Seguin, probably in 1846. There in Central Texas he found that the materials necessary for concrete production (gravel, sand, lime, and clay) were readily available. Gravel beds and sand bars occurred along the Guadalupe River. Lime could be made from limestone quarried nearby or from rocks washed down the river bottom. Caliche, thick sedimentary deposits of gravelly clay, lay so close to the surface that it was often dug to make a basement before being used in the concrete mix. By early 1847, Park had constructed a one-story hotel using concrete. This time frame can be established because the famed Texas Ranger Jack Hays was married to the hotel owner's daughter, \\"in the south room of the concrete portion of the hotel on April 29, 1847\\". The hotel then served stagecoach riders for almost 30 years. The Magnolia Hotel was probably Park's first concrete building, and it certainly is the oldest still standing. Making limecrete As a general contractor, Park also built the 1850 Guadalupe Male Academy (still standing) and the 1852 Female Department building (long lost). The non-reinforced concrete gravel-wall method promoted by Park was used in Seguin for 100 or more structures, including cisterns, walls, barns, etc., of which about 20 buildings remain extant. Park came to have imitators and competitors whose buildings are included in the total. The best known of the survivors is the Sebastopol House Historic Site, built in Greek Revival style in 1854-56. Frederick Law Olmsted passed through Seguin in the 1850s, a few years before he became famous after winning the commission to design New York's Central Park.. His dispatches to the New York Times became a book, 'A Journey through Texas'. In it he described the process: \\"A number of buildings in Seguin are made of concrete thick walls of gravel and lime, raised a foot at a time, between boards, which hold the mass in place until it is solidified. As the materials are dug from the cellar, it is a very cheap mode of construction, is neat in appearance and is said to be as durable while protected by a good roof, as stone or brick.\\" The method called 'Park's concrete', or more generically 'limecrete', utilized the natural aggregate found locally. The gravel or caliche was pulverized and mixed with sand, portions of burned lime, and water to form a workable slurry. (Clay was often added and sometimes organic materials, such as straw, horsehair, or animal bones.) Boards were constructed into a form about a foot or 18 inches wide, held together with screws or bolts, about three feet apart. The mixture was poured in \\"rounds\\", \\"pours\\", or \\"lifts\\" of about a foot to 15 inches high between the form boards, and allowed to solidify, which required about 48 hours. The bolts or screws left small voids about an inch in diameter in the hardened concrete. Pieces of hardwood approximately one inch square were used as spacers to hold the board forms apart. They were left cast in, to be used as nailers for wainscoting and trim. Then the forms were raised and the process repeated. Some of the houses were elegant mansions, notably the Col. Joseph F. Johnson Home, the Campbell House (half ruined by fire, now owned by City of Seguin), and Sebastopol. The two-story Johnson home, begun in 1847, is finished with black walnut woodwork on the doors, windows, and stairs. Other prominent buildings included churches and the courthouse. So many concrete walls were erected that some observers said Seguin was a walled city, like those in Europe in the Middle Ages. On the larger buildings, the actual physical work was done by slaves,National Register listing Sebastopol, Texas Historical Commission, Guadalupe County of course, under the supervision of men like Col. Johnson (who owned seven slaves when he began building his house), or in the case of Sebastopol, of Col. Joshua Young (who owned 17). Smaller houses could be built largely by their owners, with carpenters called in to finish the doors and windows. Later years John E. Park applied for and received several patents for concrete construction. When the Civil War came in 1861, Dr. Park served as a surgeon in Hood's Brigade. The war ended in 1865 with the South in economic chaos, and Park was living in Tennessee by 1869. John Park then returned to Austin, Texas to work with concrete again. Park became ill and died of a heart attack on April 30, 1872. For a while, others continued to build with limecrete in Seguin. But the arrival of the railroad in 1876 brought cheap lumber, brick- making equipment, and eventually Portland cement, as its manufacturing methods continued to improve. The last limecrete building erected was probably the former Baptist Church, 1877, which was demolished in 2016 after a fire. Then Seguin's era as \\"the Mother of Concrete Cities\\" drew to a close.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Voters chose 8 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Iowa was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Iowa, with over 99 percent of the electorate voting only for either the Democratic or Republican parties, though several parties appeared on the ballot. While the majority of counties turned out for Reagan, the politically volatile state of Iowa was a relatively narrow victory for him, thanks in part to the Midwest Farm Crisis of the early 1980s. The relatively weak Republican trend for this election is highlighted with the loss of Des Moines's highly populated Polk County to Mondale. Iowa weighed in for this election as 11 points more Democratic than the national average. , this is the last election in which Scott County, Black Hawk County, Linn County, and Story County voted for a Republican presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Democratic platform Mondale speaks to press on the night of his narrow primary victory in the Iowa caucuses. Des Moines, Iowa, February 2, 1984. Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice- President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970s, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide- spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Iowa by a sound 8 point margin. While Iowa typically leaned conservative prior to the 1990s, the election results in Iowa are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American Midwest at large, as Reagan did. Iowa would not be won again by the Republican Party in a presidential election until George W. Bush won in 2004. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this claim to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Iowa, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Iowa and elsewhere.

It is the type-species of the genus Lethacotyle Manter & Prince, 1953. It has been described from two specimens only by Manter & Prince in 1953;Manter, H. W. & Prince, D.

Proceedings of the Helminthological Society of Washington, 20, 105-112. of these, a single specimen, the holotype has been kept in the US National Parasite Collections and thus was the single specimen of the species, and therefore of the genus, which was available for study. Later, another species of the same genus was described. L. fijiensis has been found only off Fiji by Manter & Prince in 1953 (the material of the original description, hence the Latin species name, fijiensis, meaning \\"from Fiji\\") and allegedly off Andaman Islands by Ramalingam in 1968,Ramalingam, K. 1966: A rare record of Lethacotyle (Monogenea), its post-oncomiracidial larva with observation on distribution.

Male copulatory organ of Lethacotyle fijiensis The two specimens of the original material of L. fijiensis are 3.156 and 3.759 millimetres in length. The body is elongate, flat, there are numerous testes and a single ovary. The copulatory organs include a sclerotised vagina and male copulatory organ, comprising a ring of 24-25 spines which are 24 µm in length. The length of the spines of the male copulatory apparatus is the main diagnosis character of the species, which allows its separation from L. vera, the only other species of the genus. The posterior part of the body of L. fijiensis is asymmetrical. It bears a terminal lappet which is striated, and there are no clamps - this is a characteristic of the genus Lethacotyle.

The characters also appear in the anime series The Qwaser of Stigmata, The Qwaser of Stigmata II, and an OVA episode The Qwaser of Stigmata: Portrait of the Empress all derived from the manga series.  Characters   Main characters  = Athos = ;: :Also known as . He is the main protagonist. Tomo literally stumbles over the Russian born Alexander during her home commute with Mafuyu after a particularly difficult school day. After Mafuyu and Tomo nurse him back to health, Alexander wastes no time demonstrating his powers as a Qwaser with the element of Iron as he stalemates and eventually vanquishes the Magnesium Qwaser with such capabilities as forming an enormous black scythe that is at least twice his size along with vibrating the atoms in the iron to generate the immense heat necessary to forge alloys of iron without the need for an external blast furnace. Besides the hostile heretic Qwasers whose neutralization Athos charges him, Alexander is very austere with anyone that decides on her own to refer to him as »Sasha« and has a difficult time adhering to the social mechanics of Japanese society much to Mafuyu's frustration in the early going. Sasha's primary vendetta with the Adepts is the murder of at the hands of the Aurum (Gold) Qwaser who exiled him with a large scar on the left side of his face shaped like an inverted Eastern Cross that tends to bleed in response to Sasha's excitement during battle -- the acme of which characterized by Sasha's left eye becoming red and the scar glowing prior to bleeding heavily during power-down. Driven by his bitter prologue with the Adepts and the parallels that he sees between Tomo and Olja, Sasha's ferocity reaches its zenith when the Adepts target Tomo for her high- quality soma; during his time with Mafuyu, Sasha comes to realize the infinite value of human life as he demonstrates a copious contempt for the Adepts endangering innocent people. Aside from the comedy of refracting Miyuri's persecution to her detriment and the situational remarks in Russian (though the translation is so-so and the pronunciation is very poor), Sasha is shocked to find that Mafuyu gives as good as she gets when he obdurately ignores the social conventions of human civilization and forces him to partake her consummate cooking -- particularly when it is his favorite dish borscht. Over the course of the series, Sasha's arsenal expands from his trademark scythe and kunai to a katana-like sword he wields in tandem; even though he rejects the prospect in the early going, Sasha and Mafuyu begin to become attracted to each other even as they deny it when confronted about the prospect. He was involved in the most serious confrontations that happened in the series, the last one being the one against Shin'ichiro Ōtori, where he managed to reach the 4th (on a scale of eight) grade of elemental control. Nevertheless, despite realizing that he is in love with Mafuyu, Sasha leaves her side to train himself in order to confront the Golden Tyrant, not only for the sake of avenging his guardian, but to stop his plans. ;: :Also known as . Reeling from a particularly harsh riposte from Sasha as he again rejects her overtures, Miyuri drags Hana along in her scheme to wield the newly arrived Ekaterina as a means of restoring social homeostasis with Mafuyu unaware that Ekaterina is merely being an authentic actress to secure herself a readily available supply of soma to fuel her copper-based powers as a Qwaser that are usually manifested through her extremely versatile gynoid guardian Anastasia that has the capability to channel electricity, concurrently constrain multiple assailants, manhandle adversaries physiologically impossible for a human being, and create copper objects from scratch. When not constricting and cleaving apart her adversaries, the ten-year-old Russian-born Ekaterina devotes her energies to visiting unto her Maria Magdalen partner Hana Katsuragi several BDSM activities along with the age-appropriate activities expected of young children. Perhaps because of the following she has in the student body of the St. Mihailov Elementary School of being their queen due to her doll-like features and childish demeanor, Ekaterina has also taken to attempting to subjugate her fellow comrade-in-arms Sasha who she almost defeated when the two Qwasers first met. One interesting fact about Ekaterina is that she is often hinted to have deep connections with the late Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his family, the last monarch of Russia, and in fact, it was hinted briefly that she herself could be related to the imperial princess Anastasia and Tsar's wife, Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna, or that she could in fact be the late Tsarita herself. It was later revealed that she has no relations to the late Tsar's family and that her grandmother who had dementia told her this after her mother had abandoned her. ;: :Assisting her master Shin'ichiro Ōtori with nursing Mafuyu back to health after literally plunging into their lives, the tomboyish Elizabeth, nicknamed Lizzie, quickly bonds with Mafuyu because the two are orphans that engage in boy activities such as kendo and swordplay -- the latter case being how Elizabeth wields her titanium-based powers as a Qwaser. As the helium-wielding Adept disciple Qwasers are shocked to learn, Elizabeth primarily wields a massive double- handed greatsword she calls Excalibur whose every swing paralyzes her enemies with an acoustic disturbance prior to cleaving right through them. Ignoring the fact that she devours beef stew with the same zeal, Elizabeth loves to make fun of Sasha's affinity for borscht along with his Russian origins as a \\"northern savage\\". This rivalry and her loyalty to Shin'ichiro drives Elizabeth to prosecute a duel with Sasha in order to buy time for Shin'ichiro's plan to draw the Aurum (Gold) Qwaser out of hiding. Shin'ichiro's final instruction for Elizabeth prior to his suicide is to fight alongside Athos with Teresa as her Maria Magdalen partner. Because her titanium sword becomes quite brittle after sustaining multiple hits, she will sometimes combine her power with other Qwasers' to make stronger titanium alloys. ;: :A Japanese boy with a wild look and an aggressive personality, not to mention something of a womanizer, he confronted Sasha soon after his appearance, revealing himself to be a powerful Qwaser, whose abilities initially surprised Sasha, as Tasuku apparently had his same powers, though he managed to use them better. He is indeed a Qwaser, but his element is neodymium, which allows him to control any kind of metal through magnetism, not by interacting to it at the molecular level. He is also very skilled in Buddhist incantations, as he is the sole heir of a family of sorcerers and shamans, and thus can create elaborate incantations or even Buddhist-related weapons. His explosive personality and his occasional foolishness harbor a dark secret however: as a child he was greatly traumatized when his mother was brutally raped in front of him, which led him to become mad with ideas of revenge and turn to a life of constant conflict, slowly drifting to senseless anger. His encounter with Mutsumi Sendou saved him, and the two became inseparable since then. Though initially antagonistic, Tasuku quickly became a valuable ally, though he was accused of raping Hana and had to fight Ekaterina, when Friederich Tanner pitted the two against each other. When angered, he fights with a murderous frenzy that makes him attack with blind fury, especially if it's Mutsumi who's in danger. ;: :As the helium-wielding Qwaser triplets are shocked to have demonstrated, Shin'ichiro's prowess with his sodium based powers as a Qwaser is an experience that burns itself to memory as all the possible applications are brutal and indefensible; in addition to combustion at the atomic level, Shin'ichiro's molecular filaments have the capability to hack into the neural network of another living creature to force the quarry to think and perform the way he wants through the potassium-sodium electron conveyance. For reasons obscure and arcane that possibly include guilt, Shin'ichiro abandoned his role of the Aurum (Gold) Qwaser's right-hand man after Olja's murder and Sasha's scarring to unsuccessfully challenge his former master. Undaunted by this setback, Shin'ichiro takes Elizabeth on as his protege and intercedes for Mafuyu in the hopes that she will lead him to St. Mihailov's Academy. The gambit paid off when Shin'ichiro discerns the meaning of the Theotokos along with the procedure to avail the icon's activation incantation which requires Tomo and Teresa as his aide along with plenty of time for the procedure to prosecute its full course. In spite of Elizabeth's inhibitory efforts, Sasha arrives on the scene to rescue Tomo as the Sword's Maria incantation divides itself between Tomo and Mafuyu; having nothing to show for his subterfuge to reach or seal away the Theotokos after purposely losing to Sasha, Shin'ichiro ignites the sodium in his body after bidding farewell to Elizabeth. =Human students= ;: :Mafuyu is the main female protagonist character and the adopted daughter of St. Mihailov's last dean, and the self-appointed protector of Tomo Yamanobe. Cheerful and upbeat, she is so proficient in kendo that she carries a wooden sword with her all the time. She has to endure hardship on a daily basis in form of her and Tomo being ridiculed by other classmates. This changes when she encounters Sasha for the first time, when she starts living with him and, little by little, is pitted herself in the fights between Qwasers. Though at odds with Sasha's coldness, Mafuyu has started to open up to him and the two have formed a stronger bond. This is especially true as she has recently taken on the habit of feeding Soma to Sasha when in need, and it is shown at the end of the first season that they have feelings for each other. After recent events she is the current holder of half the Sword's Maria, a powerful incantation which was kept hidden in a Fabergé egg. The power she gained are still unclear, though apparently they at least boost her physical prowess enough to let her challenge low-level Qwasers head-on. Also, in the latest chapters, She has decided to separate from Sasha to train to become his Maria and also train to use her \\"Sword of Maria\\" power. Mafuyu is in love with Sasha. ;: :Daughter of St. Mihailov's last dean and currently best friend/roommate of Mafuyu Oribe, Tomo is her exact opposite, both physically and mentally: she herself is very childish and naïve, and while having the largest bust of the whole female cast so far, she is physically weak. Tomo is the spitting image of Sasha's original protector, Olja, which explains why he took so willingly the role of Tomo's guardian, much to Mafuyu's dismay. Also, sometimes an upside down Eastern Cross (with its third slab being a scar), the symbol of the Adepts, appears between her breasts. This is later revealed to be the presence of the Qwaser of Gold, which apparently inhabits Tomo's body as a disembodied projection and, as itself stated, is slowly draining her of her life, which is why she has to constantly replenish herself with Soma. Indeed, it was revealed that the Qwaser of Gold does have some control over Tomo, as he/she possessed her and tried to unseal Sword's Maria. The plan backfired however, and now Tomo is apparently free from his/her control and possess the other half of the incantation, with Mafuyu possessing the first. She then gets a attacked by the athos who want her powers along with her partner Sasha Martyr to open the gate to god. ;: :A Serbian Orthodox nun that serves at St. Mihailov in a variety of ordinary chores, such as taking care of children in the school's kindergarten or tending to flowers, she is notable in that, for most of the beginning of the series, she never shows any form of emotion, reacting with fright only when Mafuyu was about to close a door on her. This is explained when her past is revealed: as a child she was part of a Serbian Orthodox convent in Krajina, during the Yugoslav Wars, a jovial and hyperactive girl until the day a group of Croatian militiamen, led by \\"Gas Chamber\\" Croa, assaulted the convent and pillaged it, slaughtering and raping its occupants in a bloody carnage. The sole survivor, Teresa observed the whole massacre from inside a closet, and when later found, she was so shocked that her emotions were locked away by the trauma. Only when Sasha gave her his support and they both avenged the slaughter by killing Croa, did she manage to smile for the first time in years. Teresa used to offer her Soma to Sasha, but since Ōtori's death she partners with Elizabeth. While an ordinary human, Teresa is well-versed in combat, using a bow for long-range attacks or fighting bare-handed, or using blades concealed in her gown. A running gag involves two curious locks of hair that she has on her head, which look and behave like a puppy's ears, flipping when she is happy or excited, dropping loose when she is embarrassed, and so on. In episode 22 of the anime's first season, Teresa might be hinted for having feelings for Sasha. ;: :A student of class 1-A, she acts as an enforcer on school grounds, but also she is the main architect of the physical abuses that Mafuyu and Tomo have to endure every day, such as regularly throwing the class' garbage can on them or forcing them to fill it after \\"casually\\" tripping on it, to covering Tomo's desk with writings and trash. As Miyuri's braws, she encountered Ekaterina shortly after her arrival in Japan, and feels embarrassed by how much she's obsessing over Ekaterina. Ekaterina picking up on this pretends to be vulnerable and unconscious in the dressing room they're in after using her power on the copper wiring to plunge the room into darkness. Hana succumbs to temptation and kissed Ekaterina on the arm who then restores the power and verbally abuses and blackmails Hana into serving as her Maria. Although as additional abuse says that Hana is more of a Mary Magdelene (who was another Mary mentioned in the Bible who is believed by some to have been a prostitute.) This made her Ekaterina's personal slave and reserve of Soma, and from then on she had to endure daily abuse and sexual torture by her malicious mistress, abuse that she apparently enjoys to a degree and that gave her amazing BDSM-related skills. Unfortunately for her, this relationship with Ekaterina meant that she was often exploited by the enemy, as it happened with Yuu Kuchiba, who abducted her and drained her of Soma to the point of exhaustion, or with Friederich Tanner, who mind controlled her in order to pit Tasuku and Ekaterina against each other. Currently she is training with Sasha to improve herself as a partner to Ekaterina. In the sixth episode of the second season, Hana takes the Magdalen of Thunder from Tsubasa and becomes its holder similar to how Mafuya is the (partial) holder of the Sword's Maria. In the ninth episode of the second season she demonstrated the ability of flight and unleash great charges of electricity. ;: :The daughter of the current dean at St. Mihailov Academy, who succeeded Tomo's father. While beautiful and well-endowed, Miyuri is extremely bossy, arrogant and prideful, making nothing to conceal her disrespect for Tomo and Mafuyu and to bully them on a daily basis, supported by Hana. Greatly humiliated by Sasha, who correctly defines her as a leecher of others' powers, she \\"takes revenge\\" by welcoming and taking care of Ekaterina Kurae, the Qwaser of Copper. It can be noted that Miyuri is very rich and appears to have a sheltered upbringing, based on her drowning Ekaterina with expensive gifts. However, being treated as a fool after Sasha's arrival made her somewhat of a comic relief character. On a positive note, it can be assumed that she truly cares even for those she bullies, as she stripped naked for a group of terrorists so as to spare the same ordeal to Ekaterina, Mafuyu and the others. She briefly enjoyed Qwaser-like powers, donning a magical girl-like outfit and wreaking havoc before being stopped by Tasuku Fujiomi and becoming normal once more. ;: :Fumika is the class president of Mafuyu and Tomo's class. She is very withdrawn, due to her lack of breast size. When Eva Silver and Q and R come to St. Mihilaov Academy, Fumika stands up to Eva Silver and injures her, cutting her cheek. She is nearly cut to pieces as a result by an attack, but is saved by Alexander. She appears later bemoaning her breast size. ;: :Former partner of Sasha and currently both partner and lover of Tasuku Fujiomi, Mutsumi is an upbeat, cheerful and well-endowed girl who rarely lets her inhibitions restrain her - for instance, she is bisexual and openly flirts with Mafuyu, much to her dismay. She encountered Tasuku shortly after Sasha left Athos, nursing him back to health and winning his trust and, with that, his love, which she reciprocates. Like Tasuku, she lives formerly at Seiganji High School with her different uniform as St-Mikhailov Academy. Similarly to Teresa her primary role is to provide Soma to her partner, though she can defend herself using a pair of bladed tonfa. ;: :The head of the Sorority, a group of elite students who (according to Ayame Satsuki) surpass the student council in terms of influence, at Roman Curia Surei Academy. Miyuki is one of the top students at the school and much revered by others throughout the school for both academic and athletic knowledge. She challenges Sasha to a duel on his first day at the school within the school's virtual training system as on suspicion that he might be the culprit behind the series of sexual harassment happening in the school but is instead defeated. As a result, Sasha tastes her Soma and subsequently determines that she is not the Magdalena of Thunder. She is extremely close and dedicated to her childhood friend Tsubasa, to the point that their attachment to each other appears romantic, though she has also been shown to become fascinated by Sasha. She carries what appears to be a knight's chess piece in silver, and is able to project a symbol onto her chest that transforms into what appears to be cybernetic body armor. After realizing Tsubasa is held captive by Wan Chen, Qwaser of Silicon, she ends up assisting Sasha in battling the Adept. :In the anime, after Wan Chen's death, Miyuki and Tsubasa are able to live as normal students and become a couple. In the manga, Miyuki remains beside the comatose Tsubasa, waiting hopefully for her to wake up. ;: :Tsubasa is a student in the class of Hana and Alexander during their undercover days at Roman Curia Surei Academy and is in fact the granddaughter of the school's former chairman. In the real world, Tsubasa uses a wheelchair due to an accident within the virtual world her grandfather created (which presumably led to the virtual training system used by the school). As physical injuries appear meaningless within the virtual training environment, however, she is formidable in that environment. Tsubasa loves books and is timid, though in the virtual world she is a lot more cheerful and talkative. In the manga she gets bullied by her classmates though she is not burdened while this, meanwhile in the anime she is admired by her classmates and there is no bullying. Tsubasa and her childhood friend Miyuki Seta share a close relationship, one that can be described as romantic. Hana takes advantage of Tsubasa passing out in the school bath so Alexander can taste her Soma and see if she is the Magdalena of Thunder. Alexander determines that she is not, a conclusion that turns out to be incorrect- she is kidnapped by the Qwaser of Silicon and held against her will to awaken an old program that her grandfather designed that can further Wan's goal of controlling all computers worldwide. :In the anime, Hana ends up taking the power of the Magdalen of Thunder from Tsubasa, making her a normal girl and enabling her and Miyuki to live together happily as a couple. In the manga, Wan Chen forcibly severs connection between her body and the virtual environment where her consciousness is located, a process thought to have killed her but instead only leaves her in a state of coma, leading people (especially Miyuki) to believe that she managed to escape as well and will eventually re-awake. ;: :Another member of the sorority of Roman Curia Surei Academy. Ayame is obsessed with Miyuki and always calls her \\"onee-sama\\". When Miyuki is defeated by Alexander, Ayame takes it upon herself to avenge Miyuki, but instead gets her Soma sucked by Alexander. She follows the way of Hana in that she is obsessed with yuri and lolicon. When Ekaterina arrives at the Academy, she makes Ayame her slave as well in addition to Hana. ;: ; :An androgynus boy who appears after the events in Roman Curia Surei Academy. He befriended and follows Miyuri everywhere mostly when she tries to use any foretelling technique that involves using her breasts. Edgar is shown to be the one to truly foresee the events Miyuri predicts. He knows that Sasha is a Qwaser from Athos. Previously he was a slave of Frederich Tanner, and was constantly abused by him into constructing The Noah of Gold on his body. He is later stated by the Meteors as \\"The Golden Woman\\" speculating he may have a tie to the Gold Qwaser. It turns out his personality is fake/virtual to serve as a vessel for Frederich Tanner during the assault at the Water Sanctuary and died.  Antagonists  = The Adepts = A secret group of thirteen Qwasers who, much like Athos, desire to uncover the Theotokos, though apparently to use its powers for their own ends. They were introduced as a cult-like organization best known for its extreme brutality and harsh ways to initiate new members, willing or not, to their cause. Sasha was part of their ranks before being wounded and banished by the Qwaser of Gold, who appears to be the sect's leader. However, recent chapters have revealed the group to be far less sinister, showing them to be respectable — albeit still sinister - people. They entered a truce with Athos since they currently hold Tomo Yamanobe captive, and thus half of the incantation necessary to unseal the Theotokos. Subsidiary to the Adepts appears to be a secretive organization known as Paracelsus, formed from the remnants of Japan's Unit 731 and the Nazi eugenics program, whose members, through demented medical science, can conquer feats deemed impossible and blasphemous, such as reviving the dead and cloning at will. Their base appears to be a secluded place named Magnolia, the ruins of a fortress splendidly decorate by lush gardens, which stands in stark contrast with the grim portrait of the organization. However, the Golden Tyrant, with a few others, betrayed and forsaken the Adepts to Athos, stating they're no longer necessary for the next step. The surviving Adepts are Aoi, Jita and Joshua. ;The Golden Tyrant :The Leader of the Adepts, he was the one who killed Sasha's guardian, Olya, and gave Sasha his scar. Had a golden spike placed on Tomo to serve as a means of communication to Sasha and his fellow Adepts. His identity was a mystery during the entire series until Sasha confirms that he is new leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Gregory XVII, who manages to end the schism with the Orthodox Church after centuries of separation. After his betrayal, he manipulates Jita and Joshua (along with a few bio-terrorists) is make a scene where he prevents a virus attack and displays a miracle. This act wins himself the position of Pope and states his dream to reunite the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. He also currently runs the Theosis Project to resurrect Jesus Christ to bring forth his final judgment. He was disappointed in Jita as he gave her multiple chances to kill him when she wasn't aware of it. Also, according to Frederick Tanner, Sasha is always on his mind. It is revealed that his true and actual identity is Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ who betrayed his master. In order to continue to serve Jesus upon his return, Judas fuse his soul with the souls of his fellow Apostles and encased it in a humanoid golem of gold shaped like an archangel. His Gold powers allow him to perform unusual skills, such as the Golden Spike to control Tomo's body and use the vibrations of gold flakes to destroy a deadly virus. ;Wan Chen: :Second of the Adepts, known as Ground Zero, a Qwaser in control of Silicon. He can generate crystal/glass for use as a sword or directly pull silicon from soil in his vicinity and make a perfect clone of himself. He's also able to fuse his own power with other elements, like Jita's Carbon, resulting in Silicon Carbide materialized as a sword whose hardness equals that of diamond. As silicon is a primary component in computer chips this allows him to use his powers to directly access and control the computer that contains the school's advanced Virtual Reality program, usually through silicon tendrils between his body and a computer interface. He had a terrible history which led him to believe the world was already hell and wished to live tomorrow peacefully as a human being. However, despite his beliefs, he was finally killed by Sasha for all the trouble he caused in his \\"Witchcraft project\\". ; Both: :Third member of the Adepts, nicknamed Double Face or Air Lord or Lady of the Rustling Leaves in anime, a single person which was originally two twins, brother and sister. It is unknown what life they lived before being captured by the Adepts, but they had to endure their harsh trainings by themselves, with Aoi supporting Yū, much like how Olja had to help Sasha. Unfortunately, this connection resulted in their damnation, and Yū became a homicidal maniac as a result. Not only that, but he also became a massively powerful Qwaser with the element, oxygen, which allowed him to walk in the air with impunity, create pressures of enormous proportions, air currents capable of large destruction and more devious acts, such as suffocating anyone he wished with no more than a thought or incapacitating them by saturating their surroundings with oxygen. His sister, Aoi, contacted Sasha and begged him to kill Yū and stop his rampage, though initially both him and Ekaterina were no match for someone who could oxidize their metal with a whim, rendering them powerless. However, when Sasha fought him for one last time it was revealed that there was no Yū, as he died long ago, it was Aoi all the time: deemed unfit for combat as a Qwaser, the Adepts wanted to use her as a supply of Soma, and when she was about to be assaulted, she unleashed her powers in self-defense, slaughtering her assailant only to discover, to her horror, that it was her brother. The event shattered her mind and drove her to complete madness, forcing the creation of a split personality of anger and hatred that took the identity of Yū, plaguing her with fits of rage and hallucinations of her brother raping her. Devastated by the revelation, with the last of her sanity she begged to be killed, a plea Sasha mercifully accepted. Though seriously wounded, Aoi did not die, and thanks to Paracelsus' efforts she was saved, with the procedure also sealing her identity of Yū away, reducing it as a \\"voice in her head\\". ;Milk/Blanc :Fourth of the Adepts, nicknamed Whisper Bomb. She is a young girl, as young as Ekaterina probably, who appears dressed in a regal gown but, oddly, has her face always concealed by a gas mask and, even more oddly, is often surrounded by cartoonish explosives, such as bombs, missiles, and torpedoes. She never spoke since her introduction, but it is known that her element is hydrogen, as she combined her powers with Aoi Kuchiba, who wields oxygen, to manipulate water and reveal the concealed sanctuary of the Theotokos. She is actually an old friend of Ekaterina, whom was sworn to be protected by and her puppy Baron. However, after an accident with a bully, her puppy was killed and her face scarred, and an explosive caused Ekaterina to believe that she was dead. She can use water vibrations to have a clairvoyance-like ability to see what is going on in nearby locations. During the Golden Tyrant's betrayal, Milk was revealed to be a regen (clone body for Blanc's soul) as part of a process to resurrect Jesus Christ. ;Sanada Doukan :5th of the Adepts Hierarchy. Also known as \\"Thousand Kills\\". He appears to be a \\"very\\" large man with a sword. He is a Tungsten user and strong enough to withstand tank shells. When he was found, he killed a small army just to protect a bird's nest in a tree. At that time, Astarte developed a connection with him and he sworn true allegiance to her, becoming an Adept. He fought Sasha during the siege at the Adept's hideout. Sasha KO'ed him and tied him to a boulder, right after stating that Sasha was a worthy warrior. After the Golden Tyrant's betrayal was revealed, he overhears Astarte's danger and charges to her rescue. Unable to find her, he attacks Ootomi's clone for his part of the betrayal but was burned to death by powers. His final request to Sasha was for Astarte's protection which Sasha accepted. ;: :Possibly 7th in the Adept Hierarchy. Known as Gas Chamber, he is a tall, wicked-looking member of the Adepts, and as a Qwaser he wields the element of chlorine, with which he can create noxious and lethal gases or, in conjunction with water, generate hydrochloric acid. He was the one that led the vengeful militiamen to Teresa's convent during the Yugoslav Wars, and appears to be highly xenophobic, often lamenting that his prey smell really bad. He threatened to turn St. Mihailov in a massive grave by gassing all its occupants before Sasha fought and defeated him. A clone of him, reanimated and controlled by Friederich Tanner, was used to force the awakening of Sword's Maria by fighting Ōtori before suffering defeat. ;: :A bespectacled classmate of Tomo and Mafuyu, Ayana appears to be one of the only students of class 1-A willing to take their side despite them being bullied or ignored while mistreated, though she feared to stand with them due to possible retaliation by Miyuri and the other students. Although she appears to be a weak-willed and timid student, she was one of the Adepts, the first Qwaser introduced in the manga with her element being magnesium, with which she created razor-sharp chakrams or chains that she could ignite and control at will. Ayana terrorized St. Mihailov's premises as a mysterious assailant that targeted girls and drained their Soma, often leaving them severely injured, before trying in vain to find where the Theotokos was held. Confronted by Sasha, she tried once more to find the icon by kidnapping Tomo, and in the ensuing fight she was mortally wounded by Sasha. She burnt herself instead of succumbing to the wounds, giving a first impression of the Adepts' fanatic zeal. Unexpectedly she re- appeared as a reanimated corpse when Friederich Tanner summoned her and other fallen Qwasers to fight Shin'ichiro Ōtori, against whom she was easily dispatched and burnt once more, this time apparently for good. Her nickname as an Adept in manga is unknown but in the anime Sasha called her Miss Choreographer. In the manga it is speculated she never really treated or even considered Tomo and Mafuyu her friends. ;: :The Queen of the Living Silver, controlling the element mercury, able to summon it in vast quantities and solidify it at will, turning the substance into razor-sharp wires and blades, droplets as powerful as bullets, and other solid objects or even traps. While Sasha and Ekaterina were fighting Eva-Q and Eva-R, the real Eva Silver appeared out of nowhere in Mafuyu's class, killing their teacher by smothering him with mercury and then proceeding to \\"teach\\" the class about the beauty of cruelty and humiliation upon others, ironically also reprimanding the students about their bullying of Mafuyu. One of the most sadistic and deranged characters appeared so far, Eva was the original source of all of her clones, younger versions of herself who were given physical immortality so as to endure the atrocious tortures imposed on them by their mistress, whom they adored as their only queen and were then massacred and reabsorbed into Eva's body, so as to keep her young and beautiful. Highly prideful, Eva was initially defeated by Sasha, when she was crucified and set ablaze, yet she reappeared shortly after, gruesomely disfigured, kidnapping Mafuyu and forcing Sasha to fight once more. It was Ekaterina who shed light upon Eva's identity, unmasking her as Eva Braun, the wife-lover of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Believing her acts of depravity, especially cloning and reassimilating herself, as the true manifestation of the Nazi idea of a supreme being, she was defeated nonetheless, and completely torn apart by Ekaterina's gynoid, in the end revealing herself to be fearful of death. A cloned corpse of Eva Silver was later used in the botched attempt, made by the Qwaser of Gold and Friederich Tanner, to summon Sword's Maria. Her position in the Adepts' hierarchy is unknown. ;Friederich Tanner: :Older of the Tanner brothers, he is a blonde man of aristocratic Prussian descent who, while not being a Qwaser himself, holds strange powers akin to sorcery that lets him create many seals and incantations that allows him to assume others' identities, hypnotize and force others into doing his bidding, or to summon and teleport others at will using tarot cards. Nicknamed Double-Headed Crest Maker, he is an international terrorist much feared across Europe, who believes the current state of that continent to be miserable and uses terror to destabilize the European Community, in order to lead it to collapse, striving to revive the Holy Roman Empire with Germany at its lead. He sought the Theotokos for such an end, using both Athos and the Adepts as mere pawns in a game he orchestrated from the shadows, until he appeared to end it personally, first disguising himself as a teacher at St. Mihailov, and then trying to finally unseal the sanctuary where the Theotokos was hidden, using Mafuyu and a crest-infused Hana to reunite the two halves of Sword's Maria. He almost succeeded, however he was defeated and then killed when Sasha, Ekaterina and Tasuku combined their efforts to stop him. However, he returns alive and well and seemingly rats out the Adept's Hideout to the Meteors and helping Hayabusa capture Astrate. He is still on the Golden Tyrant's side, along with Ootomi's clone, after his betrayal and exposes the Golden Tyrant's true goal, which will require the \\"David of Resurrection\\". Sasha made his trump card, \\"Gate of Hell: Uroboros\\", turn against him and devour him, finally ending him. His final words to Sasha was that Sasha was always on the Golden Tyrant's mind. ;Georg Tanner: :Younger brother of Friederich Tanner, known as Gamma Omega, he is eighth in the Adepts' hierarchy and he can control both cobalt and gamma rays, creating destructive laser-like beams from an elaborate ornament he has on his right hand, which he constantly cleans and admires. He is highly narcissistic and arrogant, boasting his aristocratic origins with pride and treating others as inferior beings. He shares the same beliefs as his older brother Friederich, hoping like him to destabilize Europe and bring back the Holy Roman Empire, led by his native Germany. He has an especially bitter rivalry with Jita Phrygianos and her brother, considering them unworthy to be Adepts, and almost had her killed after provoking her into a fight, forcing her to take the blame. When his brother attempted to unseal the Theotokos, he was to defend him from Sasha, Ekaterina and Tasuku, aided by Aoi Kuchiba and Milk. The fight proved to be too much for him however, and he had his face greatly disfigured by Sasha's scythe before being almost burnt when the three Qwasers united their efforts to stop Friederich. Severely wounded, he was dragged from the battlefield by Aoi. He later reappeared during a tournament to encounter Sasha, only to be killed by him. ;Jita Phrygianos: :Eleventh of the Adepts, known as Black Diamond, she is Joshua's sister, whom she treats as a fool. Her element is carbon, from which she can create bladed weapons; either form it as a pair of crescent-like scythe or fiber thread; at will. She was initially very harsh towards Tomo, addressing her as a loose woman due to her good looks, though she apparently developed a crush on her, slowly opening up, especially after Tomo saved her when Georg Tanner forced her to take the blame of a fight he had provoked. She joins Wan Chen in his attempt to take the Magdalena of Thunder and was thought dead after performing a suicide attack to kill Katja in the virtual world along herself. However, she survived and was retrieved by Athos, who fitted her with a special lock on her left breast that causes her excruciating pain should she feel either excessive pleasure or use her powers. Though uneasy at being well-treated by her \\"enemies,\\" she has begun to open to the people at St. Mihailov. After the Golden Tyrant's Betrayal, she was released from captivity with her brother, but used by the Golden Tyrant in a scheme become the next Pope. ; :Possibly 12th of the Adept's Hierarchy. Known as \\"One Shot Kill\\". An expert marksman wielding element of plumbum/lead. Appeared shortly in an attempt to assassinate Sasha when he temporary lost his powers but failed in his assassination attempt and was killed as well when Sasha managed to regain his powers. ;: :the 13th of the Adepts hierarchy and known as \\"the Eleventh Exile\\", and a true rarity among them, serving somehow as the faction's comic relief character. A young man whose sister, Jita, is ranked number four in the organization, he was mistreated by his peers due to his element, roentgenium, being weak and useless, which led others to treat him as inferior, someone unfit to be a Qwaser. He boasts himself with the title of Successor of Hermes Trismegistus, though he is in fact generous and caring, if somehow foolish sometimes. He tried in vain to kidnap Tomo, who peacefully succeeded in making him realize his mistake, and then he was the first one to welcome her to the Adept's hideout. He appears after the events at Roman Curia Surei Academy during the ongoing war of Athos with The Meteors. He is attacked by Katja, but shockingly he not only renders Katja's attack useless but manifests the crest of the Golden Qwaser, implying he has earned his powers. He claims he wants to take back his sister. However, this crest backfires as The Qwaser of Gold deems him disposable and Sasha saves him by cutting off his arm. After the Golden Tyrant's Betrayal, his arm was restored and released from captivity with his sister, but used by the Golden Tyrant in a scheme become the next Pope. Others: ;: A little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes that serves an important role among the Adepts. She has been in the Adepts' secret hideout for most of her life, not even leaving once from the castle. She has implied that her most important person is her dog, Serene. Doukan is the one who takes care of her and a sisterly bond with Tomo. After the Golden Tyrant's betrayal, she and Tomo were taken to the Theosis Project's underwater base, Uterus, and was having her soma drained out of her, much to Tomo's horror. ;Shin'ichiro Ōtori's Clone :A clone of the original Shin'ichiro Ōtori with the same sodium powers, but his body can use his powers so much. Faithfully serves the Adept's cause, but was on the Golden Tyrant's side of his betrayal. ;The Helium Brothers :A trio of brothers who control the element of Helium. ; Eva-Q: Eva-R: :A pair of deranged, ghastly twin sisters dressed in scandalous, bondage-looking suits and armed with a wide variety of obscene BDSM tools, which suddenly appeared at St. Mihailov, searching for Sasha, begging those they asked informations to \\"order\\" them - that is, to torture them to death with the array of gadgets they carried, with refusal immediately followed by \\"disqualification\\", the gruesome death of their would be-master. Probably the most extreme example of the brutality of the Adepts, Eva-Q and Eva-R were clones of their original, Eva Silver, engineered to be physically immortal, no matter how massive their injuries, capable of using the element mercury like their mistress, and also completely crazy, driven by constant rape and torture to such extremes of insanity that they recognized pain with pleasure, crying out in bliss even when superficially wounded. They like Evas A-P, were created from Eva Silver's own body with mercury for two reasons. The first reason was to provide loyal slaves for Eva to send on errands or torture just for fun. The second reason was so Eva Silver could heal any injuries and regain her youth by reabsorbing them. Possibly due to their pitiful condition, Sasha fought them only briefly, leaving the job to Ekaterina, who was much more eager to kill the twins. She only managed to keep them at bay however, until their \\"mother\\", Eva Silver, was wounded by Sasha and reabsorbed them back into herself to heal the massive damage inflicted upon her body. Another clone, Eva-S, briefly appeared when Eva kidnapped Mafuyu, though she was quickly incinerated from the inside-out by Shin'ichiro Ōtori, who ignited the sodium in her body and, thus, prevented her from regenerating. ;Rostam :A teenage servant who attends to Tomo's well-being at the Adept's hideout. Has a crush on her. During the siege on the Adept's Hideout, he escorted Tomo and Astrate through a hidden escape tunnel, only to be stabbed from behind by Hayabusa. His final words was apologizing to Tomo for failing her.  Meteors  The Meteors are a troop of executioners of Athos, known for their might and ruthlessness, according to Sasha they destroy everything that stands in their way. The Meteors have their vision of Athos and believe the current organization to not be enough to save the world, thus taking matters in their own hands. Their main officers was called \\"Five Faculties\\" ;Clifford C.J. Crawford :Number 1 of the \\"Five Faculties\\" and head priest of the Meteors. A middle-aged man with shoulder-length hair and literally no ears - claiming to have been sacrificed to God and claims to be an extraordinary pleasure. ;Leon Max Muller :Number 2 of the \\"Five Faculties\\" and known as \\"The Blind Wolf\\", a young man that Mafuyu meet as a renaissance village, to which he slaughter the whole village after Mafuyu left, deeming them as heretics. He believes what the Meteor does is God's will and anyone that goes against them are deemed heretics. Appears to have his eyes covered with a blindfold. He has a large number of wolves that obey his command, which also can transform into werewolf-like beasts. He also is able to transform sharks into mutant merman. He was last seen with an agent of the Theosis Project, meaning that the Meteors are allied with the Golden Tyrant. ;Lee May :Known as \\"Silent Magnum\\" and number 3 of \\"Five Faculties\\", as the alias implies, she use all kind of firearms against her opponent. She originally came from a noble family that was killed during an international meeting. She was found by rogue soldiers who put her through brutal training and tried to impregnate her, only to find that they were also working for Fredrick Tanner, that one behind her family's massacre. After killing the soldiers, the Meteors found her and recruited her. She waited for the opportunity to kill Fredrick, esp. when he was in a student named Edgar (virtual personality) who carries the Golden Noah. At the Water Sanctuary, She sacrifices herself to stop Fredrick and save Sasha (based on a recent dream produced from the Golden Noah that the two were in love). ;Nami Okiura: :Number 4 of \\"Five Faculties\\" and bearer the alias \\"Plunger\\" Also known as Frantic Nami and one of the Meteors' main officers, she is a girl who is part of the student council at St. Mihailov, who enjoys working in the council. This is a facade however, as when instructed to act, she violently assaults the president whom she claims to love. She behaves and has abilities akin to a vampire. By biting the breasts, of her preys she can infect them with a virus which allows her to command her victims. In the anime, she successfully did this with Mafuyu and almost kills Sasha were not for the timely arrival of Teresa. She is killed by Sasha. ;Hayabusa :Another member whose skilled with blades and uses a shadow technique to become invisible, along with other ninjutsu skills. He likes to keep introductions brief and \\"Business before pleasure\\". Likes to have his opponents afraid, confused, etc. Pursued Astrate, along with Tomo, during the siege at the Adepts hideout. Apparently loves to torment women before killing them. Killed by Aoi.  The Theosis Project  The special project run by the Golden Tyrant in attempt to resurrect Jesus Christ. Their Current base of operations, where Tomo is being held, is an underwater facility around ancient Roman ruins called \\"Uterus\\" - where its members say it will the \\"Birthplace for the New Humanity\\". The idea is to use the \\"David of Resurrection\\", which acts as a special scanner, to scan the essence of Jesus Christ, which lies within the \\"Theotokos of Tsaritsyn\\", and place the essence in a clone body. Members: ;The Golden Tyrant/Pope Gregory XVII : See Adepts ;Melosz : The Golden Tyrants's partner and second in command in the Theosis project poses as Tomo's and Mafuyu's father (if it is truly him). He bears a huge scar over his face and has a prosthetic left arm and leg. He is also known to be an underworld negotiator and fixer. ;;: : See other characters ;Shinichiro Ōtori's Clone : See Adepts ;Frederick Tanner : See Adepts ;Yū Kuchiba Clone :He was revived with a clone body, much like Milk, and bears his own \\"two\\" elements. His main element is Aluminum, which he can create blades with, and also has Thermite, a process where he can convert his aluminum to have explosive features. This was achieved by the fact that his body was actually cloned from Aoi's DNA, resulting in his soul residing in a copy of her female body. As a result, he is able to utilise his naturally born element of Aluminium in conjuncture with Aoi's element of Oxygen. He is still the same sadistic psycho as he was first shown. ;Lucrezia Borgia :A seductive and alluring woman who is a sulfur user. She was sent to try to bring the Golden Tyrant's old master to join the cause. But because of Mafuyu's, Aoi's, and a friend's interference, she vowed to kill them all for it. She once used her sulfur powers to activate an underwater volcano. ;Giorgio Charon and Goryou :A tag team duo. Goryou is the muscle and Giorgio is a handsome Italian ladies man (he once tried to flirt with Tomo as her refers to her as a princess/royalty and mother superior with god-like soma).  Other characters  ;: ;: : The School nurse who works at the academy, she has connections with Athos and is aware of the movements of the Qwasers. She treats the students of the academy and sometimes helps them with their personal problems. It is later revealed she is part of the Theosis Project, but is protective of Tomo as she didn't want her to see what was happening to Astrate. ;: :St. Mihailov's student council president. ;: The strongest tactician of the Athos. She is a strong muscled woman who wears a nun uniform.

He was created by series creator Joe Weisberg and is portrayed by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. Philip is a KGB agent and, along with Elizabeth (Keri Russell), poses as a travel agent in Washington D.C. Character history Early history Philip was born as Mikhail in Tobolsk. His father died when he was six years old; his mother's history is unknown. Philip describes being attacked by gangs at a young age while collecting milk across the city. One day he fought back, and beat one of the bullies to death. As a teenager, Philip dated a young Russian woman named Irina, who shared his dream of joining the KGB. When Philip is accepted into the Illegals Program, Irina breaks up with him and tells him that she's met someone else. Later, Irina also joins the KGB as an undercover agent in Europe. Philip trains for several years before meeting \\"Elizabeth Jennings,\\" another member of the Illegals Program, who is assigned to be his wife in America. They move to Virginia in 1965 and have their first child, Paige, in 1967. Season one In 1981, Philip Jennings lives with his (pretend) wife Elizabeth outside of Washington D.C. They are revealed to be a pair of sleeper agents working for the KGB. They have two children, Paige and Henry. After a failed deportation, Philip and Elizabeth kidnap Nikolai Timoshev, a defected KGB agent, who raped Elizabeth when she was in training. At the time of Timochev's kidnapping, counter-intelligence FBI agent Stan Beeman moves next door, causing Philip to suggest defecting themselves. Elizabeth declines and Philip murders Timoshev when he finds out he raped her. Elizabeth and Philip try to become a real married couple, but after finding out Elizabeth had an ongoing affair with Gregory Thomas (Derek Luke), a Black activist, he is hurt. She tells Philip that she is beginning to feel love for him for the first time in their 16-year relationship. Philip has become genuine friends with Stan, who he initially befriended because he was a counter-intelligence agent. He begins a relationship with Martha Hanson, an FBI secretary, who knows him under the name Clark. He uses his relationship with her to keep tabs on what the FBI are working on. Philip and Elizabeth plant a bug in Caspar Weinberger's office, and begin listening for vital intelligence. After a mole in the KGB is realized, Elizabeth and Philip are kidnapped and tortured by KGB operatives posing as FBI agents. Philip believes that because Elizabeth's torturing stops, it was she who told the KGB that he considered defecting. Philip is upset that Elizabeth trusts the KGB more than she trusts him. Philip goes to New York where he rekindles a romance with Irina. She tells him that they had a son together shortly after he joined the Illegals Program, and that she hid this from him so that he would follow his dream. She suggests they leave the KGB and run away together. Philip declines, not believing he fathered a child with her. He returns to Elizabeth, who tells him she'd like them to work on their relationship, to which Philip agrees, but neglects to tell Elizabeth about Irina. She soon finds out, however, and she and Philip separate, with Philip moving into a motel. After leaving Martha's apartment one morning, Chris Amador, Stan's partner and Martha's ex-boyfriend, attacks Philip and is himself stabbed in the process. Despite Philip and Elizabeth's best attempts to keep him alive, he dies in his sleep. Gregory, who scrapped the car Philip used to transport Amador in, is soon fingered to the FBI. He commits suicide by cop. Later, General Zhukov is murdered under orders from a CIA officer, and Philip helps Elizabeth kidnap him, but after she doesn't go through with killing him, they let him go, but the CIA officer is able to identify them as a white couple. Philip quickly marries Martha in an attempt to get her to bug her boss's office after Elizabeth finds out that a United States Air Force colonel has information on the SDI project. Despite not hearing anything about a setup with the bug, Philip doesn't believe its authenticity and takes the meeting with the Colonel, where he tells Philip the schematics are 50 years away from being possible. Elizabeth goes to collect the Weinberger tape, with the FBI ready to arrest whoever shows up for it. Philip realizes this and collects Elizabeth in time, but she is shot when the FBI open fire on them. After Elizabeth's surgery, she tells Philip in Russian to \\"come home\\". Season two Elizabeth recovers at a remote safe-house and returns to the Jennings house in time for Henry's 11th birthday. However, the celebration is cut short, as she and Philip must go meet the Connors, another spy couple, but promise a \\"birthday weekend\\" at an amusement park. There, Philip is surreptitiously infiltrated in a mission by the Connors, who give him a key to their hotel room for a drop after. When Elizabeth and Philip find the Connors family shot to death in their room, they become paranoid. She locks down the house and suggests he tries to glean information from Martha, his FBI informant. Philip goes to kidnap a Refusnik scientist living in the Washington area and the Israelis save the scientist only to have the Mossad protect him. However he and Elizabeth kidnap the Mossad agent and trade him for the Scientist as well as the Soviet Union letting 1500 Jews go to Israel. Personality Philip has expressed doubts about \\"the cause\\" throughout the series. Nevertheless, he remains committed to it and is one of the KGB's most reliable field agents. While Philip grew up in poverty like his wife, his childhood was different. Philip fell in love with Irina as a young man, and that helped him develop a soft side that Elizabeth detests in the events preceding the show. Philip is a very attentive father, and it means a lot to him to make sure his children are happy and taken care of. Philip becomes very angry with Paige when she becomes very religious, partly due to the fact that he is jealous of her palpable belief in something, and that she becomes disrespectful when her parents don't approve. He is shown to be very rational and level-headed, but is prone to infrequent emotional outbursts. Philip loves playing hockey with Henry, and playing racquetball with his friend Stan Beeman. Even though Stan has played racquetball much longer than Philip, Philip picks up on the game quickly and starts beating Stan with ease. Despite these character traits, which suggest he is \\"softer\\" than Elizabeth, Philip is every bit the ruthless killer that his wife is. In season 3, he starts attending EST meetings for reasons initially unknown to him, but later feels more in touch with his emotions. However, when season 3 comes to a close, Philip realizes the negativity of his emotions and thoughts, and feels he can't work for the KGB anymore when he is forced to kill a man to save Martha's skin. He is interrupted when Elizabeth focuses on Ronald Reagan's Evil Empire speech instead of him. In season 4, Philip suffers from depression. He realizes he isn't as important as he thought he was in the KGB, and he struggles with Paige when she becomes aware of their activities. He disapproves of her relationship with Matthew Beeman. Casting Rhys spoke about what attracted him to the role of Philip: \\"He's a sort of gift of a part in that he's very sort of layered and multi-faceted. And when you meet him, he's at this great turning point in his life where everything's changing for him. You just get to do everything. You get to do the kung fu, and you get to do the emotional scenes, you get to do the disguises. It's the full package for an actor. It's a dream.\\" Reception For his portrayal, Rhys has been nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, winning once, and for three Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Actor in a Drama Series and three TCA Awards for Individual Achievement in Drama.

The Saturday Review noted that her book told “the epic of endurance and courage in a fight which sometimes looks heroic, but more often proves to be only burdensome and cruel; which is not reported in the official war communiqués but represents an essential part of the great struggle of our times.”F.C. Weiskopf, “The Human Fabric,” Saturday Review, March 20, 1943, p. 15.  Biography  Lorna Lindsley was born on 2 January 1889 to Frederic Jesup Stimson (1855–1943) and Elizabeth Bradlee Abbot Stimson (1858–1896) in Dedham, Massachusetts. She was the younger of two daughters. Her father was U.S. ambassador to Argentina from 1915 to 1921, and author of several law books, including The American Constitution (1908) and Popular Law-making (1910), as well as novels and short stories. Lorna Lindsley attended Radcliffe College and in 1909 married mining engineer Halstead Camp Lindsley (1880–1945). The couple had two daughters, Leonora (1917–1945) and Joan (1913–1971) before divorcing in 1921. Lorna moved to Paris in the 1920s, where she took an apartment at 20 rue de Cels in Montparnasse and became part of the circle of expatriate Americans living in the city. In the early 1930s, she crossed the Atlantic from Majorca to Boston in a sailing ship, named the Wander Bird.“Lorna Lindsley, Writer, 67, Dead,” New York Times, July 14, 1956, p. 15. In 1935, she co-wrote a play about Lord Byron with Gilbert Seldes called The Marble Heart, but it does not appear to have been staged.“Gossip of the Rialto,” New York Times, April 28, 1935. In 1936, Lorna and her daughter Leonora journeyed from Auckland, New Zealand, to Tahiti aboard the sailing ship Joseph Conrad under the command of Alan Villiers. Although he never mentions their presence in the book he wrote about the voyage (Cruise of the Conrad, Scribner's, 1937), he wrote about them in his diary, portions of which are quoted in his biography.Alan Villiers: Voyager of the Winds by Kate Lance (National Maritime Museum, 2009). Lorna Lindsley began to write articles for American newspapers in the late 1930s, including the Manchester Guardian, the New Statesman, the Nation (U.K.), Time and Tide, the Christian Science Monitor, and the New York Herald Tribune. In 1938, she travelled to Spain during the Spanish Civil War to report on the fate of the Loyalist forces for a French newspaper. After leaving Spain, she travelled to Palestine and wrote about the struggles of the Zionists there. At the outbreak of the Second World War, she was in France and aided the earliest Resistance efforts, before returning to the United States in 1941. These experiences formed the basis of her book, War Is People. Many of its chapters had previously appeared in print as newspaper articles. After the war, she continued to travel, including visiting Kenya to learn about the Mau Mau Uprising. She died in New York City on 12 July 1956, of a cerebral hemorrhage, at the age of 67.  Endowment  Lorna’s daughter Leonora Lindsley was killed in an accident in Germany a few days before the end of the Second World War. She had been a member of the Rochambelles, the only female combat unit on the Western Front during the Second World War, and was posthumously awarded the French Croix de Guerre avec Palme. In her memory, Lorna Lindsley gave $50,000 to the Institute of International Education. The funds were to be used to allow French students to study in the United States.http://www.iie.org/Programs/Leonora-Lindsley-Memorial-Fellowship  War Is People  War Is People was published in 1943 by Houghton Mifflin. Dr. Rafael Medoff has written of Lorna Lindsley: “It was when civil war erupted in Spain in 1936 that Lindsley found her true calling. Attaching herself to the Republican (anti-fascist) forces, she wrote a series of pro-Republican articles for US newspapers and political magazines. Lindsley did not pretend to be an objective reporter. In between articles, she served as a nurse to wounded Republican soldiers and wrote letters home for those too badly injured to hold a pen. After Franco’s triumph, she returned to Paris. In the spring of 1940, with the German army approaching, more than one million of the city’s residents fled. Lindsley too left – but only for a few days, to smuggle out film footage of the invasion. Three days later, she was back in the French capital. For the next five months, Lindsley defied the terror of the Nazi regime to help smuggle Jewish and political refugees out of the city. Her reports from within the German zone became an important source of eyewitness information for the American and British press. After returning to the United States in 1941, she wrote her first and only book, War Is People, which described the impact of war on the lives of ordinary citizens.”Dr. Rafael Medoff, “British mandate Pessah in Acre Prison,” Jerusalem Post, July 4, 2009.

Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, 47, 83-131. The species is ectoparasitic on the gills of the brassy trevally, (Caranx papuensis), off New Caledonia and was found only in this locality. It is the second species of the genus Lethacotyle Manter & Prince, 1953 described after the type-species, Lethacotyle fijiensis Manter & Prince, 1953. The genus Lethacotyle is special in that its members have no clamps on their posterior attachment organ or haptor, in contrast to most polyopisthocotylean Monogeneans which have clamps. The body of adult L. vera is 2.7-5.4 millimetres in length. The body is elongate, flat, with a pointed head showing two anterior suckers. There are numerous anterior testes and a single posterior ovary. The eggs bear two elongate filaments. The copulatory organs include a sclerotised cone-shaped vagina, 125-175 µm in length, and a male copulatory organ, comprising a ring of 21-27 spines which are 50 µm in length. The length of the spines of the male copulatory apparatus is the main diagnosis character of the species, which allows its separation from L. fijiensis, the only other species of the genus. The posterior part of the body of L. vera is asymmetrical. It bears two lateral flaps and a terminal lappet which is striated, and there are no clamps - this is a characteristic of the genus Lethacotyle.Manter, H. W. & Prince, D.

Career He was born in Birkenhead and educated at Birkenhead School. He took a job in a bank until 1899 before resuming his studies at Liverpool University before gaining a third class degree in zoology from Merton College, Oxford. After working as a demonstrator and assistant lecturer in the department of comparative anatomy at Oxford, he moved back to the University of Liverpool in 1906 also as a demonstrator and assistant lecturer. From 1911 he also lectured in embryology and genetics. During the First World War he served as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was twice mentioned in despatches. In 1918 he moved to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he became head of the Department of Zoology. When funds became available for a chair in zoology in 1922, he became professor. He was a keen field naturalist and his research interests included the study of the fauna of the sea-floor of Cardigan Bay. He married Elinor Beatrice Ord in 1912. They had one daughter, Eleanor Mary Ord Laurie. Association of University Teachers Laurie called a meeting in 1909 \\"To consider a proposal to form an Association for bringing together the members of the Junior Staff more into touch with one another and with the life of the University\\". Originally it was aimed at making contacts with other lecturers in other departments and other universities. At this time an increasing number of non-professorial staff were being employed. These Junior Staff or Assistant Lecturers were poorly paid, did essentially the same duties as professors and had few promotion prospects. In addition they had no representation on the bodies governing the Universities. Although the society formed at Liverpool was formally a \\"dining and discussion society\\" from an early stage it was clearly a new pressure group. At first its aims were local and in 1910 it won a campaign over representation on the faculties but on learning that similar groups had been formed or were in the process of formation they invited representatives of the junior staff from Bristol, Sheffield, Birmingham, Cardiff and Manchester for a dinner. In 1913 the junior staff at the Victoria University of Manchester (now the University of Manchester) presented a request for improvements in pay and grading to their university council. This included a suggestion that the starting pay should be substantially increased. The Council replied that while it agreed that eventually there should be an increase, at the current time there was insufficient money to pay for this. By 1917 inflation had rapidly eroded the value of salaries and Douglas Laurie called a meeting on 15 December 1917 to draw up a memorandum to present to the Board of Education. Almost as an afterthought he invited representatives of assistant lecturers from all universities. The meeting was attended by delegates from 15 institutions. The issues raised by the memorandum drafted at the meeting included: pay; tenure; status; grading; opportunities for research and superannuation. Finally a motion was passed to a new association with the name \\"The Association of University Lecturers\\". The name (which implicitly excluded professors from membership) caused some dissent but a split was prevented. However the Scottish lecturers went their own way and formed a separate association in 1922 which later merged with AUT in 1949 but retained some of its autonomy. The issue of pensions brought the idea of professional unity to the fore. The pension scheme for lecturers was to be left out of the new teachers pension fund formed by the Teachers' (Superannuation) Act 1918. As pension funds affect staff at levels of their career this created pressure for the association to include professors. At a conference in Bristol 27–28 June 1919 professorial delegates were present. The name of the new Association was left until all other matters were decided. Speaking from the chair Laurie pointed out that \\"the idea which brought the Association into being was of a trade union character, but expressed the hope that, when material conditions had been satisfactorily improved, educational matters generally would form the essential points on which discussion would take place\\". In the end it was agreed that the new association's objectives would be\\"the advancement of University Education and Research and the promotion of common action among University teachers in connection therewith\\" with membership open to professors. Finally the name Association of University Teachers was voted for nem con (no votes against but some abstentions) and Douglas Laurie was elected as the first president. He retired from teaching in 1940, but he became honorary secretary of the International Association of University Professors and Lecturers (IAUPL) in 1943. Although he served as president of the AUT for only one year, Laurie served as honorary general secretary for the rest of his life, running the association almost single handedly until he died in April 1953 while attending a meeting of IAUPL in Amsterdam.

All fifty states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Arkansas voters chose six electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Arkansas was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Arkansas, with just under 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, although a total of ten parties appeared on the ballot. The vast majority of counties in Arkansas voted for Reagan in a particularly strong turn out, even in this typically conservative leaning state. A bloc of heavily African-American counties in the southeastern Delta region turned out in majority for Mondale. Arkansas weighed in for this election as 2 percentage points more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which St. Francis County voted for a Republican presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Republican victory Reagan won the election in Arkansas with a resounding 22-point sweep-out landslide. While Arkansas typically voted conservative at the time, the election results in Arkansas are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. Arkansas continued in this election as a component of the Republican stronghold of the Deep South, which is evident after the presidency of Jimmy Carter. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\"Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this claim to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Arkansas, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Arkansas and elsewhere.

Most of the book is based on articles he published under the pseudonym \\"Spengler\\" on the Asia Times newspaper. Book Structure The book consists three parts: * Part 1: The Decline of the East – on the declining birthrates of the Islamic world, Goldman deduces that the Islamic fundamentalist terrorism is motivated by the feeling that the Islamic world is on an edge of demographic collapse, which will lead to an economic, and cultural disaster in Islamic nations. * Part 2: Theopolitics – the reasons behind the birthrates decline, such as Postnationalism. * Part 3: Why It Won't be a Post-American World – Goldman remarks that United States is the only big nation which isn't facing a demographic collapse, and thus promises it stability and strength.

The semi-active suspension system was widely used on luxury and top sport trim packages on most of Toyota’s products sold internationally. Its popularity fell after the “bubble economy” as it was seen as an unnecessary expense to purchase and maintain, and remained in use on luxury or high performance sports cars. Summary TEMS consisted of four shock absorbers mounted at all four wheels, and could be used in either an automatic or driver selected mode based on the installation of the system used. The technology was installed on top-level Toyota products with four wheel independent suspension, labeled PEGASUS (Precision Engineered Geometrically Advanced SUSpension). Because of the nature of the technology, TEMS was installed on vehicles with front and rear independent suspensions. Although there were TEMS equipped cars with the rear dependent suspension too – the minibuses or minivans like Toyota TownAce/MasterAce, Toyota HiAce at the top package. Based on road conditions, the system would increase or decrease ride damping force for particular situations. The TEMS system was easily installed to suit ride comfort, and road handling stability on small suspensions, adding a level of ride modification found on larger, more expensive luxury vehicles. The technology was originally developed and calibrated for Japanese driving conditions due to Japanese speed limits, but was adapted for international driving conditions with later revisions. As the Japanese recession of the early 1990s began to take effect, the system was seen as an unnecessary expense as buyers were less inclined to purchase products and services seen as “luxury” and more focused on basic needs. TEMS installation was still achieved on vehicles that were considered luxurious, like the Toyota Crown, Toyota Century, Toyota Windom, and the Toyota Supra and Toyota Soarer sports cars. Recently the technology has been installed on luxury minivans like the Toyota Alphard, Toyota Noah and the Toyota Voxy. The TEMS system has been recently named “Piezo TEMS” (with piezoelectric ceramics), “Skyhook TEMS” “Infinity TEMS” and more recently “AVS” (Adaptive Variable Suspension). Configuration settings The system was deployed with an earlier two-stage switch labeled “Auto-Sport”, with a later modification of “Auto-Soft-Mid-Hard”. Some variations used a dial to specifically select the level of hardness to the driver’s desires. For most driving situations, the “Auto” selection was recommended. When the system was activated, an indicator light reflected the suspension setting selected. The system components consisted of a control switch, indicator light, four shock absorbers, shock absorber control actuator, shock absorber control computer, vehicle speed sensor, stop lamp switch, with a throttle position sensor and a steering angle sensor on TEMS three stage systems only. All the absorbers are controlled with the same level of hardness. Operation parameters of TEMS The following describes how the system would activate on the earlier version installed during the 1980s on two stage TEMS *During normal running The system chooses the \\"SOFT\\" selection, to provide a softer ride. *At high speeds The system selects the \\"HARD\\" selection and determines that at high speeds, it assumes a more rigid configuration for better ride stability, and to reduce roll tendencies. *Braking (reducing speed to ) In order to prevent “nose dive”, the process proceeds to \\"HARD\\" automatically damping force until it senses the brakes to be at the\\"SOFT\\" setting. It will return to the \\"SOFT\\" state when the brake light is off, and the pedal has been released after 2 seconds or more. *(Only 3-stage systems) during hard acceleration To suppress suspension “squat” the system switches to \\"HARD\\" based on accelerator pedal position and throttle position. *(Only 3-stage systems) during hard cornering To suppress suspension “roll” the system switches to \\"HARD\\" based on steering angle sensor position. *SPORT mode The system remains in the \\"HARD\\" position regardless of driving conditions. (For 3-stage systems, the system automatically chooses between the “MID” and the \\"HARD\\" configurations - by the other words, the \\"SOFT\\" stage is excepted) Vehicles installed The following is a list of vehicles in Japan that were installed with the technology.

Career Michael Julius McLaney was born on February 1 of 1915 in Louisiana. McLaney made a fortune in the Casino business. His career began as a state champion tennis player for eight years running,Gus Russo (2010), Live by the Sword: The Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK, Bancroft Press, p161-2 and in 1962 he won the Grass Court Men's Doubles title at the United States Amateur Championships, with Gardnar Mulloy.United States Tennis Association, U.S. ADULT & SENIOR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS McLaney also played excellent golf, declining to turn professional on the grounds that he could make more money as an amateur (he claimed to have once won $250,000 from Carroll Rosenbloom betting on a round of golf). McLaney formed a professional partnership with Rosenbloom, and was in Rosenbloom's owner's box with him at the Colts-Giants 1958 NFL Championship Game. In September 1958 McLaney was able to purchase a large share of the Casino Internacional at Havana's Hotel Nacional de Cuba, while partnering with Rosenbloom and ultimately purchasing all shares. In 1959, following the Cuban Revolution, the hotel and casino were nationalised, and McLaney briefly imprisoned. Michael J. McLaney's life was documented in the book 'Bobby And J. Edgar' written by Burton Hersh. According to this book, after he is released from Cuba's prisons, McLaney flees to the City of Miami, Florida where he immediately gets together to scheme with associates to plan to firebomb the huge Cuban oil refineries once owned by Esso, Shell Oil Company and Texaco which is planned to take place at the very time as April 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion takes place. According to Burton Hersh, the FBI learns of this scheme and quickly alerts the 64th U.S. Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy of this attack. RFK takes off for Florida and interrupts a key meeting of McLaney and his associates on a houseboat where RFK confronts McLaney; according to witnesses, RFK drives his forefinger into McLaney's chest and tells him that there will not be any bombing of these oil refineries because the three oil companies hope to someday recover these former assets in Cuba. However, this incident did not seriously affect McLaney's relationship with the Kennedy brothers according to Burton Hersh. On December 29, 1962, after the 35th U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, had given a speech in Miami, Florida's Orange Bowl Game stadium before about 50,000 attendees who came to honor the just released from Cuba Bay of Pigs Invasion survivors, JFK frequently visited McLaney's 40 million dollar villa in Miami Beach.

Pizzo was a well-respected local historian and businessman, and was internationally recognized for his attempts to preserve the Italian American and Cuban American heritage and history of Tampa, Florida, and in particular that of his home neighborhood of Ybor City. From 1982 until his death in 1994, Pizzo was the official historian of Hillsborough County, and is author of several histories, most of which celebrate the unusual multicultural makeup of early Tampa. Pizzo also served as chairman of the Hillsborough County Historical Commission from 1968 to 1980, where he oversaw and was responsible for over eighty historical markers in Tampa and Ybor City. Early life and education Tony Pizzo was born in Ybor City to Italian parents Paul and Rosalia Pizzo, who were green grocers, in 1912. His parents instilled in him a philanthropic nature and a quest to keep the Italian heritage alive. Paul Pizzo was the organizer of La Nuova Sicilia Lodge, the very first chapter in Florida for the Sons of Italy organization and was honored in the book El Volto d'Italia (The Faces of Italy). Paul and Rosalia Pizzo created an environment filled with social and cultural stimulation, music and art, and placed a large emphasis on kindness and making contributions to your community. Pizzo described his childhood in fondly poetic terms: > I like to think of the days of my youth in Ybor city ... recall the sights, > sounds and smells that enriched my childhood. Life was pleasant and > carefree, often exciting. I can still hear the chatter in Spanish and > Italian as the workers paraded to the long days of rolling cigars in the > factories; the rumbling of wagons and the clump of horses' hooves on the > brick streets delivering bottles of milk and loaves of Cuban bread before > sunrise... The mellifluous Latin prattle along the sidewalks in the evenings > was an enchantment. I can still hear the music from the ballrooms wafting on > the night air during festive occasions. Remembering the haunting wail of the > train whistle rumbling along Sixth Avenue in the middle of the night awakens > a sad sense of nostalgia. The old haunts and departed friends capture my > memories. It was a way of life that will not return. It filled the summers > of my childhood. Pizzo attended Hillsborough High School before moving on to the University of Florida for two years. After graduation, he attended Stetson University for law school, but quit to go into business for himself. While at Stetson University, Pizzo met cousin of President Franklin D. Roosevelt Grafton Payne, and together, the two of them toured Europe in 1938. Upon returning home, Pizzo enlisted with the military and served in World War II. During the 1940s, Pizzo worked in the insurance business, but later left to start his own liquor company, International Brands, before 1950. He left this business a short time later, and began working for House of Midulla, a wholesale liquor company, and served as vice president in charge of sales from 1950 to 1984. From 1965 to 1971, Pizzo was president of Rey Del Mundo Cigar Co., a mail-order business that was among the Midulla affiliates. Pizzo additionally served as vice president and general manager for another affiliate company of Midulla, Fruit Wines of Florida Inc., the first winery to be built in Tampa. Pizzo frequently traveled in Spain and Italy, and while in Sicily he gathered material in 1970 on Italians who came to Ybor City before the turn of the century. Pizzo also was very active in Tampa history and heritage, teaching about Tampa's Hispanic roots at the University of South Florida, and served as a member of the University of South Florida's presidents Council. During his tenure as a professor in the American Studies department, Pizzo's ten part television series, \\"Tony Pizzo's Tampa,\\"(1979) produced by the University of South Florida, won two National University Television Association awards. Memberships Pizzo was involved in a great number of organizations throughout his time. Some of his impact can be seen in: * Historic Tampa/Hillsborough County Preservation Board * Tampa General Hospital Foundation * Barrio Latino Commission * City of Tampa Planning and Zoning Board (1951–1961) * Federal Housing Authority Advisory Board (1952–1955) * University of Tampa Foundation (1965–1970) * Tampa Philharmonic Association (Charter board member) * Ybor City Redevelopment Committee * Jose Marti Park Development Committee * Downtown Tampa Development Council * U.S. Air Force Academy Selection Advisory Panel (1970–1982) * Rotary Club of Tampa * Tampa World Trade Council * Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce * Ybor City Chamber of Commerce * University Club of Tampa * Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla * Tampa Historical Society (Founder) Awards Pizzo's work preserving and discovering Tampa's heritage garnered him quite a few awards throughout his lifetime, and even has his own name attached to an award today (see below). Pizzo received the Medal of the National Order of Merit Carlos Manuel de Cespedes from the Cuban government in 1952, the highest award that can be given to a foreigner, presented to him by President Fulgencio Batista for the preservation of Cuban history in Tampa. The Italian government made Pizzo a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1974 for similar work with Italian heritage and history in Tampa. In 1956 Pizzo was recognized as an Outstanding citizen with the Tampa Civitan Award, the highest honor bestowed by the city. In 1971 Pizzo founded the Tampa Historical Society, which then awarded him with the D.B. McKay State Award in 1980. The Hillsborough County Bar Association gave Pizzo the Liberty Bell Award on Law Day, 1990. And finally, Pizzo had been recognized many times in banquets during his life, and continued to receive praise in numerous posthumous celebrations. Legacy The materials left from Tony Pizzo's historical research create one of the larger personal collections in the Special Collections department of the University of South Florida Tampa Library. Pizzo Elementary School was named in his honor, and opened in 1998, four years after Pizzo's death. The Tony Pizzo Award given annually to \\"someone who has been actively involved in the City or County's Historical Education, Preservation, Research, or Community Service involving the history and heritage of Tampa\\" is also named in Pizzo's honor. Pizzo is depicted by one of the bronze statues that adorn Ybor City's streets—monuments to extraordinary citizens of this neighborhood. Pizzo's statue is situated at Ninth Avenue and 17th Street, where he is shown mid-lecture. The statue was unveiled in September 1995, just one year after Pizzo's death. Pizzo is also featured in a 12,000 square foot mural in Ybor City painted by artist Mike Parker that was dedicated in May 2013. Named \\"American Journey\\", it features prominent Ybor citizens through the years, including Ybor City's namesake Vicente Martinez-Ybor, who brought the cigar industry to Tampa from Key West.

It was published as Historia der Geburt Jesu Christi (Historia of the birth of Jesus Christ).  History and words  Christmas Story is a Historia, a setting of the Gospel intended to be performed during a service instead of the Gospel reading. The original title read: Historia der freuden- und gnadenreichen Geburt Gottes und Marien Sohnes Jesu Christi (Historia of the joyful und blessed birth of Jesus Christ, son of God and Mary). Schütz had composed a Resurrection Story (Auferstehungshistorie) already in 1623, when he had taken the position of Kapellmeister at the court of the Elector of Saxony. The music was probably first performed in a Christmas service at the court chapel of Johann Georg II, Elector of Saxony, in Dresden in 1660. Schütz mentions the elector in the long title: \\"wie dieselbe auf Anordnung Johann Georgs des Anderen vocaliter und instrumentaliter in die Musik versetzet ist durch Heinrich Schütz\\" (as set to the music for voices and instruments on an order by the other Johann Georg). The text is almost exclusively taken from the Bible in the translation by Martin Luther, quoting both Luke and Matthew, framed by a choral Introduction and Beschluss (Conclusion). The biblical narration is based on and . The text of the conclusion is a translation of the Christmas sequence \\"Grates nunc omnes\\" by Johann Spangenberg (1545). The narrator is the Evangelist. Other characters appear in eight sections termed Intermedium (interlude): the angel to the shepherds, the hosts of angels, the shepherds, the wise men, priests and scribes, Herod, an angel to Joseph (twice). The composer agreed to a publication of the recitatives in 1664, along with the text of the other parts. According to the postscript, probably written by Alexander Hering, a Kantor in Dresden, Schütz believed that his work could only be performed well by \\"fürstlichen Kapellen\\" (ducal chapels), but he offered a copy of the music for sale on request. This publication later appeared in his Sämtliche Werke (Complete works), Volume IX, in Leipzig, published by Julius Spitta 1885 to 1894. Arnold Schering discovered the parts at the Uppsala University Library in 1908. He published them in Volume XVII of the complete works.  Scoring and music  The work is scored for soloists and choir in up to six parts (SSATTB) and orchestra. Carus-Verlag published a critical edition using two violins, two violas da gamba, two recorders, two trumpets, two trombones and basso continuo. It takes about 45 minutes to perform. A late work, composed when Schütz was 75 years old, it shows a \\"mastery of means\\", \\"a work that never feels as eclectic as its influences\\". Schütz had travelled a lot and experienced the Thirty Years' War, contributing to the \\"serenity of the composer’s late works\\". The Evangelist is a tenor singing secco recitative, a tradition which Bach continued. Schütz uses \\"Italian dramatic recitative style\\" to set Luther's German. Music historian Michael Zwiebach notes: \\"It has unexpected twists that emphasize particular words, and it shifts tonal centers rapidly to reflect dramatic events.\\" The angel is sung by a soprano with two violins, a trio of shepherds is accompanied by pastoral recorders, the words of the priests are set as a quartet. Herod is accompanied by trumpets, setting his worldly power apart from the \\"more potent, less showy, heavenly host\\".

Yan'an became the capital of the communists after the Xian Incident in 1936.Mao Tse Tung Ruler of Red China by Robert Payne, p.175 It became famous in this role during the Sino-Japanese War and throughout World War II, until its capture in 1947. (Before taking over Yan'an, Mao had been based at Bao'an.) In 1947, there was only minimal communist resistance, as most of the communists had already fled in advance in a strategic withdrawal to lure Hu to the Northwest. With the outbreak of full-scale civil war between the Communists and Nationalists in early 1947, Xi Zhongxun remained in northwestern China to coordinate the protection and then recapture of the Yan'an Soviet Area.[2] As political commissar, Xi and commander Zhang Zongxun defeated the Nationalists west of Yan'an at the Battle of Xihuachi in March 1947.[2] After Yan'an fell to Hu Zongnan on March 19, 1947, Xi worked on the staff of Peng Dehuai in the battles to retake Yan'an and capture northwest China. Many high-level Communist leaders were forced to flee their lost Capital, and Chiang Kai-shek declared final victory. KMT forces were only able to hold Yan'an for about a week, and PLA forces rapidly recaptured it. The KMT commitment to conventional-style warfare with a focus on capturing fixed political capitals as objectives, immobilized a large KMT army in the useless Northwest front, making them impotent for the more important mobile campaigns in the East.

He is a hurdles race champion and has won many awards – even beating the national record in a local sports meet. He and his fellow athlete friends get intensive training from their coach Devaraj (Aadukalam Naren) to participate in an important sports meet in Kolkata, the winners of which will qualify for the next major national sports event. A flashback reveals that Pughazh has Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, which prevents his blood from clotting following any injury. If he gets even a small scratch, he might bleed to death. His father Subramaniam (Jayaprakash) is a constable at the local police station who is very protective of him, has high hopes that he will advance well in life, and make a name for himself as an athlete. Gayathri Venugopal (Sri Divya), a college student who lives in Chennai, finds out that her friend is being harassed on the phone every night by a guy. Gayathri decides to take action by calling him up and threatening him in foul language. However, due to a mix-up, she ends up calling Pughazh in Thanjavur instead. The next day, she realizes her mistake and apologizes to Pughazh on the phone. As a joke, he asks her to top up his mobile phone account, and she quickly does so to make up for it. He then pesters her successfully for several days day for further credit for his mobile phone account until he introduces himself and tells her that he will not call and annoy her anymore. Even though they both have not seen each other's faces before, Gayathri realizes that she likes him and initiates their next communication. The Calcutta sports meet gets unexpectedly relocated to Chennai instead. Hence, Devaraj decides to go to Chennai with Pughazh and the rest of the team a few days early and train there, which was perfect for Pughazh to make plans to meet up with Gayathri. Gayathri's brother Dinesh Venugopal (Thirumurugan) gets involved in an counterfeit money scam and calls the cops on the criminal gang who manufactures the currency notes without revealing his identity. The right-hand man in the criminal gang falls for Gayathri when he sees her. The leader of the gang goes to Gayathri's house to speak to her parents to get her married off to his favorite henchman, but Dinesh intervenes and threatens to go to the police, in the process revealing that he is the one who called the cops on the gang. The gang decides to murder Dinesh. When the henchmen are chasing Dinesh, he gets a lift from Pughazh, who is on his way to meet Gayathri on his bike, lying to him that his sister is in the hospital. Due to stress, Dinesh forgets to thank Pughazh when he gets dropped off, but the gang members get a good look at Pughazh, thinking that he intentionally helped Dinesh escape. They find Pughazh, who is still on his way to meet Gayathri, and try to beat him up. However, he fights back and beats them up without getting a scratch on him. During the fight, he hurls one of the gang members, who accidentally falls on Gayathri, who is also in her way to see Pughazh. She gets knocked off her scooty, and her side mirror breaks. She calls Pughazh's mobile just as he is finishing off the fight. They both see each other for the first time. Pughazh immediately gets a liking to her and her beauty, but Gayathri gets upset, thinking that he is a rowdy. Pughazh is still able to get in the good books of Gayathri and Dinesh by seeing them again during Gayathri's birthday. She invites him to his house, where on Gayathri gets more romantically involved with Pughazh. Meanwhile, after further altercations, the gangsters track and kill Dinesh. In retaliation to Pughazh's beating of the gangsters, they beat Devaraj, who tries to get help from the police. The DCP gives a gun to Pughazh hidden from everyone so that he can once for all finish the gangs activities using Pughazh's motivated intentions to save Devaraj. He is tracked again by the gangsters, who try to harm his friends and Devaraj, but Pughazh fights them off and finally kills them with the gun that he has hidden in his shoes. The next day, he enters the competition, but a fake athlete planted by the gangsters earlier inflicts a cut on his arm. He still runs through the hurdles and ends up unconscious as he crosses the finish line. The final tally shows him winning the hurdles race in a photo finish ending by .01 seconds. The final scenes show Gayathri as his wife watching Pughazh winning the gold medal in the Asian games, following which he also gets the post of DSP in Thanjavur.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Louisiana voters chose 10 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Louisiana was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Louisiana, with just under 99 percent of the electorate voting only for either the Democratic or Republican parties, though eight parties appeared on the ballot. Most parishes in Louisiana voted in majority for Reagan a particularly strong turn out, even in this typically conservative state. Notable exceptions to the trend were New Orleans's highly populated Orleans Parish, and a conglomeration of heavily black parishes along the Mississippi River. These “Black Belt” parishes have formed Louisiana's Democratic stronghold since the Voting Rights Act, while the southern Black Belt has been the most Democratic part of Louisiana in presidential elections ever since the Dixiecrat bolt. Louisiana weighed in for this election as 2% more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which St. John the Baptist Parish voted for a Republican presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice- President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970s, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Louisiana with a resounding 22 point sweep-out landslide. Reagan did better in the West than in the Deep South, but still pulled well ahead of Mondale with Southern voters during the election. While Louisiana typically votes conservative, the election results in Louisiana are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this claim to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Louisiana, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Louisiana and elsewhere.

He studied art under his father, and in 1826 accompanied him to Italy. After seven years, Wilson returned to Edinburgh, where he practised as an architect, and was for some time teacher of ornament and design in the school of art. In 1835 he was elected Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy, resigning in 1858. In 1840 he visited the continent to make a report to government on fresco painting. When William Dyce, director and secretary of the recently established schools of art at Somerset House, resigned in 1843, Wilson, who had been director of the Edinburgh school, was appointed his successor. His position there was not much more comfortable than Dyce's had been, and in 1848 he also resigned. In 1849 Wilson became headmaster of the new Glasgow School of Design. In 1864 the Board of Trade masterships were suppressed and Wilson was pensioned, but continued to live in Glasgow for some years longer, doing architectural work. In 1869 Wilson and his family left Scotland and settled at Florence, where he was involved with a large literary and artistic circle. For services to art, the cross of the Corona d'Italia was conferred upon him by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. He died at Florence on 3 July 1882. Works His pictorial work was principally landscape in watercolour. He also etched a number of book illustrations, including for Paolo Pifferi's Viaggio Antiquario (Roma, 1832), and James Wilson's Voyage round the Coasts of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1842). While in Edinburgh Wilson wrote with William Dyce, a pamphlet addressed to Lord Meadowbank, The Best Means of ameliorating the Arts and Manufactures of Scotland. In Glasgow he was occupied for nearly 10 years under the Board of Trade in superintending the filling of the windows of Glasgow Cathedral with Munich pictures in coloured glass. He selected the subjects and wrote a description of the work, which went through numerous editions. Wilson was interested in Italian art, on which he wrote, and particularly in Michelangelo Buonarroti, on whom he published a biography (London and Florence, 1876; 2nd edit. London, 1881).

It also lobbies the U.S. government, mainly in the areas of landfill regulation, rules regarding truck drivers, and taxes. Founded in 1962, the current organization is the result of a merger of Environmental Industry Associations and its sub-associations, the National Solid Wastes Management Association and the Waste Equipment Technology Association that occurred in November 2013. The NWRA includes interest groups that focus on landfills, recycling, and healthcare waste businesses as well as groups for younger members and women.

Slow Down to Get Around  The “Slow Down to Get Around” program encourages motorists to drive safely and slowly around the trucks collecting the trash and recycling from bins. (Many deaths and injuries of waste collectors occur when the workers are struck by drivers speeding around their vehicles.) NWRA adopted the program and partnered with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to create a public service announcement video. To augment this, the association lobbies individual states to pass legislation that creates a speed limit around collection vehicle or mandates that motorists move over one lane as they pass them. Such laws now exist in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  2019 shooting incident  A potential double homicide took place at the Crystal City/National Landing headquarters of the NWRA on August 28, 2019.

Known colloquially as \\"St Bart's\\", the parish is in the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and is well known as belonging to the Anglo-Catholic or High Church tradition. Its congregation is active in various ministries around Richmond and beyond. It has an opportunity shop which operates out of the parish hall. Location The church and adjacent hall complex are located at 290 Burnley Street, Richmond, on the western side of Burnley Street at the corner of Boyd Street, halfway between Swan Street and Bridge Road. Although St Bartholomew's is the Anglican parish church of Burnley, the parish land and buildings are located in Richmond, as Burnley Street is the suburban boundary: Burnley to the east and Richmond to the west. Early history In 1870, land was granted to the Anglican Church by the Victorian government. In 1883, as settlement in the area had developed fully, a committee was formed to raise funds for the purpose of constructing a new church in Burnley.St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church, Burnley: a history of the first 100 years 1885-1985. Burnley: the Church, 1985. The decision to name the new church after St Bartholomew is thought to have been a result of two factors: one of the predominant local industries in Burnley in the 1880s was tanning (St Bartholomew is the patron saint of tanners) and the meeting which led to the erection of the first wooden church building took place in August; St Bartholomew's feast day is 24 August. Original buildings First church building The original wooden St Bartholomew's Church building in 1885. The original parish land was on the south-eastern corner of Swan Street and Burnley Street The first church building, a Gothic style wooden hall, was formally opened on 22 January 1885 at the south-eastern corner of Swan Street and Burnley Street, adjacent to the present Burnley railway station.St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church, Burnley: a history of the first 100 years 1885-1985. Burnley: the Church, 1985. This building served both as a Sunday school hall and place of worship, and was served initially by clergy from neighbouring St Stephen's Church, Richmond. Rapid growth in the parish meant that pressure mounted for St Bartholomew's to be made a separate parish. This was achieved in 1890, when the Parish of Burnley was constituted and the Reverend Henry James Powell was inducted as the first vicar of Burnley. A measure of Powell's success in his new role can be seen in building extensions: within twelve months it was necessary to double the size of the church. The collapse of the economic boom in Melbourne, and the long economic depression throughout the 1890s, meant that plans to build a brick church building did not eventuate until 1908. Second church building St Bartholomew's Church, Burnley in 1910. Designed by the Melbourne architectural firm of Thomas Watts and Sons, the building was demolished in 1925 and many materials reused in the new church building on the relocated parish land. The new brick church building was designed by the well-known Melbourne architectural firm of Thomas Watts and Sons. A founder of the Victorian Institute of Architecture, Thomas Watts had been responsible for some lavish Victorian-era mansions in Melbourne's inner suburbs and was soon to direct the relocation of St James' Old Cathedral to its present site in West Melbourne. Watts' design for the new St Bartholomew's Church, in the Arts and Crafts movement style, included an entrance porch facing Swan Street and a tower with an octagonal spire at the north-west corner. The foundation stone was laid in July 1910 and the new church building was dedicated and opened December the same year. The original wooden building remained in use as the parish hall. Present church building and hall complex The parish land was relocated in 1925 to the present site on the north-western corner of Burnley and Boyd Streets. Various factors contributed to this decision: most notably the 1910 building had been weakened by ground vibrations generated by being situated between the busy tramway in Swan Street and the railway line directly behind the original property. Further difficulties were raised by the heavy industry then still in the neighbourhood. The limitation on the size of the site made expansion of the buildings to accommodate additional activities, such as a parish kindergarten, impossible. By the 1920s the original location was no longer central to the majority of worshippers, an issue raised as early as 1915, and a quieter location was also considered desirable. The relocation was accomplished by the purchase and demolition of several workers' cottages at the corner of Burnley and Boyd Streets.http://www.stbarts-burnley.org/about The present St Bartholomew's Church, Burnley in the late 1920s. The parish land was relocated to the present site, at the corner of Burnley and Boyd Streets, in 1925 and the new church and hall buildings opened in 1926. Gawler & Drummond, prolific and prominent Melbourne architects whose later work was to include the Grainger Museum at the University of Melbourne, prepared the plans for a new brick church building and adjacent hall complex; the substantial hall complex is located immediately to the south of the church. As many of the construction materials from the Swan Street church building were reused, including the bricks, flooring and roofing both internally and externally, the church building features an unusual blend of architectural styles, representing both Arts and Crafts and early Art Deco. Elements of Thomas Watts and Sons' Arts and Crafts designs were copied for the four-bay nave, transepts and chancel with adjacent vestry and organ chamber. However, the crenellated brick bell tower, baptistery and \\"west\\" front facing Burnley Street show some features of early Art Deco design. The pews, choir stalls, pulpit, memorials, pipe organ, stained glass windows, leadlights, and altar from the Swan Street church were also transferred to the present church building.St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church, Burnley: a history of the first 100 years 1885-1985.

Burnley: the Church, 1985. The church was subject to major rectification work in 2013. The church building was underpinned, drainage installed and the ground surrounding the church was sealed by paved concrete. Bell tower St Bartholomew's bell tower, a local landmark, houses a set of six bells, cast by Whitechapel Bell Foundry, London, in 2014. The bells were consecrated by the Archbishop of Melbourne, Philip Freier, on 24 August 2014, on the Feast of St Bartholomew. The tenor bell, tuned to D, weighs 203 kg. The bell tower was renovated in 2015 and the new bells were hung in April 2015. The first ¼ peal was rung on Sunday 26 April 2015. The bell tower formerly housed a peal of eight bells, which were cast and installed between 1927 and 1929 by the local firm of John Danks & Son.St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church, Burnley: a history of the first 100 years 1885-1985. Burnley: the Church, 1985. The peal was commissioned as a result of a legacy from Agnes Challingsworth, whose family presumably ran the engineering works along the Burnley railway line; the inscribed parapet \\"A. Challingsworth\\" is still partially observable. The first bell was dedicated on 6 March 1927. A further seven bells (funded by Agnes Challingsworth's bequest) were blessed at Evensong on 3 March 1929. The bells were rung for the first time by a band of ringers from St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. The tenor (or the largest) bell weighs approximately 256 kg and the weights range in size down to the treble (or smallest) which weighs approximately 40 kg. The eight Burnley bells were originally hung \\"dead\\", or immovable, from two parallel girders. They were sounded by the Danks' \\"Patent Clapper and Trigger\\", which obviated the need for the bell to be swung. Instead, by pulling a rope the clapper was impelled against the inner face of the bell. This had one very important advantage: in the absence of a team of eight ringers the bells could be sounded by four ringers each handling two ropes. In 1988, to mark the Australian Bicentennial, six of the bells were converted to \\"full circle\\" swinging operation from the original chiming operation. The original metal tower louvres were then replaced with wooden shutters which can be opened or closed to alter decibel levels and the ringing chamber was made accessible by a spiral staircase. Wayside Calvary On 11 November 1956, the wayside Calvary outside the \\"west\\" front of the church on Burnley Street was dedicated by the vicar, the Revd Father Lyle McIntyre.http://www.stbarts-burnley.org/timeline Stained glass windows Like many church buildings, the windows in St Bartholomew's Church come from many different eras and display various architectural and artistic styles. The stained glass windows behind the high altar depicting Saint Bartholomew are the work of the Melbourne glass studio of Brooks, Robinson & Co. and are from the demolished Swan Street church building.St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church, Burnley: a history of the first 100 years 1885-1985. Burnley: the Church, 1985. Most of the remaining windows were also brought from the Swan Street church building and consist of Arts and Crafts leadlights, incorporating green \\"bottle\\" glass with pink borders, casting a distinctive light across the interior.http://www.ohta.org.au/organs/organs/BurnleyStBarts.html There are also two rose windows located high in the \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" transepts and other more modern stained glass at the rear of the church, both near the baptistery and in the entrance porch. A stained glass window depicting the crucifixion, originally from Holy Trinity Church, Port Melbourne, was installed sometime in the early 2000s. It has since been removed and reinstalled into the new church at Port Melbourne.

Domestic Animal Diversity Information System of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Accessed May 2014. is an autochthonous donkey breed from the Terra de Miranda region of northeast Portugal. Appearance The Miranda donkey is born with coat that appears black, but will shed out to become brown. It is tall, at the withers, has long hairy ears, large hooves, pangare markings around its eyes, muzzle and underline, broad forehead, small eyes with projecting orbital arcades, large and strong legs, heavy neck, unobtrusive withers, short and muscular back, and a powerful chest. Miranda donkeys are distinguished from common donkeys by longer hair, and they are considered more social and docile. The development of the breed's characteristics reflects the region where they developed: isolated environmental conditions, agricultural characteristics of the soil, weather that tends to extremes and socioeconomic standards in the region. In 2001 the Miranda donkey was recognized as a distinct breed by the Portuguese Department of Agriculture, and, it was the first donkey breed in Portugal to join the group of asinine indigenous breeds protected by the European Union. It is the only officially recognized donkey breed on Portugal.

Made largely superfluous by mechanization and the end of exploitation of small parcels, they are no longer profitable as work animals, and now are little more than companion animals for the elderly. It is estimated that only 300 Miranda donkeys are now used as farm animals. The majority are now cared for by older farmers, who are then eligible for E.U. subsidies.

The villages have been depopulated. The majority of the donkeys are well-cared for, many owners viewing the animals as part of their family.

The fear is that in the near future support will be withdrawn from the donkeys. The donkey has been used as a metaphor for Portugal, shunted aside by industrial society and existing only on E.U. subsidies.Miranda donkey subsidies retrieved 2013-12-26 There is criticism of the subsidies, as they are felt to dampen the enthusiasm for innovation and modernization.

This is the aim of the preservationists, to keep alive an indigenous breed in order to save a genetic, ecological and cultural heritage unique to Portugal. To commemorate its outdated usage as a mechanisn of travel for gaita-de fole players, a festival is held every July. 20 animals are trekked through two chosen villges accomanied by the bagpipe players and a four day celebration of food, drink and music. In 2015 researchers at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro concluded the Miranda donkey was in danger of extinction over the next 50 years. The major factor was the abandonment of breeding the animal; out of an aging breeding population of 600 animals only 1/2 of the females had foals, and some had only one. Other factors include a high mortality rate among young foals, and a growing tendency of farmers to resort to hybridization and crossings with different breeds. 'Modern uses of the donkey The use of the donkey as an eco-tourism resource is emerging in Portugal. Tourist donkey trekking tours are popular, particularly beneficial for those who could not otherwise negotiate difficult terrain. The re-emergence of fairs, festivals, donkey racing and shows invigorates old local traditions and customs, with the donkey as the tool for education and awareness. This knowledge enhances a tourism targeted to environmental awareness and cultural respect. Arguably less positive for the well-being of the donkey and threatening their \\"symbolic and cultural worth\\" is the use of the animal for industrial donkey milk production.

By royal licence dated 13 March 1821 she was authorised to take and bear the surname and arms of Tollemache instead of those of Manners, and was then described as unmarried. She died at Ham House, without issue, dependent upon the friendship of her companion, Jane Beauchamp. For about 20 years she retired to Hanworth Park with her dogs and her parrot and the occasional company of some children, her youngest nieces and nephews.The Life of Katherine Mansfield Ruth E Mantz and J. Middleton Murry, Illustrated, London, CONSTABLE & COMPANY, 1933, Chapter 1: The Pa Men, page 19 Art John Constable's sketch of Ham House, June 1835 A portrait of Louisa by Sir Joshua Reynolds was engraved by V. Green, and another by Hoppner, as a peasant, has also been engraved. Hoppner's portrait was sold at Messrs. Robinson and Fisher's rooms for 14,050 guineas on 27 June 1901. This portrait originally belonged to Louisa's daughter, Lady Laura Tollemache, from whom it passed to Louisa's granddaughter, Maria, Marchioness of Ailesbury, and finally came into the possession of the latter's daughter-in-law, the Lady Charles Bruce, by whose executors it was sold. Thomas Lawrence's portrait of Lady Louisa was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1794. Louisa was a notable patron of John Constable, entertaining him at Helmingham, Ham House and London residences at Pall Mall and in Piccadilly. Constable's letters make several references to Lady Dysart and he was evidently at ease with the family. Louisa employed his brother, Golding Constable, as gamekeeper at Helingham. Constable painted copies of Reynolds' and Hoppner's works, including a portrait of Louisa dated 1823. Others to derive works from Hoppner, Lawrence and Reynolds portraits of Louisa include Henry Bone, Charles Knight and Richard Smythe. Title Ham House The death of John Manners on 23 September 1792, when Louisa was aged forty-seven, bought the of the Manners' Buckminster estate into the Tollemache family. She succeeded her brother Wilbraham in the earldom of Dysart and barony of Huntingtower on 9 March 1821, aged seventy-five, and on 13 March 1821 she, together with her only unmarried daughter, Laura, was authorised by royal licence to take and bear the surname and arms of Tollemache instead of Manners. Her major inheritance in 1821 had appeared unlikely given her many elder siblings in her younger years. In her middle-age she still had three elder siblings who might have been expected to have had progeny to whom the family title and estates could be passed. However, her eldest surviving-to-adulthood brother Lionel Tollemache, 5th Earl of Dysart had died in 1799 aged 64 with no heirs and her brother Wilbraham Tollemache, 6th Earl of Dysart died in 1821 aged 81, also without any legitimate heirs. Her elder sister Frances also died without surviving children. Thus Louisa, long widowed, came into a substantial inheritance at the age of 75. The Tollemache baronetcy became extinct, but Louisa succeeded to the Earldom of Dysart as the 7th Countess of Dysart in her own right. The estates were divided between her and her younger sister, Lady Jane, with Louisa inheriting Ham House and the surrounding estates in Ham, Petersham and Canbury and Jane receiving Helmingham, Suffolk, Cheshire and Northants. Both families took the name of Tollemache. Death and succession Increasingly blind in her old age, Louisa died at Ham House, Petersham near Richmond-on-Thames, 22 September 1840, aged 95, and was buried at Helmingham on 8 October. She survived her husband by more than half her lifetime and all of her children except her third, Charles. Her will was proved February 1841. She was succeeded by grandson, Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, son of William, Lord Huntingtower.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Voters chose twenty electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Michigan was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Michigan, with just over 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, though several more parties appeared on the ballot. Nearly every county in Michigan voted in majority for Reagan, a particularly strong turn out in what was at the time a critical swing state. Typical for elections in the 1980s, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan turned out somewhat more Democratic, and the Lower Peninsula turned out almost entirely Republican, with the notable exception of Detroit's highly populated Wayne County. Michigan weighed in for this election as 0.77% more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which Washtenaw County, Genesee County, and Marquette County voted for a Republican Presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for what he charged was his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice-President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan campaigning in Saginaw, Michigan with Bill Schuette and Jack Lousma Reagan won the election in Michigan with a decisive 19% landslide. While Michigan was typically a contested battleground state at the time, with a large black population and a heavy presence of organized labor balanced by a large rural and suburban population, the election results in Michigan are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. The election of 1984 is the final election where Michigan was won by the Republican Party with a double-digit margin, with George H.W. Bush winning the state with a single- digit margin in 1988. The state then became reliably Democratic between 1992 and Donald Trump's narrow victory in 2016. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American Great Lakes States, at large, post Reagan. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Michigan, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Michigan and elsewhere. As of 2020, this marks the last time a Republican presidential candidate has carried Washtenaw County.

Thirty-one more people in the pub were injured. The subsequent investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was fuel starvation due to incorrect operation of the fuel system. Accident The helicopter took off from its base at Glasgow City Heliport (which at the time operated from Stobcross Quay adjacent to the SECC) at 20:45 on 29 November 2013. The pilot was 51-year-old David Traill; Traill had flown Chinook helicopters in the RAF for 20 years, latterly as an instructor. He had worked for the police for four years, and had 646 hours of flight experience on the EC135. The helicopter carried two police observers, PCs Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins. On takeoff it carried of fuel. The flight, callsign SP99, was initially involved in the search for a suspected trespasser on railway lines around Eglinton Toll. It was then tasked to Dalkeith in Midlothian, around east of its base, before returning to the Glasgow area. A few minutes before the crash, the pilot had received air traffic control clearance to return to Glasgow City Heliport. At 22:22, approximately east of its home base, the helicopter came down on the flat roof of the Clutha bar in Stockwell Street (' is Latin for the River Clyde, which is adjacent to the pub). No distress call was made. A ska band, Esperanza, was playing in the pub at the time of the crash and there were reported to be around 120 people in the building, some of whom were trapped by the collapsing roof. The three helicopter occupants and six people on the ground were killed. Thirty-two others were injured, twelve seriously, one of whom died some days later. One witness, Gordon Smart, editor of the Scottish Sun, stated that he did not see a fireball or hear an explosion, and that the engine seemed to be misfiring. Aircraft The accident aircraft was a twin-engined Eurocopter EC135 T2+, serial 0546, registered G-SPAO and manufactured in 2007. At the time of the accident it had flown for 6,351 hours and made 9,385 landings. The helicopter's Certificate of Airworthiness was valid until 4 September 2018. Emergency response 2008 view of the accident site; the Clutha pub is the cream building in the foreground The building is a former tenement which used to have multiple storeys, but after a fire in the 1960s the upper storeys were removed. The walls were therefore much thicker than would be expected for a building of this height, and the complex construction of the roof complicated the search and rescue operation. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deployed 125 firefighters to the scene rescuing people trapped in the building for hours after the incident. The Scottish Ambulance Service sent upwards of 25 ambulances to the scene along with 2 Special Operations Response Teams that specialise in major and inaccessible incidents. They worked throughout the next two days searching and retrieving people from within the Clutha. Urban search and rescue firefighters were also in attendance to shore up unstable parts of the building and to excavate collapsed areas. People rescued from the scene were initially taken by the emergency services to a nearby Holiday Inn hotel. Labour Party MP Jim Murphy was interviewed as he was passing soon after the crash. 32 people were taken for treatment to local hospitals including Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, a dozen with injuries classed as serious. An emergency phone number was set up for anyone concerned about family and relatives who may have been in and around the pub, and Glasgow City Council established a family reception centre to \\"provide advice and counselling to relatives of people who have been injured or people whose relatives are unaccounted for\\". One of the seriously injured victims died from his injuries on 12 December. Reactions Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond tweeted confirmation that the helicopter was a police aircraft. He subsequently described the crash as \\"a black day for Glasgow and for Scotland\\". Glasgow MSP and Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, British Prime Minister David Cameron, opposition leader Ed Miliband, the Queen, and Pope Francis all publicly expressed their condolences. On the day following the crash, planned St. Andrew's Day celebrations in Glasgow's George Square were cancelled, and flags were flown at half-mast on Scottish Government buildings. Scottish football clubs held a pre-match minute's silence. Special services were held at Glasgow's St Andrew's Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral. The Prince of Wales visited the crash site on 6 December and met emergency service personnel. Police investigated offensive, racist or sectarian comments made about the crash on social media. A weekend of fundraising events for the families of the victims and the emergency services was held on 3–5 January 2014. Investigation The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which is responsible for investigating aircraft crashes in the United Kingdom, launched an investigation into the cause of the accident. Assistance in the investigation was provided by the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation and the French aviation incident investigation bodies (the manufacturers of the helicopter and its engine are based in Germany and France).Eurocopter, Safety Information Notice No. 2665-S-00-Rev-1, 3 December 2013 The American National Transportation Safety Board (representing the state of the manufacturer of the engines' FADEC controls), also provided assistance. The wreckage of the helicopter arrived at the AAIB's headquarters at Farnborough, Hampshire on 3 December. The aircraft was not fitted with flight data recorders but the electronics fitted to the aircraft could contain data helpful in determining the cause of the accident. Preliminary findings The AAIB issued a preliminary report of its findings on 9 December. It confirmed that the rotor blades were attached, but neither they nor the fenestron tail rotor were rotating at the time of impact. No evidence of engine or gearbox failure was found and there were around of fuel still on board. The aircraft struck the building with \\"a high rate of descent and low/negligible forward speed\\" and no part of it detached in flight. It came to rest approximately upright. On 14 February 2014, the AAIB issued a Special Bulletin on the accident. It stated that the cause of the accident was that both engines had flamed out, but the reasons that they had done so had not yet been determined. The report stated that one of the two tanks supplying the engines was empty and the other contained of fuel. A third tank, known as the main tank, was reported to contain of fuel but the transfer pumps supplying this fuel to the two engine fuel tanks were found with their switches in the \\"off\\" position. Final report The final accident report was published in October 2015. It found the main cause of the accident to be fuel starvation due to the fuel transfer pumps being switched off \\"for unknown reasons.\\" This resulted in the engines flaming out despite there being of usable fuel remaining in the main tank. A failure to land within ten minutes of the first low-fuel warning, as prescribed by emergency checklists, and a failure to achieve a successful autorotation after both engines failed were cited as additional causal factors. The AAIB also identified as contributory factor that the radar altimeter and the steerable landing light were both unpowered following the engine flame-out, leading to a loss of height information and reduced visual cues during the autorotation manoeuvre. Seven safety recommendations were made. Fatal accident inquiry In 2017 the Crown Office announced that a fatal accident inquiry would be held into the crash. The Crown Office also confirmed that no criminal charges would be laid following an investigation by Police Scotland. Preliminary hearings were held on 3 October and 4 December 2018, then on 11 January 5 February and 3 April 2019. The inquiry began on 8 April 2019 in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground, and concluded on 5 August. The inquiry was mandatory in respect of the crew of the helicopter, and discretionary in respect of the customers of the Clutha Vaults. The inquiry sat for 31 days between 8 April and 18 July. Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull provided a written determination which was published on 30 October 2019. No recommendations were made. Aftermath The Clutha The Clutha pub partially reopened in July 2015, with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon attending the opening ceremony. Legal proceedings Civil proceedings against Bond Aviation Group were begun by victims' lawyers Irwin Mitchell in January 2014, when they sent a letter of claim to the company's legal representatives. Irwin Mitchell partner Elaine Russell alleged the company had \\"strict liability... for material loss or damage... to any person or property on land or water\\", under Section 76 (2) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. Civil aviation As a direct result of the accident and recommendations made by the AAIB, the Civil Aviation Authority mandated that all police helicopters would be fitted with Cockpit Voice Recorders and Flight Data Recorders. Implementation to be completed by 31 March 2020.

The chapel is located on the eastern side of Springvale Road, just south of the intersection with Cheltenham Road, in Keysborough. Architecturally and artistically the Haileybury Chapel is one of the finest and most distinctive Australasian sacred buildings from the last quarter of the 20th century. Designed by the noted Australian architect Philip Cox, the Haileybury Chapel features extensive artwork, including over fifty stained glass mosaic windows by the celebrated Australian artist Leonard French. The chapel is also noted for its fine acoustic, which is especially suited to musical performance. History The exterior of the Haileybury Chapel showing the external three storey Ante- chapel wall and Bell Tower to the left. The chapel was officially opened by the Governor of Victoria, His Excellency Davis McCaughey, on 18 October 1987.Commemorative plaque at Haileybury Chapel main entrance The Chapel was named the David Bradshaw Chapel on 13 August 2000, after David M. Bradshaw, the Headmaster of Haileybury from 1954 to 1973. Design and architecture View to the Choir Gallery in the eastern wall, one of the four independent walls in the building. View across the Sanctuary showing the recessed sanctuary wall and exposed timber trusses below the ceiling. The Haileybury Chapel was designed by Philip Cox, a leading Australian architect. At the time of completing the project, Cox wrote:Haileybury Chapel. Brochure. Haileybury, Melbourne: 1987. The design features four large independent brick walls, each three storeys high, joined with large glass panels and a high timber ceiling with exposed trusses. These walls each feature specific elements of the building: the Ante-chapel and Vestry (northern), Sanctuary (western), Pipe Organ (southern) and Choir with Bell Tower (eastern). Externally, each wall is progressively higher than the other; the northern is the lowest and the eastern, featuring the Bell Tower, the highest. The building also pays subtle homage to traditional sacred architectural forms with the inclusion of features such as blind arcading and a double-storey Ante-chapel in the northern wall. Symbolism can be read throughout Cox's architectural design; the Sanctuary wall, for example, has twelve small windows symbolic of the Twelve Apostles. The sanctuary is both raised and recessed, indicating the importance of the communion table, lectern and pulpit. Clear glass above the sanctuary recess, invisible from the nave, floods the wall above the reredos with natural light; this is symbolic of humankind's continual search for the \\"higher things\\". The nave, or main seating area of the Chapel, features a high timber ceiling with exposed trusses symbolic of the upturned keel of a ship. The word nave, from the Latin 'navis' (ship), was historically suggested by the keel shape of the vaulting found in wood or stone in the ceilings of churches and cathedrals around the world; a ship is an ancient Christian symbol signifying humankind's spiritual journey on the seas of life. Leonard French artwork Stained glass windows Melbourne-born artist Leonard French is best known for his monumental murals, tapestries and stained glass mosaic windows which \\"grace the façades, ceilings and walls of many leading cultural, educational and spiritual edifices in Australia and overseas.\\" The Haileybury Chapel features one of Leonard French's most extensive collections of stained glass mosaic windows. Other significant examples of Leonard French's stained glass work are at the National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Library in Canberra. The impact of the socialist Mexican muralists José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera during French's early years as an artist was formative. However, his esteem for the French painter Fernand Léger gave rise to his lifelong commitment to the philosophy of art at the service of the common man, and the idea of the struggle and spiritual journey of a hero - a quest which could be applied to all individuals in search of a path through life. Many of the French's artworks are drawn from literary sources, including The Bible, Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey and most notably, Evelyn Waugh’s biography of the 16th-century English martyr Edmund Campion: eternal legends imbued with the notion of the struggle and spiritual journey of a hero. The Haileybury Chapel features over fifty stained glass mosaic windows of varying shapes and sizes, rich in symbolism and historical reference. Christian imagery abounds alongside the broader theme of Creation. Reredos The large reredos, hung in the sanctuary, is also the work of French. The ornamental beauty and shimmering luminosity of the textural surface of French’s paintings create a richness of meaning and visual impact. His emblematic use of recognisable iconographic symbols – including the Celtic Cross, circle, dome, serpent, bird and fish – together with a rich layering of paint and glazing, coalesce to form complex works of art of great depth and beauty. The Haileybury Chapel reredos exhibits French at his finest, and is one of the artistic highlights of the Chapel interior paying homage to French's unique reinterpretation of Mexican muralism. The complementary visual effect of the reredos, combined with the extensive collection of stained glass around the building in an identical artistic style, is outstanding. Paccard chapel bells The two-bell swinging peal, with a musical interval of a minor third, was installed in 1988. The bells were cast by the leading French bell foundry Paccard Fonderie de Cloches et Carillons (Paccard Bell Foundry) in Annecy, France. There are no inscriptions on the bells. The larger bell, with the musical note E, weighs and has a mouth diameter of . The smaller bell, with the musical note G, weighs and has a mouth diameter of . The bells are located in the Bell Tower at the north-eastern corner of the building and are struck hourly and pealed regularly for services and concerts.

It took part World Gliding Championships of 1956 but retired early after sustaining damage. Design and development The Bruni 3V-1 Eolo, sometimes known as the SIAI-Marchetti Eolo 3V-1, was a high performance sailplane designed by Giovanni Bruni in Italy in the early 1950s. The 3V-1 was built by a collaboration between SIAI-Marchetti and the Alessandro Passeleva Soaring Sports Club of Vergiate. The high performance sailplane, intended for competitions and record breaking, was an all wooden cantilever mid-wing aircraft, with a high aspect ratio, single spar wing which was sharply tapered in plan and mounted with 3° of dihedral. The wing was covered with unusually thick plywood to maintain the laminar profile and its tips carried \\"salmons\\", small streamlined bodies intended to minimise induced drag. Narrow slotted control surfaces filled the whole trailing edge, each occupying about a third of the span; the outermost were conventional ailerons, followed by a second set of ailerons which drooped when the flaps on the inboard third of the wing were lowered. The Eolo had a pair of mid-chord airbrakes mounted just behind the wing spar, each with sixteen blades deployed above and below the wing surfaces. In the initial version there were inboard leading edge tanks that could hold of water ballast. The Eolo's fuselage was a wood framed, ply skinned semi-monocoque of elliptical cross-section. Behind a pointed nose the pilot sat under a long, one piece canopy which extended rearwards almost to the wing leading edge where it was smoothly blended into the fuselage. It had a straight tapered V-tail with surfaces at 110°, ending in salmons, like the wings. The elevators were equipped with trim tabs. The glider had a monowheel undercarriage, equipped with a brake, which retracted behind two doors. There was also a sprung tailskid and a small protective nose skid. The Eolo first flew in August 1955. A year later it competed in the World Gliding Championships held at Saint-Yan but had to retire after an accident on the third day.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. State voters chose eleven electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Wisconsin was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with incumbent Vice President and former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. It was the last time Wisconsin had voted for a Republican in a presidential election until Donald Trump won in 2016.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Wisconsin, with over 99 percent of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, though eight additional parties appeared on the ballot. Most counties in Wisconsin voted in majority for Reagan, a particularly strong turn out in this rapidly liberalizing state. Notable exceptions to this trend were Milwaukee's Milwaukee County, almost entirely Native American Menominee County, and a few counties in the far North corner of the State, centered around Bayfield County. All of these have been Democratic strongholds since at least 1960 and more typically since the New Deal. Wisconsin weighed in for this election as 10 points more Democratic than the national average. , this is the last election in which Eau Claire County, La Crosse County, Rock County, and Iowa County voted for a Republican presidential candidate. Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice-President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Wisconsin by a solid 9 point margin. While Wisconsin typically voted more conservative at the time, the election results in Wisconsin are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. The election of 1984 was the most recent election where Wisconsin has turned out for the Republican Party until Donald Trump won the state in the 2016 election. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American Great Lakes States, at large, post Reagan. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this claim to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Wisconsin, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Wisconsin and elsewhere.

Falls Township Volunteer Fire Department Inc. is located in Muskingum County, Ohio west of Zanesville, Ohio. Falls Township Fire Department is a combination part-time/volunteer department that provides fire protection and EMS for Falls Township and Muskingum Township. Falls Township operates out of three stations and has a fleet consisting of two fire engines, three dual purpose fire engine/rescues, one aerial ladder platform, three brush fire trucks, three ALS ambulances, two utility vehicles, and two boats.  History  Falls Township Volunteer Fire Department Inc. was established in 1963. Before that time Falls Township was protected by Zanesville Fire Department, National Trail Fire Department, and Frazeysburg Fire Department. The first fire station was built by the township hall at 3095 Dillon Falls Road, Zanesville, Ohio, which is still the current Station 301. The original building was a two bay building that housed a fire engine and a tanker truck. The first fire engine was a 1962 John Bean on a Ford chassis and was numbered Engine #1. That truck was in service until 1999 when it was replaced by a new engine. The tanker truck was number Tanker #2 which was built from an old fuel truck. As the township grew the department found a need to add on to the station. In the early 1970s two more bays were added to the back of Station 301, and in 1972 Engine #5 was purchased. In 1981 the Muskingum Country Commissioner had the need to start an EMS program in the county. The county purchased ambulances for Falls Township Fire Department, Dresden Fire Department, Harrison Township Fire Department, and Washington Township Fire Department. Once again, there was a need to add on to Station 301. A lean to the length of the station was constructed onto the side of the station to house the ambulance. Today that area houses the brush fire truck, offices, and a day room/class room. In the mid-1980s there was a need to build a station in the northern portion of Falls Township. To meet this need Station 302 was built at 525 Richey Road, Zanesville, Ohio. Station 302 currently houses one fire engine/rescue, one ALS ambulance, one brush fire truck, and one boat.  Staffing  Today Falls Township Volunteer Fire Department Inc. is a combination department that has both volunteers and part-time employees.

He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate of the United States on November 14, 2013. Brewster was the first person in a same-sex marriage to represent the United States at the ambassadorial level in the Americas. He left office on January 20, 2017. Ambassador Brewster currently serves as a Principal for Insignias Global, an international political and brand advisory firm. He also serves on the Advisory Board for the Atlantic Council, Parliamentarians for Global Action and the National Democratic institute. Early life and education Brewster was born in 1960. A native of Lindale, Texas, Brewster earned an A.A. in marketing at Tyler Junior College in Texas in 1980 and completed his education in business administration at Texas A&M; University in 1983. Career Brewster is an internationally recognized diplomat and business leader. His career began with marketing and management positions in the Dallas area. In 1996, he moved to Chicago to work for a real estate investment trust, General Growth Properties, where he eventually became senior vice president for marketing and communications. In 2010, Brewster started his own company, SB&K; Global, also based in Chicago. In addition to his business career, Brewster served as the National Co-Chair of the LGBT Leadership Council for the Democratic National Committee and held the same role in the Obama 2012 campaign. As a fundraiser for President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, Brewster and Satawake raised over $1,000,000 in donations. Brewster was also involved with the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) for more than 30 years and served on its National Board of Directors. President Obama nominated Brewster for the post of Ambassador to the Dominican Republic on June 21, 2013, to replace Raul Humberto Yzaguirre, who resigned in May citing health reasons. The U.S. embassy in Santo Domingo noted the nomination on its website: \\"This nomination, given the close relationship between Mr. Brewster and President Obama, points to the importance of the Dominican Republic to the United States.\\" When asked how the government of the Dominican Republic viewed the nomination in light of Brewster's sexual orientation, César Pina Toribio, legal advisor to Dominican President Danilo Medina said the nomination demonstrated that the government had been consulted and not objected. On October 31, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee cleared the nominated and sent it to the full Senate for consideration. The Senate unanimously confirmed his appointment as Ambassador to the Dominican Republic on November 14 and he was sworn in by Vice-President Joe Biden at the White House on November 22. On the evening of that day, Brewster married his partner of 25 years, luxury real estate executive, author and social activist, Bob J. Satawake. The ceremony and reception were held at the Hay-Adams Hotel, near the White House. Upon arriving in the Dominican Republic, Brewster posted a video introducing himself and his husband on the embassy's web page. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic The nomination of an openly gay U.S. ambassador aroused controversy in the Dominican Republic. During a July 2013 press conference, Cardinal Jesús López, referred to Brewster as a maricón, equivalent to \\"faggot\\" in American English. U.S. Embassy spokesman Daniel Lewis Foote told reporters that Brewster was nominated \\"because of his skills as an international businessman and his ideas on democracy and human rights,\\" adding, \\"Brewster arrives as an ambassador, he's not coming here as an activist for the gay community.\\" The Vatican's ambassador to the Dominican Republic welcomed Brewster to the country and told him: \\"If you keep your private life behind the walls of your embassy, you'll be O.K. here\\". On March 24, 2015, Brewster appeared on a panel of six gay U.S. ambassadors and was the only one to report a problematic reception in his host country. He said: \\"We knew that that's not who the Dominican people were as a whole, and I think that was important to us. Bob and I will celebrate 27 years together this year and from that perspective we both have a very strong Christian belief and so nobody is going to ever tell me that God doesn't love me.\\" On November 25, 2015, speaking during a Thanksgiving Day luncheon at the American Chamber of Commerce in the Dominican Republic, Brewster discussed joint efforts at improving education and public safety and in supporting investments in small business. He also said the business community needed to pressure the government to make progress in protecting the rights of women and minorities. He praised the efforts of the American Chamber and the DR business community in fighting corruption and said: \\"Every entrepreneur I know, either American or Dominican, mentions corruption as the biggest problem in this country. Corruption is a cancer; it retards growth, adversely affects trade and prevents the fair application of the law.\\" He said it inhibited American investment and urged business leaders to make it an issue at the highest levels of government. He underlined the case of contributions to political campaigns: \\"there is no clean money from dirty people\\". Brewster noted that he had been criticized by some for interfering in Dominican affairs: \\"They say that when I speak, when I call for some action, when I speak in favor of some reform, I am violating the sovereignty of the Dominican Republic\\". He said his comments were essential to his role: \\"My job is to represent President Obama to the Dominican Republic with full authority to protect and defend the interests of the United States, its businesses and its people, while protecting human rights, enforcing international law, and promoting our bilateral relations\\". In words that do not appear in the transcript of the remarks, he was quoted as inviting his critics to match their rhetoric by cutting off their own ties to the U.S., saying they could \\"go to the [U.S.] embassy and turn in their visas\\".. Includes the full text of his remarks. Cardinal Nicolás de Jesús López Rodríguez, Archbishop of Santo Domingo, called Brewster's statements about corruption meddlesome (injerencistas) and accused him of promoting \\"the agenda of the gays, transsexuals, transvestites, and bisexuals (la agenda de los gays, transexuales, travestis y bisexuales). The Cardinal later called Brewster a \\"wife\\" who should stay in the embassy and \\"take care of the house\\", Brewster replied that the Cardinal's comments fostered hatred and marginalization and said that he would concentrate on the embassy's initiatives to promote democracy and ignore the \\"noise\\" (ruido) of his critics. In December 2015, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin sent a letter to Pope Francis that said: \\"In a recent interview Cardinal Rodriguez again described the ambassador as a 'faggot' and falsely claimed the ambassador was setting out to promote 'faggotry' in the Dominican Republic.\\" He asked the pope to prevent further attacks on Brewster by church officials. On March 2, 2016, Brewster announced a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to support a newly formed LGBT Chamber of Commerce of the Dominican Republic to support LGBT business owners. After the announcement, USAID director Alexandria L. Panehal appeared to reference LGBT candidates for public office when discussing her agency's grants. After some objections from a candidate and an election official, the embassy denied the existence any such funding program in the Dominican Republic or any other country. Later in March, the Dominican Council of Evangelical Unity held a press conference where they denounced Brewster and launched a campaign for Brewster's removal using the petition mechanism provided by the White House. The petition asked President Obama to remove Brewster as ambassador \\"for primarily promoting in his official duties an LGBT agenda inconsistent with the Christian cultural values and tradition of the Dominican Republic.\\" The cited his promotion of LGBT tourism and bringing his husband on visits to public schools. They said he was using USAID funds to support LGBT activities. Ambassador Susan Rice commented: \\"He has the full support of this President, this White House and the entire U.S. government and I know he will continue to advocate tirelessly for the interests of the United States in the Dominican Republic. Bigotry in any form is against the universal values that we promote and does not support the social inclusion that we believe is important for a free society to succeed. We will continue to support Ambassador Brewster as he advances universal human rights.\\" President Danilo Medina, who was re-elected for a second term in May 2016, has not commented on Brewster or the charges made by his critics, nor has anyone in his administration. A lawsuit seeking a court order to prevent Brewster and other embassy staff from visiting schools along with the ambassador's husband was dismissed on 5 April 2016. The judge called the suit \\"completely inadmissible\\". In late April, Auxiliary Bishop Victor Masalles said that Brewster's support of LGBT rights in the DR was an instance of \\"ideological colonization\\", a term used by Pope Francis, and that he suspected the U.S. government was pressuring Santo Domingo to modify its constitution. He said Brewster showed \\"an inability to distinguish his activism with his role as an ambassador\\" and that: \\"...we're suffering [from] him as a nation, as a culture, as a country that has its own uses and customs, and its own laws. He's trying to take [away] our right to national self- determination.\\" LGBT activists in the Dominican Republic have credited Brewster with helping to raise their visibility and remove the stigma attached to homosexuality there. A spokesperson for Human Rights First, a U.S.-based advocacy organization that reported on the status of LGBT rights in the country at the end of 2015, said: \\"Everyone seemed to think, even if they had mixed feelings about it, that overall it was a net positive. The presence of Ambassador Brewster has really spurred a larger conversation.\\" One advocate for transgender rights said: \\"The arrival of this ambassador is the biggest thing that could have happened to us\\". Dominican LGBT rights activist Rosanna Marzan, executive director of Diversidad Dominicana, condemned the government's failure to respond to attacks on Brewster and wrote: \\"The attacks on Brewster are also attacks on us\\". She continued: For his work against corruption and defending Human Rights, Ambassador Brewster received numerous awards including 2016 Foreign Policy Magazines 100 Global Thinkers, 2016 OUT 100 and finalist for the Susan Cobb Award presented to top diplomats by the US State Department.

It was granted on 1 January 1965. The arms are largely based on those of Hendon, with additions for other towns merged with it. The lamb in the arms carries a cross standard, however it is not the Christian lamb of God but rather the Jewish pascal lamb, according to the blazon. The lamb as standing on a hill on a blue field is taken directly from the arms of Hendon, where it symbolises the origin of the name Hendon, 'at the high down'. This was used by Hendon since the formation of a local board for the town in 1879. The chief is derived from the arms of East Barnet, where the roses stand for the fighting parties in the battle of Barnet during the War of the Roses. The Saxon crown between the roses is taken from the arms of Middlesex County Council, as a reference to the fact that a large part of this London Borough was once part of that county.Heraldry of the World:BarnetCivic Heraldry of the UK: Barnet The winged airscrew in the crest, from the crest of the Borough of Hendon, refers to the former borough's links with aviation as the headquarters of the Royal Air Force was situated there.

The lion was derived from the Compton family arms, former holders of the Manor of Finchley while the stag symbolised the game once hunted by Tudor monarchs in the forests in this area. The stag can possibly also be seen to refer to the hart supporters in the arms of Hertfordshire County Council; before 1965, the towns of Barnet and East Barnet were situated in Hertfordshire. Both supporters have crosses on them, symbols of the Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, who held the ancient priory in Friern Barnet.Heraldry of the World:BarnetCivic Heraldry of the UK: Barnet The motto, 'unitas efficit ministerium', is Latin for 'unity accomplishes service'.Heraldry of the World:Barnet Blazon Arms: Azure on a Mount in base Vert a Pascal Lamb proper on a Chief per pale Agent and Gules a Saxon Crown Or between two Roses counterchanged barbed and seeded proper.

Op 't Roodt) was a Hungarian/Dutch Roman Catholic priest and Esperantist known for inventing the Cseh method of Esperanto instruction. Biography Cseh, an Esperantist since 1910, became a Catholic priest in 1919. In Sibiu in 1920, he designed the famous Cseh method of Esperanto instruction. Because of the method's success, Cseh was invited to Târgu Mureș, where he led several Esperanto courses. From there he went to Cluj, where he led courses and began to reorganize the Romanian Esperanto movement. In the autumn of 1922, he traveled to Bucharest on the invitation of Henriko Fischer-Galati, with whom he founded the Romanian Esperanto Center (Esperanto-Centro Rumana). He spent two years in București and neighboring cities, teaching and advertising the Esperanto movement. Starting in 1921, Cseh was a chief delegate to the World Esperanto Association. In 1924, his bishop, Count Majláth, gave him leave to dedicate himself completely to the dissemination of Esperanto. In the same year, he became secretary of the Internacia Centra Komitato and was given the task of traveling through various countries to spread Esperanto. He participated in the organization of the Esperanto World Congresses in Geneva in 1925, in Danzig in 1927, and in Budapest in 1929. In the autumn of 1927 he was invited by the mayor of Stockholm and Prince Charles to lead Esperanto courses in Sweden, including in the Swedish parliament. In April 1929 the first printed edition of his course appeared in book form, written in shorthand and published in Stockholm. Having led courses in Estonia, France, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Switzerland, he moved to the Netherlands for good in 1930. Everywhere, his courses were such an extraordinary success that Esperanto magazines began to talk about a \\"renaissance\\" of Esperanto. Thus, demand grew for courses intended for instructors of Esperanto. Cseh led international schools for educators, first in Budapest (1929) and later in Arnhem, Netherlands, for many years. On 24 May 1930 he, , and her husband founded the Internacia Esperanto-Instituto. As a result, the World Esperanto Association became dissatisfied with him, and he was not permitted to participate in the 1931 World Congress in Krakow.Flandra Esperantisto, c. 1932, p. 161. In 1932, he founded and became the editor-in-chief of the Esperanto magazine La Praktiko, which was published until 1970. (In its later years, starting in 1964, the magazine was run by the World Esperanto Association.) In 1931, he traveled to Berlin several times to teach. In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, Cseh and Isbrücker held a secret meeting to found the Universala Ligo, a World Federalist organization which they continued to lead for years. Revocation and reinstatement of priesthood Cseh led successful Esperanto courses for all types of people, unaware that due to concerns about marriages of mixed religions, the current bishop of Harlem, J.D.J. Aengenent, whose diocese included the Hague, prohibited his priests from giving lessons to groups that included both Catholics and Protestants. As a result, Aengenent used his ecclesiastical right to prohibit Cseh from staying in the diocese of Harlem. Cseh's comprehension of Dutch was poor, so he did not fully comprehend Aengenent's order; for this reason, he continued to teach his Esperanto courses as he had before. After some time, Aegenent responded by revoking Cseh's priesthood. In the Huize Royal retirement home where Cseh was living at the time, the leader of the Parish, Father Genemans, visited Cseh to ask him about his life. He decided to take steps to allow Cseh to attain priesthood once again. As a result, on 6 January 1978, Cseh received a touching letter from Monsignor Zwartkruis, then bishop of Harlem, which informed him that his rights as priest had been reinstated. Copies of the letter were sent to the bishop of Rotterdam, Monsignor Simonis, and to the bishop of Transylvania.ĜOJIGA HONORADO DE LA GRANDA ESPERANTO- PIONIRO ANDREO CSEH (from \\"Universala Ligo\\" 1/1978)  The Cseh Method  The Cseh method consists of: # Not using a textbook # Not using the students' native language, but instead explaining new words using words that have already been learned # Having the students answer in unison # Using conversation about current events rather than artificial examples # Thoroughly using humor and jokes # Allowing the students to discover the rules of the language and construct the grammatical system themselves  Literature about Cseh and his method  * Esperanto en perspektivo (\\"Esperanto in perspective\\"), London, Rotterdam, 1974 * Enciklopedio de Esperanto (\\"Encyclopedia of Esperanto\\"), Budapest, 1933 * Vortoj de Andreo Cseh (\\"Words of Andreo Cseh\\"), Artur E.

Neither nation maintains an embassy in their respective capitals. Instead, the Icelandic ambassador in Beijing is also accredited to North Korea, while the North Korean ambassador in Stockholm is accredited to Iceland. The Swedish embassy in Pyongyang handles visa matters on behalf of Iceland. History According to most sources, diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1973, when all Nordic countries jointly opted to recognize the DPRK, ending the country's diplomatic isolation in Western Europe. The Icelandic non-resident embassy to North Korea on the other hand states this took place on 2 April 1982, a decade later. In the 1980s, pro-DPRK organizations and juche study groups were established in Iceland as in many other countries, as part of North Korean diplomatic efforts to build support for itself. One of these was the Icelandic Solidarity Committee for Reunification of Korea, which visited Pyongyang in the decade's first years, and the Iceland–Korea Friendship and Cultural Society which sent a delegation led by its General Secretary Hrafn Harðarson during the decade's later half. The Iceland–Korea Friendship and Cultural Society remained active as of at least 2011. Following the 1988 Summer Olympics, Iceland's non-resident ambassador to North Korea at the time stated that he had never visited the country. In 2009 the Icelandic Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Össur Skarphéðinsson, expressed his deep concerns with the ongoing missile crisis, and called for North Korea to return to the negotiations with the international community.

Geography  Autumn in Hoia Forest, November 2012 The forest covers an area of about 3 square kilometers. Its southern border begins on a ridge which runs east-west. It does not contain the steep southern slope of the hill, which rises from the Someșul Mic River. To the north, the forest ends on a smoother slope, which meets the Nadăș River. The eastern end of the forest is bordered by the Tăietura Turcului, an artificial valley that divides the hill from north to south and contains a traffic road. The west end of the forest reaches the northeastern slope of the Dealul Melcilor, nearby the Mujai Forest, which extends further westward. The Bongar valley runs along the south end of this side, which contains a downy oak grove unique to the southern steppe. Part of the northeastern end of the forest is bordered by Valea Lungă (Long Valley), which passes through Eocene limestone and forms Cheile Baciului, a valley with asymmetric slopes. A small natural lake is located upstream from Cheile Baciului, at the border of the forest. There are several springs with potable water at the north edge of the forest, in Valea Lungă.  Archaeological discoveries  The oldest Neolithic settlement in Romania (believed to have been established around 6500 BC) belonging to the Starčevo–Kőrös–Criș culture was discovered at the north of Valea Lungă. Tombs and houses from this settlement were uncovered between 1960 and 1994.  Legends  According to legend, the Hoia Forest is a hotspot of paranormal phenomena. Many ghost stories and urban legends contribute to its popularity as a tourist attraction. Skeptics say these are just stories for entertainment and lack any testable evidence.

It was first published in Japan in 2007. The English translation, by Keiko Yoshida and her husband, English author David Mitchell, was published in 2013. The book alleges that its author, Higashida, learned to communicate using the scientifically discredited techniques of facilitated communication and rapid prompting. Since Higashida lacks a genuine ability to use either written or verbal language, researchers are doubtful of claims that Higashida actually wrote the book himself. Psychologist Jens Hellman said that the accounts “resemble what I would deem very close to an autistic child’s parents’ dream.” The book became a New York Times bestseller and a Sunday Times bestseller for hardback nonfiction in the UK. It has been translated into over 30 other languages. Background Higashida was diagnosed with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when he was five years old and has limited verbal communication skills. With help from his mother, he is purported to have written the book using a method he calls \\"facilitated finger writing\\", also known as facilitated communication (FC). The method has been discredited as pseudoscience by organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association (APA). Several researchers are skeptical of the authenticity of Higashida's writings. Synopsis Yoshida and Mitchell, who have a child with autism, wrote the introduction to the English-language version. The majority of the memoir is told through 58 questions Higashida and many other people dealing with autism are commonly asked, as well as interspersed sections of short prose. These sections are either memories Higashida shares or parabolic stories that relate to the themes discussed throughout the memoir. The collections ends with Higashida's short story, \\"I'm Right Here,\\" which the author prefaces by saying: > I wrote this story in the hope that it will help you to understand how > painful it is when you can't express yourself to the people you love. If > this story connects with your heart in some way, then I believe you'll be > able to connect back to the hearts of people with autism too.  Reception  While the book quickly became successful in Japan, it wasn't until after the English translation that it reached mainstream audiences across the world. On its publication in July 2013 in the UK, it was serialised on BBC Radio 4 as 'Book of the Week' and went straight to Number 1 on the Sunday Times bestseller list. After its publication in the US (August 2013) it was featured on The Daily Show in an interview between Jon Stewart and David Mitchell and the following day it became #1 on Amazon's bestseller list. In the interview Stewart describes the memoir as \\"one of the most remarkable books I've read.\\" Other celebrities also offer their support, such as Whoopi Goldberg in her gift guide section in Peoples 2013 holiday issue. In addition to traditional media outlets, the book received attention from autism advocacy groups across the globe, many, such as Autism Speaks, conducting interviews with Mitchell. Mitchell has claimed that there is video evidence showing that Hagashida is pointing to Japanese characters without any touching; however, Dr. Fein and Dr. Kamio claim that in one video where he is featured, his mother is constantly guiding his arm. Michael Fitzpatrick, a medical writer known for writing about controversies in autism from the perspective of someone who is both a physician and a parent of a child with autism, said some skepticism of how much Higashida contributed to the book was justified because of the \\"scant explanation\\" of the process Higashida's mother used for helping him write using the character grid and expressed concern that the book \\"reinforces more myths than it challenges\\". According to Fitzpatrick, The Reason I Jump is full of \\"moralising\\" and \\"platitudes\\" that sound like the views of a middle-aged parent of a child with autism. He said the book also contains many familiar tropes that have been propagated by advocates of facilitated communication, such as \\"Higashida's claim that people with autism are like 'travellers from a distant, distant past' who have come...'to help the people of the world remember what truly matters for the Earth,'\\" which Fitzpatrick compared to the notion promoted by anti-immunisation advocates that autistic children are \\"heralds of environmental catastrophe\\". Sallie Tisdale, writing for The New York Times, said the book raised questions about autism, but also about translation and she wondered how much the work was influenced by the three adults (Higashida's mother, Yoshida, and Mitchell) involved in translating the book and their experiences as parents of autistic children. She concluded, \\"We have to be careful about turning what we find into what we want.\\" Adaptations  Stage  The book was adapted into a play in 2018, put on by the National Theatre of Scotland. The adaptation featured an outdoor maze designed by the Dutch collective Observatorium, and an augmented reality app was developed for the play.  Documentary  The book was adapted into a feature-length documentary, directed by Jerry Rothwell. The project is a co-production of Vulcan Productions, the British Film Institute, the Idea Room, MetFilm Production, and Runaway Fridge, which was presented at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. The documentary has received positive reviews from critics. Screen Daily's Fionnula Halligan stated that \\"The Reason I Jump will change how you think, and how many films can say that?”https://www.metfilmsales.com/production/the-reason-i-jump/, while Leslie Fleperin of Hollywood Reporter said that the documentary was “a work of cinematic alchemy”https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/reason-i-jump- review-1274318, and Guy Lodge of Variety commended the film for turning the original book into \\"an inventive, sensuous documentary worthy of its source.\\"https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/the-reason-i-jump-film- review-1234630364/ On 3 June 2020, Kino Lorber acquired The Reason I Jump to film in the United States.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kino-lorber- picks-up-documentary-reason-i-jump-1296989 The film will be screened at the 2020 AFI Docs film festival. Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8 Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8: A Young Man's Voice from the Silence of Autism is a follow-up to The Reason I Jump, written in 2015 and credited to Japanese author Naoki Higashida when he was between the ages of 18 and 22. Higashida has severe autism and his verbal communication skills are limited. However, he is able to communicate by pointing at letters on an alphabet chart. Skeptics have claimed that there is no proof that Higashida can communicate independently, and that the English translation represents the ideals of author David Mitchell and Keiko Yoshida. In response, Mitchell claims that there is video evidence showing that Higashida can type independently. The book is a collection of short chapters arranged in eight sections in which Higashida explores identity, family relationships, education, society, and his personal growth. The title comes from a Japanese proverb, 七転び八起き, which literally translates as \\"Fall seven times and stand up eight\\". The English translation by Keiko Yoshida and her husband, author David Mitchell, was released on July 11, 2017.

He was the first notable member of the Trencsén branch of the gens (\\"clan\\") Csák. His nephew and heir was the oligarch Matthew III Csák, who, based on his uncles' acquisitions, became the de facto ruler of his domain independently of the king and usurped royal prerogatives on his territories. Family He was born around 1235 as one of the four sons of Matthew I, founder and first member of the Trencsén branch, who served as master of the treasury (1242–1245), and Margaret from an unidentified noble family.Markó 2006, p. 219. Matthew II's brothers were Mark I, ispán (comes) of Hont County in 1247, but there is no further information about him; Stephen I, master of the stewards from 1275 to 1276 and from 1276 to 1279; and Peter I, who held powerful positions, including palatine (1275–1276; 1277; 1278; 1281) and who, furthermore, was the father of the notorious Matthew III.Kristó 1986, p. 31. He had also a younger sister, who married to the Moravian noble Zdislav Sternberg, a loyal bannerman of the Csák clan.Kristó 1986, p. 50. Their son, Stephen Sternberg (or \\"the Bohemian\\") later inherited the Csák dominion because of the absence of a direct adult male descendant after the death of Matthew III in 1321.Kristó 1986, p. 199. Matthew II married to an unknown noblewoman from an unidentified genus. This marriage remained childless and his brothers had already died for that time, as a result, in 1283, he nominated his nephew, Matthew III to inherit his property and large-scale possessions,Fügedi 1986, p. 159. which laid the foundation of a de facto independent domain, encompassing the north-western counties of the kingdom (today roughly the western half of present-day Slovakia and parts of Northern Hungary).Engel 2001, p. 126. Career His name was first mentioned by an authentic royal charter on 13 June 1270, when he served as voivode of Transylvania (1270–1272), which indicates Matthew II reached influence only after the death of king Béla IV, thus he was a loyal supporter of duke Stephen, who rebelled against his father's rule and took over the government of Transylvania in the 1260s. According to a charter issued in 1273, Matthew II participated in the Battle of Isaszeg in 1265, where Stephen gained a strategic victory over his father's army.Kristó 1986, p. 45. After that Béla IV was forced to accept the authority of Stephen in the eastern parts of the kingdom. On 23 March 1266, father and son confirmed the peace in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on 'Rabbits' Island.Fügedi 1986, p. 150. The Transylvanian voivodeship and the income of Szolnok County were Matthew's reward when Stephen V ascended the throne in 1270. He took part in a military campaign against Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1271.Kristó 1986, p. 34. He held the voivodeship until the sudden death of Stephen V in August 1272, after that he was replaced by Nicholas Geregye, a former supporter of Béla IV.Engel 2001, p. 382. Only a validly assumed non-authentic charter refers to Matthew II as voivode in April 1273.Zsoldos 2011, p. 38. Tapolcsány Castle (Podhradie, Slovakia) During the time when tensions emerged between Béla IV and his son, Stephen, two rival baronial groups developed, one of them was led by Henry I Kőszegi (\\"Henry the Great\\"), also involving the Gutkeled and Geregye clans, while the Trencsén branch of the Csák clan dominated the second group. Following the coronation of Stephen V in 1270, leaders of Béla IV's party fled to abroad from the potential retaliations, however they returned to Hungary, when the crown passed to the minor Ladislaus IV in August 1272. During the nominal regency of queen Elizabeth the Cuman both sides wished to take part in the exercise of power. The rivalry between the two parties characterized the following years.Engel 2001, p. 108. According to historian Bálint Hóman, twelve \\"changes of government\\" took place in the first five regnal years of Ladislaus IV.Fügedi 1986, p. 153. This kind of \\"political pendulum\\" is well illustrated by the fact that Matthew II functioned as ban of Slavonia from 27 November 1272 to April 1273, replacing the rival Joachim Gutkeled. However, he too has been replaced by a rival, Henry I Kőszegi.Kristó 1986, p. 36. After that Matthew II served as judge royal and ispán of Bánya (Árkibánya) ispánate within Nyitra County in the summer of 1273.Zsoldos 2011, p. 32. Soon, however, he was ignored again, because Nicholas II Gutkeled from the opposite group replaced him as judge royal. In the next year, Matthew II regained his political influence in the court, when he was appointed voivode of Transylvania in 1274 and held that office until the following year with a small interruption, when Nicholas Geregye retook the position for several months. Between 1275 and 1276, he became master of the treasury, besides that he also functioned as ispán of Pozsony, Baranya Counties and Bánya ispánate.Zsoldos 2011, p. 63. In 1276, he served as voivode for the fourth time, replacing his distant relative, Ugrin Csák. Coat of arms of the gens Csák Matthew II remained partisan of the king at all times, in accordance with the Csák tradition. In contrast, the Kőszegi family gradually manifested its disloyalty to the Árpád dynasty, first of all, when Henry the Great returned to Hungary from exile in Bohemia in 1272, assassinated Béla of Macsó, a grandson of the late Béla IV and partitioned the territory of the Duchy of Macsó among the barons. In 1272, he and Joachim Gutkeled captured and imprisoned the child Ladislaus IV himself and after the release of the royal, they also thrown into prison the king's younger brother, prince Andrew two years later. In August 1274, an armed conflict broke out between the two baronial groups. Meanwhile, Matthew II fought against Ottokar II of Bohemia in early 1273 at Styria and Carinthia, who also laid claim to the title king of Germany.Kristó 1986, p. 37. Matthew was one of the two commanders (the other one was his rival, Stephen II Gutkeled) of the Hungarian army in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278, where Ottokar II was killed. His bravery and heroism during the battle had been documented by German chronicles. After his last voivodeship (1276), he held only local head functions in the next two years; he was ispán of Moson (1277–1278), Sopron (1277–1279) and Vas (1277) Counties.Zsoldos 2011, p. 329. However, soon, his political career reached the top, when he was appointed palatine of Hungary in December 1278, succeeding his brother, Peter I in that position. Besides that he also became judge of the Cuman people, ispán of Bánya ispánate and Somogy County. As palatine, he made a proactive role in the conclusion of peace between the Gutkeleds and the Slavonian Babonić family after a series of border wars. According to a royal charter he provided \\"truth\\" in the name of the king at Sopron in February 1279, when he ordered the execution of a town's citizen, Peter. Later Ladislaus IV donated Peter's lands to Denis Osl, who formerly saved the life of Matthew II in the Battle on the Marchfeld. This fact clearly indicates that Matthew II, like the other contemporary lords, put his own follower in a stronger position, abusing his office. He also started to establish a so- called \\"private army\\" with the participation of his royal servants. Several charters preserved, some landowners have complained to the king concern that the palatine harassed and plundered their possessions.Kristó 1986, p. 38. In the summer of 1280, he was replaced by Finta Aba, brother of Amade Aba. However, he was appointed palatine for a second term two years later, replacing Ivan Kőszegi, the late Henry the Great's son. Besides that he was also ispán of Sopron (1282), Pozsony and Somogy Counties (1282–1283). He held these offices until his death. He prepared his last will and testament on 15 April 1283. Chronologically the next royal charter refers to him as a deceased person on 9 August 1284. Possessions Despite of his successful political and military career, Matthew II was not among the largest landowners in Hungary. He had estates in Komárom County, north of the Danube in Hetény (today: Chotín, Slovakia) and to the south near the village of Bille (today part of Esztergom). According to his testament in 1283, Prasic (today: Prašice, Slovakia), Nemcsic and Jác (today: Jacovce, Slovakia), in the north part of Nyitra County, also belonged to his domain, which he inherited probably from his brother, Stephen I, because these lands were located close to Hrussó Castle, centre of his brother's former estate. At first his wife inherited this property, however she also died shortly, after that Matthew III, son of the youngest brother Peter I acquired the lands. The Dominican monastery at the 'Rabbits' Island, where the Csák brothers' widow mother lived for a long time, had inherited Gyirok and Nándor (Komárom County). Matthew II established his centre at Tapolcsány (today: Podhradie, Slovakia), where a stone castle was built and strengthened. He did not donate his estates in Nyitra County to the Church, those remained in the clan. Perhaps he had also estates or vassals in Pozsony County, maybe one of them was Thomas Hont- Pázmány, for whom Matthew II, as palatine, acted to the Archdiocese of Esztergom, in connection with a payment of a loss. The expansion in Pozsony County caused conflicts between the Csák clan and the Kőszegi family, which had long been a landowner in the county.Kristó 1986, pp. 40–41.

Vinyl iodides are versatile molecules that serve as important building blocks and precursors in organic synthesis. They are commonly used in carbon-carbon forming reactions in transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, such as Stille reaction, Heck reaction, Sonogashira coupling, and Suzuki coupling.Xie, Meihua, et al. \\"Regio-and stereospecific synthesis of vinyl halides via carbozincation of acetylenic sulfones followed by halogenation.\\" Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 694.14 (2009): 2258-2262. Synthesis of well-defined geometry or complexity vinyl iodide is important in stereoselective synthesis of natural products and drugs.  Properties  Vinyl iodides are generally stable under nucleophilic conditions. In SN2 reactions, back-attack is difficult because of steric clash of R groups on carbon adjacent to electrophilic center (see figure 1a).Klein, David. Organic Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Jun 15, 2011. Google book. Thurs. 28 Nov. 2013. https://books.google.com/books?id=SsX9pbarkQkC&source;=gbs_navlinks_s In addition, the lone pair on iodide donates into the ╥* of the alkene, which reduces electrophilic character on the carbon as a result of decreased positive charge. Also, this stereoelectronic effect strengthens the C-I bond, thus making removal of the iodide difficult (see figure 1b).Bhupinder, Mehta; Manju, Mehta. Organic Chemistry. PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd., Jan 1, 2005. Google book. Thurs. 28 Nov. 2013. https://books.google.com/books?id=QV6cwXA9XkEC&source;=gbs_navlinks_s In SN1 case, dissociation is difficult because of the strengthened C-I bond and loss of the iodide will generate an unstable carbocation(see figure 1c) Figure 1. In cross-coupling reactions, typically vinyl iodides react faster and under more mild conditions than vinyl chloride and vinyl bromide. The order of reactivity is based on the strength of carbon-halogen bond. C-I bond is the weakest of the halogens, the bond dissociation energies of C-I is 57.6kcal/mol, while fluoride, chloride and bromide are 115, 83.7, 72.1 kcal/mol respectively.Blanksby, Stephen J., and G. Barney Ellison. \\"Bond dissociation energies of organic molecules.\\" Accounts of Chemical Research 36.4 (2003): 255-263 As a result of having weaker bond, vinyl iodide does not polymerize as easily as its vinyl halide counterparts, but rather decompose and release iodide.Herman, Jan A., and Pierre Roberge. \\"X‐ray induced polymerization of vinyl iodide in solution.\\" Journal of Polymer Science 62.174 (1962): S116-S118. It is generally believed that vinyl iodide cannot survive common reduction conditions, which reduces the vinyl iodide to an olefin or unsaturated alkane.Zhang, Xing, et al. \\"An efficient cis-reduction of alkyne to alkene in the presence of a vinyl iodide: stereoselective synthesis of the C22-C31 fragment of leiodolide A.\\" Tetrahedron (2012). However, there is evidence in literature, in which a propargyl alcohol's alkyne was reduced in presence of a vinyl iodide using hydrogen over Pd/CaCO3 or Crabtree's catalyst.Denton, Richard W., and Kathlyn A. Parker. \\"Functional Group Compatibility. Propargyl Alcohol Reduction in the Presence of a Vinyl Iodide.\\" Organic letters 11.13 (2009): 2722-2723. Parker's group reduction methods  Other applications  Scheme 1. Magnesium-halogen exchange Besides using vinyl iodides as useful substrates in transition metal cross-coupling reaction, they can also undergo elimination with a strong base to give corresponding alkyne, and they can be converted to suitable vinyl Grignard reagents. Vinyl iodides are converted to Grignard reagents by magnesium-halogen exchange (see Scheme 1a).Rottlander, M.; Boymond, L.; Cahiez, G.; Knochel, P. J. Org. Chem. 1999. 64, 1080 The scope of this synthetic method is limited since it requires higher temperatures and longer reaction time, which affects functional group tolerance. However, vinyl iodide with electron withdrawing group can enhance rate of exchange(see Scheme 1b). Also addition of lithium chloride helps enhance magnesium-halogen exchange (see Scheme 1c). It is predicted lithium chloride breaks up aggregates in organomagnesium reagents.Ren, H.; Krasovskiy, A.; Knochel, P. Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 4215  Methods of synthesis  Nomenclature Vinyl iodides are synthesized by methods such as iodination and substitution reaction. Vinyl iodides with well-defined geometry (regiochemistry and stereochemistry) are important in synthesis since many natural products and drugs that have specific structure and dimension. Example of regiochemistry is whether the iodide is positioned in either alpha or beta position on the olefin. Stereochemistry such as E-Z notation or cis-trans alkene geometry is important since some transition metal cross-coupling reactions, such as the Suzuki coupling, can retain olefin geometry. In synthesis, it is useful to introduce vinyl iodide at various positions to be set up for a coupling reaction at the next synthetic step. Below are various means and methods in introducing and synthesizing vinyl iodides.  Synthesis from alkynes  The common and simplest approach to make vinyl iodide is addition of one equivalent HI to alkyne. This generally makes 2-iodo-1-alkenes or α-vinyl iodide by Markovnikov's rule. However, this reaction does not happen at good rates or very high stereoselectively.Kropp, P. J.; Crawford, S. D. J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, 3102. As a result, most synthetic methods often involve a hydrometalation step before addition of I+ source. = α-vinyl iodides = Introducing an α-vinyl iodide from a terminal position of an alkyne is a difficult step. in addition, the vinyl metal intermediate can be mildly nucleophilic, for example vinyl aluminum, can form C-C bonds under catalytic conditions. However, Hoveyda group have demonstrated using nickel- based catalyst (Ni(dppp)Cl2), DIBAL-H with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS), selectively favor α-vinyl iodide with little to no byproducts.Gao, Fang, and Amir H. Hoveyda. \\"α-Selective Ni-Catalyzed Hydroalumination of Aryl-and Alkyl- Substituted Terminal Alkynes: Practical Syntheses of Internal Vinyl Aluminums, Halides, or Boronates.\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 132.32 (2010): 10961-10963. Also they observed reverse selectivity for β with Ni(PPh3)2Cl2 in their hydroalumination reactions under same conditions with little or no byproducts. The advantage of this method is that is inexpensive (and commercially available), scalable and one-pot reaction. Hoveyda'group hydroalumination method Another method doesn't involve hydrometalation but hydroiodation with I2/hydrophosphine binary system, which was developed by Ogawa's group.Kawaguchi, Shin-ichi, and Akiya Ogawa. \\"Highly Selective Hydroiodation of Alkynes Using an Iodine− Hydrophosphine Binary System.\\" Organic Letters 12.9 (2010): 1893-1895. Ogawa's group Hydroiodation method with I2/hydrophosphine The hydroiodation proceeds by Markovnikov-type adduct, no reaction is observed without addition of hydrophoshine. In a plausible mechanism proposed by Ogawa's group, the hydrophosphine reacts with HI to form an intermediate complex that coordinate HI to do Markovnikov hydroiodation on the alkene. The advantage of this system is the conditions are mild, can tolerate wide range of functional groups. Mechanism Proposed by Ogawa's group = β-vinyl iodides = They are generally more methods in making β-vinyl iodides versus α-vinyl iodides using hydrometalation (with aluminum with DIBAL-H (hydroalumination), with boron (hydroboration), with HZrCp2Cl (hydrozirconation)).Chong, J.; Darwish, Alla. Tetrahedron, Volume 68, Issue 2, 14 Jan 2012, pages 654-658 However, hydrometalation with alkyne with various functional groups often react poorly with side products. The Chong groups have demonstrated using hydrostannation, using Bu3SnH with palladium catalyst with high E stereoselectivity. They observed using sterically bulky ligands gave higher regioselectivity for β-vinyl iodide. The advantage of this technique is this technique can tolerate a wide range of functional groups. Chong's group hydrostannation method Z selective β-vinyl iodides are slightly more difficult to introduce than E-β-vinyl iodides, often requiring more than one step. Hydroalumination and hydroboration usually proceed by syn fashion, therefore selectively favors E geometry. The Oshima group have demonstrated using hydroindation with HInCl selectively favors Z geometry.Takami, Kazuaki, et al. \\"Triethylborane-mediated hydrogallation and hydroindation: Novel access to organogalliums and organoindiums.\\" The Journal of Organic Chemistry 68.17 (2003): 6627-6631. They suggested that the reaction proceeds by a radical mechanism. They predict that HInCl adds to alkyne by radical addition in a Z geometry. It does not isomerized to E geometry because of low reactivity of radical InCl2 with intermediate complex (no second addition). If second addition occurs then isomerization will occur through diindium intermediate. They confirm a radical mechanism in a mechanistic study with alkyne and alkene cyclization. Oshima's group hydroindation method  Substitution  Substitution is perhaps most useful method in introducing vinyl iodide into the molecule. Halogen-exchange can be useful since vinyl iodides are more reactivity than other vinyl halides. Buchwald group demonstrates a halogen- exchange from vinyl bromide to vinyl iodide with copper catalyst under mild conditions.Klapars, Artis, and Stephen L. Buchwald. \\"Copper-catalyzed halogen exchange in aryl halides: An aromatic Finkelstein reaction.\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 124.50 (2002): 14844-14845. It is possible that this method can tolerate various functional groups since these conditions were tested aryl halides initially. The scope of this exchange for regiochemistry and stereochemistry is currently unexplored. Buchwald's group halogen exchange method Halogen-exchange can also be done with zirconium derivatives that retain olefin’s geometryLiard, Annie, and Ilan Marek. \\"Stereoselective preparation of E vinyl zirconium derivatives from E or Z enol ethers.\\" The Journal of organic chemistry 65.21 (2000): 7218-7220. Marek's group Halogen exchange method The Marek group have further investigated using zirconium catalyst on E or Z vinyl ethers, which selective for E-vinyl ethers. The zirconium's oxophilic nature allows elimination alkoxy group at the β position to form intermediate vinyl zirconium complex. The E geometry selectivity is not cause by sterics but rather the reaction itself is not concerted. In a mechanistic study, they observed isomerization, which suggest E geometry product is more favored than Z geometry. The difference of results between halogen exchange and E-vinyl ether reaction is that only when there is a presence of an oxonium intermediate, is isomerization observed. Marek's group zirconium vinyl iodide synthesis from vinyl ether Scheme 2. An interesting substitution reaction is vinyl boronic acid to vinyl iodide done by Brown's group.Brown, H. C; Hamaoka, T.; and Ravindran, N.; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1973, 95, 5786 Depending on order of addition of iodide or base, vinyl borate can yield different stereoisomers of vinyl iodide (see scheme 2a). The Whiting group, however, noticed that Brown's method was not applicable to more sterically hindered boronic esters (no reaction).Stewart, Sarah K., and Andrew Whiting. \\"Stereoselective synthesis of vinyl iodides from vinylboronate pinacol esters using ICI.\\" Tetrahedron letters 36.22 (1995): 3929-3932. They proposed that the iodide source was not electropositive enough. So they decided to use ICl which is more polar than I2, in which, they observed similar results (see scheme 2b). Radical substitution of carboxylic acid to iodide is demonstrated by a modified Hunsdiecker reaction.Das, Jaya Prakash, and Sujit Roy. \\"Catalytic Hunsdiecker reaction of α, β-unsaturated carboxylic acids: how efficient is the catalyst?.\\" The Journal of Organic Chemistry 67.22 (2002): 7861-7864. Homolytic cleavage of O-I bond generates CO2 and vinyl radical. Vinyl radical recombines with iodide radical to form vinyl iodide. Modified Hunsdiecker reaction = Iododesilylation = Iododesilylation is a substitution reaction of silyl group for iodide. The advantages of iododesilylation are that it avoids toxic tin reagent and intermediate vinyl silyl are stable, nontoxic and easily handled and stored. Vinyl silyl can be made from terminal alkyne or other methods. The Kishi's group reported a mild preparation of vinyl iodide from vinyl silyl using NIS in mixture of acetonitrile and chloroacetonitrile.Stamos, D. P.; Taylor, A. G.;Kishi, Y; Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37 (48), 8647-8650 They observed retention of olefin geometry in some vinyl silyl substrates while inversion in others. They reasoned that the R group's size had an effect on the geometry of the olefin. If the R group is small, the solvent acetonitrile can participate in the reaction leading to inversion of the olefin's geometry. If the R group is big, the solvent is unable to participate, leading to retention of olefin's geometry Kishi's group iododesilylation method Zakarian's group then decided to run the reaction in HFIP, which gave high retention of olefin geometry.Ilardi, E. A.; Stivala, C. E.; Zakarian, A., Organic Letters. 2008, 10 (9), 1727-1730 They reasoned that HFIP is a low nucleophilicity solvent, unlike acetonitrile. In addition, they observed accelerated reaction rate because HFIP activate NIS by hydrogen bonding. Zakarian's group HFIP iododesilylation method Unfortunately, iododesilylation under those conditions (above) can potentially yield multiple byproducts in highly functionalized molecules with oxygen functional groups. Vilarrasa and Costa's group hypothesized that radical reactions producing HI and I2 help facilitate cleavage in alcohol's protecting group and may add into other alkene bonds.Vilarrasa, J; Sidera M; Organic Letters, 2012, 13, 4934-4937 They experimented on used of silver addictive such as silver acetate and silver carbonate in which the silver can react with the excess iodide to form silver iodide. They observed no byproducts, with 100% conversion to products and increased yields.  Name reactions  Some famous vinyl iodide synthesis methods involve conversion of aldehyde or ketone to vinyl iodide.

In the aftermath of the 1970s Watergate affair and a subsequent congressional inquiry led by Sen. Frank Church,Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms  Spying On The Home Front  FRONTLINE  PBS it was revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-Vietnam War leaders such as Jane Fonda and Dr. Benjamin Spock. Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the European Parliament highlighted the NSA's role in economic espionage in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999. However, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, Edward Snowden. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as PRISM, XKeyscore, and Tempora were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents.Snowden has ‘thousands’ of damaging NSA documents, says Greenwald As confirmed by the NSA's director Keith B. Alexander on September 26, 2013, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens. Much of the data is kept in large storage facilities such as the Utah Data Center, a US$1.5 billion megaproject referred to by The Wall Street Journal as a \\"symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess.\\"  Clandestine surveillance in the United States  Wartime censorship of communications during the World Wars was paralleled by peacetime decipherment of communications by the Black Chamber (Cipher Bureau, MI-8), operating with the approval of the U.S. State Department from 1919 to 1929. In 1945 the now-defunct Project SHAMROCK was created to gather all telegraphic data entering into or exiting from the United States. Major communication companies such as Western Union, RCA Global and ITT World Communications actively aided the U.S. government in the latter's attempt to gain access to international message traffic. In 1952, the NSA was officially established. According to The New York Times, the NSA was created in \\"absolute secrecy\\" by President Truman. Six weeks after President Truman took office, he ordered wiretaps on the telephones of Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, a close advisor of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The recorded conversations are currently kept at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum, along with other sensitive documents (~233,600 pages). Under J. Edgar Hoover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) carried out wide-ranging surveillance of communications and political expression, targeting many well- known speakers such as Albert Einstein, Frank Sinatra, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, Martin Luther King, Jr., A FBI memo recognized King to be the \\"most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country.\\", and Daniel Ellsberg, Some of these activities were eventually uncovered in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, leading to the Resignation of Richard Nixon. File:Albert Einstein Head.jpgDue to his alleged ties to communism, the German-born physicist Albert Einstein was placed under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shortly after he emigrated to America. The FBI monitored Einstein's mail, intercepted his telephone calls, and searched his trash. File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpgThe American boxer Muhammad Ali, a self-declared Vietnam War conscientious objector, was targeted by the NSA's Project MINARET.  Mass surveillance in a global context (1940–2001)  During World War II the U.K. and U.S. governments entered into a series of agreements for sharing of signals intelligence of enemy communications traffic.U.S. National Security Agency. Early Papers Concerning US-UK Agreement – 1940–1944 . Agreement between British Government Code and Cipher School and U.S. War Department dated May 17, 1943. Retrieved: October 5, 2013. In March 1946, a secret agreement, the \\"British-US Communication Intelligence Agreement\\", known as BRUSA, was established, based on the wartime agreements. The agreement \\"tied the two countries into a worldwide network of listening posts run by Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the U.K.'s biggest spying organisation, and its U.S. equivalent, the National Security Agency.\\" In 1988, an article titled \\"Somebody's listening\\" by Duncan Campbell in the New Statesman, described the signals intelligence gathering activities of a program code- named \\"ECHELON. The program was engaged by English-speaking World War II Allied powers Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States (collectively known as AUSCANNZUKUS). Based on the UKUSA Agreement, it was created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War in the early 1960s. Though its existence had long been known, the UKUSA agreement only became public in 2010. It enabled the U.S. and the U.K. to exchange \\"knowledge from operations involving intercepting, decoding and translating foreign communications.\\" The agreement forbade the parties to reveal its existence to any third party. By the late 1990s the ECHELON system was capable of intercepting satellite transmissions, public switched telephone network (PSTN) communications (including most Internet traffic), and transmissions carried by microwave. A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager in his 1996 book \\"Secret Power\\". While the existence of ECHELON was denied by some member governments, a report by a committee of the European Parliament in 2001 confirmed the program's use and warned Europeans about its reach and effects.Fiddler, Stephen (July 1, 2013). Echoes of Echelon in Charges of NSA Spying in Europe. The Wall Street Journal. The European Parliament stated in its report that the term \\"ECHELON\\" was used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicated it was a signals intelligence collection system capable of interception and content inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic globally. The report to the European Parliament confirmed that this was a \\"global system for the interception of private and commercial communications.\\" File:Mandela voting in 1994.jpgSouth Africa's anti-apartheid President Nelson Mandela was closely watched by British MI6 agents. File:BEST ALL-TIME DIANA!

The bid to prevent future attacks of this scale led to the passage of the Patriot Act. Later acts include the Protect America Act (which removes the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign targets) and the FISA Amendments Act (which relaxed some of the original FISA court requirements). In 2005, the existence of STELLARWIND was revealed by Thomas Tamm. On January 1, 2006, days after The New York Times wrote that \\"Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts, the President emphasized that \\"This is a limited program designed to prevent attacks on the United States of America. And I repeat, limited.\\" In 2006, Mark Klein revealed the existence of Room 641A that he had wired back in 2003. In 2008, Babak Pasdar, a computer security expert, and CEO of Bat Blue publicly revealed the existence of the \\"Quantico circuit\\", that he and his team found in 2003. He described it as a back door to the federal government in the systems of an unnamed wireless provider; the company was later independently identified as Verizon. Additional disclosures regarding a mass surveillance program involving U.S. citizens had been made in the U.S. media in 2006. File:Kofi Annan.jpgThe 7th U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was placed under surveillance by British intelligence agents, who bugged his office in the lead up to the Iraq War. File:Ban Ki-moon headshot.jpgThe 8th U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was placed under surveillance by U.S. diplomats, who also collected iris scans, fingerprints and DNA of foreign diplomats, according to leaked documents released by WikiLeaks.  Acceleration of media leaks (2010–present)  On November 28, 2010, WikiLeaks and five major news outlets in Spain (El País), France (Le Monde), Germany (Der Spiegel), the United Kingdom (The Guardian), and the United States (The New York Times) began publishing the first 220 of 251,287 leaked U.S. State department diplomatic \\"cables\\" simultaneously. On March 15, 2012, the American magazine Wired published an article with the headline \\"The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)\\", which was later mentioned by U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson during a congressional hearing. In response to Johnson's inquiry, NSA director Keith B. Alexander testified that these allegations made by Wired magazine were untrue. In early 2013, Edward Snowden handed over 200,000 top secret documents to various media outlets, triggering one of the biggest news leaks in the modern history of the United States.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. State voters chose 23 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Ohio was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with incumbent Vice President and former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Ohio, with over 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, though several more parties did appear on the ballot. Most counties in Ohio voted in majority for Reagan, a particularly strong turn out even in a state with a strong streak of Appalachian social conservatism. As was typical for the time, two exceptions to this trend were Cleveland's Cuyahoga County, and residents of several counties on the Eastern border with Pennsylvania, who voted largely for Mondale. Ohio weighed in for this election as 0.12% more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which Lorain County, Lucas County, Athens County, and Summit County voted for a Republican presidential candidate,Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 and the last until 2016 that Ashtabula County voted for a Republican candidate. Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice- President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan waves to supports during his whistle-stop tour of Ohio. October, 1984. President Ronald Reagan shaking hands with unidentified members of the crowd while at Bowling Green University in Ohio on September 26, 1984. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970s, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide- spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the latter as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Ohio with a decisive 18 point landslide. While Ohio typically leaned conservative at the time, the election results in Ohio are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. The election of 1984 is also one of the final elections where Ohio has reliably turned out for the Republican presidential candidate, and marks the end of a political era for the State, which has since transformed more into the swing state that we know it as today. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American Great Lakes States, at large, since Reagan. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Ohio, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Ohio and elsewhere.

It is believed to represent a king. It was probably made in the thirteenth- fourteenth century AD, before any European contact had taken place with the local population. The realism and sophisticated craftsmanship of the objects challenged Western conceptions of African art at the time.

The artist designed the head in a very naturalistic style. The face is covered with incised striations, but the lips are unmarked. The headdress suggests a crown of complex construction, composed of different layers of tube shaped beads and tassels. This decoration is typical of the bronze heads from Ife. Bronzes from Ife and Benin, Peter Herrmann, Berlin, 2007, retrieved 30 November 2013 The crown is topped by a crest, with a rosette and a plume which now is slightly bent to one side. The crown's surface includes the remains of both red and black paint. The lifelike rendering of sculptures from mediaeval Ife is exceptional in sub-Saharan African art, and initially was considered the earliest manifestation of a tradition that continued in Yoruba art, in early Benin art and other pieces. An excavation in Igbo-Ukwu in 1959 provided scientific evidence of an established metal working culture and bronze artifacts that may be dated to the ninth or tenth centuries. 1938 excavation The Ife Head was found in 1938 at the Wunmonije Compound, Ife, by accident during house building works. It was found among sixteen other brass and copper heads and the upper half of a brass figure. Most of the objects found in the Wunmonije Compound and neighbouring areas ended up in the National Museum of Ife, but a few pieces left Nigeria and are now in the collections of major museums. The British Museum's Ife Head was acquired by the editor of the Daily Times of Nigeria, and the bronze sculpture eventually made its way to the National Art Collections Fund,Ife head Brass head of a ruler, British Museum highlights, retrieved 30 November 2013 which donated it to the museum in 1939. The discovery of the sculptures was the spur for the government to control the export of antiquities from Nigeria. Before this was achieved, this head made its way to London via Paris and another two were sent to America. Attempts to prevent further exports, prompted by Leo Frobenius, were successfully promulgated in 1938, when legislation was enacted by the colonial authorities. Frobenius was a German ethnologist and archaeologist who was one of the first European scholars to take a serious interest in African art, especially that of the Yoruba. Ife Yoruba copper mask for King Obalufon II; circa 1300 AD; copper; height: 29.2 cm; discovered at Ife; Ife Museum of Antiquities (Ife, Nigeria) The Ife head is thought to be a portrait of a ruler known as an Ooni or Oni. It was likely made under the patronage of King Obalufon II whose famous naturalistic life size face mask in copper shares stylistic features with this work. Today among the Yoruba, Obalufon is identified as the patron deity of brass casters. The period in which the work was made was an age of prosperity for the Yoruba civilisation, which was built on trade via the River Niger to the peoples of West Africa. Ife is regarded by the Yoruba people as the place where their deities created humans. These bronze heads are evidence of additional trade since Ife-made glass beads have been found widely in West Africa. The copper is thought to be from local Nigerian ores, although earlier scholars believed it to have come from Central Europe, North West Mauritania, the Byzantine Empire, or Southern Morocco. The bronze casts could have been modelled on contemporary terracotta sculptures. A long tradition of terracotta sculpture with similar characteristics existed in the culture prior to the date of the creation of these metal sculptures. Ivory was another material used frequently in African art. Impact on art history When Frobenius discovered the first example of a similar head it undermined existing Western understanding of African civilisation. Experts could not believe that Africa had ever had a civilisation capable of creating artefacts of this quality. Attempting to explain what was thought an anomaly, Frobenius offered his theory that these had been cast by a colony of ancient Greeks established in the thirteenth century BC. He made a claim, widely circulated in the popular press, that his hypothesised ancient Greek colony could be the origin of the ancient legend of the lost civilization of Atlantis.On the ruins of Atlantis – Leo Frobenius between research and Vision (in German) , freunde-afrikanischer-kultur.de, retrieved 1 December 2013 It is now recognised that these statues represent an indigenous African tradition that attained a high level of realism and refinement.Ife head, History of the World in 100 Objects, BBC, retrieved 30 November 2013  Influence on contemporary culture  There is widespread use of the Ife Head in logos and branding of Nigerian corporations and educational institutions such as Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife.

A. ambiguus is one of eight species in the ant genus Anochetus to have been described from fossils found in Dominican amber and is one of a number of Anochetus species found in the Greater Antillies. History and classification Anochetus ambiguus is known from two solitary fossil insects which, are inclusions in dark yellow transparent chunks of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The specimens were collected from an undetermined amber mine in fossil bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains, northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene the age range is only the youngest that it might be. At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number D-3346, and the paratype, number D-4015, were preserved in the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart amber collections. The fossils were first studied by entomologist Maria L. De Andrade of the University of Basle with her 1994 type description of the new species being published in the journal Stuttgarter Beiträge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Paläontologie). The specific epithet ambiguus is derived from the Latin ambiguus which mean \\"uncertain or variable\\". The species is one of eight Anochetus species which have been described from Dominican amber. Two species were described prior to A. ambiguus, A. corayi in 1980 and A. brevidentatus in 1991. The remaining five species; A. conisquamis, A. dubius, A. exstinctus, A. intermedius, and A. lucidus were all described by De Andrade in the same 1994 paper as A. ambiguus. A number of modern species live in the Greater Antilles, with at least three modern species found on Hispaniola.  Description  The Anochetus ambiguus specimens are well preserved, though the paratype shows some distortion from the amber moving after entombment and both are missing some body structures. The specimens have estimated body lengths between . The overall coloration of A. ambiguus is a brown to dark brown, with femora, petiole, and trochanters a reddish tone. The mandibles are just under one- third the length of the head, flare in width from the base to tips and have between 7 and 9 teeth which decrease in size from the tips to the bases. The apical three teeth on each mandible blade are elongated and slender for grasping prey. Both the mesonotum and pronotum have a slight \\"u\\" shaped profile, with the undersides of each curved upwards. The propodium sports short spines, long, on the rear edge, while the petiole has longer spines centrally placed and reaching in length.

In August 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama announced the creation of \\"a review group on intelligence and communications technologies\\" that would brief and later report to him. In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the National Security Agency (NSA) to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using \\"backdoors\\" in hardware or software. Geoffrey R. Stone, a White House panel member, said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks. U.S. Army General Keith B. Alexander, then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, \\"These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security.\\" He added that \\"the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks.\\" In June 2014, Alexander's recently installed successor as the NSA's director, U.S. Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done overall did not lead him to conclude that \\"the sky is falling.\\" Conceding there was no absolute protection against leaks by a dedicated insider with access to the agency's networks, Rogers said the NSA must nevertheless \\"ensure that the volume\\" of data taken by Snowden \\"can't be stolen again.\\"Sanger, David E.

Allegations of false testimony Excerpt of James Clapper's testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence On June 21, 2013, the Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper issued an apology for giving erroneous testimony under oath to the United States Congress. Earlier in March that year, Clapper was asked by Senator Ron Wyden to clarify the alleged surveillance of U.S. citizens by the NSA: In an interview shortly after Snowden's disclosures were first published, Clapper stated that he had misunderstood Wyden's question and answered in what he thought was the \\"least untruthful manner\\".NBC News Exclusive Transcript of Andrea Mitchell's Interview with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, June 9, 2013. Retrieved July 3, 2014. Later, in his letter of apology, Clapper wrote that he had only focused on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during his testimony to Congress, and therefore, he \\"simply didn't think\\" about Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which justifies the mass collection of telephone data from U.S. citizens. Clapper said: \\"My response was clearly erroneous—for which I apologize\\". Declassification To increase transparency and because it is in the public interest the Director of National Intelligence authorized the declassification and public release of the following documents pertaining to the collection of telephone metadata pursuant to Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act on July 31, 2013. These documents were: # Cover Letter and 2009 Report on the National Security Agency’s Bulk Collection Program for USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization # Cover Letters and 2011 Report on the National Security Agency's Bulk Collection Program for USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization # Primary Order for Business Records Collection Under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act On July 19, 2013, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to the Obama administration, urging it to allow companies involved in the NSA's surveillance to report about these activities and to increase government transparency.  Treatment of journalism  ; Press censorship In June 2013, British government officials issued a confidential DA-Notice to several press organizations, with the aim of restricting their ability to report on these leaks. That same month, the United States Army barred its personnel from access to parts of the website of The Guardian after that site's publication of Snowden's leaks.\\"Restricted Web access to the Guardian is Armywide, say officials\\", Philipp Molnar, Monterey Herald, June 27, 2013. Retrieved October 15, 2014. The entire Guardian website was blocked for personnel stationed throughout Afghanistan, the Middle East, and South Asia. According to a survey undertaken by the human rights group PEN International, these disclosures have had a chilling effect on American writers. Fearing the risk of being targeted by government surveillance, 28% of PEN's American members have curbed their usage of social media, and 16% have self-censored themselves by avoiding controversial topics in their writings. ; Detention without charge On August 18, 2013, David Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, was detained for nine hours under Schedule 7 of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act of 2000. Miranda was returning from Berlin, carrying 58,000 GCHQ documents on a single computer file to Greenwald in Brazil. Greenwald described Miranda's detention as \\"clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ\\". The Metropolitan Police and Home Secretary Theresa May called Miranda's detention \\"legally and procedurally sound\\". However, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who helped introduce the bill in the House of Lords, said that under the act, police can only detain someone \\"to assess whether they are involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism.\\" He said, \\"I am very clear that this does not apply, either on its terms or in its spirit, to Mr Miranda.\\"David Miranda's detention had no basis in law, says former lord chancellor  World news. The Guardian. (August 21, 2013). Antonio Patriota the Brazilian Minister of External Relations said that Miranda's detention was \\"not justifiable\\". The reasons for Miranda's detention were sought from the police by British politicians and David Anderson Q.C., the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The United States government later said that British officials had given them a \\"heads up\\" about Miranda's detention, while adding that the decision to detain him had been a British one. ;Destruction of evidence The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said the newspaper had received legal threats from the British government and was urged to surrender all documents leaked by Snowden. Security officials from the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) later made a visit to the newspaper's London headquarters to ensure that all computer hard drives containing Snowden's documents were destroyed. ;Editing of interview transcript After the NSA Director of Compliance John Delong was interviewed by The Washington Post regarding these disclosures, the White House sent a \\"prepared\\" statement to The Post and ordered that \\"none of Delong's comments could be quoted on the record\\". The Post refused to comply. ;Criminal investigation A criminal investigation of these disclosures, by Britain's Metropolitan Police Service, was reported in November 2013. ;Comments On August 18, 2013, Amnesty International asserted that if journalists maintain their independence and report critically about governments, they too may be \\"targeted\\" by the British government. On August 20, 2013, Index on Censorship argued that the British government's \\"threat of legal action\\" against The Guardian was a \\"direct attack on press freedom in the UK\\". On September 4, 2013, U.N. Special Rapporteur Frank La Rue stressed that the \\"protection of national security secrets must never be used as an excuse to intimidate the press into silence.\\" Forced landing of Bolivian President Morales' plane Five Latin American countries—Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela—voiced their concerns to the UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-Moon after the plane of Bolivia's President Evo Morales was denied entry by a number of western European countries, and was forced to reroute to Austria based on \\"suspicion that United States whistleblower Edward Snowden was on board\\". Ban said it was important to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future and emphasized that \\"A Head of State and his or her aircraft enjoy immunity and inviolability\\". Lavabit On August 8, 2013, Lavabit, a Texas-based secure email service provider reportedly used by Snowden, abruptly announced it was shutting down operations after nearly 10 years of business. The owner, Ladar Levison, posted a statement online saying he would rather go out of business than \\"become complicit in crimes against the American people.\\" He also said that he was barred by law from disclosing what he had experienced over the preceding 6 weeks, and that he was appealing the case in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Multiple sources speculated that the timing of the statement suggested that Lavabit had been targeted by the US government in its pursuit of information about Snowden. The following day, a similar email service, Silent Circle, preemptively shut down in order to \\"prevent spying\\". Snowden said about the Lavabit closure, \\"Ladar Levison and his team suspended the operations of their 10-year-old business rather than violate the Constitutional rights of their roughly 400,000 users. The President, Congress, and the Courts have forgotten that the costs of bad policy are always borne by ordinary citizens, and it is our job to remind them that there are limits to what we will pay.\\" He said that \\"internet titans\\" like Google should ask themselves why they weren't \\"fighting for our interests the same way small businesses are.\\"  Impact on trade  In March 2014, The New York Times reported that revelations of NSA spying had cost U.S. tech companies, including Microsoft and IBM, over $1 billion. A senior analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said it was \\"clear to every single tech company that this is affecting their bottom line,\\" and predicted that the U.S. cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. Forrester Research, an independent technology and market research company, said losses could be as high as $180 billion, or 25 percent of industry revenue.  Allegations of adverse consequences for US and UK security  U.S. Army General Keith Alexander, then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, \\"These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security.\\" He added that \\"the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks.\\" (Archive) In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey said that Snowden \\"has caused us some considerable damage to our intelligence architecture. Our adversaries are changing the way that they communicate.\\" In October, former GCHQ director Sir David Omand, speaking of how useful for Russia's intelligence services Snowden's stay in Russia could be, told the BBC: \\"Part of me says that not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and Maclean in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents.\\" Snowden stated that he had not leaked any documents to Russia. Also in October, Andrew Parker, director general of the UK Security Service, maintained that the exposing of intelligence techniques had given extremists the ability to evade the intelligence agencies; he said, \\"It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will.\\" That same month, the Financial Times editorialized that security chiefs were \\"right to be alarmed, knowing that terrorists can change their modus operandi in response to new information on their capabilities\\" and there was \\"no firm evidence that the intelligence agencies are using these new collection capabilities for malign ends.\\"  U.S. responses   Executive branch  On June 9, 2013, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, referring to the surveillance activities lately reported in The Washington Post and The Guardian, stressed the activities were lawful, conducted under authorities approved by the U.S. Congress, and that \\"significant misimpressions\\" had resulted from the articles published; he called the disclosures of \\"intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe\\" \\"reckless\\". He condemned the leaks as having done \\"huge, grave damage\\" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities. We the People petition to pardon Snowden at the White House website That same day, a We the People petition was launched via the whitehouse.gov website seeking \\"a full, free and absolute pardon for any crimes [Snowden] has committed or may have committed related to blowing the whistle on secret NSA surveillance programs.\\" The petition attained 100,000 signatures within two weeks, thus meeting the threshold and requiring an official response from the White House. The White House answered on July 28, 2015, declining to pardon Snowden. In a response written by Lisa Monaco, Obama's homeland security and terrorism advisor, the White House said Snowden's disclosures had severe consequences for national security and that he should come home to be judged by a jury of his peers. Also in June 2013, the U.S. military blocked access to parts of The Guardian website related to government surveillance programs for thousands of defense personnel across the country,\\"Restricted Web access to the Guardian is Armywide, say officials\\", Philipp Molnar, Monterey Herald, June 27, 2013. Retrieved 15 October 2014. and to The Guardians entire website for personnel stationed in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and South Asia. A spokesperson described the filtering as a routine \\"network hygiene\\" measure intended to mitigate unauthorized disclosures of classified information onto the Department of Defense's unclassified networks. In August 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama said that he had called for a review of U.S. surveillance activities even before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations. Obama announced that he was directing DNI Clapper \\"to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies\\" that would brief and later report to the president. In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using \\"backdoors\\" in hardware or software. Panel member Geoffrey R. Stone said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks. On October 31, 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that \\"in some cases\\" the NSA had \\"reached too far\\" in some of its surveillance activities, and promised that it would be stopped.Kerry: Some NSA surveillance work reached 'too far' and will be stopped. Star Tribune (November 1, 2013).US surveillance by NSA has sometimes 'reached too far,' says Kerry. DW.DE (October 31, 2013). In January 2014, James Clapper gave public testimony to a session of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He asked that \\"Snowden and his accomplices\\" return the purloined NSA documents. When Clapper was asked whether the word \\"accomplices\\" referred to journalists, Clapper's spokesperson Shawn Turner responded, \\"Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs.\\" Also in January 2014, a review by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) concluded that the NSA's collection of every U.S. phone record on a daily basis violates the legal restrictions of the statute cited to authorize it. \\"The Section 215 bulk telephone records program,\\" PCLOB reported, \\"lacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215 [of the Patriot Act], implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only limited value. As a result, the Board recommends that the government end the program.\\" The White House rejected the findings, saying \\"We simply disagree with the board's analysis on the legality of the program.\\" A second PCLOB review, in July 2014, concluded that the NSA's surveillance program targeting foreigners overseas is lawful, under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, and effective but that certain elements push \\"close to the line\\" of being unconstitutional. The July report said that the Board was \\"impressed with the rigor of the government’s efforts to ensure that it acquires only those communications it is authorized to collect, and that it targets only those persons it is authorized to target. Moreover, the government has taken seriously its obligations to establish and adhere to a detailed set of rules regarding how it handles U.S. person communications that it acquires under the program.\\"Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board p. 103, 2 July 2014  Congress  Reactions to the global surveillance disclosures among members of the U.S. Congress initially were largely negative. Speaker of the House John Boehner and senators Dianne Feinstein and Bill Nelson called Snowden a traitor, and several senators and representatives joined them in calling for Snowden's arrest and prosecution. Arizona Senator John McCain criticized politicians who voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act but were outraged by the NSA spying on phone calls by saying, \\"We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation. Now, if members of Congress did not know what they were voting on, then I think that that's their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's.\\" In July 2013, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations unanimously adopted an amendment by Senator Lindsey Graham to the \\"Fiscal Year 2014 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill\\". S. 1372 at GovTrack. S. 1372 at OpenCongress. that would have sought sanctions against any country offering asylum to Snowden. Also in July 2013, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) proposed the \\"Amash–Conyers Amendment\\" to the National Defense Authorization Act. If passed, the amendment would have curtailed \\"the ongoing dragnet collection and storage of the personal records of innocent Americans.\\" The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 205–217. An analysis indicated that those who voted against the amendment received 122% more in campaign contributions from defense contractors than those who voted in favor. In September 2013, Senators Mark Udall, Richard Blumenthal, Rand Paul and Ron Wyden introduced a \\"sweeping surveillance reform\\" proposal. Called the most comprehensive proposal to date, the \\"Intelligence Oversight and Surveillance Reform Act\\" seeks to end the bulk collection of communication records made legal in section 215 of the Patriot Act and to reign in other \\"electronic eavesdropping programs\\". Wyden told The Guardian the Snowden disclosures have \\"caused a sea change in the way the public views the surveillance system\\". The draft bill is a blend of 12 similar proposals as well as other legislative proposals. In October 2013, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, author of the Patriot Act, introduced a proposal to the House of Representatives called the USA Freedom Act to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court.'Patriot Act' Author Seeks 'USA Freedom Act' to Rein In NSA – US News and World Report. Usnews.com (October 10, 2013). Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while it also would require a warrant to deliberately search for the e-mail and phone call content of Americans that is collected as part of a surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records. Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.  Judiciary  In April 2014, The Washington Post reported that some federal judges holding low-level positions had been balking at sweeping requests by law enforcement for cellphone and other sensitive personal data. The Post called it \\"a small but growing faction, including judges in Texas, Kansas, New York and Pennsylvania,\\" and said the judges deemed the requests overly broad and at odds with basic constitutional rights. Although some rulings were overturned, said the Post, their decisions have shaped when and how investigators can seize information detailing the locations, communications and online histories of Americans. Albert Gidari Jr., a partner at Perkins Coie who represents technology and telecommunications companies, told the Post that these judges \\"don't want to be the ones who approve an order that later becomes public and embarrassing…. Nobody likes to be characterized as a rubber stamp.\\" According to the Post, some legal observers have called this \\"the Magistrates' Revolt,\\" which began several years ago; however, it gained power amid mounting public anger about government surveillance capabilities after the NSA disclosures. =Lawsuits= In the wake of the NSA leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him (see Klayman v. Obama), and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against Director of National Intelligence James Clapper alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional (see ACLU v. Clapper). Once the judge in each case had issued rulings seemingly at odds with one another, Gary Schmitt (former staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence) wrote in The Weekly Standard, \\"The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program—a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff.\\" State governments Legislators in several states introduced bills based upon a model act, written by anti- surveillance activists, called the \\"Fourth Amendment Protection Act\\". The bills seek to prohibit state governments from co-operating with the NSA in various ways: the Utah bill would prohibit provision of water to NSA facilities; the California bill would prohibit state universities from conducting research for the NSA; and the Kansas bill would require a search warrant for data collection. Public protests Demonstration in Berlin, Germany, August 30, 2014 The disclosures have inspired public protests. = \\"Restore the Fourth\\"= After the June 2013 release, a political movement known as \\"Restore the Fourth\\" was formed in the United States and rapidly gained momentum. In early July, Restore the Fourth was responsible for protests in more than 80 cities including Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. These protests were loosely coordinated via online messaging services and involved protestors from all over the United States. = \\"Stop Watching Us\\"= \\"Stop Watching US\\" rally in Washington DC, October 26, 2013 On October 26, 2013, an anti-NSA rally called \\"Stop Watching Us\\" was held in Washington, D.C., billed by organizers as the \\"largest rally yet to protest mass surveillance\\". A diverse coalition of over 100 advocacy groups organized the event and attracted thousands of protesters calling for an end to mass surveillance. Speakers included former governor Gary Johnson and NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake. =\\"The Day We Fight Back\\"= \\"The Day We Fight Back\\" was a protest against mass surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA) on February 11, 2014. The 'day of action' primarily took the form of webpage banner-advertisements urging viewers to contact their lawmakers over issues surrounding cyber surveillance and a free Internet. By February 10, more than 5,700 websites and organizations had signed up to show support by featuring The Day We a Fight Back banner for 24 hours. The banner of The Day We Fight Back, February 11, 2014 As February 11 drew to a close, The New York Times posted a blog titled \\"The Day the Internet Didn't Fight Back,\\" reporting that \\"the protest on Tuesday barely registered. Wikipedia did not participate. Reddit … added an inconspicuous banner to its homepage. Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and DuckDuckGo, which were listed as organizers, did not include the banner on their homepages. The eight major technology companies—Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AOL, Apple, Twitter, Yahoo and LinkedIn … only participated Tuesday insofar as having a joint website flash the protest banner.\\"  Non- government organization  An analysis released by the New America Foundation in January 2014 reviewed 225 terrorism cases since the September 11 attacks found that the NSA's bulk collection of phone records \\"has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism,\\" and that U.S. government claims of the program's usefulness were \\"overblown.\\" International response Asia = China = On June 17, 2013, nearly two weeks after the first disclosure was published, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily briefing, \\"We believe the United States should pay attention to the international community's concerns and demands and give the international community the necessary explanation.\\"  Hong Kong The South China Morning Post published a poll of Hong Kong residents conducted while Snowden was still in Hong Kong that showed that half of the 509 respondents believed the Chinese government should not surrender Snowden to the United States if Washington raises such a request; 33 percent of those polled think of Snowden as a hero, 12.8 percent described him as a traitor, 36 percent said he was neither. Referring to Snowden's presence in the territory, Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-Ying assured that the government would \\"handle the case of Mr Snowden in accordance with the laws and established procedures of Hong Kong [and] follow up on any incidents related to the privacy or other rights of the institutions or people in Hong Kong being violated.\\" Pan-democrat legislators Gary Fan and Claudia Mo said that the perceived U.S. prosecution against Snowden will set \\"a dangerous precedent and will likely be used to justify similar actions\\" by authoritarian governments. During Snowden's stay, the two main political groups, the pan-democrats and Pro-Beijing camp, found rare agreement to support Snowden. The pro-Beijing DAB party even organised a separate march to Government headquarters for Snowden. The People's Daily and the Global Times editorials of June 19 stated respectively that the central Chinese government was unwilling to be involved in a \\"mess\\" caused by others, and that the Hong Kong government should follow the public opinion and not concern itself with Sino-US relations. A Tsinghua University communications studies specialist, Liu Jianming, interpreted that the two articles as suggesting that the mainland government did not want further involvement in the case and that the Hong Kong government should handle it independently. After Snowden left Hong Kong, Chinese-language newspapers such as the Ming Pao and the Oriental Daily expressed relief that Hong Kong no longer had to shoulder the burden of the Snowden situation. Mainland experts said that, although the Central Government did not want to appear to be intervening in the matter, it was inconceivable that the Hong Kong government acted independently in a matter that could have far-reaching consequences for Sino-US relations. One expert suggested that, by doing so, China had \\"returned the favor\\" for their not having accepted the asylum plea from Wang Lijun in February 2012. The official Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily denied the US government accusation that the PRC central government had allowed Snowden to escape, and said that Snowden helped in \\"tearing off Washington's sanctimonious mask.\\" =Malaysia= On November 2, 2013, the Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman summoned the ambassadors of Australia and the United States to protest an alleged American- led spying network in Asia.  Europe  = European Union = Early in July 2013, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmström, wrote to two U.S. officials that \\"mutual trust and confidence have been seriously eroded and I expect the U.S. to do all that it can to restore them\\". On October 20, 2013, a committee at the European Parliament backed a measure that, if enacted, would require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The legislation has been under consideration for two years. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far-reaching spying program by NSA.\\"Rules Shielding Online Data From N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe\\", James Kanter and Mike Scott, New York Times, October 21, 2013. Retrieved October 22, 2013. The European Council meeting at the end of October 2013 in its statement signed by all 28 EU leaders while stressing that \\"intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism\\" and noting \\"the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership\\", said that this must \\"be based on respect and trust,\\" a lack of which \\"could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence gathering\\". On December 23, 2013, the European Parliament released the results of its inquiry into the NSA activities. \\"The European Parliament's committee inquiry into the spying scandal,\\" Deutsche Welle reported, \\"was the first of this scale. No individual EU country has looked into the scandal this thoroughly and no EU government has been as explicit in its criticism of the US government.\\" The draft report covered the preceding six months and was, said Deutsche Welle, \\"hard on all sides—including governments and companies in the EU.\\" Presented by Claude Moraes, British Member of the European Parliament from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the report found what it called \\"compelling evidence of the existence of far-reaching, complex and highly technologically advanced systems designed by US and some Member States' intelligence services to collect, store and analyze communication and location data and metadata of all citizens around the world on an unprecedented scale and in an indiscriminate and non-suspicion-based manner.\\" The fight against terrorism, said the report, can \\"never in itself be a justification for untargeted, secret and sometimes even illegal mass surveillance programs.\\" However, Moraes and his fellow rapporteurs considered it \\"very doubtful that data collection of such magnitude is only guided by the fight against terrorism, as it involves the collection of all possible data of all citizens; points therefore to the possible existence of other power motives such as political and economic espionage.\\" =France= On October 21, 2013, France summoned Charles Rivkin, the U.S. Ambassador to France, to clarify and explain the NSA's surveillance of French citizens. Speaking to journalists, President François Hollande said, \\"We cannot accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies. We ask that this immediately stop.\\" According to The Wall Street Journal, data allegedly collected by the NSA in France was actually collected by French intelligence agencies outside France and then shared with the United States. =Germany= A view from the rooftop terrace of the Reichstag building in Berlin, the seat of the German parliament. In the background, behind the Brandenburg Gate, the United States Embassy can be seen. The grey structure on the embassy's roof (top right corner of the photograph) is thought to contain surveillance equipment, possibly used to tap into mobile phones. Pirate Party of Germany against PRISM in Berlin, Germany, 2013. According to The Wall Street Journal, \\"The outcry over NSA eavesdropping has been most pronounced in Germany, a country whose history of dictatorship has left the population particularly sensitive to violations of personal privacy.\\" It was revealed that, beginning in 2002, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone has been \\"on an NSA target list\\". It was reported that the NSA also spied on then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder starting in 2002 after the Schroeder criticized plans for the invasion of Iraq. On July 1, 2013, the German Foreign Ministry summoned Philip D. Murphy, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, over allegations that the NSA had spied on institutions of the European Union. Towards the end of July, the media reported that Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), had been actively cooperating with the NSA, which sparked demonstrations in 40 German cities involving thousands of protesters all over the country. In early August 2013, Germany canceled largely symbolic Cold War-era administrative agreements with Britain, the United States and France, which had granted the Western countries which had troops stationed in West Germany the right to request surveillance operations to protect those forces. At the end of August, under the orders of the German domestic intelligence agency, a federal police helicopter conducted a low- altitude flyover of the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, apparently in search of suspected clandestine eavesdropping facilities. A German official called it a symbolic \\"shot across the bow.\\"German Helicopter Searched For NSA Listening Post In Frankfurt SPIEGEL ONLINE. On October 24, 2013, EU heads of state met to discuss a proposed data protection law. The representatives of Italy, Poland and France wanted the law to be passed before the May 2014 European Parliament elections. Germany, represented by Angela Merkel, and the UK, represented by David Cameron, favored a slower implementation; their wishes prevailed. About the \\"Five Eyes\\" espionage alliance, Merkel remarked, \\"Unlike David, we are unfortunately not part of this group.\\" Also on October 24, the Foreign Ministry summoned John B. Emerson, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, to clarify allegations that the NSA had tapped into Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone. While the German government had hoped for a \\"no spy\\" agreement with the U.S., by January 2014 it was reported that Germany had \\"given up hope\\" of securing such a treaty. The Foreign Office's Philipp Mißfelder declared that \\"the current situation in transatlantic relations is worse than it was at the low-point in 2003 during the Iraq War\\".http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/17/22338261-us-germany- relations-hit-new-low-amid-nsa-spying-scandal-official-says?lite The German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal was started on March 20, 2014, by the German Parliament in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany and to search for strategies on how to protect German telecommunication with technical means. It was revealed that Germany's BND intelligence service has covertly monitored European defence interests and politicians inside Germany at the request of the NSA.\\"German spies 'monitored European targets for the US against German interests'\\". The Daily Telegraph. 24 April 2015. =Italy= Italy's Prime Minister Enrico Letta asked John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, to clarify if the NSA had illegally intercepted telecommunications in Italy. On October 23, 2013, the Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano told reporters, \\"We have a duty to [provide] clarity to Italian citizens—we must obtain the whole truth and tell the whole truth, without regard for anyone.\\" =Spain= On October 25, 2013, the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy summoned James Costos, the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, to clarify reports about the NSA's surveillance of the Spanish government. Spanish EU Minister Íñigo Méndez de Vigo said such practices, if true, were \\"inappropriate and unacceptable\\". An EU delegation was to meet officials in Washington to convey their concerns. According to The Wall Street Journal, data allegedly collected by the NSA in Spain was actually collected by Spanish intelligence agencies outside Spain and then shared with the United States. On October 29, The Washington Post reported that an anonymous \\"senior Obama administration official\\" had also described such an arrangement with Spain. =UK= British Foreign Minister William Hague admitted that Britain's GCHQ was also spying and collaborating with the NSA, and defended the two agencies' actions as \\"indispensable.\\"\\"Data snooping: law-abiding citizens have 'nothing to fear', says Hague – video\\". The Guardian (London). June 9, 2013.\\"NSA Prism programme: William Hague makes statement on GCHQ – video\\". The Guardian (London). June 10, 2013. Meanwhile, UK Defence officials issued a confidential DA-Notice to British media asking for restraint in running further stories related to surveillance leaks including the PRISM program and the British involvement therein. British Prime Minister David Cameron issued a veiled threat to resort to prior restraint, through high court injunctions and DA- Notices, if The Guardian did not obey his demands to stop reporting its revelations on spying by GCHQ and the NSA, a development that \\"alarmed\\" the Committee to Protect Journalists and spurred 70 of the world's leading human rights organizations to write an open letter to the newspaper expressing their concern about press and other freedoms in the UK. In 2014 the Director of GCHQ authored an article in the Financial Times on the topic of internet surveillance, stating that \\"however much [large US technology companies] may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals\\" and that GCHQ and its sister agencies \\"cannot tackle these challenges at scale without greater support from the private sector\\", arguing that most internet users \\"would be comfortable with a better and more sustainable relationship between the [intelligence] agencies and the tech companies\\". Since the 2013 surveillance disclosures, large US technology companies have improved security and become less co-operative with foreign intelligence agencies, including those of the UK, generally requiring a US court order before disclosing data. North America =Mexico= On October 24, 2013, the Mexican Foreign Minister José Antonio Meade Kuribreña met with U.S. Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne to discuss allegations reported by Der Spiegel that the NSA hacked the emails of former president Felipe Calderón while in office. Oceania Australia Former Foreign Minister Bob Carr remarked that the U.S. would be critical of any other nation that failed to prevent the release of such sensitive documents. \\"Certainly if it had gone the other way,\\" said Carr, \\"if there'd been some official in Canberra, some contractor in Canberra, who allowed a slew of material as sensitive as this to be plastered over the world's media, America would be saying very stern things to someone they'd be regarding as a woefully immature ally and partner.\\"Spying row: Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono accuses Tony Abbott of taking claims too lightly =Indonesia= On November 1, 2013, the Foreign Ministry of Indonesia summoned Australia's Ambassador Greg Moriarty to explain his country's surveillance of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and other Indonesian political leaders. On November 18, the Australian ambassador was summoned again by Indonesian government officials, who pledged to review all types of cooperation with Australia. The Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa called the spying \\"unacceptable\\", and added that \\"This is an unfriendly, unbecoming act between strategic partners.\\" The Indonesian ambassador to Australia was also recalled as a response to the incident.  South America  =Brazil= National Congress of Brazil about U.S. spying activity in that country. The Brazilian government expressed outrage at the revelations that the National Security Agency directly targeted the communications of president Dilma Rousseff and her top aides. It called the incident an \\"unacceptable violation of sovereignty\\" and requested an immediate explanation from the U.S. government. Brazil's government signaled it would consider cancelling Rousseff's state visit to Washington—the only state visit for a foreign leader scheduled this year. A senior Brazilian official stated the country would downgrade commercial ties unless Rousseff receives a public apology. That would include ruling out the $4 billion purchase of Boeing F-18 Super Hornet fighters and cooperation on oil and biofuels technology, as well as other commercial agreements. Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security. =Ecuador= Ecuador responded by renouncing U.S. trade benefits and offering to pay a similar amount, $23 million per year, to finance human rights training in America to help avoid what Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño called \\"violations of privacy, torture and other actions that are denigrating to humanity.\\"  Other countries  Russia, South Africa, and Turkey reacted angrily after it was revealed that their diplomats had been spied on during the 2009 G-20 London summit.  Non-government organizations  =Index on Censorship= London-based Index on Censorship called upon the U.S. government to uphold the First Amendment, saying, \\"The mass surveillance of citizens' private communications is unacceptable—it both invades privacy and threatens freedom of expression. The US government cannot use the excuse of national security to justify either surveillance on this scale or the extradition of Snowden for revealing it.\\" = United Nations = In July 2013, speaking to the foreign affairs committee of the Icelandic Parliament in Reykjavík, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that in his personal opinion, Edward Snowden had misused his right to digital access and created problems that outweigh the benefits of public disclosure. Birgitta Jónsdóttir, an Icelandic legislator who in 2010 assisted WikiLeaks in publishing U.S. state secrets leaked by Chelsea Manning, expressed alarm at Ban's remarks. She said that he \\"seemed entirely unconcerned about the invasion of privacy by governments around the world, and only concerned about how whistleblowers are misusing the system.\\"Pilkington, Ed. \\"Edward Snowden's digital 'misuse' has created problems, says Ban Ki-moon.\\" The Guardian.

He was originally trained as a medical doctor but taught in several scientific fields. He was a one time California Superintendent of Public Instruction. Carr and his wife Jeanne were close friends of John Muir and were extremely influential in Muir's life at several key junctures. Life and career Carr was born in Stephentown, New York on March 9, 1819, the son of Peleg Slocum Carr and Deborah Goodrich Carr. He attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Castleton College (Vermont). He received an MD from the latter in 1842. For several years he taught at colleges in the east. Carr received an appointment as professor to the University of Wisconsin in 1855 — his title was Chair of Natural Sciences, and he also was to teach a course in agricultural science. He was the eighth member of the faculty, and at the time this was considered by the regents to fill the needs. The university was new, and as a lobbying ploy to enhance legislative and public support, Carr and Daniel Read were inaugurated in a ceremony in the Assembly hall. Carr used the occasion to outline his educational philosophies, and throughout his time in Madison he continued to push for emphasis on practical relevancy of the coursework offered by the university. \\"[T]he public have a reasonable right to expect ... that these departments connect the University directly with the industrial interests of the State, by affording instruction to young men, in Agriculture, Mining, etc....\\" Like many academics at the university, he immediately became involved with the state historical society. He was also a member of the State Geological Survey and served as a university regent from 1857-1859. Outspoken and at times at odds with his colleagues, in 1867 Carr lost his faculty position during a general turnover due to reforms instituted by new university president Paul A. Chadbourne. At first Carr and his wife Jeanne were unsure of their next career step, and made a trip back east to visit friends and family. They eventually decided to move to California, and although Carr did not have an offer to teach when they made the move, it was a fortuitous time since the new University of California was being formed, and Carr was eventually offered a professorship. He remained outspoken, and in time the stresses and strains led him to step down from teaching. He then moved on to a career in politics, and in 1875 he was elected California Superintendent of Public Instruction, assuming office on December 6. In his campaign he was endorsed by several of the populist organizations of the state. He was a Republican. Being a Past Master of the Temescal Grange, he also received important support from the Grangers. Carr was sometimes assisted in his work as Superintendent when he was ill by Jeanne, who officially held the title of Assistant Superintendent. Personal tragedy struck the Carrs during this time period (one son died in a railroad accident, and another of a gunshot — some said murder, others said suicide), and Ezra's health declined. As a result he retired from active life and in 1880 moved into the newly formed Indiana Colony, the forerunner of Pasadena. Carr died in there on November 27, 1894. Relationship with John Muir The Wisconsin State Fair was held in Madison during the days Ezra and Jeanne and their family were living there. One exhibitor was a young man named John Muir who in his spare time on the family farm in Marquette County whittled a series of very clever clocks and similar devices. These caught the attention of Jeanne who saw in Muir intellectual gifts that she felt should be nurtured. She sought out Muir and through a series of circumstances encouraged him to apply to become a student at the University. Among his instructors were Ezra Carr, as well as another professor he was to stay in contact for most of his life, James Davie Butler. The Carrs and the Butlers were personal as well as professional mentors. Some life events were also influenced in reverse; when Muir went to California, he was in active contact with Jeanne, and when the Carrs were deciding on locations for their next move, Muir strongly endorsed California. Jeanne Carr was gregarious and gifted and the Carrs had a vast network of influential friends in the east. When they moved to California they picked right up cultivating important relationships. In the summer of 1869, Jeanne Carr went to Yosemite for her first visit, hoping to be able to meet Muir in person. However, Muir was high in the Sierra that summer tending sheep. Jeanne Carr stayed at James Hutchings' hotel, where Jeanne and Hutchings' wife Elvira struck up a friendship that was to last for many years. When Jeanne Carr found out that Hutchings needed a millwright to run a sawmill (for lumber to build up tourist facilities), she was able to connect Hutchings to Muir. (Muir, aside from his general mechanical aptitude, had specific experience as a millwright in Indiana.) While Muir was working for Hutchings over the next few years, Jeanne Carr frequently suggested to friends that they seek out Muir as a personal guide/naturalist. Among those who took up this suggestion were Ralph Waldo Emerson and scientist Asa Gray. The relationship between Jeanne Carr and John Muir was public and platonic, yet warm and intimate. What the Carrs did to enhance Muir's career was broad and general, nurturing his contact with the elite classes of society in late nineteenth century United States. An important specific influence was when Jeanne Carr introduced Muir to the woman he would marry, Louisa \\"Louie\\" Strentzel. Louie Strentzel's father was a medical doctor from Poland, who moved to California during the gold rush. He practiced medicine only a little in California, but he did build up a valuable ranch in Martinez. The Carrs knew Strentzel because he was very active in the Grange movement. Jeanne thought that Louie and John would be a good match, which led to their marriage. When Dr. Strentzel died, Louie and John inherited the estate. Income from the ranch was key in allowing Muir free rein to promote his particular wilderness philosophies, which resonated strongly among the wealthier classes of society (who were after all the only ones who could afford the expense of wilderness adventures in that era). When Louie died, Muir inherited a good part of the ranch for himself (some of the inheritance going to their daughters), which accounts for the fact that contrary to popular perceptions that he was a dreamy vagabond, when he died he was worth the twenty-first century equivalent of $4 million. Almost every aspect of Muir's success, financial and otherwise, was in some part due his relationship to the Carrs.

Worship and devotion Key features of the church's worship are the weekly observance of the Lord's Supper presided over by one or more of the men of the church, believer's baptism leading to salvation, and a cappella singing. History in Central Europe The time in which the churches of Christ in Central Europe began is not agreed upon. Some have said that the churches of Christ began with the American Restoration Movement.

A group in Nottingham withdrew from the Scotch Baptist church in 1836 to form a Church of Christ.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Great Britain and Ireland, Churches of Christ in James Wallis, a member of that group, founded a magazine named The British Millennial Harbinger in 1837. In 1842 the first Cooperative Meeting of Churches of Christ in Great Britain was held in Edinburgh. Approximately 50 congregations were involved, representing a membership of 1,600. The name \\"Churches of Christ\\" was formally adopted at an annual meeting in 1870. Alexander Campbell influenced the British Restoration Movement indirectly through his writings; he visited Britain for several months in 1847, and \\"presided at the Second Cooperative Meeting of the British Churches at Chester\\". At that time the movement had grown to encompass 80 congregations with a total membership of 2,300. Annual meetings were held after 1847. The use of instrumental music in worship was not a source of division among the Churches of Christ in Great Britain before World War I. More significant was the issue of pacifism; a national conference was established in 1916 for congregations that opposed the war. A conference for \\"Old Paths\\" congregations was first held in 1924. The issues involved included concern that the Christian Association was compromising traditional principles in seeking ecumenical ties with other organizations and a sense that it had abandoned Scripture as \\"an all-sufficient rule of faith and practice\\". Two \\"Old Paths\\" congregations withdrew from the Association in 1931; an additional two withdrew in 1934, and nineteen more withdrew between 1943 and 1947. Membership declined rapidly during and after the First World War.Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Most Association congregations (approximately 40) united with the United Reformed Church in 1981. In the same year, twenty-four other congregations formed a Fellowship of Churches of Christ. The Fellowship developed ties with the Christian churches and churches of Christ during the 1980s. Theology As a result of their different history and the influence of the Scottish Baptists, British Churches of Christ have, when compared to the American Restoration Movement, placed a relatively greater emphasis on restoring the New Testament church than they have on unity. During the 1800s, the internal dialogue of the British churches was characterized more by rationalism than by evangelicalism. They put greater emphasis on convincing adherents of other churches than on converting non-Christians. In the early 20th century, they became more open to ecumenism. By the 1960s relatively few ministers of the British Churches of Christ had a conservative, evangelical approach to theology. By the 1980s, strong allegiance to restorationism was limited to the a cappella congregations.

FETs are devices with three terminals: source, gate, and drain. FETs control the flow of current by the application of a voltage to the gate, which in turn alters the conductivity between the drain and source. FETs are also known as unipolar transistors since they involve single-carrier-type operation. That is, FETs use either electrons or holes as charge carriers in their operation, but not both. Many different types of field effect transistors exist. Field effect transistors generally display very high input impedance at low frequencies. The most widely used field-effect transistor is the MOSFET (metal-oxide- semiconductor field-effect transistor). History Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field-effect transistor in 1925. The concept of a field-effect transistor (FET) was first patented by Austro-Hungarian physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925 and by Oskar Heil in 1934, but they were unable to build a working practical semiconducting device based on the concept. The transistor effect was later observed and explained by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs in 1947, shortly after the 17-year patent expired. Shockley initially attempted to build a working FET, by trying to modulate the conductivity of a semiconductor, but was unsuccessful, mainly due to problems with the surface states, the dangling bond, and the germanium and copper compound materials. In the course of trying to understand the mysterious reasons behind their failure to build a working FET, this led to Bardeen and Brattain instead building a point-contact transistor in 1947, which was followed by Shockley's bipolar junction transistor in 1948. The first FET device to be successfully built was the junction field-effect transistor (JFET). A JFET was first patented by Heinrich Welker in 1945. The static induction transistor (SIT), a type of JFET with a short channel, was invented by Japanese engineers Jun-ichi Nishizawa and Y. Watanabe in 1950. Following Shockley's theoretical treatment on the JFET in 1952, a working practical JFET was built by George F. Dacey and Ian M. Ross in 1953. However, the JFET still had issues affecting junction transistors in general. Junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass- production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications. The insulated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET) was theorized as a potential alternative to junction transistors, but researchers were unable to build working IGFETs, largely due to the troublesome surface state barrier that prevented the external electric field from penetrating into the material. By the mid-1950s, researchers had largely given up on the FET concept, and instead focused on bipolar junction transistor (BJT) technology. The foundations of MOSFET technology was laid down by the work of William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Shockley independently envisioned the FET concept in 1945, but he was unable to build a working device. The next year Bardeen explained his failure in terms of surface states. Bardeen applied the theory of surface states on semiconductors (previous work on surface states was done by Shockley in 1939 and Igor Tamm in 1932) and realized that the external field was blocked at the surface because of extra electrons which are drawn to the semiconductor surface. Electrons become trapped in those localized states forming an inversion layer. Bardeen's hypothesis marked the birth of surface physics. Bardeen then decided to make use of an inversion layer and use it instead of a very thin layer of semiconductor which Shockley envisioned in his FET designs. Based on his theory, in 1948 Bardeen patented the progenitor of MOSFET, an insulated-gate FET (IGFET) with an inversion layer. The inversion layer confines the flow of minority carriers, increases modulation and conductivity, although its electron transport depends on gate's insulator or quality of oxide if used as an insulator, deposited above the inversion layer. Bardeen's patent as well as the concept of inversion layer forms the basis of CMOS technology today. In 1976 Shockley has described Bardeen's surface state hypothesis \\"as one of the most significant research ideas in the semiconductor program\\". After Bardeen's surface state theory the trio tried to overcome the effect of surface states. In late 1947, Robert Gibney and Brattain suggested the use of electrolyte placed between metal and semiconductor to overcome the effects of surface states. Their FET device worked, but amplification was poor. Bardeen went further and suggested to rather focus on the conductivity of the inversion layer. Further experiments led them to replace electrolyte with a solid oxide layer in the hope of getting better results. Their goal was to penetrate the oxide layer and get to the inversion layer. However, Bardeen suggested they switch from silicon to germanium and in the process their oxide got inadvertently washed off. They stumbled upon completely different transistor, the point-contact transistor. Lillian Hoddeson argues that \\"had Brattain and Bardeen been working with silicon instead of germanium they would have stumbled across a successful field effect transistor\\". By the end the of the first half of 1950s, following theoretical and experimental work of Bardeen, Brattain, Kingston, Morrison and others, it became more clear that there were two types of surface states. Fast surface states were found to be associated with the bulk and a semiconductor/oxide interface. Slow surface states were found to be associated with the oxide layer because of adsorption of atoms, molecules and ions by the oxide from the ambient. The latter were found to be much more numerous and to have much longer relaxation times. At the time Philo Farnsworth and others came up with various methods of producing atomically clean semiconductor surfaces. In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derrick accidentally covered the surface of silicon wafer with a layer of silicon dioxide. They showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer, while allowing for others, thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface. Their further work demonstrated how to etch small openings in the oxide layer to diffuse dopants into selected areas of the silicon wafer. In 1957, they published a research paper and patented their technique summarizing their work. The technique they developed is known as oxide diffusion masking, which would later be used in the fabrication of MOSFET devices. At Bell Labs, the importance of Frosch's technique was immediately realized. Results of their work circulated around Bell Labs in the form of BTL memos before being published in 1957. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni. In 1955, Ian Munro Ross filed a patent for a FeFET or MFSFET. Its structure was like that of a modern inversion channel MOSFET, but ferroelectric material was used as a dielectric/insulator instead of oxide. He envisioned it as a form of memory, years before the floating gate MOSFET. In February 1957, John Wallmark filed a patent for FET in which germanium monoxide was used as a gate dielectric, but he didn't pursue the idea. In his other patent filed the same year he described a double gate FET. In March 1957, in his laboratory notebook, Ernesto Labate, a research scientist at Bell Labs, conceived of a device similar to the later proposed MOSFET, although Labate's device didn't explicitly use silicon dioxide as an insulator. Metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET) A breakthrough in FET research came with the work of Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla in the late 1950s. In 1958 he presented experimental work which showed that growing thin silicon oxide on clean silicon surface leads to neutralization of surface states. This is known as surface passivation, a method that became critical to the semiconductor industry as it made mass-production of silicon integrated circuits possible. The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was then invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng in 1959. The MOSFET largely superseded both the bipolar transistor and the JFET, and had a profound effect on digital electronic development. With its high scalability, and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits. The MOSFET is also capable of handling higher power than the JFET. The MOSFET was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. The MOSFET thus became the most common type of transistor in computers, electronics, and communications technology (such as smartphones). The US Patent and Trademark Office calls it a \\"groundbreaking invention that transformed life and culture around the world\\". CMOS (complementary MOS), a semiconductor device fabrication process for MOSFETs, was developed by Chih- Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963., filed in 1960, issued in 1963 The first report of a floating-gate MOSFET was made by Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze in 1967.D. Kahng and S. M. Sze, \\"A floating gate and its application to memory devices\\", The Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 46, no. 4, 1967, pp. 1288–1295 A double-gate MOSFET was first demonstrated in 1984 by Electrotechnical Laboratory researchers Toshihiro Sekigawa and Yutaka Hayashi. FinFET (fin field-effect transistor), a type of 3D non-planar multi- gate MOSFET, originated from the research of Digh Hisamoto and his team at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory in 1989. Basic information FETs can be majority-charge-carrier devices, in which the current is carried predominantly by majority carriers, or minority-charge-carrier devices, in which the current is mainly due to a flow of minority carriers. The device consists of an active channel through which charge carriers, electrons or holes, flow from the source to the drain. Source and drain terminal conductors are connected to the semiconductor through ohmic contacts. The conductivity of the channel is a function of the potential applied across the gate and source terminals. The FET's three terminals are: #source (S), through which the carriers enter the channel. Conventionally, current entering the channel at S is designated by IS. #drain (D), through which the carriers leave the channel. Conventionally, current entering the channel at D is designated by ID. Drain-to-source voltage is VDS. #gate (G), the terminal that modulates the channel conductivity. By applying voltage to G, one can control ID. More about terminals Cross section of an n-type MOSFET All FETs have source, drain, and gate terminals that correspond roughly to the emitter, collector, and base of BJTs. Most FETs have a fourth terminal called the body, base, bulk, or substrate. This fourth terminal serves to bias the transistor into operation; it is rare to make non- trivial use of the body terminal in circuit designs, but its presence is important when setting up the physical layout of an integrated circuit. The size of the gate, length L in the diagram, is the distance between source and drain. The width is the extension of the transistor, in the direction perpendicular to the cross section in the diagram (i.e., into/out of the screen). Typically the width is much larger than the length of the gate. A gate length of 1 µm limits the upper frequency to about 5 GHz, 0.2 µm to about 30 GHz. The names of the terminals refer to their functions. The gate terminal may be thought of as controlling the opening and closing of a physical gate. This gate permits electrons to flow through or blocks their passage by creating or eliminating a channel between the source and drain. Electron-flow from the source terminal towards the drain terminal is influenced by an applied voltage. The body simply refers to the bulk of the semiconductor in which the gate, source and drain lie. Usually the body terminal is connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, depending on the type of the FET. The body terminal and the source terminal are sometimes connected together since the source is often connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, although there are several uses of FETs which do not have such a configuration, such as transmission gates and cascode circuits. Effect of gate voltage on current I–V characteristics and output plot of a JFET n-channel transistor. Simulation result for right side: formation of inversion channel (electron density) and left side: current-gate voltage curve (transfer characteristics) in an n-channel nanowire MOSFET. Note that the threshold voltage for this device lies around 0.45 V. FET conventional symbol types The FET controls the flow of electrons (or electron holes) from the source to drain by affecting the size and shape of a \\"conductive channel\\" created and influenced by voltage (or lack of voltage) applied across the gate and source terminals. (For simplicity, this discussion assumes that the body and source are connected.) This conductive channel is the \\"stream\\" through which electrons flow from source to drain. =n-channel FET= In an n-channel \\"depletion-mode\\" device, a negative gate-to-source voltage causes a depletion region to expand in width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the active region expands to completely close the channel, the resistance of the channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch (see right figure, when there is very small current). This is called \\"pinch-off\\", and the voltage at which it occurs is called the \\"pinch-off voltage\\". Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (see right figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large). In an n-channel \\"enhancement-mode\\" device, a conductive channel does not exist naturally within the transistor, and a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create one. The positive voltage attracts free- floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a conductive channel. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added to the body of the FET; this forms a region with no mobile carriers called a depletion region, and the voltage at which this occurs is referred to as the threshold voltage of the FET. Further gate-to- source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called inversion. =p-channel FET= In a p-channel \\"depletion- mode\\" device, a positive voltage from gate to body widens the depletion layer by forcing electrons to the gate-insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, positively charged acceptor ions. Conversely, in a p-channel \\"enhancement-mode\\" device, a conductive region does not exist and negative voltage must be used to generate a conduction channel. Effect of drain-to-source voltage on channel For either enhancement- or depletion-mode devices, at drain-to-source voltages much less than gate-to- source voltages, changing the gate voltage will alter the channel resistance, and drain current will be proportional to drain voltage (referenced to source voltage). In this mode the FET operates like a variable resistor and the FET is said to be operating in a linear mode or ohmic mode. If drain-to-source voltage is increased, this creates a significant asymmetrical change in the shape of the channel due to a gradient of voltage potential from source to drain. The shape of the inversion region becomes \\"pinched-off\\" near the drain end of the channel. If drain-to-source voltage is increased further, the pinch-off point of the channel begins to move away from the drain towards the source. The FET is said to be in saturation mode; although some authors refer to it as active mode, for a better analogy with bipolar transistor operating regions. The saturation mode, or the region between ohmic and saturation, is used when amplification is needed. The in-between region is sometimes considered to be part of the ohmic or linear region, even where drain current is not approximately linear with drain voltage. Even though the conductive channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region exists in the p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free to move out of the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel. Composition FETs can be constructed from various semiconductors—silicon is by far the most common. Most FETs are made by using conventional bulk semiconductor processing techniques, using a single crystal semiconductor wafer as the active region, or channel. Among the more unusual body materials are amorphous silicon, polycrystalline silicon or other amorphous semiconductors in thin-film transistors or organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) that are based on organic semiconductors; often, OFET gate insulators and electrodes are made of organic materials, as well. Such FETs are manufactured using a variety of materials such as silicon carbide (SiC), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs). In June 2011, IBM announced that it had successfully used graphene- based FETs in an integrated circuit. These transistors are capable of about 2.23 GHz cutoff frequency, much higher than standard silicon FETs. Types right300pxthumbDepletion-type FETs under typical voltages: JFET, poly- silicon MOSFET, double-gate MOSFET, metal-gate MOSFET, MESFET. Top: source, bottom: drain, left: gate, right: bulk. Voltages that lead to channel formation are not shown. The channel of a FET is doped to produce either an n-type semiconductor or a p-type semiconductor. The drain and source may be doped of opposite type to the channel, in the case of enhancement mode FETs, or doped of similar type to the channel as in depletion mode FETs. Field- effect transistors are also distinguished by the method of insulation between channel and gate. Types of FETs include: *The MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) utilizes an insulator (typically SiO2) between the gate and the body. This is by far the most common type of FET. **The DGMOSFET (dual-gate MOSFET) or DGMOS, a MOSFET with two insulated gates. **The IGBT (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) is a device for power control. It has a structure akin to a MOSFET coupled with a bipolar- like main conduction channel. These are commonly used for the 200–3000 V drain-to-source voltage range of operation. Power MOSFETs are still the device of choice for drain-to-source voltages of 1 to 200 V. **The MNOS (metal–nitride–oxide–semiconductor transistor) utilizes a nitride-oxide layer insulator between the gate and the body. **The ISFET (ion-sensitive field- effect transistor) can be used to measure ion concentrations in a solution; when the ion concentration (such as H+, see pH electrode) changes, the current through the transistor will change accordingly. **The BioFET (Biologically sensitive field-effect transistor) is a class of sensors/biosensors based on ISFET technology which are utilized to detect charged molecules; when a charged molecule is present, changes in the electrostatic field at the BioFET surface result in a measurable change in current through the transistor. These include enzyme modified FETs (EnFETs), immunologically modified FETs (ImmunoFETs), gene-modified FETs (GenFETs), DNAFETs, cell-based BioFETs (CPFETs), beetle/chip FETs (BeetleFETs), and FETs based on ion- channels/protein binding. **The DNAFET (DNA field-effect transistor) is a specialized FET that acts as a biosensor, by using a gate made of single- strand DNA molecules to detect matching DNA strands. *The JFET (junction field-effect transistor) uses a reverse biased p–n junction to separate the gate from the body. **The static induction transistor (SIT) is a type of JFET with a short channel. *The DEPFET is a FET formed in a fully depleted substrate and acts as a sensor, amplifier and memory node at the same time. It can be used as an image (photon) sensor. *The FREDFET (fast-reverse or fast- recovery epitaxial diode FET) is a specialized FET designed to provide a very fast recovery (turn-off) of the body diode, making it convenient for driving inductive loads such as electric motors, especially medium-powered brushless DC motors. *The HIGFET (heterostructure insulated-gate field-effect transistor) is now used mainly in research.freepatentsonline.com, HIGFET and method - Motorola] *The MODFET (modulation-doped field-effect transistor) is a high-electron-mobility transistor using a quantum well structure formed by graded doping of the active region. *The TFET (tunnel field-effect transistor) is based on band-to-band tunneling. *The HEMT (high-electron-mobility transistor), also called a HFET (heterostructure FET), can be made using bandgap engineering in a ternary semiconductor such as AlGaAs. The fully depleted wide-band-gap material forms the isolation between gate and body. *The MESFET (metal–semiconductor field-effect transistor) substitutes the p–n junction of the JFET with a Schottky barrier; and is used in GaAs and other III-V semiconductor materials. *The NOMFET is a nanoparticle organic memory field-effect transistor. *The GNRFET (graphene nanoribbon field-effect transistor) uses a graphene nanoribbon for its channel. *The VeSFET (vertical- slit field-effect transistor) is a square-shaped junctionless FET with a narrow slit connecting the source and drain at opposite corners. Two gates occupy the other corners, and control the current through the slit. *The CNTFET (carbon nanotube field-effect transistor). *The OFET (organic field- effect transistor) uses an organic semiconductor in its channel. *The QFET (quantum field effect transistor) takes advantage of quantum tunneling to greatly increase the speed of transistor operation by eliminating the traditional transistor's area of electron conduction. *The SB-FET (Schottky- barrier field-effect transistor) is a field-effect transistor with metallic source and drain contact electrodes, which create Schottky barriers at both the source-channel and drain-channel interfaces. *The GFET is a highly sensitive graphene-based field effect transistor used as biosensors and chemical sensors. Due to the 2 dimensional structure of graphene, along with its physical properties, GFETs offer increased sensitivity, and reduced instances of 'false positives' in sensing applications *The Fe FET uses a ferroelectric between the gate, allowing the transistor to retain its state in the absence of bias - such devices may have application as non-volatile memory. Advantages The FET has high gate-to-drain current resistance, on the order of 100 MΩ or more, providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time,VIII.5. Noise in Transistors a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is found in noise-sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or open, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches. Disadvantages A field-effect transistor has a relatively low gain–bandwidth product compared to a BJT. The MOSFET is very susceptible to overload voltages, thus requiring special handling during installation. The fragile insulating layer of the MOSFET between the gate and channel makes it vulnerable to electrostatic discharge or changes to threshold voltage during handling. This is not usually a problem after the device has been installed in a properly designed circuit. FETs often have a very low \\"on\\" resistance and have a high \\"off\\" resistance. However, the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while switching. Thus efficiency can put a premium on switching quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional switching. FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between switching speed and power dissipation. There is also a trade-off between voltage rating and \\"on\\" resistance, so high- voltage FETs have a relatively high \\"on\\" resistance and hence conduction losses. Failure modes FETs are relatively robust, especially when operated within the temperature and electrical limitations defined by the manufacturer (proper derating). However, modern FET devices can often incorporate a body diode. If the characteristics of the body diode are not taken into consideration, the FET can experience slow body diode behavior, where a parasitic transistor will turn on and allow high current to be drawn from drain to source when the FET is off.Slow Body Diode Failures of Field Effect Transistors (FETs): A Case Study. Uses The most commonly used FET is the MOSFET. The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) process technology is the basis for modern digital integrated circuits. This process technology uses an arrangement where the (usually \\"enhancement-mode\\") p-channel MOSFET and n-channel MOSFET are connected in series such that when one is on, the other is off. In FETs, electrons can flow in either direction through the channel when operated in the linear mode. The naming convention of drain terminal and source terminal is somewhat arbitrary, as the devices are typically (but not always) built symmetrical from source to drain. This makes FETs suitable for switching analog signals between paths (multiplexing). With this concept, one can construct a solid-state mixing board, for example. FET is commonly used as an amplifier. For example, due to its large input resistance and low output resistance, it is effective as a buffer in common- drain (source follower) configuration. IGBTs are used in switching internal combustion engine ignition coils, where fast switching and voltage blocking capabilities are important. Source-gated transistor Source-gated transistors are more robust to manufacturing and environmental issues in large-area electronics such as display screens, but are slower in operation than FETs.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Kentucky voters chose nine electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Kentucky was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Kentucky, with over 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, though several other parties did appear on the ballot. The majority of counties in Kentucky voted for Reagan, a particularly strong turnout even in this typically conservative state. The long-lasting Democratic stronghold along the Eastern border of the state is still evident during this election. It is also worth mentioning Gallatin County, in the Northern part of the State along the Ohio River. A rare event in any election, Gallatin County voted a dead tie between the Republican and Democratic candidates, each gaining 1,042 votes from the small county. Reagan became the first Republican to ever carry Carroll County, a highly secessionistCopeland, James E.; ‘Where Were the Kentucky Unionists and Secessionists’; The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, volume 71, no. 4 (October, 1973), pp. 344-363 rural Bluegrass county that had been the state's only county outside the coalfields to support George McGovern 12 years earlier.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, pp. 206-211 Kentucky weighed in for this election as 2 percentage points more Republican than the national average. Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice- President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970s, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Kentucky with a resounding 21 point sweep-out landslide. While Kentucky typically voted (and votes) conservative, the election results in Kentucky are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Kentucky, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Kentucky and elsewhere.

It has been a fully owned technology business sector of London Stock Exchange Group since 2009. It rebranded as LSEG Technology in 2017. MillenniumIT’s systems are used by exchange businesses around the world including, London Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana, Oslo Børs, Turquoise, the London Metal Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and a series of emerging market exchanges. In 2016, MilleniumIT was named ‘Best Exchange Technology Provide' at the Markets Choice Awards in New York.  History  The company was founded in 1996 by Tony Weerasinghe as a systems integrator and Sun Microsystems authorized reseller. MillenniumIT entered the software design field the following year when it interpreted a systems integration contract from the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) as an opportunity to design and install a straight-through processing system for the Exchange. The CSE solution became the basis for MillenniumIT’s suite of capital-markets software products. In the year 2000 MillenniumIT became Sun Microsystems’ regional distributor for Bangladesh, Nepal and Maldives. Its capital-markets software found a number of customers around the world, and in 2001 MillenniumIT won its first major US contract and set up operations in Boston, MA. In 2002, the firm moved into its new corporate headquarters, the first Silicon Valley style software campus in Sri Lanka. The company was awarded contracts in Boston and Nairobi. It also continued to expand by opening a UK subsidiary and office in 2004. The following year, the company was contracted to provide an automated equity, ETF and options-trading system for the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). Live trading at AMEX commenced in 2006, even as the company received a US patent on its Business Innovation Dynamically (BID) technology. At home in Sri Lanka, MillenniumIT commenced implementation of a countrywide intranet for the national fixed-line telecoms provider, SLT, while US operations expanded with a new office in Jersey City, NJ.  London Stock Exchange Group acquisition  Following a contract with London Stock Exchange (part of London Stock Exchange Group - LSEG) for a new trading platform for equities, MillenniumIT was acquired by LSEG in 2009. The acquisition gave the company a footing in international competition, and a number of orders from around the world followed shortly. In 2010, LSEG's Turquoise trading platform was successfully migrated to Millennium Exchange, MillenniumIT’s flagship capital-markets software. The company was now active on four continents, and important business wins continued in Canada, India and South Africa. It also entered into a partnership agreement with Tullett Prebon to further develop the IDB’s electronic broking capabilities across a variety of asset classes for internal and external trading systems. In May 2013, Mack Gill became CEO and in June 2014, founder Tony Weeresinghe resigned from the company as Chairman.

Files (born March 27, 1972) is a Republican politician from Fort Smith, Arkansas. Files represented portions of the Arkansas River Valley in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2003, and in the Arkansas Senate from 2011 to 2018. He pleaded guilty in 2018 to wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering relating to misuse of the state's surplus money and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Background A native of Norman, Oklahoma, Files graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in accounting from Arkansas State University in Jonesboro. Previously, he had attended Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia. He is the owner of FFH Construction, a general construction firm. From 1997 to 2004, he was the president and superintendent of the Fort Smith Christian School. Prior to that, he was hired to help start operations of the Baldor Electric Company plant in Ozark, Arkansas, as the accountant and materials manager. He and his wife, the former Michaela K. Mitchell (born 1977), have four children, Kate, Liz, Bella, and Mitchell, and are active members of Grand Avenue Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist congregation in Fort Smith. The senator coaches Little League baseball and basketball. Political life From 1999 to 2003, he represented District 12 in the Arkansas House of Representatives. Files was first elected to the State Senate in 2010 in District 13. His district number was switched through redistricting from District 13 to District 8, effective January 2013, and his district boundaries changed to include most of the cities of Greenwood and Hackett. He served on Senate committees for Revenue & Taxation, Transportation, Technology, Legislative Affairs, Joint Budget, and Senate Efficiency. He was also a member of the Joint (House and Senate) Legislative Committee on Auditing. He was chairman of the Revenue and Taxation Committee. Fraud scandal In early 2017, Files was accused of submitting false bids for the River Valley Sports Complex, a planned park of softball fields at Chaffee Crossing in Fort Smith. Though initially denying the charges, Files pleaded guilty to wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas in January 2018. He resigned his senate seat in February. Plea The plea agreement says Files and Lee Webb, a member of the Sebastian County Election Commission, convinced the City of Fort Smith to appropriate $1.6 million for the project in 2014. Files then created three fictitious companies to bid for the project. He later proposed steering $150,000 of public funds from the state's General Improvement Fund (GIF) to the project. Files had control over the funds, and was chairman of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. He pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay $83,900 in restitution.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose 11 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Tennessee was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with incumbent Vice President and former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Tennessee, with over 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, though several other parties appeared on the ballot. The majority of counties in Tennessee voted in majority for Reagan, a particularly strong turn out even in this typically conservative-leaning state. This included the main population centers of the state – Nashville's Davidson County, Knoxville's Knox County, and narrowly, Memphis's Shelby County. Tennessee weighed in for this election as 1 point more Democratic than the national average. As a result, it was the only state in the former Confederate States of America to not give over 60% of its vote to Reagan. Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice-President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Tennessee with a 16-point sweep-out landslide. While Tennessee typically voted conservative at the time, the election results in Tennessee are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. Reagan generally did better in the West than the South, but still pulled far ahead of Mondale in this election. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Tennessee, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Tennessee and elsewhere.

The arsonists were conspiring with John Magno, co-owner of the store, who desired to destroy the struggling business to collect a fraudulent insurance claim and clear the site for construction of a condominium development. The fire led to the evacuation of over 50 homes on Christmas morning, and the death of one of the arsonists. After many years of sitting as an idle lot, it was replaced by a condo building, Carmelina Condominiums, completed in 2015.  Background  Woodbine Building Supply was a hardware store on Toronto's east-end Danforth Avenue owned by Magno with his two brothers, Frank and Carlo, and started by their father years before. For several years the company had struggled to compete with a nearby Home Depot, and its owners had frequent disputes with local residents; it had been fined $11,800 for improper storage of materials. The brothers planned to move their store to a new location nearby, and construct a condominium development on the Danforth site. Weeks before the fire, the Magno brothers increased their insurance coverage on the store. A local demolition company quoted $145,000 to demolish the store and clear the lot, which was rejected by Woodbine Building Supply's owners.  Fire and explosion  Late on December 24, 2001, four men arrived at the store and began loading its contents into two vans. They chose Christmas Eve to start the fire because they believed Italians and Greeks living in the area would largely be in church for midnight mass. At one point one of the men dropped a cash register in the parking lot, the noise attracting the attention of neighbours; Jason Regaldo then left in one of the vans. At 12:34 AM on December 25, the building was destroyed by a massive explosion; debris was found embedded in cars across the street. Investigators believe that the inexperienced arsonists failed to start a fire on their first try, and on trying again accidentally ignited flammable vapours which had built up in the building's basement. Sam Paskalis was badly burned, and spent several months in hospital in a coma; he was badly disfigured. The body of Tony Jarcevic, 22, was discovered two weeks later. The fire which followed was one of the largest in Toronto's history. Families in fifty nearby homes were evacuated and sheltered in buses, and 171 firefighters needed two days to bring the fire under control. The fire caused $4 million in damage and closed Danforth Avenue for several days.  Perpetrators   John Magno  John Magno was the President of Woodbine Building Supply, which he co-owned with his brothers Frank and Carlo. John and the store were known for frequent disputes with nearby residents. After the store was destroyed by fire, Magno filed an insurance claim worth $3.5 million. Investigators suspected arson, and based on testimony by Paskalis, Magno and Roks were charged with second- degree murder under a rarely used section of the Criminal Code which allows a person to be charged for taking \\"flagrant risks with human life in order to achieve some further unlawful purpose.\\" Magno denied his involvement in the scheme. He was found not guilty of second-degree murder but guilty of manslaughter and three counts of arson and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Magno vowed to appeal his conviction and was released on bail; however, his appeal was dismissed in July 2015.  Adrian Roks  Adrian Roks, Jr., was a Toronto businessman who owned two tanning salons with his wife, and had no criminal record prior to the fire. Roks was with Magno's family on Christmas Eve when the fire was set, however investigators suspected Roks' involvement due to his relationship with the others accused. After Paskalis admitted his own involvement in the scheme, Roks was charged with second-degree murder under section 229(c) of the Criminal Code, as was Magno. Police offered to drop the charge against Roks if he agreed to give a \\"truthful statement\\" about the insurance fraud conspiracy; however, the offer was rescinded when police felt Roks was not telling everything he knew. On June 11, 2007, Roks was sentenced to life imprisonment.  Sam Paskalis  John \\"Sam\\" Paskalis had a history of being a con artist, and one of his schemes involved people applying for a loan through a fake company and paying the insurance fees up front but never getting the loan. Paskalis also used stolen credit card numbers, some of them taken from unsuspecting customers at Woodbine, to order merchandise. He was supposed to get C$50,000, part ownership of a nightclub and a cut-rate condo for his role in the scheme. Paskalis had organized the theft of $1 million in store inventory before setting it on fire to cover his tracks. On the night of the fire, he was caught in the explosion and severely burned, spending several months in a coma. In March 2005, he admitted his involvement in the scheme, and in a plea bargain pleaded guilty to manslaughter and arson in exchange for the Crown dropping second-degree murder charges. He received a time served sentence of five years, spending more than two years in jail.  Tony Jarcevic  Tony Jarcevic, aged 22 at the time, was taking a fire prevention course at a local community college and was hired to set the fire. According to Paskalis, the two men were spreading gasoline and fertilizer in the basement of Woodbine Building Supply when Paskalis decided to leave because of the fumes. Jarcevic called him back just before the explosion which destroyed the building. Paskalis escaped; Jarcevic's badly burned body was not discovered until 17 days later.  Shaun McMaster  Shaun McMaster helped the arsonists move merchandise from the store on the evening of the fire, and waited in a van while Paskalis and Jarcevic set the fire. After the explosion, McMaster tried unsuccessfully to contact the other trapped arsonists, then fled the scene. On January 3, 2008, he pleaded guilty to manslaugher and was given a time served sentence of 6½ years in prison.  Jason Regaldo  Jason Regaldo was a friend of Jarcevic, McMaster and Paskalis who agreed to store merchandise from Woodbine Building Supply which the arsonists removed as payment for setting the fire. On the night of the fire, Regaldo helped others remove merchandise from the store but fled after a cash register was dropped in the parking lot, attracting attention from neighbours. Later, fearing that Magno would sue for the damage done to the store, police convinced Regaldo to admit his involvement and testify against Magno. Regaldo was convicted of conspiracy to commit arson and given a suspended sentence.  Others  According to Paskalis, the arsonists were tipped off to the police investigation by an Ontario Provincial Police informant. Paskalis testified that Frank Magno, an OPP auxiliary sergeant and John Magno's brother, was contacted by \\"friends\\" in the OPP who advised him on homicide investigations, and Frank told the arsonists to \\"be careful.\\" Frank Magno was not charged in the arson.  Aftermath  The lot formerly occupied by Woodbine Building Supply is the site of Carmelina Condominiums, a 12-storey condo building with 148 residential units and street-level retail. Carmelina is owned by JFC Properties, a company run by John, Frank and Carlo Magno. The tower is much larger than the surrounding two-storey retail buildings on Danforth Avenue, and taller than the recommendations in Toronto's Official Plan. While many residents initially welcomed the development of the empty lot which had been idle since the explosion, construction caused damage to surrounding properties which once again led to disputes with neighbours. Construction was completed and Carmelina Condominiums opened in 2015.

State voters chose seven electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting Democratic nominee James M. Cox and his running mate, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt, against Republican challenger U.S. Senator Warren G. Harding and his running mate, Governor Calvin Coolidge. Background By the beginning of 1920 skyrocketing inflation and President Woodrow Wilson's focus upon his proposed League of Nations at the expense of domestic policy had helped make the incumbent President very unpopularGoldberg, David Joseph; Discontented America: The United States in the 1920s, p. 44 – besides which Wilson also had major health problems that had left First Lady Edith effectively running the nation. Political unrest observed in the Palmer Raids and the \\"Red Scare\\" further added to the unpopularity of the Democratic Party, since this global political turmoil produced considerable fear of alien revolutionaries invading the country.Leuchtenburg, William E.; The Perils of Prosperity, 1914-1932, p. 75 Demand in the West for exclusion of Asian immigrants became even stronger than it had been before.Vought, Hans P. ; The Bully Pulpit and the Melting Pot: American Presidents And The Immigrant, 1897-1933, p. 167 Another issue was the anti-Cox position taken by the Ku Klux Klan because Cox was viewed by the Klan as too lenient towards Catholicism,Brake, Robert J.; 'The porch and the stump: Campaign strategies in the 1920 presidential election'; Quarterly Journal of Speech, 55(3), pp. 256-267 and Cox's inconsistent stance on newly passed Prohibition – he had been a \\"wet\\" but announced he would support Prohibition enforcement in August The West had been the chief presidential battleground ever since the \\"System of 1896\\" emerged following that election.Faykosh, Joseph D., Bowling Green State University; The Front Porch of the American People: James Cox and the Presidential Election of 1920 (thesis), p. 68 For this reason, Cox chose to tour the entire nationFaykosh, The Front Porch of the American People (thesis), p. 69 and after touring the Pacific Northwest Cox went to California to defend his proposed League of Nations and to convince the region that large sums of money were being spent by Harding simply to put Republicans in the White House.'The Passing of Woodrow Wilson', The Round Table, 11:41 (November 1920), pp. 14-31 Cox argued that the League could have stopped the Asian conflicts – like the Japanese seizure of Shandong – but his apparent defence of Chinese immigrants in the Bay Area was very unpopular and large numbers of hecklers attacked the Democrat.Faykosh, The Front Porch of the American People (thesis), p. 74 Moreover, the only attention Cox received in the Western press was severe criticism, and he completely ignored charges against misadministration by the Wilson Administration, and in liberal, heavily unionized Washington State where strikes had been particularly extreme since the war ended, Cox's failure to address labour issues proved also very costly. Vote By October, it was clear that the Northwest – where Charles Evans Hughes had carried only Oregon in 1916 – was strongly in favor of the Republicans: in Washington Harding led a combined poll of male and female voters 680 to Cox's 256.'First Straw Vote Favors Harding'; Boston Daily Globe, September 26, 1920, p. 6 A week later polls strongly suggested Cox would not register a majority in any antebellum free or postbellum state, and in the Evergreen State he was trialing four to one out of around 2,100 people polled.'Harding Leads in the Straw Vote: Cox Weak in North and West in Rexall Balloting'; Boston Daily Globe, October 3, 1920, p. Although there were some gains by the Democratic ticket in later polls, with Cox approaching a 1-to-2 ratio to Harding's support at the end of October,'Cox Gains in Straw Vote: Late Returns Give Him Missouri – Some Other States Close'; The New York Times, October 31, 1920, p. 6 a minimum forty thousand vote plurality was predicted by the Washington Post at the same time.'Harding 363 Votes, Cox 168, Is Result Obtained From Estimates by 47 Editors' (Special to The Washington Post); Washington Post, October 31, 1920, p. 1 Ultimately Harding took Washington in a landslide beyond the late-October polls' prediction, defeating Cox by a 138,839 vote margin. Parley Christensen, the nominee of the recently created Farmer-Labor Party, performed very well in the state and nearly drove Cox into third place, with only 7,052 votes between the two. Harding proved the third and last Republican, following on from Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 and William Howard Taft in 1908, to sweep every county in Washington State. This feat has been equalled only by Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who ironically was Cox's running mate in this election, in both 1932 and 1936. This would prove the last election until Richard Nixon in 1968 when the Republican Party carried Ferry County.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, pp. 332-333 Results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"7\\"  1920 United States presidential election in Washington -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Running mate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! style=\\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Republican  Warren G.

The device is capable of producing four of the primary tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Digital lollipops were developed through research led by Nimesha Ranasinghe at the National University of Singapore.  Design  According to Ranasinghe, \\"The system is capable of manipulating the properties of electric currents (magnitude, frequency, and polarity: inverse current) to formulate different stimuli. Currently, we are conducting experiments to analyze regional differences of the human tongue for electrical stimulation.\\" The devices generate alternating current signals through a sliver electrode, stimulating the tongue's taste receptors to emulate the major taste components. It also produces small, varying amounts of heat to simulate food. Eventually, the digital lollipop could aid Alzheimer's patients by helping them \\"either enhance or suppress certain senses\\" and may also allow people with diabetes to experience sweetness without increasing their blood sugar levels. The National University of Singapore research team is developing Taste Over Internet Protocol (TOIP) that would allow taste information to be communicated between locations.
