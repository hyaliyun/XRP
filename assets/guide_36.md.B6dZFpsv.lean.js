Kent State University and Alexander J. Seed, 669 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2012), was a notable case precedent in the United States patent law decided by United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2012 that deals with the questions of inventorship and attorney‚Äôs fee shifting in patent lawsuits. Background In January 1998 Kent State University hired Dr. Falana to develop new additives for liquid crystal displays. In March 1999, Dr. Falana developed a method for making a novel genus of chemical compounds and synthesized several new molecules using his method. In September 1999, Falana left Kent State for another job. Dr. Seed continued the research and synthesized several more molecules using Dr. Falana‚Äôs method, several of which turned out to be promising for the use in liquid crystal displays. In June 2000, Kent State and its spin-off (Kent Displays, Inc.) filed a provisional application for a US patent claiming compositions of matter comprising molecules prepared by Falana‚Äôs method. After the patent eventually became issued and published in 2004, Falana learned about the omission of his name on the list of inventors. After Kent State failed to provide a satisfactory answer, Falana filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against Kent State University and the inventors named on U.S. Patent No. 6,830,789 seeking correction of inventorship under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 256. District court At the bench trial, the District Court concluded that Falana contributed to the conception of the claimed compositions ‚Äìof-matter by developing a previously unknown method for their preparation and ordered the USPTO to correct the inventorship (the USPTO records as of 16 June 2016 are still not corrected at and the patent maintenance fee lapsed on December 14, 2012). The District Court also found the case to be exceptional under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 285 on three grounds: 1) that defendants engaged in inequitable conduct, 2) that they took an untenable position in defending this case, and 3) that their continued defense of this case in the face of testimony that lacked credibility and veracity was frivolous and bordered on bad faith and awarded attorney fees to Falana. Appeal Kent State and other Defendants appealed to the CAFC and the case was decided on January 23, 2012. The CAFC affirmed the decisions of the District Court on both inventorship and attorney fees. The Federal Circuit found that where the method of synthesizing the claimed compound requires more than the exercise of ordinary skill in the art, the discovery of that method is as much a contribution to the compound as the discovery of the compound itself. It established a binding precedent that the conception a synthetic method can make a person an inventor on a composition- of-matter claim, even if the person did not actually make the compound in question but only developed a method for making the compound, provided that the method was not publicly known previously. Significance This case was decided after an earlier 2001's Chou v. University of Chicago and had similar circumstances and outcome, suggesting that university faculty and administration need to be better educated on the principles of Intellectual Property Law. It also established a currently binding precedent in regard to joint inventorship and attorney fee-shifting in the US Patent Law.Case Study: Falana V. Kent State Law 360, May 7, 2012Paul R.

Known for his missionary work in Rhodesia, Alvord's demonstrative methods are credited with revolutionising African agriculture.  Biography  Alvord was born in Utah on March 25, 1899. He studied for a Master of Science degree in agriculture at Washington State College and after graduation worked as a teacher, specialising in agricultural science after 1913. He joined the US Department of Agriculture's Extension Service in 1919. The same year he volunteered to serve as a missionary with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) and was sent to the Mount Selinda mission in Chipinge District Rhodesia as an agriculturalist. At Mount Selinda he taught modern agricultural techniques to Africans and introduced terrace farming as a means of preserving soil cover to hillside plots. Some of the European settlers disagreed with Alvord's teachings as they enabled the African population to earn money from cash crops. In 1920 he was asked to help draw up plans for a new state-run agricultural school at Domboshawa. As well as establishing the school Alvord spent some time there training the staff and teaching students about legumes, crop rotation, ploughing, fertilising and row planting. Alvord's teaching methods, based upon demonstration, were well regarded by the new South Rhodesian state, which sough to increase the output of African-run farms, and in 1926 he was appointed the government's Agriculturalist for the Instruction of Natives. His schools taught Africans modern techniques of irrigation, stock management, soil conservation, village planning and sanitation. There is an often disputed claim that he was the first to introduce the plough to Melsetter District. In 1944 Alvord became Director of the Department of Native Agriculture. Through this position he was able to implement his demonstrative method throughout the country and promote the centralisation of arable and grazing areas. His influence is regarded as having revolutionised African agriculture. He was recognised by the British state, who appointed him an officer of the Order of the British Empire on June 10, 1948. He retired from government service in 1950 and returned to missionary work with the ABCFM, serving as principal of the Alvord Agricultural School until 1954. From 1954 he was principal of Marandellas School of Agriculture of the Methodist Mission. Alvord died in Southern Rhodesia (then part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland) on May 6, 1959.

According to one of its creators, the urban architect Alain Renk: \\"Today the future of cities and metropoles lies less in the poetic, imaginary and solitary techniques found in Jules Verne‚Äôs novels than in capacities offered by digital mediations to imagine, represent and openly share knowledge, through the collective intelligence, offering opportunities to consider less standardized and prioritized lifestyles, freer creativity, shorter design and manufacturing circuits of circular economies and, ultimately, preservation of common goods.  Backgrounds  The project originates in 2002 at the Orleans ArchiLab international meetings, with the publication of the book named Construire la Ville Complexe? (Building the Complex City?), published by Jean Michel Place, a well-known editor in the world of architecture.

Their presence in the neighbourhoods for several weeks, right where people live and work, prompts the number of participants to be much higher (over 1 600 people in Evreux) than with conventional methods of consultation that struggle to get people go to places allocated for this. These achievements arouse the interest of some researchers who will analyse some attitude changes in urban professionals and citizens. Can we talk about a rebirth of participatory democracy? Are those images, which belong to hyperrealism, misleading or conversely are they accessible to all kinds of people? Are the Open-Source dimension of the collected data and its accessibility in real time involved in building trust between experts and non-experts? The method is the topic of several scientific articles, Article written by Nancy Ottaviano in June 2014 in Unlimited Cities Montpellier Article by Nancy Ottaviano for Participation et d√©mocratie and has been honoured with several awards in France, as well as with the Open Cities Award from the European Commission.  UN-Habitat and Unlimited Cities DIY  The first requests were initially applied for in Rio, in 2011, for associations to use the software in the favelas, and then recurrently in Africa, South America and India. In parallel associations and groups in Europe also wanted to be free to implement, in their territories and independently, the collaborative urban planning device without needing further financing than users‚Äô support. In June 2013 the Civic-Tech UFO presented at the festival Futur en Seine the Unlimited Cities DIY prototype: an open source, free and easy to implement upgrade.

Little personal information is known about him aside from his French origin. His anonymity is a deliberate artistic choice in order to place more importance on the music itself rather than the identity of the musician behind it. Hueso started writing music as Carpenter Brut with the intention of mixing sounds from horror films, metal, rock, and electronic music. Carpenter Brut has released three EPs, EP I (2012), EP II (2013) and EP III (2015) which were collected and released together as the album Trilogy (2015). He has released two additional studio albums, Leather Teeth (2018) and Blood Machines OST (2020), along with one live album, CARPENTERBRUTLIVE (2017). He has also contributed original music to a variety of soundtracks, both for film and video games. In live performances Carpenter Brut is joined on stage by guitarist Adrien Grousset and drummer Florent Marcadet, both from the French metal band Hacride and in 2016 Brut toured the United States with the Swedish heavy metal band Ghost. In a 2018 interview with Loudwire, Tobias Forge, lead singer of the band Ghost, stated that Hueso was also the producer for the band Deathspell Omega, a French black metal band known for the anonymity of its members. History =Origins= Hueso describes the beginnings of Carpenter Brut as \\"a joke,\\" and contends that the name Carpenter Brut is a play on words, derived from the surname of filmmaker and composer John Carpenter and the champagne Charpentier Brut. The idea to make electronic music stemmed from wanting to write music alone, rather than being in a band. Hueso explained in 2017 \\"Electro music is perfect for that [writing alone], especially when you‚Äôre not a good musician like me. I don‚Äôt know how to play guitar; it would have been a poor decision.\\" =EPs & Trilogy (2012‚Äî2015)= Carpenter Brut's 2012 and 2013 EP's were released on BlackBvs Records. The third EP, in 2015 (and all subsequent releases, ), were released on Hueso's own No Quarter Prod label. The label was created with the intention of allowing Hueso to remain independent and maintain control over his own image and art. =Leather Teeth (2018)= Carpenter Brut's second full-length album was released at midnight on February 22, 2018 with no pre-release promotion. A press release accompanying the release read: \\"Leather Teeth is the soundtrack to a movie envisioned by Carpenter Brut, one that tells the story of a shy American teenager, Bret Halford, who can‚Äôt get the girl and will do anything he can to win her over, including becoming the singer of one of the most talked about bands in mid-‚Äò80s glam-metal, Leather Patrol.\\" The press release included a quote from Carpenter Brut, describing the album as \\"pure frenzy like Master of Puppets, or any of the good old metal albums.\\" Leather Teeth features Kristoffer Rygg of Ulver and Mat McNerney of Grave Pleasures on vocals. In a December, 2018 interview, Hueso explained that Leather Teeth was inspired by \\"Judas Priest, and the glam rock of the '80s.\\" It is the first album in a trilogy and tells the story of \\"[a] main character [who] is still a young student in love, and not yet the serial killer he will become in the second part of the trilogy. Even if he has tantrums as in ‚ÄúMonday Hunt‚Äù or ‚ÄúHairspray Hurricane,‚Äù he is still convinced that he can conquer Kendra, the cheerleader.\\" Hueso described himself, in a 2018 interview, as being \\"tired of this race to whoever makes the darkest or most brutal music, it‚Äôs just bullshit,\\" while describing Leather Teeth's sound as being \\"softer\\" and \\"more glamorous\\" than Trilogy \\"while flirting with a dark side that will be developed in the next album,\\" a sequel which he intends to be \\"darker and more violent.\\" =Blood Machines OST (2020)= Carpenter Brut's Blood Machines OST was released in April, 2020. It is the soundtrack to a 50-minute film directed by Seth Ickerman, director of the \\"Turbo Killer\\" music video. The idea came from online response to \\"Turbo Killer\\" and requests for a sequel; the film was devised by Ickerman while Hueso describes himself as being \\"in charge of the soundtrack.\\" =Leather Teeth follow-up (upcoming)= Hueso has suggested that a new Carpenter Brut album may be released by the end of 2020 \\"at the very earliest.\\" The album will involve a \\"reinvention\\" of Carpenter Brut and taking the music \\"on a darker path.\\" It will be a continuation of the Leather Teeth trilogy and will involve a story of \\"a character who wants to take revenge on the cheerleader who‚Äôs been making fun of him 'serial killer style'.\\" Hueso described one track off the album as \\"really long, really violent, and which will have much more of a black metal vibe to it. The ending will go on for about five minutes and will consist of only blast beats.\\" Hueso suggested Ben Koller of Converge would perform on the track. =Other appearances= Hueso also wrote music for the 2016 video game Furi, a process which he described as being \\"a lot less free\\" than composing music for Carpenter Brut. Hueso explained that he was required to work with scenes that the video game designers sent, while also working with loops that can go on for several minutes if the player decided to stay in the same place. Ultimately, Hueso described it as \\"a good experience,\\" but wasn't sure he would attempt it again, citing a greater affinity for soundtracks for film than video games. In 2019 Hueso appeared in the documentary film The Rise of the Synths which explored the origins and growth of the genre. Hueso appeared alongside various other composers from the Synthwave scene, including John Carpenter himself who also starred in and narrated the film. Music Videos =Music Videos= When working on a trailer for Festival de l‚ÄôEtrange, director duo Rapha√´l Hernandez and Savitri Joly-Gonfard (working under the name Seth Ickerman) approached Hueso with the request to use the track \\"Hang'em All\\" for the trailer's soundtrack. Having been aware of the duo and liking their \\"DIY and smart\\" approach to their work, Hueso allowed use of the track and Ickerman went on to direct all of Carpenter Brut's music videos for the first three EP's. For the music video to \\"Turbo Killer,\\" Hueso gave \\"carte blanche\\" to the directors, with the only stipulation that they \\"give birth to certain characters\\" he had in mind. Hueso saw the video two weeks before its wide release and described his reaction to it as \\"thrilled [...] like a kid opening his Christmas presents,\\" and wondering \\"how the fuck did they do that?\\" The music videos for the album Leather Teeth were directed by Silver Strain, who also created the visuals projected during Carpenter Brut's live performances. =Blood Machines (2020)= Cast the known cast is: * Elisa Lasowski as Corey (a priestess) * Anders Heinrichsen as Vascan (spaceship captain) * Christian Erickson as Lago (spaceship mechanic) * Jo√´lle Berckmans as Mima (a ghost) * No√©mie Stevens in an unknown role History and overview Ickerman had wanted to make a feature length film using a Carpenter Brut soundtrack prior to the release of the Turbo Killer music video, and due to the success of Turbo Killer and fan requests for a follow- up, Blood Machines entered development. A successful Kickstarter campaign saw the film jump from an estimated run time of 30 minutes to 50 minutes; it is expected to be released in 2020 and will be a sequel to the Turbo Killer music video. As with their earlier collaborations, Ickerman have \\"free rein\\" in terms of the visuals, with Hueso describing himself as being \\"in charge of the soundtrack.\\" In December, 2016, David Sandberg, director of Kung Fury (2015), signed on to Blood Machines as producer; a press release for the announcement described the film's plot as \\"following two space hunters chasing the female ghost of a machine through the galaxy.\\" The official synopsis, reads: Influences \\"At the very beginning,\\" Hueso commented, Carpenter Brut was influenced by Justice, but by 2017 he would be \\"much more inspired by prog rock artists,\\" like Toto and Supertramp along with Iron Maiden, Meshuggah, Ulver, Nine Inch Nails, Type O Negative, Pink Floyd and The Beatles. In a 2019 interview with Kerrang!, Hueso stated that his early musical influences included Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death. Hueso claimed in 2016 to not listen to horror movie soundtracks, but noted there were \\"themes that stand out,\\" such as Creepshow, Maniac Cop and Friday the 13th and that he does enjoy the compositions of John Williams, John Carpenter, Alan Silvestri and James Horner. Cinematically, Hueso's influences include 1980s \\"Slasher/Horror/B-movies as well as blockbusters,\\" and Hueso has specifically noted, \\"everything from Steven Spielberg\\" along with Star Wars, The Terminator, RoboCop, Predator, The Thing, Street Trash, Bad Taste, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Evil Dead, Nekromantik and Maniac Cop, commenting, \\"not only did I find that these films were totally badass, but their soundtracks were too. Music was an integral part of the movies, that‚Äôs what I enjoyed.\\" Ultimately he concluded that, \\"those influences run through everything Carpenter Brut does: the desire to give you something violent, cinematic and fun!\\" Hueso bases his live performances on those of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, stating \\"I didn‚Äôt like playing live at the beginning [...] I just wanted to make music in my room. When it became clear that people wanted me to play I worked hard to put on a real show. It‚Äôs the same as Trent Reznor with Nine Inch Nails: if I‚Äôm going to play live, it needs to be huge.\\" Discography =Albums= * Trilogy (2015) A compilation of the three Carpenter Brut EPs. * Leather Teeth (2018) * Blood Machines OST (2020) =EPs= * EP I (2012) * EP II (2013) * EP III (2015) =Live albums= * CARPENTERBRUTLIVE (2017) =Remixes= * Le Couleur - Vacances de 87 (Carpenter Brut Remix) (2013) * Scattle - Remorse (Carpenter Brut Remix) (2014) * GUNSHIP - Tech Noir (Carpenter Brut Remix) (2015) * MOON - Dust (Carpenter Brut Remix) (2015) * Ghost - Dance Macabre (Carpenter Brut Remix) (2018) * League of Legends - Phoenix (Carpenter Brut Remix) (2019) =Single track releases= * \\"Chew Bubblegum...\\" (2014)  Bandcamp Subscriber Exclusive Track * \\"The Good Old Call\\" (2014)  Bandcamp Subscriber Exclusive Track * \\"Mandarin Claws\\" (2014)  Bandcamp Subscriber Exclusive Track * \\"Hush Sally, Hush!\\" (2019)  Bandcamp Subscriber Exclusive Track * \\"Maniac feat Yann Ligner\\" (2020) =Other appearances= * Perturbator - Dangerous Days (2014) (track, \\"Complete Domination (Feat.

Biography  He was born in a lower-middle-class neighborhood where most of the residents, including his parents, engaged in handicrafts. He had a passion for drawing and, at the age of twelve, he was apprenticed at a local decorative painting workshop.\\"Vicente Castell y su Tiempo\\" @ Jaume I University. His talents eventually gained him entrance to classes being taught by the costumbrista painter and drawing professor, Eduardo Laforet (1850-1941), who had a home and workshop in Castell√≥n where he served as a mentor to young artists. Portrait of the guitarist, Francisco T√°rrega (1904) One of Laforet's associates helped Castell enroll at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos in Valencia, where he studied from 1891 to 1893, working at odd jobs and painting portraits to pay his way. While there, he came under the influence of Joaqu√≠n Sorolla and Ignacio Pinazo.Biographical notes @ EPdLP. On the strength of his work, he received scholarships from the . He also found a patron in Gaspar Cazador, proprietor of the Hotel Espa√±a. These financial sources enabled him to study at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Sant Jordi in Barcelona from 1898 to 1899, followed by studies at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. There, he visited the Museo del Prado to acquaint himself with the Old Masters. He later visited Rome, where he became ill with yellow fever and nearly died. A friend intervened, however, and brought him back home, where he recovered and was able to attend the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1901, he was awarded a bronze medal at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts. The following year, he married the niece of one of the painters he had been apprenticed to as a boy and opened an art academy. He would teach most of the best-known painters to emerge from Castell√≥n, including , and . During the war, with very little demand for art, he and a friend opened a small workshop where they made toys. After pricking the middle finger on his right hand with a large splinter, he developed an infection that required surgery and left that finger virtually paralyzed. In 1923 the Mayor, Francisco Ruiz Cazador, appointed him a Municipal Councillor and he later became a Deputy Mayor. In 1928, he was one of the founders of the Escuela de Artes y Oficios and was chosen to be Director. He suffered hearts attacks in 1932 and 1933 and died of one in 1934.

In: Zollern-Alb-Kurier of 30 September 2009 The training area is the hub of the federal armed forces in the Sigmaringen district, and the last military training center still in use in southern Germany.

In August 1899 the Grand Duchy of Baden's Ministry of Finance was informed by the General Command in Karlsruhe of the requirements for a future training area. In addition to many other criteria, the future area should not have a high elevation, should have a railway terminal and should be as circular as possible. The agency assigned to conduct the search (Dom√§nendirektion) quickly determined that the wishes of the military could not be met by any of the candidates. In 1905, the interest of the agency focused on the Heuberg. Since both the terrain and the purchase presented the fewest difficulties, the site was chosen, despite the fact that the future training area was only one-third in Baden and would not have a railway connection. Plans for a military station below the outer firing position Blumersberg in Me√üstetten were worked out in detail for 8000 gold marks.Stadtarchiv Pl√§ne Heubergbahn Me√üstetten mit Milit√§rbahnhof HR-E 787.11/01-05 From 1908 on purchase negotiations were held for the areas in Baden,Gro√üherzogtum Baden, Bezirksamt Me√ükirch: Heinstetten, Schwenningen und Stetten am kalten Markt W√ºrttembergK√∂nigreich W√ºrttemberg, Oberamt Balingen: Ebingen und Me√üstetten und Prussia,Hohenzollernsche Lande, Oberamt Gammertingen Frohnstetten, Kaiseringen und Stra√übergAllgemeine Forst und Jagdzeitung, Volumr 87, 1911 which dragged on for some time.

Because there were not enough fixed accommodations, the soldiers were housed in tents or quartered in the surrounding communities. Between 1912 and 1916 Camp Heuberg was built in the district of Stetten am kalten Markt. The establishment of the training area forced the destruction of several settlements which had been built to improve the economic situation of the population in the former territory of Stra√überg, Zollernalbkreis.Neun Forscher stellen Untersuchungen zur Landesgeschichte an.

The Prussian Ministry of War. gave careful consideration to the naming of the training area. In addition to the proposals as \\"Truppen√ºbungsplatz Stetten\\", \\"Truppen√ºbungsplatz Heuberg\\" was ultimately selected and approved by the Minister of War. In both World Wars a prisoner-of-war camp was established at the site. At the beginning of 1933 the existing buildings on the Heuberg north of the facility were used as one of the first concentration camps of the Nazi regime. Up to 2,000 people, mostly political opponents of the regime, were taken in protective custody. After nine months, Concentration Camp Heuberg was dissolved. Most prisoners were then deported into larger concentration camps, such as Dachau. Memorial for the Bachem Ba 349 ‚ÄûNatter‚Äú on the Ochsenkopf.

The grave is still there today; also still to be seen at the launch point are the concrete launch pad and the wooden stump of the launching ramp. =Postwar years until today= From 1945 to 1959 the site was under French administration. The last French army unit moved from Camp Heuberg in 1997. In 1966 the Bundeswehr expanded in Stetten am kalten Markt with the construction of the Albkaserne. Missiles were stationed here during the Cold War. In 1995 the city of Me√üstetten reacquired the former \\"Blumersberg\\" artillery site. Used chiefly for the armored corps until the end of the twienth century, Heuberg is now used in many ways besides‚Äî practicing Army force basic training, bomb disposal, military police, Technisches Hilfswerk, professional fire, Federal Police, customs and police, CBRN defense. Nature and landscape protection The training center possesses an extraordinarily important ecology for nature preservation. The area is divided into 40 per cent forest cover and 60 percent open meadow areas, some interspersed with juniper heath. It is characterized by the traditional herding economy (transhumance). So it is possible to maintain or expand the typical landscape of the past centuries at the facility. On the hills are old bunkers, or what is left of them to see after bombardment. Since the training area is burdened by its nearly century-old military use to a large extent with ammunition and parts, entering and driving is extremely dangerous and therefore strictly forbidden for civilians.

The meadow at the Dreibannmarke served as a stopping place for traveling merchants, wagons and craftsmen. With care it is possible to identify traces of the border. After the inauguration of the firing ranges, a meadow was allocated to the Gypsies as a camping site at the edge of the restricted area. Until 1835 merchants were smuggled over the customs borders guarded by local hunters. Ritter Heinrich von Tierberg, called Haiterbach, had most likely sold his property in Haiterbach, and in 1345 acquired his new territory on the grounds of the military training center, the center of which was Me√üstetten.

Origin The Type ET tender first entered service in 1947, as tenders to the last batch of 100 Class 15F locomotives to enter service on the South African Railways (SAR). They were built by North British Locomotive Company to designs by Doctor M.M. Loubser, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1939 to 1949, and were equipped with mechanical stokers.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947).

Modification During the 1950s, some of the Type ET tenders were modified to enlarge their coal bunkers from capacity. These modified tenders were designated Type ET1. Classification letters Since many tender types are interchangeable between different locomotive classes and types, a tender classification system was adopted by the SAR. The first letter of the tender type indicates the classes of engines to which it can be coupled. The \\"E_\\" tenders were arranged with mechanical stokers and could be used with the locomotive classes as shown. * Class 15F, if equipped with a mechanical stoker. * Class 23. * Class 25NC. * Class 26.

The cultural institution responsible for its protection is the CADA (, Archeological Ensemble Dolmens of Antequera). It was declared a World Heritage Site in 2016. Outstanding Universal Value For something to be declared World Heritage Site, it must demonstrate exceptional universal value; that is, an extraordinary importance transcending national borders and of interest to present and future generations of all humanity. UNESCO requires justification of at least one of the six criteria set for the cultural heritage by the Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972) to demonstrate the exceptional universal value of the site. The proposal of the Antequera Dolmens Site is based on one of them (i); the International Council on Monuments and Sites in its final report incorporates other two (iii, iv). * Criterion (i): \\"represent a masterpiece of the human creative genius\\" The Neolithic Dolmen of Menga represents one of the most important masterpiece of megalithic architecture (Atlantic tradition) based on post-and-lintel construction with an earthen covering, notable for its enormous dimensions that push the size possible in a corridor sepulcher by incorporating the unprecedented solution of intermediate pillars; likewise, the later, Chalcolithic tholos (beehive tomb) of El Romeral complements the two dolmens with its corridor and false dome of drystone masonry (Mediterranean tradition). * Criterion (iii): \\"provide a unique testimony, or at least exceptional, on a cultural tradition or a living or dead civilization\\" Both the Dolmen of Menga and the Tholos of El Romeral have anomalous orientations. The archaeoastronomer Michael Hoskin, who studied the site, noted that, whereas the axes of almost all dolmens around the Mediterranean are oriented to a celestial feature, such as sunrise at dawn on the equinoxes (as occurs in the Dolmen of Viera), the Dolmen of Menga points to the striking nearby peak called the Pe√±a de los Enamorados. This rises abruptly from the plain and contains the contemporaneous rock shelter of Matacabras, in which cave paintings are found.Decree 245/2011 of 12 July, which is enroll into the General Catalogue of the Andalusian Historical Heritage as Bien de Inter√©s Cultural, with the typology of archaeological site, the Archaeological site of Pe√±a de los Enamorados, in the municipality of Antequera (Andalusia). BOJA n¬∫150 de 02/08/2011 Meanwhile, the Tholos of El Romeral is oriented to the mountains of El Torcal, containing the Cave of the Bull (terrestrial orientation), as well as to the noon sun on the winter solstice (celestial orientation). El Torcal is noted for the extensive, otherworldly karst landscape at its summit. In addition, the Tholos of El Romeral lies along an axis from the Dolmen of Menga to the Pe√±a de los Enamorados. Thus, the Dolmens of Antequera construct a unique megalithic landscape by their relationship with the surrounding natural elements. * Criterion (iv): \\"be an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates one or several significant periods of human history\\" The three megalithic monuments reflect a stage of human history in which the first ceremonial monuments in Western Europe were built, according to the two major building traditions of megalithic art (lintel and beehive). This is an unusual proposal on the List of World Heritage Sites as it is not being put forward as a mixed heritage site, in which its cultural value would be added to its natural value, but as an integration and close dialogue between the megalithic architecture and the landscape. A phenomenon of \\"landscape monumentalization\\" has occurred here by which the natural landmarks acquire the value of monuments while the manmade constructs present the appearance of a natural landscape. Finally, the authenticity of the megaliths is well established, with the Dolmen of Menga dating to the Neolithic and the Tholos of El Romeral to the Chalcolithic, and the structures retain high integrity, being in good condition and well maintained.

Description  This species was originally described by B. S. Ferrero and J. I. Noriega in 2007. Their description was based on quite complete cranial pieces exhumed from sediments of the Luj√°n River in the Diamante department, in the province of Entre R√≠os, in central-eastern Argentina. The type specimen is CICYTTP- PV-M-1-23, a skull and proximal fragment of the right jaw. Its type locality is the north bank of the Ensenada stream, on a pleistocene lake-fluvial horizon in the \\"Arroyo Feliciano formation\\" of Argentina. It is described as having a long and robust skull, with a short rostrum with respect to the total length of the skull. The skull has a single, non-arched sagittal crest, large flat parietal bones on the anterior skull cover, with the temporal crests converging very close to the frontal-parietal suture. The palate is highly arched, the premaxilla is deeply serrated above the canine, and the upper jaw and base of the zygomatic process are surprisingly robust. The P1 is short and quadrangular, and the mandibular condyle is thin, with the posterior wall flat or somewhat concave. An extensive study of all the Tapirus materials collected in the fossil deposits of South America concluded that this is a valid species. On the basis of morphometric analysis of its teeth, it is concluded that Tapirus mesopotamicus is significantly smaller than the larger fossil or living tapirs, such as Tapirus indicus, Tapirus oliverasi, Tapirus tarijensis, and Tapirus haysii; and that it was similar in size to Tapirus terrestris and Tapirus rondoniensis.  Habitat and Diet  This species, like any member of the Tapirus genus, is associated with warm climates: rainforest, savanna or humid tropical or subtropical forests near rivers; with a herbivorous diet of leaves and fruits.

Biography Babe, an American, arrived in the Cape Colony (modern-day South Africa) circa 1865 as a sales representative for the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and also as a special correspondent for the New York World. He arrived in Colesberg, Cape Colony on June 12, 1870 and by July 4 was at Jacobsdal, Orange Free State. At Jacobsdal he demonstrated the 1866 .44 Henry Winchester rifle's quick firing by shooting 16 rounds in ten seconds, resulting in a large number of sales. Once he completed his work for Winchester and the newspaper, Babe found that he had several months before his scheduled return journey. He decided to enter into diamond mining, having previously had experience prospecting in California. This was soon after the first discovery of diamonds in the region. Babe was unimpressed with the technique that was then in use on the diamond fields, of excavating a quantity of gravel and then removing it to the nearest water source, often some distance away, for washing and screening. He devised a type of dry sorting pan that could sort diamonds from the gravel without the use of water. This machine was first used at the Vaal River field in 1871 and became known as the \\"Yankee Baby\\" or simply the \\"Baby\\" after Babe's surname. The machine became very popular and was still in use in the region in 1966. The \\"Baby\\" functioned as a swinging sieve (underneath a coarser sieve which separates out the larger pebbles), which allows medium-sized pebbles (which may contain diamonds) to roll into a tub. The contents of the tub are gravitated, and the heavier stones are placed on a sorting table to allow the diamonds to be hand-picked out. Sales of the Baby, income from excavating diamonds, sales of diamonds purchased from other miners, and profits from \\"grubstakes\\" (whereby he earned a cut of profits from miners to whom Babe provided capital, materials or provisions) made Babe a fortune. In 1872, he was in the eastern United States where he published a book titled The South African Diamond Fields. This work was mentioned in a discussion on potential rivals by Mark Twain in a letter to journalist John Henry Riley. Babe was robbed of $10,000 worth of diamonds from a stagecoach in York, Pennsylvania in July 1872. After returning to the Cape, his ventures became unprofitable and, after losing his money, he returned to America in 1873. Babe was married to Elanora Ray Babe, who died on May 28, 1893, less than two months after him.

Raab was born in Glogau (now G≈Çog√≥w, Poland). He studied for several years at the leopoldinum (later to become the University of Wroc≈Çaw). He also took part in performances at the catholic church there. He studied violin with a violinist named Rau before moving to Berlin to study with Franz Benda. He also began composing numerous concertos, sonatas and sinfonias in the style of his master. His name appears as a dedication on the autograph manuscript of a quartet by Johann Gottlieb Janitsch dated 1750, Potsdam alongside Johann Caspar Grundke, an oboist of Frederick the Great's Hofkapelle. This indicates that he took part in performances at the Royal Court, or possibly at Janitsch's weekly house concerts \\"Freitags-Akademien\\".) In this particular quartet, Raab must have played either viola or violetta. In 1753 he was employed as Konzertmeister at the Hofkapelle of Karl Friedrich Albrecht, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt in Berlin. After the death of the Margrave in 1762, he acquired the position of chamber musician and director of music at the court of Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia. In 1784, he was recorded as living in Mauerstra√üe. His date of death is unknown. His son, Ernst Heinrich Otto (1750-1801), having learnt the violin from his father, also became a distinguished violinist and was appointed as a chamber musician to the emperor of Russia.

Characteristics  This species was originally described by Elizete Celestino Holanda, Ana Maria Ribeiro, and Jorge Ferigolo, in 2011, using materials from the Upper Pleistocene of the Madeira River Formation, in Araras, Nova Mamor√© municipality, Rondonia state, Brazil. The type specimen of Tapirus rondoniensis is an almost complete skull with a unique combination of characteristics that differ from those of current and fossil species of Tapirus described in South America. It is mainly identified by its broad frontals that support pneumatization that extends to the frontoparietal suture, a high sagittal crest, and a weakly molarized P2. T. rondoniensis is similar in some respects to T. terrestris, but retains some primitive cranial and dental character states like T. pinchaque, such as broad fronts and a weakly molarized P2. An extensive study of all the materials collected in the fossil deposits of the Tapirus genus concluded that this is a valid species. On the basis of morphometric analysis of its teeth, it is concluded that T. rondoniensis is significantly smaller than most fossil or living tapirs, such as T. indicus, T. oliverasi, T. tarijensis, and T. haysii; and that it was similar in size to T. terrestris and T. mesopotamicus.

The bridge opened in 1854 and was used to take the main road traffic over the river until 1932.  Overview  The bridge was designed by James Dredge, an engineer from England. Dredge used his patented 'taper principle' design for the bridge. The bridge uses a double cantilever system where two opposing cantilevers are supported by suspension chains giving it the appearance of a classic suspension bridge. The span of the bridge is and the two main chains are apart. Each of the main chains is made from a series of wrought-iron eye-rods varying in length from to and with a nominal diameter of . The main chains hang over high granite towers and one end of each chain is anchored to the bridge at mid-span and the other ends are anchored below ground inland of the bridge. The chains consist of twelve parallel rods at the tower and progressively reduce in width by one link at each joint towards each end of the chains as they get further from the towers. The decking is of timber, supported on trussed wrought-iron transoms.  History  In 1849 an old stone bridge that spanned the River Oich near Aberchalder was destroyed by flooding. To reduce the risk of a new bridge being damaged by similar flooding, it was decided that a single-span bridge was required to replace the old bridge. English engineer James Dredge was engaged to provide such a bridge. Dredge used his patented 'taper principle' for the bridge which was opened in 1854. Dredge's bridge carried the main road traffic across the River Oich until the construction of a two-lane concrete bridge in 1932. Following its withdrawal from service, the bridge fell into disrepair and had to be closed to public use. The bridge, which is now a listed building, was renovated for Historic Scotland in 1997, and returned to use as a public footbridge.

One example is that, in prehistoric times, north of Ilo, Peru, far from any other source of water, four lomas-fed springs permitted about of irrigated agriculture plus grazing for llamas and alpacas. Hundreds of people of the Chiribaya culture benefited from this unlikely agriculture in a rainless land. Later, during the 17th century, Spanish colonists pastured 200 mules in these lomas.

Biography  Wayne Rhoden (Music), known professionally as Father Goose, is a Jamaican-born producer, singer, songwriter. He made a name for himself in the underground circuit in Jamaica and on the streets of Brooklyn, New York under the personas of Rankin Don and Don Chibaka. As Father Goose he performs children's music, Kindie rock, and reggae-fied nursery rhymes, often in the ‚ÄúDan Zanes and Friends‚Äù ensemble, including in a series of Disney videos entitled ‚ÄúHouse Party Time.‚Äù = Early life = Wayne Rhoden was born in Jamaica to Joyce and James Rhoden and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Like many musical artists, his debut performance occurred at a young age. He recalls that his first singing performance happened at the age of five, using his family and friends as his audience. On subsequent occasions he would serve as DJ for parties thrown by his parents. Later he performed in a PTA-hosted Ash Wednesday fundraising fair at his Ewarton grade school. He attended Erasmus High School in Brooklyn, New York, then went on to pursue a career in electrical engineering. But as fate would have it, he was drawn to his first love, music. = Musical career = In the 1980s as Rankin Don he recorded the hits Can‚Äôt Find Me Love and Baddest DJ and in the 90s the Real McCoy, Black Queen, and Green Card. He was later introduced to producers who urged him to record for the mainstream labels. He has performed at concerts with some of reggae's well-known artists including, Gregory Isaacs, Andre, Sleepy Worder, Lloyd D Stiff, and Blacka Ranks; Grammy nominees Beres Hammond and Freddie McGregor; and past Grammy winners Shabba Ranks, Shaggy, and Beenie Man. His relationship with musician Dan Zanes was initiated by his mother, who while working for Zanes, suggested that he should meet her son and check out his talent. In the 2000s as Father Goose he was featured on several Dan Zanes albums such as Rocket Ship Beach and Catch That Train! and also released three of his own albums: Color with Father Goose, It‚Äôs a Bam Bam Diddly, and Bashment Time. In 2008 as Don Chibaka he gave his performance on the Etcetera single Dance Like That (Remix) featuring Richie Stephens and Kevin Lyttle. = Personal life = Father Goose on life support Rhoden is the father of two. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and his son (Little Goose) who also sings and performs in his father's band. In 2007, Rhoden discovered he had kidney failure. He received a kidney in December 2015 after eight years on dialysis, twice on life support and other complications. The kidney transplant was successful: he has made a full recovery and is currently still performing and hosting music workshops for children.

The church, built in 1911 for an African- American congregation founded in 1889, is a well-preserved example of English and Gothic Revival architecture. The parsonage, built in 1913, is a little- altered example of Colonial Revival architecture. Both buildings are important in the history of Springfield's African-American community, and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. The church building is now occupied by a different congregation, the original having moved to larger quarters across Union Street; the parsonage house continues to be used by the St. John's congregation as an education center. Description and history The historic buildings of the St. John's congregation are located east of downtown Springfield, in the city's Old Hill neighborhood. The church stands at the southeast corner of Union and Hancock Streets, and the former parsonage next to it on Union Street. The modern St. John's church, opened in 2013, stands across Union Street. The historic church faces Hancock Street; it is a single-story wood frame building, with a gabled roof and shingled exterior. It was built in 1911 to a design by Hammett Seabury, a regionally prominent architect. The parsonage is a 2-1/2 story Colonial wood-frame structure, also designed by Seabury, and completed in 1913. The St. John's congregation traces its origins to the oldest of Springfield's African-American congregations. The Free Church was founded in 1844, and was an important area center of abolitionist activity, serving as a nexus of activity on the Underground Railroad. The church congregation included the noted abolitionist John Brown in its early years. In 1889, this congregation merged with the Sanford Street Congregational Church to form St. John's. Growth in the city's African- American population was significant in the decades after the American Civil War, and by the start of the 20th century the church was straining its existing quarters. The church was built during the leadership period of Rev. William DeBerry, and the church also built the adjacent parsonage, initially as a facility for educating and training girls (a similar building for training boys and young men has not survived). Under DeBerry's leadership, the church was also given land in East Brookfield, at which it established Camp Atwater, as a summer facility for its youth. The girls' training house was converted to a parish house and meeting space in the 1960s. The new church was built in 2013, and the old one is now occupied by a different congregation.

Besides serving with several Inuit organisations she was president of the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation. She lives in the Ottawa area and has three children. Early life Kuptana was born in 1954 in an igloo on the Prince of Wales Strait while her parents, William and Sarah Kuptana, were seal hunting. The family was living a traditional, nomadic lifestyle and it wasn't until 1958 that they permanently relocated to Sachs Harbour on Banks Island. Her father had moved to the community to help build the weather station. Growing up in Sachs, Kuptana only spoke Inuvialuktun until at the age of seven or eight, she was forcibly taken by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to the residential school in Inuvik about to the southwest. At school, she was not permitted to speak her own language and forced to adopt an alien culture. After 10 years in the school system, she lost the ability to speak Inuvialuktun, making communication with elders in her home community difficult, although she later relearned the language. CBC and IBC In 1979, she joined CBC Northern Service as a radio broadcaster, where she reported on issues that were relevant to the Inuvialuit. While at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, her broadcasts were in Inuvialuktun and they were heard throughout the Western Arctic.

Political life Kuptana had been involved in Inuit rights and land claims since 1975, and in 1986, she became the Canadian vice chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, now the Inuit Circumpolar Council. She remained in that position until 1989. In 1991, she became chair of Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, now Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. Through the Charlottetown Accord during the constitutional discussions Kuptana negotiated for the enshrinement of Inherent Right of Inuit in Canada's Constitution and came close to winning. In 1995, she became President of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference and co-chaired the Arctic Canadian panel which led up of the Arctic Council. She has also worked with the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Migratory Bird Treaty and on Inuit residential school experience where she helped Inuit in receiving compensation. In the last 10 years, Ms. Kuptana worked on the Inuit Residential School experience and ensured that Inuvialuit received compensation. As well, Ms. Kuptana has written articles and worked on the emergent issue of Arctic Sovereignty and Security.

Critical reception John Lleonart in The Canberra Times put the book into its context: \\"A Cartload of Clay is a mellow, often distinctly melancholy autobiographical essay. Johnston had intended it to be a novel but the fact that it is structurally incomplete does not detract from it. The absence of a contrived ending is, indeed, a factor in the book's impact as a human document...There is no doubt that the Johnston trilogy has reached a plane where neither the most determined parochial masochism and self-revelation can harm it. And even if, while writing this last painful episode, he was over- conscious about not being well-known outside Australia, that too may serve a worthwhile purpose. Any Australian writer who in future can produce work of the quality of the Johnston trilogy will, surely know he does not have to apologise for it to anybody.\\"\\"A writer's swansong\\" by John Lleonart, The Canberra Times, 16 October 1971, p15 See also * My Brother Jack * Clean Straw for Nothing * 1971 in literature References 1971 Australian novels Unfinished novels Australian autobiographical novels ","title":"A Cartload of Clay"},{"id":"51090762","title":"List of Commonwealth War Graves Commission World War I memorials to the missing"},{"id":"51090777","text":"Fremulon Production logo, as seen on Brooklyn Nine-Nine Fremulon is a television production company founded by television producer and writer Michael Schur.

It was named for Andr√© Mass√©na. Its layout was designed by Joseph Vernier in 1843-1844. The Place Mass√©na is the main square of the city. Before the Paillon River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Mass√©na Casino in 1979, the Place Mass√©na became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of Italian architecture. The recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Mass√©na has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the Corso carnavalesque (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets. The Place Mass√©na is a two-minute walk from the Promenade des Anglais, old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (Jardin Albert Ier). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: avenue Jean M√©decin, avenue F√©lix Faure, boulevard Jean Jaur√®s, avenue de Verdun and rue Gioffredo.

He often was referred to as Pat Conway or Patsy Conway. Early life Conway was born in Troy, New York, but moved to Homer, New York as an infant. He learned to play cornet as a young man while working in a carriage factory, joining the popular Homer Cornet Band and eventually becoming leader of the Cortland Band. The Ithaca Band After a successful appearance by the Cortland Band at the 1894 Central New York Volunteer Fireman‚Äôs Association convention in Ithaca, New York, Conway was recruited by the judges (including music educator Hollis Dann) to relocate to Ithaca in 1895. He served as director of the Cornell University Cadet Band (predecessor of the Cornell Big Red Marching Band) from 1895 to 1908. He also began teaching students at the new Ithaca Conservatory of Music (predecessor of Ithaca College) at a time when teaching band music and brass instruments was uncommon. Conway formed the Ithaca Band in 1895 and brought the ensemble to national popularity and acclaim. By around 1910, the ensemble came to be known as Conway's Band or Patrick Conway and His Famous Band. In Ithaca, they had a standing contract with the trolley company to perform at Stewart Park (then Renwick Park), but extensive tours brought them around the country to the St. Louis World's Fair, Canadian National Exhibition, Cincinnati Zoo, Corn Palace, Willow Grove Park, the Pan-American Exposition, Atlantic City, Oaks Amusement Park, and the Panama-Pacific Exposition. Many members of Conway's band had substantial success beyond the band, such as Lincoln Holroyd, Getty H. Huffine, Ernest Williams. Conway and the Ithaca Band made many recordings on the Victor and Edison labels. In 1927, they played on the premiere of the General Motors Family Hour radio show. In the stage and film productions of The Music Man, set in 1912, character Harold Hill mentions Conway in the introduction to \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\" alongside other famous bandleaders like Patrick Gilmore and John Philip Sousa. All three were inaugural members of the National Band Association Hall of Fame of Distinguished Band Conductors in 1980. Conway Military Band School In 1922, sensing the waning popularity of professional bands, Conway founded the Conway Military Band School in affiliation with the Ithaca Conservatory of Music. It was among the first schools of its kind in the country. Students included George S. Howard (first director of the U.S. Air Force Band) and Les Brown (noted bandleader). Conway led the school until his death in 1929 following a prostate operation. The school was merged into Ithaca College in 1931 and laid the foundation for the college's strong band tradition. Other work When not touring with the Ithaca Band, Conway conducted the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra from 1910 to 1916 and also led the pit orchestra for a theater in Syracuse. In World War I, he received a captain's commission and led musical activity for the United States Army Air Service while at Camp MacArthur in Waco, Texas. This was the first band program for the predecessor of the United States Air Force.

She enrolled into music school to learn piano, which she graduated in 1979. In 1981 Vetlitskaya graduated from the high school with gold medal. The same year, defying her parents' wish that she should go into studying languages, she went on to start a ballet dance school of her own.–ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª—å—è –í–µ—Ç–ª–∏—Ü–∫–∞—è. Biography at www.uznayvse.ru =Career= Natalya Vetlitskaya started her musical career by taking part in the recording of the soundtrack for the 1983 Mary Poppins, Goodbye, written by Maksim Dunayevsky, then the head of the RSFSR Pop Music Orchestra. One of its members was Pavel Smeyan, whom Vetlitskaya married in 1983, and it was he who insisted that she start singing too, not just dance. Credited as Natalya Smeyan, she recorded one song for the film Train Out of Schedule (1985). A year earlier she debuted as an actress, having received a small part in the film Vyshe radugi (Higher Than Rainbow). In 1986 Vetlitskaya took up the job of choreographer in the Retsital ballet. A year later, after the sisters Bazykins left the rock band Rondo, Mikhail Litvin invited to the auditioning Sveta Kolesnikova from the Vizit group, who brought in her friend, Natalya Vetlitskaya. \\"'But I cannot sing,' I argued. 'And I cannot dance,' she replied. So with a great deal of mutual help, in a ten days' time we prepared our own little show, got ourselves into our old school uniforms, drastically cut, and were welcomed in,\\" she remembered. Vetlitskaya worked there as choreographer, dancer and backing vocalist, and took part in the recording of four songs which made it into the 1986 Rondo-86 album. Soon her relationships with Litvin deteriorated, though, and she left. In 1987‚Äì1988 she danced and sang for the bands Klass and Idea Fix, before joining in 1988 Mirazh which she left later that year. \\"In Mirazh I earned a certain sum, 90 per cent of which I gave to my parents for them to buy a car, and the rest kept for myself, hoping this money will keep me afloat until something else comes my way,\\" Vetlitskaya remembered. All of her savings went into recording a jazz rock number at the SNC, the Stas Namin studio, but nothing came of it. Vetlitskaya's prospects started to look grim, but then Igor Matviyenko re-introduced her to Igor Zuyev, a young composer whom she knew from her days with Klass. \\"I liked his new songs and so we started to record my debut album... Then Fyodor Bondarchuk approached me, suggesting that he might shoot a clip for one of the songs, \\"Look Me into the Eyes\\". I said, okay, but I am penniless. Through some complicated financial scheme he procured the sum needed and we made this clip.\\" Considered to be Russia's first true commercial video, it was a low-budget, unrehearsed affair. \\"Those people in the video were not actors, but friends and their friends, our own circle,\\" the singer remembered. Natalya Vetlitskaya's breakthrough came in 1992 when a video for \\"Posmotri v glaza\\" (Look Me into the Eyes), her debut album's title track received the Gran Prix at the Moscow Generation-92 festival and launched the career of Fyodor Bondarchuk, who made the clip with Tigran Keosayan and Sergey Kozlov, the latter as a cameraman. The clip, nominated for the MTV Video Music Award as well as the Eurovideo Grand Prix, made the singer famous in Russia and known in Europe. Vetlitskaya's second album Playboy came out in 1994, the video for the title track, made by Sergey Kalvarsky, premiered on the New Year Eve to become a huge hit. It was followed by Raba Lyubvi (Slave to Love, 1996), its title track again topping the Russian pop radio charts. In 1997 Vetlitskaya starred in the film The New Adventures of Buratino (as Alisa the Fox) and recorded three songs for the soundtrack, including \\"Taj Mahal\\", a duo with Sergey Mazayev. Another unusual collaboration, with the post-punk outfit Nogu Svelo! resulted in \\"River\\", the duet with the band's singer Maxim Pokrovsky, who would later sum up her appeal as \\"intelligent femininity and feminine intelligence.\\" In 2003 Vetlitskaya starred as Princess Natalia in Maksim Papernik's musical Snow Queen, for which she recorded the song \\"Lanterns\\", a duet with Vadim Azarkh. Also in 2003 she performed for the last time at the festival Pesnya goda, with the song \\"Flame of Passion\\". In early 2004 her sixth album Moi lyubimy (My Beloved) came out. Later that year Vetlitskaya gave birth to her daughter Ulyana and went into semi-retirement, only occasionally appearing on TV and releasing new songs and clips (\\"Birdie\\", \\"It's not Just\\") in the course of the next five years. She was expected to make a major comeback in 2009, but the announced massive tour never materialized for reasons which remained unknown.

And we were just very good friends. Hung out together, were going to the parties as a pair. I loved him as a friend but for some reason never saw a man in him. There was nothing romantic about our relationship.\\" There was another version of the story. According to the composer Lyubov Voropayeva, who worked closely with Belousov, the latter was deeply in love with Vetliyskaya and experienced shock when, on his return from a short New Year tour, found a note informing him that the marriage was over. \\"It was a joke for her, but tragedy for him,\\" Voropayeva insisted.–ì—É—Ä—É –ö–ï–ù –õ—é–±–æ–≤—å –í–æ—Ä–æ–ø–∞–µ–≤–∞: –ñ–µ–Ω—è –ë–µ–ª–æ—É—Å–æ–≤ ‚Äì –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç –≤ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–º —à–æ—É-–±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å–µ! ‚Äì NEWSmuz.com June 4, 2012 Vetlitskaya's third husband was Kirill Kirin, originally a model, later an administrator for Philipp Kirkorov.–î–µ—Å—è—Ç–æ–≥–æ —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –±—ã —Å–æ—Ä–æ–∫ –ø—è—Ç—å –ª–µ—Ç –ø–µ–≤—Ü—É –ñ–µ–Ω–µ –ë–µ–ª–æ—É—Å–æ–≤—É. ‚Äì Moskovsky Komsomolets / www.mk.ru Over the years she had relationships with Dmitry Malikov, Vlad Stashevsky, Suleiman Kerimov (who reportedly presented her an airplane as a parting gift),–ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª—å—è –í–µ—Ç–ª–∏—Ü–∫–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—à–Ω—É—é —Å–∫–∞–∑—É –ø—Ä–æ –ö–∞–Ω–¥–µ–ª–∞–∫–∏ –∏ –ö–µ—Ä–∏–º–æ–≤–∞. ‚Äì www.eurosmi.ru Mikhail Topalov (producer and businessman, father of Vlad Topalov),–í–µ—Ç–ª–∏—Ü–∫–∞—è –∂–¥—ë—Ç —Ä–µ–±—ë–Ω–∫–∞ –æ—Ç Smash!! ‚Äì www.club.ru and Sergey Zverev.

Knopf. It is Danler's first published book. It was written by the author over a seven-year period, and, despite receiving glowing press before its release, received mixed reviews. The book is based in part on Danler's experience as a waitress in New York City. History and background The novel was written while Danler was a waitress at Union Square Cafe and an MFA student at nearby university The New School. Later, while a waitress at Buvette, another restaurant in New York City, she met Peter Gethers, a publisher, and informed him that she had recently finished a book. After Gethers recommended the manuscript to a friend, Danler received a six-figure contract for two novels at Alfred A. Knopf. Danler is one of a cohort of authors to receive large contracts in exchange for multi-book deals. Others include Emma Cline and Imbolo Mbue. Danler has stated that although she has much in common with Tess, the novel's protagonist, that Tess \\"quickly became a character, and is in many ways much better and much worse at life than I was at that age\\" and is not entirely based on her. She has also stated that the novel's other two central characters, Jake and Simone, are entirely fictional. Danler has compared writing her first novel to her experiences in the restaurant world. Plot summary Tess is twenty-two when she packs up her things in her car and moves from Ohio to New York City. Knowing nothing and no one she stumbles her way into a job at a semi-prestigious restaurant as a back waitress. The servers and staff are exceptionally tight-knit and take their jobs extremely seriously and Tess does as well. Tess is also drawn to Jake, one of the bartenders, and Simone, a senior server who takes Tess under her wing and begins to train her palate and teach her about wines so that she might one day be able to become a server. Although they initially dislike her, the staff members soon warm up to Tess and she joins them in their hedonistic lifestyle. Nevertheless she longs to be included in Simone and Jake's more exclusive circle and comes to learn that they are both from Connecticut, they knew each other before the restaurant, and Simone treats him like family. Tess aggressively pursues Jake but he refrains from sleeping with her which Tess comes to realize is because of Simone. When Simone walks in on Tess licking Jake after he cut himself, Simone says she will speak to Jake and he finally begins sleeping with Tess. Tess is initially happy to be involved with Jake and with Simone. Gradually her closeness to the two turns to bitterness after she discovers that they have matching tattoos neither one will talk about and that Simone raised Jake from the time he was eight. She also loses respect for Simone after realizing that at 37 she is chained to the restaurant. Hers is a specialty whose skills will transfer nowhere, and her beauty is quickly fading. When the restaurant is closed by the health inspectors, Tess goes upstairs to the general manager's office and accidentally discovers that Simone and Jake have planned a one month vacation to France for his birthday without telling her. She gets black out drunk and tries to confront Simone and Jake, but they fail to respond to her. The next time she sees them she confronts Simone, mocking her for being irrelevant. She also tries to convince Jake that his relationship with Simone is unhealthy and asks him to quit for her but though he admits he is tempted he ultimately rejects her. Feeling defeated Tess goes to speak to the general manager, Howard, to convince him to give her one of the prestigious server jobs even though she knows that Simone will try to block her promotion. Howard has sex with her in return for the promotion; however, it turns out to be a transfer to one of their sister restaurants which Tess refuses. She tells Simone that she instead will try to work at a wine shop and Simone encourages the move. Reception The exterior of Union Square Cafe Several reviews noted the expectations that preceded the book's publication. The novel was mostly well received, with some critics noting that the central characters (particularly Jake) were not fully fleshed out and the novel lacks overall substance. However, others, such as Gabrielle Hamilton, writing for the New York Times praised the novel, saying the \\"faults of the book are few\\". Vanity Fair referred to the novel as a \\"love letter\\" to Union Square Cafe. It was No. 32 on USA Today's bestseller's list. The Washington Post's Karen Heller described the novel as \\"true to its title: a smart, delicious, coming-of-age tale about a young woman already drunk on the idea of New York before her true education begins.\\" TV series In October 2017, Starz and Plan B Entertainment announced the development of a TV adaptation of the novel, with Ella Purnell as Tess. The series premiered on Starz on May 6, 2018 to mixed reviews. In July 2018, it was announced that the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered in July 2019. It was cancelled in December 2019, after the second season ended. References 2016 American novels Alfred A.

For many years, starting in 1990, she played a pivotal role working at the National Science Foundation (NSF) as Program Director of the Antarctic Glaciology Program in the Division of Polar Programs, including many trips to both North and South Polar regions. Both the Palais Glacier and Palais Bluff in Antarctica were named in her honor and she has received many further recognitions for her distinguished career.  Early life and education  Palais attended Newton North High School in Massachusetts, graduating in 1974. In 1978 she received her Bachelor of Arts (BA) cum laude in Geology/Earth Science from the University of New Hampshire. She attended The Ohio State University between 1978 and 1985, where she earned both a Master of Science (MS) and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Geological and Earth Sciences/Geosciences. Her graduate research focused on the study of volcanic fallout in snow and polar ice cores from both Greenland and in samples from the Byrd ice core and from shallow ice cores near Mt. Erebus on Ross Island in Antarctica.  Career and impact  For over 26 years Palais directed polar glaciology research as Program Director for the Division of Polar Programs Antarctic Glaciology Program at NSF. In an effort to understand the history and dynamics of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, NSF research programs focus on various glaciology aspects including the use of ice cores as global paleoclimate indicators. Palais made more than 27 trips to Antarctica and 3 to Greenland. Palais is a member of numerous professional societies including the American Geophysical Union, the International Glaciological Society, the American Polar Society, the Explorers Club and the Animals and Society Institute.  Awards and honors  Palais Glacier and Palais Bluff are two features in Antarctica named in her honor by by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN), Palais Glacier in 1995, and Palais Bluff in 2000. In 2007, the Explorers Club named her co-recipient of the Lowell Thomas Award for her contributions to breakthroughs in glaciology and climate science. In 2017, the International Glaciological Society awarded Palais the Richardson Medal for 'For insightful and steadfast service to the U.S. and international glaciological and ice core science communities by enabling discoveries that have impacted the course of climate science and enlightened understanding of the important role of glaciology and the polar regions in global climate change'. In 2019 The University of New Hampshire (UNH) awarded Palais an honorary degree at its May 18 Commencement ceremony : \\"...for her contributions to climate change research, studying volcanic fallout in ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica. She served as program director of the Antarctic glaciology program at the NSF‚Äôs Division of Polar Programs making many trips to Antarctica and Greenland to understand the history and dynamics of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. ...\\" On September 27[7], the College of Engineering and Physical Science at UNH further honored Palais by naming her as its 2019 recipient of the Distinguished Alumni Award in recognition of her outstanding contributions to society. In presenting the award Dean Zercher said that ‚ÄúJulie‚Äôs service at NSF positioned her as a leader of the glaciology scientific community, Her impact on the science and on the profession has been impressive....\\" In reply Julie remarked that the part of her career of which she was the most proud was her role in the development of the U.S. ice core community that analyzes ice cores for the evidence of climate change. Early in her career, there were in the US few labs and a lack of groups that could properly collect, analyze and sample ice cores. As program manager of the Glaciology program at NSF, she was responsible for helping build the infrastructure and personnel in the United States, and it is now the U.S. science community at the top when it comes to the ability to plan and execute cutting-edge ice coring programs and contribute to the important dialogue about how climate is changing. Then, in October The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center announced that \\"Dr. Palais would receive the 2019 Goldthwait Polar Medal in recognition of her distinguished record of scholarship and service polar science. She is among the pioneers of ice core science and, particularly, in studies of the geochemical signatures of volcanic deposition and other processes within the ice record.

Early life Dann was born in Canton, Pennsylvania to a musical family and studied music in Boston before returning to his hometown to teach music lessons and lead a church choir and community chorus. In 1886, he became principal of the academy at Havana, New York (now Montour Falls). Career in Ithaca In 1887, Dann was hired to teach penmanship in the public schools in Ithaca, New York with the promise that he could also begin instruction in music. Music education was rarely included in the school curriculum in this era. Dann founded and directed a high school chorus and men's chorus, while also directing the local Presbyterian Church Choir. After the founding of the Ithaca Conservatory of Music in 1892, Dann served on the school's executive committee. He remained the supervisor of music in Ithaca schools until 1905. In 1889, Dann became director of the Cornell University Glee Club, a position he would hold for 32 years. He significantly raised the musicality of the ensemble, beginning a tradition of tours and bringing the choir to England in 1895, one of the first international tours by an American choral ensemble. On this tour, the men were hosted by the Savage Club of London, and a similar organization was founded in Ithaca upon their return. After judging a local band competition in 1894, Dann helped persuade bandleader Patrick Conway to relocate to Ithaca to form the Ithaca Band, teach at the Ithaca Conservatory, and lead the Cornell Cadet Band (now the Cornell Big Red Marching Band). Dann was hired by Cornell University in 1903 as instructor of music to begin a department of music at the university. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1904 and full professor in 1907. In addition to leading choral activities and overseeing music at Sage Chapel, Dann organized annual music festivals between 1904 and 1920, bringing nationally famous soloists and orchestras to Ithaca to perform major works. He also began the Cornell concert series to regularly bring noted musicians to campus. From 1910 to 1921, Dann organized a summer school at Cornell for teachers and supervisors of music, training hundreds of music teachers. Besides teaching music education and technique, the program also included music appreciation and community music, and it was one of the first institutions to offer training in instrumental supervision. State and national music leadership Dann was very active as a leader in music education on the state and national levels. He chaired the music council of New York state from 1910 to 1921, and also was chair of music examinations for the New York State Board of Regents and a member of the New York State Music Syllabus Committee, which standardized music teaching. He held a leadership role in the Music Supervisors National Conference (now the National Association for Music Education) from 1910 until his death in 1929, including serving as president from 1919 to 1920. He conducted the first national high school chorus in 1928. In 1921, Dann left Ithaca to become state music director in Pennsylvania, providing oversight for music education at all ages and levels of education. He developed a statewide curriculum and was a strong proponent of community singing. Other work In 1918, Dann took a leave of absence from Cornell to serve as the Army Song Leader in Louisville, Kentucky. He edited and compiled the first Army Song Book. He is perhaps best known as the author and editor of numerous songbooks and music teacher manuals. He authored the eight-volume Hollis Dann Music Course and five-volume Hollis Dann Song Series. He also edited a popular school hymnal and a songbook of Christmas carols, possibly the first to publish the music and lyrics together for \\"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear.\\" Later career At the age of 63, Dann joined the faculty of New York University in 1925, remaining until retirement in 1936. He founded the Department of Music Education and oversaw the first graduate work there in the subject. He continued to teach workshops and guest conduct festival choirs and state choirs around the country until shortly before his death in 1939.

Although the Australians were heavily outnumbered and almost overwhelmed by the Viet Cong the battle ended in a decisive victory for them, establishing their dominance over the province. This perspective however sharply contrasts with competing interpretations in which the D445 Battalion had garnered strong political support in Phuoc Tay. Furthermore, the local D445 Battalion was redeployed northwards against the newly deployed 11th Armored Cavalry Taskforce a month later and so the true significance of the battle is called into question. However, in the years since it was fought the intentions of the Viet Cong, in particular in mortaring the Australian base at Nui Dat on the night on 16/17 August, have been much debated. This has included the possibility that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company, 6 RAR. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. Later interviews conducted by an Australian veteran of the battle Terry Burstall, with commanders of the 275th Battalion and D445 Battalion including the battle commander and later Deputy Defense Minister Nguyen Thoi Bung indicate that mortaring was intended to draw out the 6 RAR out of their base, in which an ambush was to occur followed by a retreat before artillery and air support can be utilised, typical of the grab-by-the- belt tactic. Background The Battle of Long Tan (18 August 1966) took place in a rubber plantation near Long Tan, in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The action was fought between Australian forces and Viet Cong and North Vietnamese units after 108 men from D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR) clashed with a force of 1,500 to 2,500 from the Viet Cong 275th Regiment, possibly reinforced by at least one North Vietnamese battalion, and D445 Provincial Mobile Battalion. The 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) had arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat. After two months it had moved beyond the initial requirements of establishing itself and securing its immediate approaches, beginning operations to open the province. Meanwhile, in response to the threat posed by 1 ATF the 275th Regiment was ordered to move against Nui Dat. For several weeks Australian signals intelligence (SIGINT) had tracked a radio transmitter moving westwards to a position just north of Long Tan; however, extensive patrolling failed to find the unit. At 02:43 on the night of 16/17 August, Viet Cong mortars, recoilless rifles (RCLs) and artillery heavily bombarded Nui Dat from a position to the east, before being engaged by counter-battery fire. The following morning B Company, 6 RAR departed Nui Dat to locate the firing points and the direction of the Viet Cong withdrawal. A number of weapon pits were subsequently found, as were the positions of the mortars and RCLs. D Company took over the pursuit around midday on 18 August. At 15:40 the lead element, 11 Platoon, clashed with a Viet Cong squad and forced them to withdraw. Shortly after resuming the advance, at 16:08 the platoon came under small-arms and rocket-propelled grenade fire from a flank after drawing ahead of the other platoons and was isolated. Pinned down, they called for artillery support as a monsoon rain began, reducing visibility. Beginning as an encounter battle, heavy fighting ensued as the advancing battalions of the Viet Cong 275th Regiment attempted to encircle and destroy the Australians. After less than 20 minutes more than a third of 11 Platoon had become casualties, while the platoon commander was killed soon after. 10 Platoon moved up on the left in support but was repulsed. With D Company facing a much larger force, 12 Platoon tried to push up on the right at 17:15. Fighting off an attack on their right before pushing forward another they sustained increasing casualties after clashing with several groups moving around their western flank to form a cut-off prior to a frontal assault. Opening a path to 11 Platoon yet unable to advance further, they threw smoke to mark their location. Nearly out of ammunition, at 18:00 two UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF arrived overhead to resupply D Company. Meanwhile, the survivors from 11 Platoon withdrew to 12 Platoon during a lull, suffering further losses. Still heavily engaged, both platoons then moved back to the company position covered by artillery. By 18:10 D Company had reformed but was still in danger of being overrun. A Company, 6 RAR was dispatched in M113 armoured personnel carriers from 3 Troop, 1st APC Squadron to reinforce them. Meanwhile, B Company headquarters and one platoon were still returning to base and were also ordered to assist. Leaving Nui Dat at 17:55, the carriers moved east, crossing a swollen creek before encountering elements of D445 Battalion attempting to outflank D Company and assault it from the rear. The Viet Cong were caught by surprise as the cavalry crashed into their flank and with darkness falling they broke through, while B Company entered the position at 19:00. Arriving at a crucial point, the relief force turned the tide of the battle. The Viet Cong had been massing for another assault which would have likely destroyed D Company, yet the firepower and mobility of the armour broke their will, forcing them to withdraw. Continuing past D Company the relief force assaulted the Viet Cong, before moving back to the company position at 19:10. The artillery had been almost constant throughout and proved critical in ensuring the survival of D Company. A later interview with officers involved in the battle indicate some men of the D445 were killed while capturing two wounded Australians, with all having been killed in the barrage. By 19:15 the firing had ceased and the Australians waited for another attack. However, after no counter-attack occurred they prepared to withdraw west. With the dead and wounded loaded onto the carriers D Company left at 22:45, while B and A Company departed on foot. A landing zone was then established by the cavalry with the evacuation of the casualties finally completed after midnight. Forming a defensive position ready to repulse an expected attack they remained overnight, enduring the cold and heavy rain. The Australians returned in strength the next day, sweeping the area and locating a large number of Viet Cong dead. Although initially believing they had suffered a major defeat, as the scale of the Viet Cong's losses were revealed it became clear they had won a significant victory. Two wounded Viet Cong were killed after they moved to engage the Australians, while three were captured. The bodies of the missing from 11 Platoon were also located. Two men had survived despite their wounds, having spent the night in close proximity to the Viet Cong as they attempted to evacuate their own casualties. Due to the likely presence of a sizeable force nearby the Australians remained cautious as they searched for the Viet Cong. Over the next two days they continued to clear the battlefield, uncovering more dead as they did so. Yet with 1 ATF lacking the resources to pursue the withdrawing force, the operation ended on 21 August. Heavily outnumbered but supported by strong artillery fire, D Company held off a regimental assault before a relief force of cavalry and infantry fought their way through and forced the Viet Cong to withdraw. Eighteen Australians were killed and 24 wounded, while Australian official reports claim the Viet Cong lost at least 245 dead which were found over the days that followed. Actual figures are in dispute, by both veterans of the Australian and North Vietnamese side, with allegations of body-count inflation in order to serve public-relations purposes. A decisive Australian victory, Long Tan proved a major local setback for the Viet Cong, indefinitely forestalling an imminent movement against Nui Dat and establishing the task force's dominance over the province. Although there were other large-scale encounters in later years, 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. Assessment =Initial Australian hypotheses= In the wake of the battle the Australians were left to speculate on the reason it occurred. One hypothesis was that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. Brigadier David Jackson‚ÄîCommander 1 ATF‚Äîbelieved the Viet Cong had been on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of 18/19 August when D Company intercepted them and this was supported by information from a prisoner captured afterwards. They were carrying large quantities of ammunition and may have had sufficient strength to seriously damage the base, even if its defences were likely strong enough to withstand such an attack. Yet, from the earliest Jackson had felt the Viet Cong would have to engage 1 ATF in a major battle if they wished to retain control of Phuoc Tuy, and this interpretation fitted his previous thinking. In dispatching patrols east of Nui Dat following the mortar attack on 16/17 August Jackson seemingly reacted to his opponent's first move, and he may have allowed himself to be shaped into responding as the Viet Cong had intended. In his after action report Lieutenant Colonel Colin Townsend‚ÄîCommanding Officer 6 RAR‚Äîwrote that he believed D Company had disrupted a regimental attack on the 1 ATF base. Yet years later he stated that he doubted the Viet Cong ever intended attacking Nui Dat. He felt they would have gained more from attacking a soft target such as Ba Ria and that the defences at Nui Dat would have been sufficient to withstand a regimental assault, having been improved significantly in the 11 weeks since its occupation and protected by patrols and overwhelming artillery support, even if they were still to be fully developed. However, there were suspicions a battalion from the 274th Regiment was moving towards Nui Dat from the west at the same time the 275th Regiment approached from the east, and if true such an attack may have been feasible, even if it still would not have achieved the nine to one superiority communist doctrine required. The southern side of the base was only lightly defended and an assault from that direction would have allowed the Viet Cong to attack the gunline first, and if they succeeded in breaking-in would have then crossed of open ground before reaching Headquarters 1 ATF. On the other hand, Major Noel Ford‚ÄîOfficer Commanding B Company, 6 RAR‚Äîbelieved the mortar attack served to lure an Australian reaction force into an ambush, arguing the Viet Cong would have been unlikely to telegraph their intentions to attack Nui Dat and that they had left a clear trail for any force dispatched to find the mortar base plate and RCL positions. Townsend disagreed, arguing the mortar crews and RCL teams had actually tried to hamper the follow up by breaking into small groups, indicating that no such trap had been planned. Meanwhile, Major Harry Honnor‚ÄîOfficer Commanding the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery attached to 6 RAR in direct support‚Äîbelieved the bombardment had been used by the Viet Cong to register targets and that D Company had stumbled across the force as it was preparing to launch an assault on Nui Dat two days later, with the battle that ensued preventing this from occurring. A year after, Nguyen Van Nuong (alias Loc), a former Viet Cong soldier who had rallied, claimed to have been second-in-command of a platoon from D445 Battalion at Long Tan. During questioning he stated they had planned to destroy Nui Dat to allow further operations in Phuoc Tuy, with the force consisting of three battalions from the 275th Regiment, D445 Battalion and several medical units; in total some 2,000 men. The Viet Cong had estimated Australian strength at Nui Dat at 3,000 men and planned to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush by two battalions from the 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion, while the remaining battalion would capture Nui Dat. They expected to quickly overwhelm the ambushed force and any relief force, thereby leaving the base relatively undefended. Loc said D445 Battalion's role was to close the rear of the ambush and that they taken only light casualties during the battle. Despite Viet Cong claims he believed only 100 Australians had actually been killed or wounded, and that the official number of Viet Cong casualties was 200 dead, although he had seen more than that on the battlefield and believed many more had died during the fighting. According to Loc the Viet Cong were concerned about 1 ATF's capabilities and would attempt to avoid contact in future. In accounting for the reason Nui Dat ultimately escaped attack it was surmised that D Company may have entered the killing zone before the ambush was prepared and because of this the third battalion may have been unable to be released. Other possibilities included the Viet Cong being forced to abandon that part of the plan by the weight of the artillery, or that they had overestimated the size of the Australian force and retained the third battalion to complete the ambush. The information from Loc was consistent with that known or suspected by 1 ATF, and other than a single battalion overwhelming Nui Dat, was considered plausible. Yet Smith was adamant D Company had not been ambushed, believing the action to have been an encounter battle regardless of what may have been planned. He argued that the troops in the rubber plantation were not sited for an ambush, while the presence of 2,000 to 3,000 men so close to Nui Dat without prepared positions indicated they were still moving when the first contact occurred. Equally, D Company had been left in possession of the dominant terrain and was not drawn into a killing zone as the plantation offered too much concealment, no effort had been made to cut them off from any relief force sent from Nui Dat, no artillery or mortars were fired into the engagement area, while the thick vegetation to the north prevented the Viet Cong manoeuvring into a favourable position. He reasoned that an ambush would have been more effective near the original base plate position as that was the only location they could have been sure the Australians would investigate given they had no way of knowing D Company would move another east after the handover with B Company where they contacted the 275th Regiment. Finally, communist ambushes were doctrinally completed in less than three hours, but Long Tan had continued for over four. As such Smith concluded that since the tactics used by the Viet Cong had been contrary to many of the principles of an area ambush the battle was unlikely to have been one. McNeill argues though that too many facts may be missing to make a conclusive assessment of Viet Cong intentions as to date no definitive Vietnamese account is available, while according to Ham those that exist are contradictory or unreliable. =Later Vietnamese claims= In 1988 two former PAVN officers, Nguyen Thanh Hong and Nguyen Van Kiem (a later commander of D445 Battalion)‚Äîwhile being interviewed by the Australian official historian, Ian McNeill‚Äîclaimed no more than two battalions had been involved, less than half the lowest Australian estimate. Kiem claimed the primary force consisted of D445 Battalion reinforced by one company of North Vietnamese from Headquarters Military Region 7 with a total of 720 men, while Hong said one battalion from the 275th Regiment had also been involved and that with D445 Battalion its total strength was 700 to 800 men. They believed an entire Australian battalion had been engaged along with two squadrons of APCs, and that it had been reinforced by a second battalion the following day, while there had been hundreds of Australian casualties, citing a BBC broadcast which reported 500 killed and 21 tanks destroyed. Against this, Kiem estimated total Viet Cong losses as approximately only 30, mainly from artillery fire. Hong agreed, stating the figure of 245 killed was exaggerated by a factor of 10. Estimated losses from D445 district-commander Colonel Bao stated information he had received at the time was that there was 150 losses including killed and captured for all units involved. Contradictory evidence is also given by the D-Company Commander, who stated he \\"didn't seen more than 50 bodies and I spent three days in the area.\\" Yet this was at odds with alleged Viet Cong records to have been captured by US forces of the diary of the 275th Regiment's commander listing that unit's losses as 500 dead. McNeill provides these figures based on the diaries of a future Deputy Defense Minister Nguyen Thoi Bung and overall battle commander; however, according to Earnest Chamberlain actual documentation of these diaries have not been corroborated. Captured soldiers later stated D445 Battalion's casualties had been 70 killed and 100 wounded. These claims were directly contradicted by Australian intelligence reports in which the D245 Unit suffered just 30 casualties. Claims were also contradicted by the Dong Nai history which stated both the 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion had been involved. Indeed, the majority of the dead buried after the battle were wearing green uniforms, and this coupled with their weapons and equipment, indicated they were either main force Viet Cong or North Vietnamese. One of the three prisoners was from D445 Battalion and the other two were North Vietnamese who claimed to be from the 45th Regiment, perhaps unaware their unit had changed its name to the 275th Regiment when operating in the south. According to them it was the artillery battalion of this regiment which had bombarded Nui Dat. Years later many of Kiem's claims about the role of D445 Battalion were found to be misleading. The Long Tan Cross, commemorating Australian losses Both Kiem and Hong claimed the plan had been to mortar Nui Dat to draw a reaction force into an ambush, not to attack the base. They confirmed the dual military and political aim, emphasising the disruption caused by 1 ATF lodging at Nui Dat and the intention to affect Australian public opinion. The forced evacuation of Long Tan and Long Phuoc had curtailed the Viet Cong who regarded it as a liberated area, and it was chosen as the ambush site to demonstrate to the local population that they were still able to operate despite the Australian presence. Hong explained the ambush was sprung within range of the artillery at Nui Dat because they correctly assumed no reaction force would move outside the cover it provided, and instead planned on rapidly closing with and destroying it before artillery or air support could be brought in. They planned to occupy prepared positions in the rubber plantation and destroy whatever force was sent to locate the mortars following the attack on Nui Dat. A stop force had been placed to the east, while another was to the south to hold the Australians in place, reasoning that the thick undergrowth to the north would force them between the two. D445 Battalion was then to close the rear of the ambush, attacking from the north-west. A larger ambush would then have been staged outside artillery range along the withdrawal route subsequently used by the 275th Regiment. Meanwhile, the 274th Regiment was positioned north of Binh Ba astride Route 2 to ambush US forces should they try to relieve 1 ATF. Hong later asked: \\"How can you claim a victory when you allowed yourselves to walk into a trap that we had set? Admittedly we did not finish the job, but that was only because time beat us and your reinforcements arrived. I mean you did not even attempt to follow us up. How can you claim a significant victory from that sort of behaviour?\\" While the plan outlined by Hong had many of the components of an annihilation ambush, and drawing the enemy out his base area was a standard communist tactic, several weaknesses were evident, including the lack of a means of neutralising the Australian artillery, the absence of indirect fire weapons in the ambush, and the comparatively small size of the ambushing force. Equally the plan to site a second ambush outside artillery range would have been ineffective as the Australians were unlikely to proceed that far unless their guns had followed. Hong believed the ambush failed because the soldiers at the front fired on 11 Platoon before the entire Australian force entered the killing zone, while it should have been opened from the rear against 12 Platoon. Had D Company been attacked from the rear the battle would have been more like an ambush, and they would have been in immediate danger, while it would likely have been irrelevant if the forward Viet Cong troops fired first as the Australians were already well into the plantation. Yet they had been unable to co-ordinate such a manoeuvre and D445 Battalion had more than three hours from the initial contact to close the gap at the rear and failed to do so. Regardless, a few issues cast doubt on this version of events. Firstly, if the Viet Cong had been in the plantation on 17 and 18 August preparing an ambush they would likely have been identified by the patrols from A or B Company, 6 RAR. Secondly, the alleged size of the force is questionable as just 700 men would have been insufficient to be certain of success, while according to communist doctrine it would have required more than a regiment to achieve overwhelming force. In the end the reaction of the Viet Cong indicted they had not detected D Company's presence in the rubber plantation until the first clash with 11 Platoon. In 2005, Nguyen Nam Hung‚Äîdeputy commander 274th Regiment‚Äîclaimed the Viet Cong had indeed intended to destroy 1 ATF and liberate Ba Ria province. He stated that a two-phased offensive had been conceived, planning first to draw them into the open and destroy them in an ambush, and then attack the weakened base at Nui Dat. Ultimately though their goal had been political and the capture of Nui Dat was not considered important. According to the official D445 Battalion history, the officers of the units involved met in early August to finalise plans for the attack. The account claimed that following the mortar attack on 16/17 August, the force had formed up in a wide semi-circle at 10:15 on 18 August to lie in wait, with the 275th Regiment given the \\"middle battle\\" position and tasked with springing the ambush, while other units from the 275th Regiment and one company from D445 Battalion occupied the \\"front block\\" position near the village of Long Tan, and two companies from D445 Battalion under command of Major Sau Thu had been tasked with occupying the \\"back block\\" position to encircle the Australians by sweeping beneath their \\"tail\\" and destroying them. In support, the 80-strong Vo Thi Sau militia company, most of them women, was located nearby to help drag away the wounded following the battle. Thu later confirmed he had been ordered to lure the Australians out of Nui Dat, kill as many as possible, capture their weapons, and overrun the base. Yet this explanation also contains inconsistencies. In particular, the delay of over a day between the mortar attack and the battle suggests another purpose, and it is possible it may have served to test the Australian reaction and the speed with which counter-battery fire could be directed against them in preparation for a full-scale attack. Conclusion While Vietnamese sources maintain an ambush was planned at Long Tan, whether they also intended attacking Nui Dat remains uncertain. The fact a large Viet Cong force had not been identified in the area before midday on 18 August suggests no such force was there, and consequently it could not have been occupying an ambush position awaiting the arrival of the reaction force from Nui Dat. Despite this, it seems likely the 5th Division had planned an ambush but were ill-prepared due to a lack of co- ordination between the morning of 17 August and the selection and occupation of the intended site. As a result, they appear to have been unready when D Company entered the plantation and were likely somewhere on its eastern edge instead. The Viet Cong were probably still conducting their reconnaissance and establishing the ambush in the vicinity of where the rubber met the jungle when the battle occurred, while the Australians may have upset their plan by moving faster than the ARVN and US troops they had previously fought. What followed then appears to have been an encounter battle as the two advancing forces clashed on open ground in a meeting engagement. An alternative explanation is that D Company approached from an unexpected direction, physically dislocating the ambush. Indeed, Thu stated \\"...we didn't know how many... [the Australians] had in Nui Dat. We tried to draw them out... We thought they would go one way but... [they] went the wrong way and came behind us.\\" In July 2006, David Sabben‚Äîplatoon commander 12 Platoon‚Äîand Bob Buick‚Äîplatoon sergeant 11 Platoon‚Äîvisited the battlefield for a television story on 60 Minutes, where they met Nguyen Minh Ninh, former vice-commander D445 Battalion. Minh told them: \\"You won. But we won also. Tactically and militarily you won‚Äîbut politically, we won. In this battle you acted out of our control‚Äîyou [escaped] from our trap.\\" According to journalist Cameron Stewart it was the first time a senior North Vietnamese officer had admitted being defeated at Long Tan.

He is the author of 2016 poetry collection The Crown Ain't Worth Much (published as Hanif Willis- Abdurraqib), 2017 essay collection They Can't Kill Us Until They Kill Us, the 2019 non-fiction book, Go Ahead in the Rain, on the hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, and the 2019 poetry collection A Fortune for Your Disaster. Early life Abdurraqib was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. He graduated from Beechcroft High School in 2001. He then attended Capital University, where he earned a degree in marketing and played on the soccer team. Career =Poetry= Columbus is the setting for Abdurraqib's first book, a poetry collection called The Crown Ain't Worth Much (Button Poetry, July 2016). Publishers Weekly's review said, \\"When Willis-Abdurraqib meditates on the dangers of being young and black in America, the power of his poetry is undeniable,\\" and the Indiana Review calls the collection \\"expansive and rich...compassionate, elegiac.\\" Fusion called his \\"poetry a crash course in emotional honesty.\\" Writing of the collection's titular poem, The Huffington Post said Abdurraqib's \\"chilling take on black death is heartbreakingly true.\\" Abdurraqib has been a Pushcart Prize nominee and a Callaloo Creative Writing Fellow. PBS's Articulate with Jim Cotter described Abdurraqib as \\"of a generation that is helping to redefine poetry\\" and Blavity called him one of \\"13 Young Black Poets You Should Know\\". He is a poetry editor at Muzzle Magazine and a founder, with Eve Ewing, of the Echo Hotel poetry collective. He edited an anthology of poems about pop music called Again I Wait For This To Pull Apart (FreezeRay Press, 2015). In April 2017 his chapbook Vintage Sadness had a limited edition release by Big Lucks, selling out its print run of 500 copies in just under six hours. In August 2017, he was named the managing editor of Button Poetry. On September 3, 2019, Tin House released Abdurraqib's second poetry collection, A Fortune for Your Disaster. Abdurraqib will be a visiting poet teaching in the MFA program at Butler University in the fall of 2018. =Prose= Abdurraqib's writing has appeared in The Fader, The New York Times, and Pitchfork, as well as previously serving as a columnist at MTV News, writing about music, culture, and identity. The Huffington Post named his essay on Fetty Wap's song \\"Trap Queen\\" to its list of \\"The Most Important Writing From People of Color in 2015.\\" Discussing Abdurraqib's essay on the late Muhammed Ali as inspiration to a generation of hip-hop artists, critic Ned Raggett called the piece a \\"standout\\" among the many elegies. Abdurraqib's essay collection They Can't Kill Us Until They Kill Us was published in November 2017 by Two Dollar Radio. The Chicago Tribune named it to a list of \\"25 must-read books\\" for the fall of 2017 and Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review, calling the collection \\"mesmerizing and deeply perceptive\\". The book also received favorable reviews from the Chicago Tribune and The Washington Post (where Pete Tosiello described They Can't Kill Us as \\"a breathtaking collection of largely music-focused essays\\"), and The New York Times Magazine featured a passage from the collection in the magazine's \\"New Sentences\\" column. Abdurraqib published Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a A Tribe Called Quest in 2019 as part of University of Texas Press's American Music Series, edited by Jessica Hopper, David Menconi, and Oliver Wang. It debuted at number 13 on The New York Times bestseller list for paperback non-fiction and received strongly favorable reviews from critics. Reviewers stressed the accomplishment of integrating music history with both a broader history and a more personal one: at Publishers Weekly, Ed Nawotka called it \\"part academic monograph on the group and its music, part pocket history of hip-hop, part memoir, and part epistolary elegy. It is a book that conveys the wonder of being a fan and the visceral impact of experiencing the feeling of having oneself reflected back in music and pop culture.\\" At NPR, Lily Meyer praised Abdurraqib's \\"seemingly limitless capacity to share what moves him, which means that to read Go Ahead in the Rain, you don't need to be a Tribe Called Quest fan: Abdurraqib will make you one.\\" In January 2018, Abdurraqib announced he had signed a two-book deal with Random House; the first book, They Don't Dance No' Mo', will be on the history of black performance in the United States to be published in 2020. The second will be an essay collection following on They Can't Kill Us.  Honors  In 2017, Abdurraqib received an honorary degree in human ecology from the College of the Atlantic. The Crown Ain't Worth Much was a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Book Award and nominated for a 2017 Hurston-Wright Legacy award. They Can't Kill Us Until They Kill Us was named a best book of 2017 by numerous outlets, including NPR, Pitchfork, the Los Angeles Review, the Chicago Tribune, Stereogum, the National Post (Canada), Paste, the CBC, and Esquire. Personal life In 2017, Abdurraqib moved back to Columbus, Ohio; previously he lived in New Haven, Connecticut. Works * (ed.)

Ports to other home computers were published by Datasoft. Canyon Climber is a three- screen platform game with an American Southwest theme. Two of the screens are direct analogs of those in Donkey Kong. The game was ported to the Atari 8-bit family by Tim Ferris, the Apple II by Brian Mountford, and PC-6001. The box art is by Scott Ross. Gameplay Canyon Climber consists of three non- scrolling screens that are endlessly cycled through. In the first, similar to the rivet screen from Donkey Kong, the goal is to place explosive charges on both ends of each of four bridges, using ladders to climb between them, then trigger a detonator. Goats pursue the player and can be jumped over. The second screen resembles Donkey Kong's opening level, with angled platforms and connecting ladders. Native Americans (\\"Indians\\" in the manual) on each platform shoot arrows which can be jumped or avoided. The goal is to reach the top. The objective of the third screen is also to climb to the top. Brick- dropping birds are the primary obstacle. The soundtrack of the first screen is a musical adaptation of the Prelude section from Prelude and Fugue in C minor, BWV 847. Reception The 1983 book The Creative Atari stated, \\"Canyon Climber achieves a cartoon-like atmosphere in the rendering of its various screens, to very pleasing effect,\\" concluding \\"You will spend a while with Canyon Climber.\\" In a review of four Atari 8-bit Datasoft games (the others are Pacific Coast Highway, Clowns and Balloons, and Shooting Gallery), Charles Brannon of COMPUTE! wrote, \\"the overall animation and execution are perhaps the best of the four.\\" Electronic Fun with Computers & Games described Canyon Climber as \\"not quite as demanding as Donkey Kong, but the concept is appealingly bizarre,\\" and called the game \\"short-term addictive.\\" Reviewing the TRS-80 Color Computer version for Creative Computing, Stephen B. Gray warned, \\"Canyon Climber is a game for the expert or the masochist.\\" Long after the game's initial release, Keita Iida noted the low difficulty level, calling the game \\"perfectly suited for beginning players who are just getting into platform/climbing games.\\" Mark Sabbatini, looking at the Color Computer version, agrees: \\"as soon as you've completed the levels a few times the challenge is pretty much gone.\\" He also disliked the randomness of the rocks and goats, stating \\"all too often whether you live or die is all about luck and not about skill and planning.\\" Legacy One section of Llamasoft's 2011 GoatUp game for iOS is an homage to Canyon Climber.

Launch and focus The organization officially launched on August 24, 2016, designated as a 501(c)(4), with a presentation that was live-streamed online via YouTube to meetings across the country and shown by Free Speech TV. Our Revolution's three main goals are to (1) revitalize American democracy by engaging millions of individuals in the political processes, (2) empower the next generation of progressive leaders, and (3) elevate political consciousness by educating the public about issues confronting the United States. More specifically, the organization aims to create, support, promote and elect progressive candidates from school board to US Senate; support and help pass progressive ballot measures; create, train and mobilize activists; and both support and participate in protests against issues such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Dakota Access Pipeline. The progressive issues Our Revolution promotes are almost identical to those of Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign: reducing income and wealth inequality, working for single-payer healthcare, reducing the price of prescription drugs, instituting a $15 minimum wage, expanding Social Security, creating jobs, and making public colleges and universities tuition-free.\\"What's Next for the Revolution?.\\" In These Times. (September 2016 ): 554 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web. Date Accessed: 2016/10/21. The organization will support minority rights, specifically African American, Latino and Native American rights, including government respect of treaties with Native Americans. Organizations that support Our Revolution include People for Bernie, National Nurses United, and the Communications Workers of America, among others.\\"WHOSE REVOLUTION?.\\" In These Times. (October 2016 ): 1427 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web. Date Accessed: 2016/10/21. =Staffing= Bernie Sanders speaking at a campaign rally at Southern New Hampshire University in January 2016. The organization's staff include chairman Larry Cohen and president Nina Turner, both of whom are also national co-chairs of Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. Erika Andiola, the Sanders campaign's Latino press secretary, has joined the organization's communications staff. Our Revolution's 501(c)(4) designation prevents Sanders from playing a role in the organization because he is an elected official. On August 29, 2016, the board of Our Revolution was announced as: * Larry Cohen (Chairman) ‚Äì Labor * Nina Turner (President) ‚Äì Former Ohio State Senator * Deborah Parker ‚Äì Native American Leader * Ben Jealous ‚Äì Civil Rights Leader * Jim Hightower ‚Äì Political Leader, National Radio Commentator & Writer * James Zogby ‚Äì Arab American Human Rights Leader * Huck Gutman ‚Äì Former Chief of Staff for Senator Bernie Sanders * Jane Fleming Kleeb ‚Äì Environmental Activist * Lucy Flores ‚Äì Former Nevada Assemblywoman * Catalina Velasquez ‚Äì Immigration, Reproductive Justice and Trans Queer Liberation Activist * Shailene Woodley ‚Äì Actress and Environmental Activist At the start, the organization faced a significant staffing challenge as eight of its initial 15 staffers left before the launch when Weaver was chosen as president. They objected to the way he had handled Sanders's presidential campaign and to his decision to make Our Revolution a 501(c)(4).Pritt, Pamela. \\"Sanders announces 'Our Revolution' with national event.\\" Register-Herald (Beckley, WV) August 25, 2016: Newspaper Source. Web. October 21, 2016. Some staffers also left in protest of a lack of diversity among the organization's leaders. The remaining staff was subsequently joined by an additional three staffers, bringing the total to ten. = 2016 election = During the 2016 election, the organization supported several ballot measures and candidates, with $1.3 million raised. Of the 106 candidates and 34 ballot initiatives Our Revolution supported, 58 candidates and 23 ballot initiatives won in 2016. Our Revolution, like Sanders, opposed the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump. After Trump's election, Our Revolution issued the following statement: > We will do everything in our power to ensure that the president-elect cannot > ignore the battles Americans are facing every single day. Our job is to > offer a real alternative vision and engage on the local and national level > to continue the work of the political revolution in the face of a divided > nation. Sanders himself announced, \\"I intend to work with President Trump on those issues where he will, in fact, work for the middle class and working families of this country. I will vigorously oppose him if he appeals to racism or sexism or some of the other discriminatory measures that he brought up during his campaign.\\" Chairman Larry Cohen cited populist sentiment and cautioned that political and economic elitists may face backlash in upcoming elections. =Post-2016 political activism= In January 2017, Our Revolution activists worked in local elections in California to advance Sanders's agenda. According to executive director Shannon Jackson, Our Revolution is \\"going to continue to do this around the states\\". A May 2018 article in Politico described Our Revolution as \\"flailing\\" and \\"in disarray\\". According to the article, by May 2018 the organization's monthly fundraising totals were one-third of what they were in May 2017. Moreover, the article noted internal conflicts and tensions within the organization, such as that board members and Sanders 2016 presidential delegates questioned Our Revolution president Nina Turner's actions and motives. Specifically, they questioned whether Turner was using the organization as a springboard for a presidential run of her own and whether she was \\"settl[ing] scores with the Democratic National Committee from 2016\\". Turner attempted to hire Tezlyn Figaro‚Äîwho frequently appeared on Fox News to praise Trump and has made anti-immigration comments‚Äîas the chief of staff, but was overruled by the board's executive committee. Additionally, Lucy Flores resigned from the board in April 2018 due to what she claims was the organization's lack of outreach to the Latino community. Our Revolution also endorsed Dennis Kucinich for governor in Ohio in 2018, which some Ohio Democrats questioned because of Turner's close relationship with Kucinich's running mate, even though he was widely considered the most progressive candidate in that race. A subsequent article in The New Republic concurred with the Politico report and suggested that change may be necessary at Our Revolution for it to succeed at its goals. After Politico reported the discontent with Figaro's position in the organization, Turner announced that Figaro would still be part of the organization and noted that Figaro's anti- immigrant and pro-Trump commentary was not endorsed by Turner or Our Revolution. Figaro said that she \\"offer[s] no excuse\\" for her comments and questioned the motivations of those who spoke to Politico about her. Erika Andiola, an undocumented immigrant who was a former political director at Our Revolution, said that Turner fired her after her activism in favor of the DREAM Act. The Young Turks, a progressive American news and commentary program on YouTube, discussed the Politico article on their May 21 show, calling it an \\"attack piece\\". Cenk Uygur strongly objected to its claims and denied its accuracy, including its assertions that the group \\"has left many Sanders supporters disillusioned\\" and that the group has \\"fueled doubts about Sanders' organizational ability heading into 2020\\". Our Revolution board member James Zogby disputed the Politico report in a series of tweets, calling it a \\"hit piece fueled [by] a few disgruntled souls out to harm [Nina Turner].\\" The Politico article has also been criticized by others on similar grounds, as well as for its anonymous sourcing and lack of quotes. An article published by Common Dreams also broadly disputed the Politico article, as did a Naked Capitalism piece.  Summer for Progress  Several progressive organizations, including Fight for 15, Justice Democrats, Democratic Socialists of America, National Nurses United, Working Families Party, and Brand New Congress, announced in July 2017 a push to encourage House Democrats to sign on to a #PeoplesPlatform, which consists of supporting \\"eight bills currently in the House of Representatives that will address the concerns of everyday Americans.\\" These eight bills and the topics they address are: # Medicare for All: H.R. 676 Medicare For All Act # Free College Tuition: H.R. 1880 College for All Act of 2017 # Worker Rights: H.R.15 - Raise the Wage Act # Women‚Äôs Rights: H.R.771 - Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act of 2017 # Voting Rights: H.R. 2840 - Automatic Voter Registration Act # Environmental Justice: H.R. 2242 - Keep It in the Ground Act of 2017 # Criminal Justice and Immigrant Rights: H.R. 3227 - Justice is Not For Sale Act of 2017 # Taxing Wall Street: H.R. 1144 - Inclusive Prosperity Act Transform the Party Our Revolution's Transform the Party campaign is aimed at getting its supporters to run for leadership positions in local Democratic parties.

It was released on November 15, 2016, a week after the election of Donald Trump. The book was written in the context of Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign and aimed to explain some of its rationale. Contents In the book, Sanders sets out his position on climate change, free college tuition, income inequality, closing the gender wage gap and defeating Donald Trump while campaigning for Hillary Clinton during the last three months leading to the 2016 presidential election. Sanders discusses how his presidential campaign was considered by the political establishment and the media to be a \\"fringe\\" campaign and something not to be taken seriously. He discusses his initial struggle as being an \\"Independent senator from a small state with little name recognition\\". The memoir also covers how his campaign had no money, no political organization, and it was taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment. In Our Revolution, Sanders shares his personal experiences from the campaign trail, recounting the details of his primary fight and the people who made it possible. He outlines a progressive economic, environmental, racial, and social justice agenda that will create jobs, raise wages, protect the environment, and provide health care for all‚Äîand ultimately transform our country and our world for the better. Reception Upon its release, it was on The New York Times Best Seller List at number 3. John R. Coyne Jr. gave the memoir a positive review for The Washington Times saying that \\"For starters, it tells us who this man who energized so many young people really is ‚Äî an enthusiastic young socialist trapped in an old curmudgeon's body, his ideas basically just as fresh to him today as when he left his native Brooklyn\\". David Weigel of The Denver Post said that the memoir was \\"like a sitcom character who gets beaned on the head and hallucinates an angel ‚Äî or a talking dog, or a 75-year-old senator from Vermont ‚Äî spinning lessons about what really matters in life\\". Sanders and Mark Ruffalo were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

Biography He was born in Al-Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia on either 20 July or 5 September 1974. In September 2014, he established contact with IS and sought pledges of allegiance on their behalf. In late 2014, he allegedly facilitated the movement of people and material for IS operations in Saudi Arabia. According to the Treasury, he \\"was in Yemen with a group that pledged allegiance to ISIL and received significant funding from either ISIL or an unidentified donor\\". According to the United States Department of the Treasury, he recruited for the Islamic State in Yemen in mid-2015 having received funding from IS in 2014 to implement their plan in Yemen. He declined to recruit and facilitate efforts in Yemen on behalf of Al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in favor of an alleged promise of 4,000 al- Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb fighters by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. =Leadership disputes in Yemen= In December 2015, he suffered a rebellion against his rule as governor by members of the Islamic State in Yemen, who appealed to the Islamic State leadership in Syria and Iraq to replace him. Seventy members announced their defection in a letter published online, though they reaffirmed their allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The authors accused him and his \\"inner circle\\" of committing \\"excesses and violations against sharia.‚ÄùDespite our efforts to advise and inform the caliph‚Äôs office on matters happening in Yemen, the violations against the sharia remain present and continue to increase,\\" the letter continued. \\"They stopped working in accordance with the prophetic path regarding the resolution of many problems and issues.\\" The letter further listed three violations of sharia supposedly committed by Abu Bilal;the wrongful \\"dismissal of a number of soldiers\\" after they filed a complaint, a failure to provide \\"basic resources\\" during a battle in Hadhramaut Governorate, and the refusal to submit to a sharia ruling against a regional commander. Additional accusations were made of \\"oppressing the downtrodden\\" and \\"expelling the muhajireen\\". They then demanded that Baghdadi dismiss the governor for Yemen, along with \\"his retinue.\\" Abu Ubaydah Abd al- Hakim, a member of the consultative council of the Islamic State responded, rejecting the request to remove the governor and saying, \\"What you have ventured to do is absolutely rejected. You must hear and obey he who has been tasked with your emirate, and you tasked by his emiracy over you\\". =US sanctions= He was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury on 29 September 2015.  Death  In 2017, videos lamenting Abu Bilal al- Harbi's death were circulated by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Yemen Province, implying he had died.

The event took place on August 28, 2016, and was held in the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico. The event Was the 24th year in a row that AAA had held a Tripleman√≠a show, and was the 31st show held under the Tripleman√≠a banner since 1993. The annual Tripleman√≠a show is AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event. A total of seven matches took place, with the main event being a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where Psycho Clown put his wrestling mask on the line and Pagano put his hair on the line, \\"betting\\" it on the outcome of the match. The AAA Latin American Championship was also defended on the show along with the AAA World Tag Team Championship and La Copa Tripleman√≠a. Production =Background= Outdoor view of the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico building. 2016 marked the 24th year since 1993 where the Mexican professional wrestling company Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) or Triple A held their annual Tripleman√≠a show and the 31st Tripleman√≠a show promoted by AAA, as they held multiple Tripleman√≠a shows over the summers of 1994 to 1997. The 2016 event took place at the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico (Mexico City Arena), an indoor arena in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, Mexico that has a maximum capacity of 22,300 spectators. This was the fifth consecutive Tripleman√≠a (XX, XXI, XXII, and XXIII) held at the venue. AAA's Tripleman√≠a is their biggest show of the year, the highlight of their year, AAA's equivalent of the WWE's WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event. AAA later confirmed that the show would be available as an internet pay-per-view (iPPV) with both Spanish and English language commentary, but not available through traditional PPV channels. The Tripleman√≠a was the first of three major shows held within a week of each other, produced by the three biggest lucha libre promotions in Mexico, AAA, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). The second major lucha libre show, the CMLL 83rd Anniversary Show, will take place five days after Tripleman√≠a on September 2 at Arena M√©xico where Psycho Clown's cousin La M√°scara will risk his mask as well in a match against Dragon Lee. Finally the third-largest Mexican lucha libre promotion, IWRG will hold IWRG La Hora de la Verdad in Arena Naucalpan two days later on September 4, headlined by a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match, between Trauma I and Canis Lupus. =Storylines= The Tripleman√≠a XXIV show featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Psycho Clown, risking his clown mask in the main event. After Pentag√≥n Jr. won the 2016 Rey de Reyes tournament, he and the rest of Los Perros del Mal were attached by the team of Nicho El Millonario, Dami√°n 666, Halloween and Pagano, claiming they were the \\"Real Perros del Mal\\", alluding to the fact that Nicho, Dami√°n 666 and Halloween used to be part of the group. After the show Pagano confirmed that he had indeed signed with AAA. The group was initially known as La Nueva Familia Fronteriza, later shortened to simply La Familia Fronteriza (\\"The Border Family\\"). Bestia 666, son of Dami√°n 666, was later added to the group. While the rest of La Familiar Fonteriza continued to work the storyline feud with Los Perros del Mal, Pagano moved off on a tangent, starting a storyline with Psycho Clown, an AAA wrestler who, like Pagano, used a clown ring character. Pagano made his official AAA in ring debut on April 18 as he, Pagano, Dami√°n 666 and Nicho defeated Los Psycho Circus (Psycho Clown, Murder Clown and Monster Clown) by count-out. Subsequently Pagano and Psycho Clown faced off in a Hardcore wrestling match. During the match Pagano lit a wooden table on fire and then threw Psycho Clown through it to win the match. Two weeks later the two clashed again, this time in a match that also included Pentag√≥n Jr., a match that was once again won by Pagano. After defeating Psycho Clown once more on July 8 and stealing Psycho Clown's wrestling mask, Pagano challenged Psycho Clown to put his mask on the line while Pagano would put up his hair in a Luchas de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\". At the time Psycho Clown did not respond to the challenge. On July 16 AAA officially announced the match as the main event of Tripleman√≠a XXIV on August 28. The team of Averno and Chessman, also known as Los Hell Brothers won the vacant AAA World Tag Team Championship by defeating the teams of Aero Star/F√©nix and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr./Villano IV at the Guerra de Titanes show. Los Hell Brothers subsequently made several successful title defenses and began bragging about how there were no challengers left for them to deal with, that \\"no man\\" could defeat them. In the spring of 2016 sisters-turned-rivals Mari Apache and Faby Apache reunited as Mari returned to the tecnico side and started to team up with her sister on a regular basis. The two teamed up with their former step- mother Lady Apache and won the women's version of the 2016 Lucha Libre World Cup. Around the time of the World Cup Mari and Faby Apache challenged Los Hell Brothers, demanding that they put the tag team championship on the line, a challenge that Averno and Chessman turned down, acting very dismissing and sexist in the process. During the July 8 AAA Television taping Averno and Chessman dressed up as a pair of frumpy women as they mocked Los Apaches. At the subsequent taping Los Apaches distracted Averno and Chessman during a title defense against Jack Evans and Ang√©lico, which lead to Averno and Chessman losing the tag team titles. Afterwards it was announced that Averno and Chessman had finally agree to face Los Apaches at Tripleman√≠a XXIV. El Patr√≥n Alberto defeated El Texano Jr. to win the AAA Mega Championship at the 2014 Guerra de Titanes show. Over the next year El Patr√≥n defended the championship on several occasions, until he signed a contract with WWE in late 2015, which led to AAA announcing that since the WWE would not allow El Patr√≥n to defend the championship it was vacated and they would hold a tournament to determine a new champion. At the 2016 Guerra de Titanes show El Mes√≠as and El Texano Jr. defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Psycho Clown, earning the right to wrestle for the vacant AAA Mega Championship at a later date. At the subsequent Rey de Reyes show El Texano Jr. pinned El Mesias to become a two time AAA Mega Champion. In the weeks following Rey de Reyes El Texano Jr. was repeatedly attacked by El Mesisas and later on Brian Cage as well, slowly turning El Texano Jr. t√©cnicos in the process. El Mesias, Brian Cage and Johnny Mundo all adopted an \\"Anti-Mexico\\" attitude, even naming themselves \\"Team Trump\\" after the US presidential candidate. On June 16, 2016 Dr. Wagner Jr. defeated El Mesias by disqualification to become the number one contender for the AAA Mega Championship, surprisingly inserting him into the championship feud. During an AAA press conference on July 28 and confirmed that El Texano Jr. would defend the AAA Mega Championship against both Dr. Wagner Jr. and Brian Cage, but El Mesias was not included. On July 3, 2016 Pentag√≥n Jr. defeated Psycho Clown to win the AAA Latin American Championship. The following week the team of Johnny Mundo, El Mesias and Hernandez defeated the trio of Pentag√≥n Jr., El Texano Jr. and El Hijo del Fantasma when Mundo pinned Pentag√≥n Jr. Following the match Mundo challenged Pentag√≥n Jr. to defend the Latin American championship against Mundo since he just pinned the champion. On July 23 AAA announced that Pentag√≥n Jr. would defend the AAA Latin American Championship against Johnny Mundo, acknowledging that the two had faced off before as part of Lucha Underground. The second match of the night was announced as the second ever Copa Tripleman√≠a with 12 wrestlers competing for the trophy. AAA confirmed 11 of the 12 names, La Parka, El Elegido, El Zorro, Daga, Taurus, El Hijo del Pirata Morgan, Pimpinela Escarlata, Mamba, Super Fly, Hernandez and Australian Suicide, but listed the 13th wrestler simply as a Luchador Sorpresa (\\"Surprise Wrestler\\"). AAA Hall of Fame First established in 2007 the AAA Hall of Fame has inducted one or two lucha libre-related people each year at Tripleman√≠a. The initial class of the Hall of Fame included AAA founder Antonio Pe√±a and Rey Misterio Jr.. Later inductees have included Eddie Guerrero (2008), Pepe \\"Tropi\\" Casas (2009), Octag√≥n (2011), Perro Aguayo (2012), Abismo Negro (2013), El Brazo (2014), Rayo de Jalisco Sr. (2014), H√©ctor Garza (2015), and El Hijo del Perro Aguayo (2015). On August 18 the R√©cord sports newspaper revealed that \\"Love Machine\\" Art Barr was the first name confirmed for the 2016 AAA Hall of Fame, joining his former Los Gringos Locos partner Eddie Guerrero in the hall of fame. Barr is the first inductee who is not of Mexican heritage, being born in Portland, Oregon to US parents. Barr, son of local promoter Sandy Barr, had a storied career before ending up working in Mexico. Initially he worked as a local face character called Beetlejuice and was even offered a contract with World Championship Wrestling, but due to a statutory rape conviction he later found himself unable to get full-time work in the US. Moving to Mexico he first worked as the masked character \\"American Love Machine\\" for CMLL, but was unmasked by Blue Panther. He later jumped to AAA and formed a team with Eddie Guerrero known as \\"La Pareja del Terror\\" (The Pair of Terror) with Eddie Guerrero who won the AAA World Tag Team Championship. The duo, along with Konnan, would go on to form Los Gringos Locos, the most hated rudo team in Mexico at the time. Barr and Guerrero main evented AAA's AAA When Worlds Collide, their first US broadcast PPV, losing an Apuesta match to El Hijo del Santo and Octag√≥n. Barr died only 17 days after When Worlds Collide, with the official cause never being clearly stated. The R√©cord article also confirmed that AAA was planning in inducing a second person in the hall of fame but did not name that person. During the show AAA also inducted Joaqu√≠n Rold√°n, who took control of AAA after Antonio Pe√±a's death, into the Hall of Fame.

Reception How To Grow A Band received a majority of positive reviews from critics. Joe Leydon of Variety called the film \\"most fascinating as it tactfully charts the sort of artistic and philosophical differences that can eventually undermine any group endeavor, even among seemingly like-minded collaborators.\\" Nicolas Rapold of the New York Times notes \\"Meatto‚Äôs framing tends to catch the musicians‚Äô give- and-take, merging and dueling notes onstage, especially at a Manhattan concert that is the film‚Äôs highlight.\\" Joan Radell of Paste Magazine called the film \\"masterful filmmaking\\" and named the film one of the 10 Best Music Documentaries of 2012 New York Magazine named the film a \\"Critic's Pick\\" noting that \\"the music is both challenging and heavenly\\".

Some other reviews of the film were less favorable. Slant Magazine writer Joseph Jon Lanthier noted that \\"One can‚Äôt speak of Mark Meatto‚Äôs documentary profile, How to Grow a Band, without starting squarely with Thile, because the movie is unsurprisingly devoted to peddling the up-and-comer as something daring, something new.\\".

In his first race at 1200m, he collected $914,500 in the race for two-year-olds. Price said, \\"But all credit to Extreme Choice. Today was the day where he had an opportunity to really stand up. I think today we got a lot of information about the horse and we're off to the [Golden] Slipper.\\" As a result of the win, the horse immediately entered favouritism for the race. In the days before the Golden Slipper Stakes, it was announced that Extreme Choice would be racing in China Horse Club colours after they purchased a controlling interest in the horse in conjunction with Aquis Farm and Newgate Farm. The deal was to see the purchase price raise to 20 million dollars, should Extreme Choice have won the race. Finishing eighth, jockey Craig Newitt said, \\"I don't think he went 100 metres without getting interfered with the whole race. For him to get as close as he did his run was outstanding.\\" After a spell, Extreme Choice returned in the Group 1 A J Moir Stakes in September 2016. In his first appearance at Moonee Valley, Extreme Choice was said to have \\"left two of Australia‚Äôs greatest sprinters, Chautauqua and Buffering, in his wake with a devastating finishing burst to win\\". Three weeks later he failed to place in the Coolmore Stud Stakes and was spelled. In February 2017, one owner listed his five percent share of Extreme Choice on bloodstock trading platform G1Xchange.com. With a successful trial under his belt, Extreme Choice was the favourite for Oakleigh Plate in February 2017. Finishing third, a length behind winner Sheidel, Price said, \\"He ran home well but the two winners were in the right spot ‚Äì on the speed. He certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint.\\" With new jockey Joao Moreira onboard, Extreme Choice then failed to place in the Newmarket Handicap. In March 2017, Extreme Choice was retired to stud, with a stud fee of $22,000 in 2018.

As head of the Maktab al-Buhuth wa al-Dirasat (Office of Investigation and Studies), \\"an independent entity concerned with researching Shari'i issues, and issuing fatwas\\" he had considerable religious influence within the group. History =Early life= Turki al-Binali was born on 3 September 1984 in Al-Bousaiteen district, Al Muharraq, Bahrain to a wealthy, notable family that has close political relations to the ruling royal family of Bahrain, the Al-Khalifa. He attended classes that taught remembering the Qur'an in his hometown and he learned the recitation of Qur'an from one of the Sheikhs of Sultan Bin Salama Mosque. He also attended the classes of Sheikh Abu Zaid and another sheikh from Al-Janoubi Mosque in Al-Bousaiteen. He studied both the elementary and middle stages at Al-Iman school, a private religious school and then he studied in the literary section at Al-Hidaya Al- Khalifia Boys high school. As his name indicates, he is from the Al Bin Ali sub-tribal confederation. The Al Bin Ali family are related (by marriage) to the royal family in Bahrain. =Islamic studies= At some point he moved to Dubai for higher education in Islamic studies at the College of Islamic and Arabic Studies (Dubai), however he was deported back to Bahrain. Thereafter he studied at Imam Al-Ouza‚Äôi School in Beirut and at the Institute for Religious Studies in Bahrain. He studied under the Saudi scholar Abdullah Ibn Jibreen, a member of the powerful Council of Senior Scholars and Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas in Saudi Arabia, as well as the Syrian Zuhayr al-Shawish, the Palestinian-Jordanian Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi and Moroccan Omar al-Haddouchi. Other teachers include Sheikh Safaa Al-Dawi Al- Adawi and Sheikh Amer Sabri Al-Tamimi. Al-Maqdisi provided Bin‚Äòali with a general ijazah authorizing him to teach all of his works. As he wrote in 2009 in the introduction to one of Bin‚Äòali‚Äôs books, \\"I provided him with an ijaza to teach all of my books when I saw in him extraordinary passion and support for the religion, for God‚Äôs unity (tawhid), for jihad, and for the mujahidin. Such passion as this ought not to be met but with backing and support and encouragement. If a shaykh has the right to take pride in any of his students, I am proud of this beloved brother.\\" He was detained numerous times in multiple countries and banned from entry to the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Egypt, Qatar and others. =Yemen= At some point, he traveled to Abyan in Yemen and met with members of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was a member of AQAP and served as a sharia official for them. Video shows him in Yemen in 2012 using the name Hatim al- Muqbil.http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2017/06/11/senior-islamic-state-cleric- turki-al-binali-killed-in-an-airstrike/ =2007 arrest= He was arrested in 2007 with a group of his companions over \\"Takfiri\\" statements made by what was known as \\"Al-Saqifa Cell\\". He was released after a series of debates, arranged by prison officials, with Salafi Sheikhs close to the Saudi religious institution, like Adnan Al-Aroor, who visited him many times during his detention and held debates with him. =Tunisia= Between August 2012 and early 2013 he traveled in Tunisia giving lectures. He is known to have visited Sousse, Menzel Bourguiba and Bizerte. Pictures show he met Seifallah Ben Hassine at this time. =Libya= In June 2013 he traveled to Libya following the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Many videos uploaded to YouTube show his meetings in the city of Sirte, where he delivered a series of lectures. ISIL According to press reports, he arrived in Syria in late February 2014, though he may have been living there even earlier. According to the United States Department of the Treasury, \\"Binali is a recruiter for ISIL foreign fighters, and provides literature and fatwas for ISIL training camps and has written several pamphlets to recruit more fighters to ISIL, including the first call for Muslims to pledge allegiance to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi as caliph\\". As of March 2014, Binali led an ISIL support network actively recruiting Gulf nationals to join ISIL in Syria. Further, in November 2014, Binali was appointed to the post of chief religious advisor for ISIL.https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0351.aspx Binali has gone by various kunya including Abu Human Bakr ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Athari, Abu Bakr al-Athari, Abu Hazm al-Salafi, Abu Hudhayfa al-Bahrayni, Abu Human al-Athari, Abu Khuzayma al-Mudari, Abu Dergham and the one which he is perhaps best known by, Abu Sufyan al-Sulami. =Arrest of brother= His brother, Abdullah Mubarak al-Bin'ali was arrested in April 2015 when he tried to leave Bahrain with someone else's passport, according to the supreme criminal court. Abdullah said that for years, his brother Turki had been able to express himself freely in public speeches and on social media, and that he had also been able to travel unimpeded \\"within sight of the security services\\".\\"But after travelling to the conflict zone in Syria followed by a number of young people, charges against him have been transferred to his brother, and I deny these charges,\\" he added. Turki al-Benali is himself being tried in absentia in this case. His brother was freed 31 Oct 2015. =Loss of citizenship= In April 2014, Bin'ali wrote that the Bahraini government was threatening to withdraw the citizenship of all Bahraini citizens fighting in Syria unless they return home within two weeks. His response was to compose a poem disparaging the very notion of citizenship, and vowing to stay on in the Islamic State. \\"Is it reasonable\\"\\" he asked, \\"that we would return, having arrived in the Sham of epic battles and warfare?‚Ä¶ A land wherein the rule is Islam is my home; there is my dwelling and there do I belong.\\" On January 31, 2015, the Bahraini government revoked Binali‚Äôs citizenship. =US and UN sanctions= He was subject to sanctions by both the United States Department of the Treasury and the United Nations Security Council. Death On 20 June 2017, the US-led coalition released a statement, stating that Turki al-Binali had been killed in an airstrike on 31 May in Mayadin, Syria Family His cousin Mohammed Isa al-Binali, a lieutenant who defected from the Bahrain Defence Force, appeared in an Islamic State video. Mohamed Isa al-Binali has been described as a former Interior Ministry officer. He worked in Jaw Prison, a facility notorious for overcrowding and harsh conditions.

Her work at the association features workshops for women regarding gender violence, prevention of violations among indigenous girls, prevention of women's alcoholism. She is also involved in projects for planting vegetables and she supports women's economic development. She says, \\"What I do is fine because I do it for all women who suffer violence.\\" In 2003, she was falsely accused by two women (mother and daughter) of adultery. The punishment in her rural Indian village included being held down and having chili paste applied to her genitals, causing injury. The activist, advised by the human rights commission of the state of Hidalgo, filed a criminal complaint against the aggressor, becoming the first Indian woman to do so.

The distillery is famous for both its innovative production processes, and immersive distillery experience. It was described in 2019 by Smithsonian Magazine as \\"a high-end Willy Wonka experience for adults.\\" In 2015 Lost Spirits and Davis were presented the Global Master Award for innovation from the Spirits Business for its technical achievements aging spirits in its laboratory. In 2018 The Spirits Business Magazine, American Distilling Institute, and Drinks Business Magazine all judged Lost Spirits to be the world's best distillery experience. In 2018 Jim Murray's Whisky Bible awarded one of Lost Spirits \\"Abomination\\" laboratory aged whiskies with a prestigious Liquid Gold award. In 2019 Lost Spirits won the \\"Best World Whisky\\" award from the Wizards of Whisky for another of its \\"Abomination\\" whiskies. As of 2020, Lost Spirits has an F rating with the BBB. Dozens of reviews on yelp state that alcohol was purchased after the tour in late 2019 but those purchases were never honored, shipped, or refunded.  History  = Early years = Lost Spirits Distillery was founded in 2010 by distiller Bryan Davis and Joanne Haruta. The first location was in rural Monterey County California, built on land owned by Haruta's family. At that time, the two founders had little money and built almost the entire distillery by hand. The facility became well known for its distinctive artistic design, which included Japanese styled tea gardens and stills fitted with sculpted dragon heads. Lost Spirits initially produced highly idiosyncratic malt whiskies, fermented from malt smoked with burning peat. Unlike Scotch whisky, the peat was sourced from unusual locations. Burning plant matter preserved in the peat harvested from sources not typically used, such as Canadian forests or the Florida Everglades gave the whiskies peculiar aromas and flavors. The unusual profiles of the early whiskies earned the distillery highly polarized and mixed reviews. They were described by French whisky critic Serge Valentin as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty useless to try to score this... All codes, barriers and tasting semantics have already been broken anyway.‚Äù = Cult Whisky Distillery = The early whisky period culminated with the release of Umami, Ouroboros, and Seascape II which represented a major turning point for the distillery. Umami was, at the time, the world's only whisky fermented in ocean water. Ouroborors was the only whisky ever made from California Island peat. The two releases won the distillery significant critical acclaim including its first Liquid Gold award in Jim Murrays Whisky bible. The distillery quickly sold out all of its annual production and auction prices for Umami climbed to over $1,600 per bottle at auction. At the time Davis was described by GQ magazine as ‚Äúone of America‚Äôs most raved about young distillers‚Äù and Whisky Magazine nominated Lost Spirits for Craft Distillery of the Year. = Rum = In 2013, Davis ceased making whisky and began making rum. The new rum line was a critical success and became closely associated with the Tiki Revival Movement. The line was prominently featured in lectures and classes at Tiki Oasis in San Diego, the Hukilau in Fort Lauderdale, and Tiki Caliente in Palm Springs. The rum line earned Lost Spirits several best in class designations. = Technology & Controversy = In 2015 the company attracted global media attention when it announced that its co-founder, Bryan Davis, had invented a new means of aging spirits. Davis' process was shown, using modern analytical chemistry, to replicate the chemical reactions which take place as spirits age in barrels. It produces in days what is said to taste like decades aged spirits. This is done by a special processes that aims to replicate the ageing process in a laboratory while producing the same chemical signature and taste. In late 2014 Lost Spirits filed patents for a spirits aging technology. The technology was shown capable of reproducing the chemical signature of rum aged for 20 years in barrels, in less than a weeks time. The high-tech process utilized heat and specific bands of light to break down oak barrel wood. The process was granted a US patent in 2015. According to the Huffington Post, Davis had been using preliminary versions of the technology to produce all of his past rums and some of the early whiskies, which may partially explain some of the distilleries critical successes. Davis‚Äô final rum produced at Lost Spirits Monterey county location was made entirely using the new technology. It was bottled under the brand name Lost Spirits Colonial Inspired Rum and sold exclusively through Bounty Hunter Rare Wines in Napa, California. The rum was initially released at $100 per bottle without disclosing the use of the technology. The critical reception was extremely favorable. Christopher Null broke the story of the technology in Wired Magazine creating significant controversy and a great deal of media attention. In early 2015, just before the original distillery closed, the Spirits Business Magazine awarded Lost Spirits its first Global Master Award in the category of distillery innovation for its aging work. = 2015 - 2017 Closure = In mid 2015, Davis and Haruta closed the original distillery and moved to Silicon Valley to focus exclusively on licensing technology to other distilleries. = Lost Spirits - Los Angeles = In late 2016 Davis and Haruta began working with Los Angeles investor Dr. Wynn Sanders, Theron Regnier, and James Haruta. The group built a new highly thematic distillery in The Los Angeles Arts District. The distillery borrows elements from immersive theater, theme park design, and a distillery. The highly theatrical distillery features tasting rooms themed to each spirit and connected by waterways made of the distilleries cooling water. The Los Angeles distillery was both financially and critically successful. Forbes Magazine reviewed the distillery under the headline \\"Forget The Hollywood Studios: Lost Spirits Distillery Is The Best Tour In L.A.‚Äù. In late 2018 the distillery began working with renown architect John Berry to reimagine aspects of the tour.

This manual, a public document, published by Government of Tamil Nadu and available for sale in Government book depots and some private book stalls, gives complete details of how to transact business in Government offices with very clearly delineated accountability and responsibility norms with citations of Government Orders. Details are available about the instruction given to Government officials as how to receive a petition, how to write a petition to government offices and what government officers should do on receiving them etc. It also gives details of various registers to be maintained, who should maintain them and for what purpose. It also codifies the behaviour mode between superior and subordinate officers in the conduct of official business. It has two parts. The first part deals with attendance, general discipline, organisation of Office, the office system, how letters received to be accounted for in the Office, etc. The second part deals specifically with Collectors Office, Revenue divisional office etc.  Introduction  The introductory paragraph says that every member of the establishment will be supplied with a copy of this book and he must make himself thoroughly conversant with the rules contained in it. The plea of ignorance will never be accepted as an excuse for disobeying them. The contents of the manual is backed by various Government orders issued from time to time appropriately referenced. The manual says that it is the duty of Head of office to see that every member in his office knows and understands the rules, keeps his copy of them corrected, updated and hand it over to his successor on leaving office  Hours of attendance  All members of establishment are expected to attend office from 10:00 AM to 5:45 PM. (Corrected to include latest orders) on all weekdays except recognized holidays. Heads of officers must set an example for the others by themselves attending punctually. Lunch interval of half an hour is given between 1 and 3 PM. but they should leave only in turns after making suitable arrangements and they should not leave all at a time.  Attendance register  An attendance register in the prescribed form will be maintained and kept in the custody of the manager. There will be a late attendance register. The staff are, on no account to take papers out of office in order to work at home. As a general rule work on Sundays and other holidays is prohibited. For handling urgent work on holidays proper arrangements will be made.  Casual leave  Casual Leave will be granted under such rules and conditions as laid down from time to time. It will not be granted on vague and general grounds such as ‚Äòurgent private affairs‚Äô or ‚Äòfor a certain ceremony‚Äô. The purpose for which leave is required must be stated definitely. Application for leave must be made and orders on them obtained before the leave is taken. The casual leave register should be maintained in the prescribed form. Pages should be allotted to each official. Compensatory holidays and optional religious holidays should also be mentioned in the casual leave register in a separate portion under separate headings.  General Discipline  While in office all members of establishment must behave in a quiet and dignified manner. They must address other members of establishment courteously. They must attend to their work and not waste the time. They must try to maintain perfect silence and if they have occasion to talk, they will do in low voice so as not to disturb others. They are particularly warned against heinous offence of divulging to outsider any information that may have come to their knowledge in their official capacity. They must, of course, not accept any presents or remuneration from any visitor or party nor lay themselves under obligation to such persons in any other way.  Tidiness and cleanliness of Office. A waste paper box must be kept within a convenient distance of every member of the staff. Waste paper must be thrown into this and not on the floor. Stationery and records must be put away tidily in the shelves, are not left lying on the tables and on the top of the shelves exposed to dust. All rubbish and obsolete forms of publications must be cleared away, not left to liter office  Organisation of Office  The manual suggest the first step to be taken in order to introduce the \\"Tottanham's System\\" into any Office is to divide the Office into convenient sections and draw a clear distribution list showing the subjects dealt with by each staff member. To each section, a section letter will be assigned and to each group, subjects dealt with the staff member, a number will be allotted. Fair copying and dispatching section must also be organised under a competent Supervisor. The system followed in government office is called \\"Tottanham's System\\". There will be an office Manager who is otherwise called as \\"The Sarishtadar\\" will exercise supervision and control over all sections and the heads of sections. He must periodically inspect the Personal Registers and see that they are punctually, neatly and properly maintained. The Office Manager must check any tendency to delay and bring it to the notice of superior officer. He must also find out whether there is any indication that any member of the establishment is obviously unsuited for his work. If any serious delay or other irregularity comes to light, it is not a sufficient excuse for the supervisor to say that he repeatedly warned the offender or urged to deal promptly with the file that has been delayed. The supervisor's duty in such cases is to report immediately to superior officer as soon as he found that his own admonitions are not proving effective. Should he fail to do so, he cannot be held to have discharged his responsibility. The office system followed in government offices is called \\"Tottanham's System\\" It deals with all arrangements with regard to \\"routine work\\" i.e., to such branches of work as the opening letters, registering, indexing, fair copying and dispatching of correspondence, the receipt of papers into the record room, their arrangement in the record room to store in safe custody, retrieval when required and destruction when no longer required and so on. The manual describes various registers to be maintained in government offices. Some of the important registers are : Distribution Register, Personal Register, New Case Register, Fair copy Register, Special registers etc. All letters received in any government office are serially numbered and they are registered in the distribution register, duly indicating to whom and to which staff members such a letter is assigned for initiating action. Personal Register is to be maintained by every staff member, which will have complete details of all the letters he has received and the dates of action taken by him. Finally how this letter is disposed of is also indicated in the personal register. This is an important register to assess the performance of every staff member. Periodical Register is another register which is helpful in monitoring whether the reports to be sent to various superior officers are promptly sent. This register has the details of the periodical reports, their subjects, the periodicity and to whom they are to be sent. The special register will have details of important references marked as Special by Head of Office and to be dealt with separately. = Opening of Letters = It is desirable that whenever possible the letters received should be opened in the presence of head of office. The letters will then be sorted out and distributed to the concerned sections after duly registering them in the Distribution Register. The staff member who receives these letters should register them at once in their Personal Register. They should take action immediately if the letter received is new. The letter received will be kept in the current file i.e. along with the original letters received. He will put up a note to his superior officer indicating what is the reference received and what action need to be pursued. In case the letter received relates to already existing file, he must record this in his personal register and restore the letter in the appropriate file and pursue action. = Disposals = How long should a government office retain a closed file?. There are different kinds of disposals in government system. Certain files need not be retained at all whereas certain others need to retained. Depending on the importance of the matter, Government has evolved a system retaining them with proper classification. \\"N. Dis\\" indicates nil disposal which means that it need not be retained and the original can be returned. If it is marked as \\" K. Dis\\" it means, it has to be kept for three years and later it can be destroyed. \\"L. Dis.\\" means it can be destroyed after 1 year . Once the letter is approved by competent authority it'll be fair copied in the fair copying section and immediately dispatched. There is a register in which all these entries are made then and there. The arrangements for storing these records also to be made in every Office. There will be a record clerk who is in charge of storing files and retrieving them. The system evolved and practiced in Governmental offices is comprehensive. Its efficiency depends on the person implementing it. It ensures that every single paper received in government office is accounted for properly.

Although it was widely used in the past, the drug has mostly been discontinued and hence is now mostly no longer available. Side effects of NPP include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, which give it a mild side effect profile and make it especially suitable for use in women and children. NPP is a nandrolone ester and a long-lasting prodrug of nandrolone in the body. NPP was first described in 1957 and was introduced for medical use in 1959. It was the first nandrolone ester to be introduced, followed by nandrolone decanoate in 1962, and has been one of the most widely used nandrolone esters. However, in more recent times, the drug has been largely superseded by nandrolone decanoate, which is longer-acting and more convenient to use. In addition to its medical use, NPP is used to improve physique and performance. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. Medical uses NPP has been used mainly in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women and as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of senile or postmenopausal osteoporosis in women. Historically, it has also had a variety of other uses. Because of its reduced androgenic effects, the drug has not generally been used in androgen replacement therapy for androgen deficiency in men and has instead been used for solely for anabolic indications. However, nandrolone esters have more recently been proposed for the treatment of androgen deficiency in men due to favorable properties including their high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects and consequent much lower risk of prostate enlargement, prostate cancer, and scalp hair loss relative to testosterone. =Available forms= NPP is or has been available 25 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL formulations in oil solution for intramuscular injection. Non- medical uses NPP is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters. Nandrolone esters have been said to be the most popular AAS used by bodybuilders and in sports. This is in part due to the high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect of nandrolone and its weak propensity for androgenic and estrogenic side effects. Side effects The most common side effects of NPP consist of virilization (masculinization) in women, including symptoms such as acne, hirsutism (increased body/facial hair growth), hoarseness of the voice, and voice deepening. However, relative to most other AAS, NPP has a greatly reduced propensity for virilization and such side effects are relatively uncommon at recommended dosages. At higher dosages and/or with long-term treatment they make increase in incidence and magnitude however. A variety of uncommon and rare side effects may also occur. Interactions Antiestrogens like aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifene) can interfere with and prevent the estrogenic effects of NPP. 5Œ±-Reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride can prevent the inactivation of nandrolone in so-called \\"androgenic\\" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland and may therefore considerably increase its androgenic side effects. This is opposite to the case of most other AAS, which are either potentiated by 5Œ±-reductase in such tissues or are not metabolized by 5Œ±-reductase. Antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and bicalutamide can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of NPP. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Nandrolone, the active form of NPP. NPP is a nandrolone ester, or a prodrug of nandrolone. As such, it is an androgen and anabolic steroid, or an agonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone. Relative to testosterone, NPP has enhanced anabolic effects and reduced androgenic effects. In addition to its anabolic and androgenic activity, NPP has low estrogenic activity (via its metabolite estradiol) and moderate progestogenic activity. Like other AAS, NPP has antigonadotropic effects, which are due to both its androgenic and progestogenic activity. =Pharmacokinetics= NPP is converted into nandrolone in the body, which is the active form of the drug. It has an extended elimination half-life in the body when administered via intramuscular injection. Its duration of action is approximately one week and it is administered once every few days to once per week. The elimination half-life and duration of action of NPP are much shorter than those of nandrolone decanoate. Chemistry Nandrolone phenylpropionate, or nandrolone 17Œ≤-phenylpropionate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is an androgen ester; specifically, it is the C17Œ≤ phenylpropionate ester of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), which itself is the 19-demethylated analogue of testosterone. History NPP was first described in 1957 and was introduced for medical use in 1959. It was initially used for a wide variety of indications, but starting in the 1970s its use became more restricted and its main uses became the treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis in women. Today, NPP is scarcely available. The drug was the first form of nandrolone to be introduced, and was followed by nandrolone decanoate in 1962, which has been more widely used in comparison. Society and culture =Generic names= Nandrolone phenylpropionate is the generic name of the drug and its while nandrolone phenpropionate is its . It has also been referred to as nandrolone phenylpropanoate or as nandrolone hydrocinnamate. =Brand names= NPP is or has been marketed under a variety of brand names including Durabolin, Fenobolin, Activin, Deca-Durabolin, Evabolin, Grothic, Hybolin Improved, Metabol, Nerobolil, Neurabol, Norabol, Noralone, Sintabolin, Strabolene, Superanabolon, and Turinabol. =Availability= NPP is or has been marketed in many countries throughout the world, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. United States NPP was marketed previously in the United States but is no longer available in this country. Nandrolone decanoate, conversely, is one of the few AAS that remains available for medical use in this country. =Legal status= NPP, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act.

He was the author of many books about agriculture. Early life Mathieu de Dombasle was born on 26 February 1777 in Nancy, France. He served in the French Army. Career De Dombasle grew beetroots in Monplaisir near Nancy to produce sugar as early as 1809. He was one of the first farmers to grow beetroots for this purpose in France. Five years later, in 1814, he went bankrupt, as the new tariffs made sugarcane more profitable. He subsequently wrote several essays about sugar. De Dombasle invented the \\"Dombasle plough,\\" based on the works of Albrecht Thaer. He organized agrarian fairs, where he demonstrated the plough. De Dombasle was the co-founder of the Soci√©t√© centrale d‚Äôagriculture with Antoine Bertier, and he served as its founding president from 1820 to 1825. Meanwhile, the two men established a model farm in Roville-devant-Bayon in 1821-1822. De Dombasle became an Officer of the Legion of Honour. Death and legacy De Dombasle died on 27 December 1843 in Nancy, France. His grandson, Charles de Meixmoron de Dombasle, who became a painter, edited three of his books and published them posthumously in 1861-1862.

His father, being a Jewish Believer, was a missionary to the Jews throughout Europe. He and his brother, Christian (a missionary in China), changed their last names from Zeckhausen to Ellison in 1925 to better assimilate into British society. Following in his father's footsteps, Ellison was an Anglican missionary to the Jews in Europe in the late 1920s and '30s. However, after receiving Believer's Baptism, he was kicked out of the Church of England. Upon his return to Britain, he held many positions in the academic realm as a respected Old Testament scholar and became associated with the Open Brethren. He was a friend and colleague of F. F.

The episode was written by Richard Hatem, and was directed by David Solomon. Plot Opening quote: \\"Then she began to weep bitterly, and said, 'What can a poor girl like me do now?\\" A girl, Carly (Maddie Hasson) is kidnapped by her cousins. Nick (David Giuntoli) is trying to help Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) remember him but she cannot and for some reason, she can remember everything else, even Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell). Hank (Russell Hornsby) is struggling to maintain his stability after everything he witnessed, going as far as to threaten his psychiatrist. Carly's father, Jarold (Mark Pellegrino), who is also Hank's friend, asks for help in finding Carly. Nick sees Jarold woge into a Coyotl and discovers that when a female Coyotl reaches 17, a pack will make a ritual named Aseveracion. They deduce that Jarold's brother-in-law, Hayden (John Pyper-Ferguson), may be responsible. They raid his apartment, but only discover dismembered animals. They finally locate the well where Carly is held and rescue her. The in-laws begin a shooting. While trying to hide in a barn, Carly discovers Nick is a Grimm and panics, showing her form in front of Hank. A paranoid Hank holds her at gunpoint and Nick is forced to reveal his Grimm identity. Hayden threatens to kill Jarold and enters inside to retrieve Carly and kill Nick and Hank. They use a ruse to lure the in-laws into a trap and arrest them. Hank is now happy that he's not crazy, or at least that he is not the only one, understanding Nick's life as a Grimm. Juliette is released from the hospital but Nick is heartbroken as she shows no feelings towards him. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 4.67 million people, earning a 1.6/4 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking first on its timeslot and sixth for the night in the 18-49 demographics behind a rerun of Mike & Molly, a rerun of The Big Bang Theory, a rerun of 2 Broke Girls, Hotel Hell, and Hell's Kitchen. This was a 5% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.90 million viewers with a 1.7/5. This means that 1.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. =Critical reviews= \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"It looks like Grimm is going to leave most of those plates spinning for a while. Renard's origins, the resistance movement, Adalind's whereabouts, Juliette's memory, Nick's mother, those goddamn coins ‚Äî all of that is on the bench tonight, except for a few ancillary scenes. Instead, 'Bad Moon Rising' is a transformation into Grimm: Special Victims Unit, a tightly plotted standalone that accomplishes one important plot point. Hank is no longer in the dark, and though there are still a lot of questions, it felt right.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.1 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Ah well, I'm nitpicking. It's exciting to think what Hank might bring to the inside now that he knows the full story. He'll be meeting everyone again for the first time, which will be fun to explore. Grimm Season 2 has started out with great momentum and moved from 'sure, I'll watch it' to 'must see' on my viewing list.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"Through issues of identity, sanity, memory, and family, the residents of Portland have slowly been confronting their personal demons, looking them dead in the eye and daring them to make a move. In 'Bad Moon Rising', an episode where every subplot found a character trying to get back to their idea of 'home', there was indeed some movement in that area.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"With the reveal of the truth, it's increasingly obvious this is a Grimm radically different than Season 1, determined to throw status quo to the wind rather than milking a plot. Moreover, this Wesen-of-the-week story did not feel like useless filler as so many of the Season 1 episodes did. It stood on its own and delivered a solid crime story that could have honestly been an episode of a regular procedural drama with the barest of retouches. No longer does the show feel segmented into monster episodes versus mythology episodes‚Äîjust like Hank and Nick, the show is uniting all the separate pieces.\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Bad Moon Rising (Grimm)"},{"id":"51092820","text":"Bang Mun Nak railway station is a railway station located in Noen Makok Subdistrict, Bang Mun Nak District, Phichit.

William Weir Gilmour Background Weir Gilmour was born in Lanarkshire.The Times House of Commons, 1950 He started out working as a miner.Fascist Scotland By Gavin Bowd He was at one time a mining surveyor, based at Annathill, and in 1920 was elected to the Institution of Mining Engineers.Transactions of the Institution of Mining Engineers, vol.LIX, p.153 Around 1931 he worked as a salesman.The Times House of Commons, 1931 Political career =Independent Labour Party= Weir Gilmour started his political activity in his native Lanarkshire as a member of the Independent Labour Party. He was a delegate to the Glasgow Trades and Labour Council. =New Party= Gilmour's first public candidature came at the 1931 General Election. He had joined the New Party, recently founded by Labour Party rebel Oswald Mosley. He fought the Lanarkshire seat of Coatbridge without success. =Scottish Democratic Fascist Party= In 1933 Gilmour co-founded the Scottish Democratic Fascist Party (SDFP) with Major Hume Sleigh.Kushner, Tony, and Kenneth Lunn. Traditions of Intolerance: Historical Perspectives on Fascism and Race Discourse in Britain. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1989. p. 199Gallagher, Tom. Edinburgh Divided: John Cormack and No Popery in the 1930s. Edinburgh: Polygon, 1987. p. 204 The party sought to prohibit Irish migration to Scotland, expel Catholic religious orders from Scotland, and repeal the Education (Scotland) Act 1918 (which allowed Catholic schools into the state system funded through education rates). No Catholics were permitted to join the SDFP. The SDFP was at odds with Oswald Mosley's larger British Union of Fascists, particularly over the issue of Catholicism. In contrast to the SDFP, the BUF was accepting of Catholics, with Catholics making up a high percentage of the BUF membership, particularly in Northern England. This led to Weir Gilmour denouncing the BUF as \\"run by Roman Catholics, organised by Roman Catholics, in the interests of Roman Catholics.\\" Gilmour later opined that the SDFP's virulent anti-Catholicism may have unintentionally undermined fascism in Scotland by putting off prospective Catholic recruits. In 1937 he was elected to Peebles Town Council, for which he remained a member for more than 20 years. =Labour Party= In the 1945 General Election he was organizer for the Labour and Co-operative Party candidates in Dumfriesshire. He was a frequent speaker on Labour platforms during the election and acted as Election Agent for the Labour candidate at Dumfriesshire. =Liberal Party= Prior to the 1950 General Election, he gravitated to the Liberal Party. Following boundary changes a new constituency of Midlothian and Peebles was created. He somehow managed to get himself chosen as the Liberal candidate to contest the election. The local liberal associations were still organised on the old boundaries and the Peebles and Southern Midlothian association, which covered much of the new seat, publicly stated that they had never been consulted on the adoption of Gilmour as Liberal candidate. The Chairman of the association and at least one other committee member resigned in protest at his selection. The association secretary said \\"Councillor Gilmour was not adopted by the Association and we are making no recommendation to Liberals as to how they should vote.\\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/scotsman-archive-liberal-split- in-peeblesshire-13-february-1950-1-790486#ixzz4EbrTimtL In a poor election for the Liberals generally, Gilmour finished third, losing his deposit.

The mausoleum is dedicated to Aung San and other leaders of the pre-independence interim government, all of whom were assassinated on 19 July 1947. It is customary for high-ranking government officials to visit the mausoleum on 19 July to pay respects, and 19 July was designated as Martyrs' Day, a public holiday. Background On 19 July 1947, at 10:37 a.m., BST, several of Burma's independence leaders were gunned down while they were holding a cabinet meeting at the Secretariat in downtown Rangoon. The assassinations were planned by a rival political group, and the leader and alleged mastermind of that group Galon U Saw, together with the perpetrators, were tried and convicted by a special tribunal. The assassinated were: # Aung San, Prime Minister # Ba Cho, Minister of Information # Mahn Ba Khaing, Minister of Industry and Labor # Ba Win, Minister of Trade # Thakin Mya, Minister Without Portfolio, unofficially considered as Deputy Prime Minister of Burma # Abdul Razak, Minister of Education and National Planning # Sao San Tun, Minister of Hills Regions # Ohn Maung, Secretary of State Transport # Ko Htwe, Razak's bodyguard Soon after the assassinations, Major General Sir Hubert Rance, the last British Governor of Burma, appointed U Nu to head an interim administration and when Burma became independent on 4 January 1948, Nu became the first Prime Minister of Burma. 19 July was designated a public holiday known as Martyr's Day. List of burials The mausoleum contains the remains of #Aung San #Thakin Mya #Ba Cho #Ba Win #Mahn Ba Khaing #Ohn Maung The body of Sao San Tun was cremated in Mongpawn, his hometown, and the ashes were interred in his hometown and the Martyrs' Mausoleum. U Razak and Ko Htwe were interred in a Muslim cemetery in Tamwe Township. 1983 bombing The mausoleum was destroyed by a bomb on 9 October 1983, an assassination attempt against Chun Doo-hwan, the fifth President of South Korea,. orchestrated by North Korea. The blast ripped through the crowd killing 21 people and wounding 46 others.. Fourteen South Korean ministers, presidential advisers, journalists, and security officials were killed; four Burmese nationals, including three journalists, were also among the dead. President Chun was saved because his car had been delayed in traffic and was only minutes from arriving at the memorial. The mausoleum was rebuilt in 1985 under the military socialist dictatorship of Ne Win. Political significance Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi at the Martyrs‚Äô Mausoleum After the 1988 Uprising, the State Peace and Development Council junta downgraded the ceremony and the mausoleum became off-limits to ordinary people. Public access to the mausoleum was restricted until 2010 because the government was afraid of the public gathering at the mausoleum. Until 2011, the most senior official to attend the ceremony was the Yangon Mayor. In 2011, the government allowed the public to pay their respects at the mausoleum on Martyrs‚Äô Day, drawing large, emotional crowds.

It is 250.559 km from Bangkok railway station and is a class 1 railway station. It is on the Northern Line of the State Railway of Thailand. The station opened on 31 October 1905 as part of the Northern Line extension from Lopburi to Pak Nam Pho. The line continued to Phitsanulok in 1908. Originally, this was the railway station for Nakhon Sawan City as passengers would alight here and cross the Chao Phraya River to reach the city, however its main purpose was removed as the new railway station built at Nong Pling replaced its role. Today, the station acts as a rail yard, a railway maintenance centre, and a junction for an occasionally-used freight line to Kamnansong Rice Mill.

Biography  At first Forgeot devoted himself to literature only as a pastime, and was almost entirely involved in the occupations that gave him a rather important job as an inspector of the postes. His first play, les Rivaux amis was a real trifle. The dialogue was so cut that there were not three tirades with six verse: everything rolled on words that skillful players argued. These kinds of plays, very fashionable some years before the Revolution, were canvasses on which the actors embroidered at will: their silent game, their inflections, gave these pieces all the credit; and when one read the book, one was surprised to find nothing in it. Les Deux Oncles, in one act, in verse (Paris, 1780, in-8¬∞) was successful. Les √âpreuves, which followed les Rivaux Amis, in one act, in verse (1782, in-8¬∞), marked some progress: the characters were more developed, and the style had grace and elegance. The fable, of which the fabric was very slender, offered an ingenuous character, full of candor and naivety. It was one of the brilliant roles of the charming actress C√©sarine Olivier, who died some time after at a very young age. During the Revolution, Forgeot, having lost his job, gave himself entirely to literature but did not justify the hopes that his successful comedies √âpreuves or La Ressemblance, in three acts, in free verse (1796 in-8¬∞) had suggested. Among several plays he gave in different theatres, only the two-act opera mingled with ariettes, Dettes (1787, in-8¬∞), by Stanislas Champein, performed 8 January 1787, where very humorous scenes were to be found, is remembered.

The village of Bambalang is one of the four villages that make up Ndop Central Sub Division and one of the thirteen villages that make up Ngoketunjia Division. Bambalang village saw most of its fertile land flooded upon the completion of the Bamendjin Dam in 1974 giving rise to some Islands like Mbissa, Nkeshie, Mbefekhu, Mishie and Mpayah. The Bamendjin Dam was constructed mainly to serve as a reservoir to feed the hydroelectric plant at Ed√©a. It was constructed across the Noun River, a tributary of the Sanaga River that operates the hydroelectric plant at Edea. The construction of this dam has served as a source of mixed feelings for Bambalang people because while those whose fertile land were flooded look at it as a mishap, it is beneficial to a cross section of the population given that it is contributing enormously to the economy of the village with thousands of fishermen whose lives and that of their families depend on fish (Bambalang fish) gotten from the water. The vegetation is Guinea Savanna as farming has destroyed most forests with the exception of the \\"Pa‚Äôah Ngwong\\" Forest at the heart of the village (about 3.5 km2). Bambalang village is mainly a hillock stretching in a North West, South- East direction. It is narrow at the North-West and broadens towards the South East, appearing as a semi-Island or a promontory. Bambalang has a length of about 21 km and a width of about 8 km giving an area of about 168 km2 supporting a population of 20.863 people. History Myth holds that the Mbaw-Yakum people (known as Bambalang upon the arrival of the Germans) sprung out of a lake in a forest ‚ÄúPa‚Äôah Ngwong‚Äù at the heart of the village. It is believed that the original founders were nine in number referred to as ‚ÄúNgwandipuh‚Äù i.e. the ‚ÄúBig Nine‚Äù. Ethnological studies trace the origin of the Mbaw-Yakum people from Ndobo in the Adamawa Region of Cameroon as well as other Tikari Villages in Ndop Plain. The Tikars migrated from Bornu in Northern Nigeria through Ndobo, Bafia and the Western Region to the North Western Region in the late 17th and early 18th Centuries A.D. The first settlement of the Mbaw-Yakum people must have been at Pa‚Äôah Ngwong where a mysterious lake exist. It is in this small lake at the heart of the forest where myth holds that the founders of the village sprung out covering their heads with leaves of a herb ‚Äúmbimboroh‚Äù (piper umbellatum). At that time tribal wars were rampant leading to frequent migrations. This explains the movement of small groups of people usually under a leader seeking refuge. The present Mbaw-Yakum village originated from a number of small villages led by chiefs who arrived and settled at different periods. Pa‚Äôah Ngwong was the site where Yakum-Ntaw I had settled with his people. These groups were frequently attacked by enemies and at times the others united with enemies to fight against each other. It was to avoid this continuous fighting that a number of small villages were united by Yakum-Ntaw I to form one village under one leader known as Yakum. They decided to call themselves the Mbaw people under the leadership of Yakum hence the name Mbaw-Yakum. Mbaw-Yakum is related to other villages because they hold that Ngwafuongmbie, wife of Mangwa (leader of the ‚ÄúBig Nine‚Äù) had two sons and a daughter. The two sons were Tining and his elder brother Chungpikuh. Chungpikuh was a hunter while Tining remained at home and succeeded their father. Chungpikuh led a group of people who settled at the present land of Bamunka and became the Fon of Bamunka. However, other Mangeh villages belief that Mangeh had five children, two sons (Tuningmungwa and Chengfong) and three daughters (Byiae, Vhenji and Mekheng). The eldest Tunigmungwa succeeded their father and formed Bambalang while his brother Chengfonf established the Bamunka village whereas Byiae formed Bamali, Vhenji formed Bafanji and Mekheng the Bamunkumbit village. Bambalang and Bamunka were descendants of the males (sons of Mangeh) while Bafanji, Bamunkumbit and Bamali are the descendants of the daughters. These five villages, have formed the Mangeh Family Association to maintain peace and unity among themselves to ensure progress of all. These villages have no defined boundary between them because they know that they are one. Location Bambalang is located between latitude 50¬∞47‚Äô and 50¬∞55‚ÄôN and longitude 10¬∞26‚Äô and 10¬∞37‚ÄôE. It is located S.E of Ndop plain and shares divisional boundaries to the East with Bamum (Noun Division) at Bangourian, Nkoumougba and Ngon-Njitapon Villages, to the South with Bamboutos Division at Bamendjing and Bagham villages. These boundaries shared with Noun and Bamboutos are also regional boundaries since the two Divisions are in the West Region. To the West, its neighbors are Bafanji and Balikumbat in Balikumbat Sub Division, to the North its neighbors are Bamali and Bamunka in Ndop Central Sub division and Baba I, Babessi and Bangolan in Babessi Sub Division. Administration Bambalang Village is a second class Fondom in Cameroon with respect to the scale of administrative organization. The functioning, management and development of the village is placed directly under the authority of the Fon whose decision is guided by the ‚ÄúNgumba‚Äù secret society and is final. Bambalang have had thirty three (33) Fons including the present Fon, H.R.M Fon Kelvin Shomitang II who was enthroned in 2009 upon the disappearance of his father. Remarkable amongst the previous Fons is Fon Shomitang I who did not have good times with his people. There were constant disagreements, which made him leave the palace with some of his supporters. Some provoked him, as he did not have children early. He reigned from about 1830-1885. He left the village and first settled at Banso where he became a close friend to the then Fon of Nso in about 1860. From Nso, Fon Shomitang with his people then left and settled next at Bamum meanwhile the people at home (Bambalang) made a provisional (tentative) Fon since the throne could not be left empty. While at Bamum his friendship with Sultan Nsangu strengthened while his people also became very friendly with the Bamums and were therefore involved in games with the Bamums. Shomitang lived with his wives in Bamum land for long and Mborongunu (who succeeded him) grew in Foumban. A remarkable legacy of his second reign upon return from Foumban was the introduction of the Royal Queen's Dance exclusively for members of the Royal Family called ‚ÄúNdilow‚Äù which they learned at Bamum. The ‚ÄúNdilow‚Äù dance is a special dance in Bambalang because it is performed only during special ceremonies for example during the funeral of a Queen, Fon and visits of Royal Guests. Health Bambalang village have several health establishments including one medicalised health center with resident medical doctors, Care Center Clinic (private) with resident medical doctors and three other health centers in Mighang, Mbissa and Mbashie quarters. The use of modern medicine in Bambalang is gaining popularity with time as modern medicalization is gradually taking over from herbs. However, there exist some illnesses that are believed can only be treated with traditional herbs. Such illnesses include Typhoid, side pains, frontal headache etc. Inhabitants are however reluctant to go to health centres until their situation is deteriorating. Education Bambalang village have several nursery schools both government and privately owned with over three hundred kids enrolled. There are over ten different government primary schools and over three private primary schools with a total enrollment of over six thousand children. For secondary schools, there is one Government Bilingual High School, one Government High School, two Government Secondary Schools, one Government Technical High School, One Government Technical College, and several private colleges like Mekilins, Christ the king, Progressive Secondary School etc. Today, education have been embraced by all Bambalang Sons and Daughters with a new form of competition now arising among its inhabitants; that of who goes further in education than who. Bambalang sons and daughters are educationists and spotted nationwide teaching for the Government of Cameroon in numerous schools created. There is no single home in Bambalang without a child who has embraced Whiteman's education. However, the future of Whiteman's education in Bambalang is dented given that most of its sons and daughters drop out of school due to early and unwanted pregnancies, love for quick cash, lack of sponsors, unemployment etc. Culture Common meal in Bambalang Bambalang people boost a lot of cultural heritage including the Bambalang language. The Chrambouh, though, inter-spaced between the culture of the Mbaw Yakum People and that of Bamoun, because Bamoun's descendants occupy part of the Bambalang land. Quarters predominantly inhabited by Bamoun's descendants include: Mbissa Island, Mbashie, Njono, Mbafu, Nkeshi Island, Mbapishie with others living in some quarters. However, beside the culture of the Bamoun people, they respect the Bambalang culture and identify themselves as Bambalang people.. In Bambalang village, there are eight days of a week namely, Vi-Mitang, Vi-Ghei, Vi-Shaa, Vi-Nwi, Vi-Ngwong, Vi-Nkwi, Vi-Fongoung and Vi-Nkwa. There are two ‚Äúcontri-Sundays‚Äù (Vi-Nwi and Vi-Nkwi) which are considered as holy days in the village. On these days, inhabitants are expected not to go to the farm, to be calm meanwhile funerals are mostly organized on these days. Vi-Nkwa is the main market day though there are some sub markets like in Mbachoro, Mbasha, Mighang and Mbissa Island. On these market days, commodities are sold ranging from food crops through dresses and electronic gadgets. Bambalang Market attracts visitors the entire North West Region and West Regions of the country. These visitors come to buy food crops like groundnuts, maize, fish, goats, contri fowl among others. =Twins= In Bambalang village, the delivery of twins is seen as a sign of blessing and the children given some preferential treatment from birth. Upon birth of twins, the mother and father are given special attributes like ‚ÄúNtapah‚Äù and ‚ÄúTapinui‚Äù respectively while the children are given names with respect to the order of delivery; Nkeh if the first is a male and Shengwe if the first is a female while Mingo is generally used for both male and female if they are second. Whether the first is a female or male, they are reserved for the Palace, something that used to be a pride. =Nchindas(servants)= The Nchindas (servants) enroll into the service of the palace, undergoing rigorous but shrewd training for more than ten years though it has greatly reduced to a few years due to the requirements of the formal education system. There are two types of Nchindas: those to serve the Ngumba and those to serve the Fon. Nchindas graduate from the palace after gaining knowledge and used to the way peace and order is maintained in the village. Upon graduation, a porcupine spine is stuck into his cap. After graduation the ex-nchinda enjoys some privileges: Succeeds their father, Honoured with traditional title, given wives by the Fon, Accompany the Kwifon to funerals and enjoy the privileges thereof (food and drinks). =Sha'atang (Annual Cultural Festival= The Sha‚Äôatang epitomizes the Mbaw-Yakum people because it is a period of communion and reunion. Before the coming of the Christmas, villagers knew that they had to buy new dresses for their children during Sha‚Äôatang. Before the reign of Fon Ghogomu, death celebrations of late Fons were frequent often provoked by problems that threatened the welfare and health of the Fondom. In such situations, the gods of the land were always consulted. A common answer was that one of the late Fons was angry that the villagers have neglected him for long. An eleven days of ceremonies (to usher peace) was then observed and the celebration carried out. If after this a similar revelation was made of another Fon, another death celebration was carried out immediately, so that a lot of time for farming and other gainful activities were lost this way. Because of this Fon Ghogomu suggested to the Kwifon that the celebration of all late Fons could be jointly done, once a year. i.e. an Annual Cultural Festival. This period is a week of peace (retreat) when there should be no quarreling, fighting, shouting and farming. The rest of the period could therefore be used for farming and other gainful activities since this is done once a year. Economy Fishing in Bambalang The people of Bambalang village are mostly involved in agriculture especially the cultivation of groundnuts and maize. Groundnuts cultivated in Bambalang (contri groundnut) are unique in shape and taste, being found nowhere else. The people of Bambalang also participate in fish farming which is one of the main income generating activities. Tourism Sandy Beach of Mbissa, Bambalang Movement in and around Bambalang is aided thanks to good road network though not tarred. The earth road is constructed with gravel that makes it possible to move freely. There are several touristic attractions in Bambalang including the Sandy Beaches of Mbissa Island where an ecotouristic site have been constructed attracting visitors from around the world. The construction of a Royal Museum in the Fon's Palace has boosted the attraction of the Palace to visitors who come in their numbers to see for themselves artifacts. Prominent among the artifacts found in the Royal Museum is a walking stick that was used by Fon Shomitang I. Fon Shomitang's corpse was never seen as he told his kinsmen that whenever the walking stick is seen without him, they should know he is no more. The Minister of Arts and Culture, Professor Narcisse Mouelle Kombi, disclosed during the 2016 edition of the sha'atang the imminent insertion of the Mbaw-Yakum (Bambalang Palace Museum Project) into the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UNESCO, Project. He was marveled especially by the combination of tradition and modernism in architectural blend that gives the palace a unique attraction for tourists. He equally promised the training of museum attendants and financial assistance for the renovation of the palace if means permit. Politics With the return of multi-party politics in 1990 most Bambalang people became excited. There were accusations and counter accusations between militants of the ruling party CPDM and militants of the SDF. The S.D.F provoked those in the C.P.D.M, calling them embezzlers and enemies of progress. In early 1990 only die hard C.P.D.Ms openly militated in their party. On the other hand, the C.P.D.M militants looked at the S.D.F as rebels and vandals who were out to create havoc and having nothing to offer. Today in Bambalang these extreme views have been dropped. The Fon HRM KEVIN SHOMITANG II (a supporter of the party in Power, the C.P.D.M) has called on his people to rethink the raison d‚Äôetre of politics and to embark on politics for development. Bambalang village is home to Prof. Paul Mingo Ghogomu, a politician who was appointed Director of Cabinet at the Prime Minister's office in 2009. References  Further reading  * Jean-Pierre Warnier.

Safe Harbor is achieved when a subgroup has greatly improved since the previous year, even though they did not meet the state goal. In 2011, the school declined to Warning status due to low student achievement in reading and math. In 2010, Schuylkill Haven High School achieved AYP. In 2010, the attendance rate was reported at 95%. From 2004 to 2009, Schuylkill Haven HIgh School achieved AYP status each school year. In 2003 the School was in Warning status due to lagging student achievement especially in mathematics. ;PSSA Results Pennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.PDE, State Academic Standards, 2014 In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the applicable course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. The state announced the change in 2010 and made it in order to comply with Governor Edward G. Rendell's agreement to change to the national Common Core standards. ; 11th Grade Reading: *2012 - 70% on grade level, (12% below basic).

The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 Gettysburg College provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region. College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 75% of Schuylkill Haven Area High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges, takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment Schuylkill Haven High School offers the Pennsylvania dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The School works in cooperation with Penn State Schuylkill to offer the courses. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report: PA College Credit Transfer System Makes Higher Education More Affordable, Accessible, April 29, 2010 SAT scores In 2015, 72 Schuylkill Haven Area School District students took the SAT exams.

Additionally, there was one incident of harassment and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in three incidents at the school, with no arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. In 2013, there were two incidents of bullying in the high school. Additionally there were ten incidents involving the police with one arrest. One case of sexual harassment was also reported as well as a case of stalking. In 2011, there was one incident of bullying in the high school. Additionally there were thirteen incidents involving the police with no arrests. One case of sassault on a student was also reported. Schuylkill Haven Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. According to the Center for Disease Control‚Äôs biannual national study of high school students in 2009, five percent of Pennsylvania students did not go to school for at least one day because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness policy Schuylkill Haven Area School Board established a district wellness policy in July 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required Schuylkill Haven Area School District to submit a copy of the policy for approval. A study was conducted of the submitted policies (n=499). It found that the majority of districts complied with the mandates of the law. Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. Schuylkill Haven HIgh School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced- price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and migrant youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non-subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Schuylkill Haven HIgh School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A school nurse is available to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. ;Health eTools program: Schuylkill Haven Area School District participated in Highmark Foundation‚Äôs Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools grant which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued by the company in 2013. Extracurriculars Schuylkill Haven Area School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded, sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The District has a mandatory random drug testing policy for all students who participate in ports or other extracurriculars as well as those who drive to school. The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. The district operates an indoor swimming pool and has a turf football field since 2006.Evan Jones, New Turf Field should keep Haven in the green, Reading Eagle, August 2006 By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the school district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, a Pennsylvania public cyber charter school, charter school and those who are homeschooled, are all eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 =Sports= Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

Its artistic director is Gordan Nikoliƒá, concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra.  History  BandArt, born in 2005 within Spanish festival of Lucena Cordoba. It is an independent orchestra formed by musicians of whom many are members of some of the most prestigious orchestras in Europe. The Serbian Gordan Nikoliƒá, soloist and concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra and artistic director of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, is the art director and soul of BandArt. The name ‚ÄúBandArt‚Äù was chosen because it captures perfectly the orchestra‚Äôs talent and aspirations. \\"Band\\" comes from the Spanish word bandas, traditional wind ensembles, still strongly alive in many localities in Spain where local people of all generations meet regularly to socialize and play music of all styles, from Zarzuela to Bizet, driven by a folkloristic, popular enthusiasm. \\"Art\\", where the musical language and musician‚Äôs instincts are exposed to far more complex forms which call in their interpretation for much more elaborated nuances and deeper interdependence of all its elements. BandArt 's aim is to explore the possibilities of strengthening the links of those two worlds, the local and the universal, on the platform of great composer‚Äôs music. BandArt has performed in the most prestigious festivals and concert series in Spain, including the Ciclo de Ibermusica, Ciclo Palau 100 (Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana) conducted by Sir Colin Davis, Ciclo Sinf√≥nico de la Fundaci√≥n Caja Madrid, Peralada Festival performing Orfeo ed Euridice by Gluck with La Fura dels Baus, (DVD recording for Cmajor Label), Artes no Camino festival and El Escorial Festival, with the support of Patrimonio Nacional. They have also performed in the Palau de la M√∫sica de Val√®ncia and in the Auditorio Nacional de M√∫sica, Madrid. In July 2016 BandArt performed Mozart¬¥s Idomeneo at the Ludwigsburger Schlossfestspiele in a production by the Ludwigsburg Festival and the refugees‚Äô German association Zuflucht Kultur e.V.  Special characteristics  BandArt is an orchestra without the conductor usual figure in the stage so it requires a deep interaction and hard team work by its members.They keep a special attention and that‚Äôs when ‚Äúwith side by side work upper bounds are achieved\\".This leads to play on numerous occasions standing up, generating a feel and energy close to rock and roll and establishing strong emotional bonds with the public.This can be appreciated by attending any of their concerts and also in the documentary BandArt, filmed by Iv√°n Vald√©s. It has been said that BandArt \\"is an example of the rejuvenation of classical music in its symphonic version and develops another way of playing\\". Recordings Several BandArt interpretation had been recorded: Orfeo ed Euridice by Christoph Willibald Gluck had been performed by BandArt and La Fura dels Baus at Castell de Peralada‚Äôs Festival in 2011. It was recorded by Unitel Classical, available in DVD and also in YouTube. Ludwig van Beethoven Piano Concert No. 4 in G major, BandArt Orchestra with Javier Perianes, piano; Gordan Nikolic, concertmaster; were recorded at the National Auditorium of Music in Madrid for Los cl√°sicos the TV program of classical music on RTVE in 2008. Ludwig van Beethoven Symphony No. 7 in A major (Opus 92), BandArt Orchestra; Gordan Nikolic, concertmaster; were recorded at the National Auditorium of Music in Madrid for Los cl√°sicos the TV program of classical music on RTVE in February 2008. The documentary ‚ÄúBandArt‚Äù by Iv√°n Vald√©s shows how the orchestra works. Social activities Social integration through the arts is a vital part of their activities. Due to this social vocation, from its foundation to the present, members of the ensemble have taken part in a number of activities with refugees, in prisons, retirement homes, disability associations, schools(working especially with children with risk of social exclusion) and hospitals. In order to develop these projects, BandArt has been supported by Teatro Real, Fundaci√≥n Don Juan de Borb√≥n, Fundaci√≥n ONCE, Patrimonio Nacional and Zuflucht Kultur, within others.

Book of the Dead, spell 110: Fields of Iaru. Scene from tomb of Ramses III (1186‚Äì1155 BC) Human uses of living things, including animals plants, fungi, and microbes, take many forms, both practical, such as the production of food and clothing, and symbolic, as in art, mythology, and religion. The skills and practices involved are transmitted by human culture through social learning. Social sciences including archaeology, anthropology and ethnography are starting to take a multispecies view of human interactions with nature, in which living things are not just resources to be exploited, practically or symbolically, but are involved as participants. Plants provide the greater part of the food for people and their domestic animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While many plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided a large part of the power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs. Many species of animal are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, especially dogs and cats. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as cactuses, able to tolerate dry conditions, are grown as houseplants. Animals such as horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in the Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Living things further play a wide variety of symbolic roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Sometimes a major disease like tuberculosis, caused by a bacterium, plays a role in culture, in its case being associated for some reason with artistic creativity. Context =Culture= Culture consists of the social behaviour and norms found in human societies and transmitted through social learning. Cultural universals in all human societies include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of social organization, mythology, philosophy, literature, and science. The term \\"bioculture\\" has been proposed to cover all the practical uses (but not the symbolic ones) of living things in culture, including agriculture, production of food and clothing, forestry, animal breeding and training, the pet trade, use of living things in science, zoos and aquariums, animal sports, and the raising of game animals for sport hunting. =Three types of use= Scholars of human culture have traditionally divided uses of living things into two categories: practical use for food and other resources; and symbolic use such as in art and religion. More recently, scholars have added a third type of interaction, where living things, whether animals, plants, fungi or microbes function as participants. This makes the relationships bidirectional, explicitly implying various forms of symbiosis in a complex ecology. These three types are described in turn. Practical uses =For food and materials= Ploughing rice fields with water buffalo in Indonesia The human population exploits and depends on many animal and plant species for food, mainly through agriculture, an essential component of human culture, but also by exploiting wild populations, notably of marine fish. Livestock animals are raised for meat across the world; they include (2011) around 1.4 billion cattle, 1.2 billion sheep and 1 billion domestic pigs. Plants provide the greater part of food for humans, and for their domestic animals. They have played a key role in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet. Plants grown as industrial crops are the source of a wide range of products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time. Structural resources and fibres from plants are used to construct dwellings and to manufacture clothing. Wood is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as musical instruments and sports equipment. Wood is pulped to make paper and cardboard. Cloth is often made from cotton, flax, ramie or synthetic fibres such as rayon and acetate derived from plant cellulose. Thread used to sew cloth likewise comes in large part from cotton. Plants are a primary source of basic chemicals, both for their medicinal and physiological effects, and for the industrial synthesis of a vast array of organic chemicals. Note that the details of each plant and the chemicals it yields are described in the linked subpages. Textiles are made from both animal fibres, including wool and silk, and plant fibres, including cotton and flax. Dyestuffs too are made both from animals, including carmine from the bodies of insects, and from plants, including indigo, [madder], and lichens. =For work and transport= Working domestic animals including cattle, horses, yaks, camels, and elephants have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods. =In science= mice are widely used in medical research. Biology studies the whole range of living things. Animals such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the zebrafish, the chicken and the house mouse, serve a major role in science as experimental models, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year. Knockout mice are used to help discover the functions of genes.Y Zan et al., Production of knockout rats using ENU mutagenesis and a yeast-based screening assay, Nat. Biotechnol. (2003). Basic biological research has often been done with plants. In genetics, the breeding of pea plants allowed Gregor Mendel to derive the basic laws governing inheritance, and examination of chromosomes in maize allowed Barbara McClintock to demonstrate their connection to inherited traits. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana is used in laboratories as a model organism to understand how genes control the growth and development of plant structures. Space stations or space colonies may one day rely on plants for life support. =For medicines and drugs= Mandrake in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, one of hundreds of medicinal plants used since classical antiquity Vaccines have been made using animals since their discovery by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live cowpox afforded protection against the more dangerous smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases mumps and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro. An increasing variety of medicinal drugs are based on toxins and other molecules of animal origin. The cancer drug Yondelis was isolated from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata. One of dozens of toxins made by the deadly cone snail Conus geographus is used as Prialt in pain relief. Since classical times and possibly much earlier, hundreds of species of plants have provided drugs to treat a wide range of conditions. Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, written by 70 AD, listed some 600 medicinal plants and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and squill. The book remained a standard reference for nearly two thousand years, and was the basis of the European pharmacopoeia until the end of the 19th century. Also since the earliest times, people have exploited some of the many psychoactive substances manufactured by plants in religious rituals and for pleasure. Among the most widely used throughout history are alcohol, produced by fermenting cereals with yeast (a fungus), tobacco, coffee, tea, chocolate, cannabis, coca (used as leaf for some 8,000 years in Peru,Early Holocene coca chewing in northern Peru Volume: 84 Number: 326 Page: 939‚Äì953 and in recent times also purified to cocaine), mescaline (from a cactus) and psilocybin (from a fungus). =For pleasure= The colourful floral display in the Isabella Plantation, Richmond Park, London attracts many visitors. Both animals and plants are used to provide pleasure, through a range of activities including keeping pets, hunting, fishing, and gardening. A wide variety of animals are kept as pets, from invertebrates such as tarantulas and octopuses, insects including praying mantises, reptiles such as snakes and chameleons, and birds including canaries, parakeets and parrots all finding a place. Mammals are the most popular pets in the Western world, with the most kept species being dogs, cats, and rabbits. For example, in America in 2012 there were some 78 million dogs, 86 million cats, and 3.5 million rabbits. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. Many animals are hunted for sport. The aquatic animals most often hunted for sport are fish, including many species from large marine predators such as sharks and tuna, to freshwater fish such as trout and carp. Birds such as partridges, pheasants and ducks, and mammals such as deer and wild boar, are among the terrestrial game animals most often hunted. Chapters on hunting deer, wild hog (boar), rabbit, and squirrel. Thousands of plant species are cultivated for aesthetic purposes as well as to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardens may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania. Symbolic uses =In art= Both animals and plants are significant in art, whether as background or as main subjects. Animals, often mammals but including fish and insects among other groups, have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, in both early history as in Ancient Egypt, and prehistory, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux and other sites in the Dordogne, France and elsewhere. Major artistic depictions of animals include Albrecht D√ºrer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket. Plants appear in art, either to illustrate their botanical appearance, or for the purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.

Below the main image, a parade of animals go two by two into Noah's ark. Animals, plants, and microbes feature in literature and film. Animals as varied as bees, beetles, mice, foxes, crocodiles and elephants play a wide variety of roles in literature and film. A genre of films has been based on oversized insects, including the pioneering 1954 Them!, featuring giant ants mutated by radiation, and the 1957 The Deadly Mantis. Birds have occasionally featured in film, as in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 The Birds, loosely based on Daphne du Maurier's story of the same name, which tells the tale of sudden attacks on people by violent flocks of birds. Ken Loach's admired 1969 Kes, based on Barry Hines's 1968 novel A Kestrel for a Knave, tells a story of a boy coming of age by training a kestrel. Parasitoids have inspired science fiction authors and screenwriters to create disgusting and terrifying parasitic alien species that kill their human hosts, such as in Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. Plants too, both real and invented, play many roles in literature and film. Plants' roles may be evil, as with the triffids, carnivorous plants with a whip-like poisonous sting as well as mobility provided by three foot-like appendages, from John Wyndham's 1951 science fiction novel The Day of the Triffids, and subsequent adaptations for film and radio. J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world Middle-earth features many named kinds of plant, including the healing herb athelasTolkien, J. R. R. (1954) The Fellowship of the Ring, I 12 \\"Flight to the Ford\\". the yellow star- flower elanor which grows in special places such as Cerin Amroth in Lothl√≥rien,Tolkien, J. R. R. (1954) The Fellowship of the Ring, II 6 \\"Lothl√≥rien\\". and the tall mallorn treeTolkien, J. R. R. (1954) The Return of the King, VI 9 \\"The Grey Havens\\". of the elves. Tolkien names several individual trees of significance in the narrative, including the Party Tree in the Shire with its happy associations, and the malevolent Old Man WillowTolkien, J. R. R. (1954) The Fellowship of the Ring, I 6 \\"The Old Forest\\". in the Old Forest. Trees feature in many of Ursula K. Le Guin's books, including the forest world of Athshe and the Immanent Grove on Roke in the Earthsea series, to such an extent that in her introduction to her collection The Wind's Twelve Quarters, she admits to \\"a certain obsession with trees\\" and describes herself as \\"the most arboreal science fiction writer\\". James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar features a giant tree named Hometree, the sacred gathering place of the humanoid Na'vi tribe; the interconnected tree, tribe and planet are threatened by mining: the tribe and the film's hero fight to save them. Trees are common subjects in poetry, including Joyce Kilmer's 1913 lyric poem named \\"Trees\\". Flowers, similarly, are the subjects of many poems by poets such as William Blake, Robert Frost, and Rabindranath Tagore. The bacterial disease tuberculosis played a role in culture, associated for some reason with artistic creativity. It was known as \\"the romantic disease\\". Many artistic figures including the poet John Keats, the composer Frederic Chopin and the artist Edvard Munch either had the disease or were close to others who did. Tuberculosis played prominent and recurring roles in diverse fields. These included literature, as in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, set in a sanatorium; in music, as in Van Morrison's song \\"T.B. Sheets\\"; in opera, as in Puccini's La boh√®me and Verdi's La Traviata; in art, as in Monet's painting of his first wife Camille on her deathbed; and in film, such as the 1945 The Bells of St. Mary's starring Ingrid Bergman as a nun with tuberculosis. =In mythology and religion= Animals are important in religions such as Hinduism. Here, cattle listen to Krishna's music. Animals including many insects and mammals feature in mythology and religion; indeed, animals and plants appear in what has been suggested to be the world's first religion in the Paleolithic era. Among the insects, in both Japan and Europe, as far back as ancient Greece and Rome, a butterfly was seen as the personification of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death.Hutchins, M., Arthur V. Evans, Rosser W. Garrison and Neil Schlager (Eds) (2003) Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia, 2nd edition. Volume 3, Insects. Gale, 2003. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, while the praying mantis was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture. Among the mammals, cattle, deer, horses, lions and wolves (and werewolves), are the subjects of myths and worship. Of the twelve signs of the Western zodiac, six‚ÄîAries (ram), Taurus (bull), Cancer (crab), Leo (lion), Scorpio (scorpion), and Pisces (fish)‚Äîare animals, while two others, Sagittarius (horse/man) and Capricorn (fish/goat) are hybrid animals; the name zodiac indeed means a circle of animals. All twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac are animals.Lau, Theodora, The Handbook of Chinese Horoscopes, pp. 2‚Äì8, 30‚Äì5, 60‚Äì4, 88‚Äì94, 118‚Äì24, 148‚Äì53, 178‚Äì84, 208‚Äì13, 238‚Äì44, 270‚Äì78, 306‚Äì12, 338‚Äì44, Souvenir Press, New York, 2005 Plants including trees are important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may be more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras koks is a tree which grows from the start of the Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. cites: Homer, Odyssey, x. 302‚Äì306. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree. As participants Social sciences including anthropology, ethnography, and archaeology have long investigated human interactions with living things. Anthropology and ethnography have traditionally studied the roles of living things in human culture in two opposed ways: as physical resources that humans used; and as symbols or concepts through totemism and animism. More recently, these scientists have also seen living things as participants in human social interactions,{{cite journal last=White first=Thomas last2=Candea first2=Matei last3=Lazar first3=Sian last4=Robbins first4=Joel last5=Sanchez first5=Andrew last6=Stasch first6=Rupert editor-last=Stein editor-first=Felix editor- last2=Candea editor-first2=Matei editor-last3=Diemberger editor- first3=Hildegard title=Animals journal=Cambridge Encyclopedia of Anthropology date=2018-05-23 doi=10.29164/18animals doi-access=free } in what has been called \\"multispecies ethnography\\". The anthropologists S. Eben Kirksey and Stefan Helmreich wrote: Archaeology, too, has traditionally centred ecological interactions on the human side, rather than, in Suzanne E. Pilaar Birch's words, Birch includes animals, plants, fungi, and microbes among critical interactions with humans: Whereas historically, Birch states, humans saw themselves as exceptional, such as in the medieval great chain of being, an integrated multispecies approach would assemble expertise \\"in diverse areas, including archaeology, human-animal studies, biology, ecology, evolutionary theory, and philosophy\\".

Havening involves instructing the patient to recall emotionally disturbing events while the practitioner gently touches the patient's palms, arms and face. Havening shares features in common with another alternative therapy method, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Methodology Havening works through a change agent, a brain delta wave, generated by a simple soothing touch on the palms, upper arms and forehead. This wave interacts with the voltage dependent calcium channel on a glutamate activated neuron in the lateral amygdala. This interaction produces an intracellular calcium oscillation activating a phosphatase which acts to remove a traumatically placed AMPA receptor. The selective activation of the amygdala neuron associated with the emotional component of the recalled memory from the traumatized event is critical to making that neuron susceptible to the change agent. It is this selectivity that allows us to target specific memories. In addition, as the client begins treatment immediately after recall, the distress of the client is minimized., Volume 15, Issue 3, May‚ÄìJune 2019. Assessments of claims The official \\"Havening\\" website includes a listing of testimonials about Havening's effectiveness, however, the \\"Havening Research\\" page does not link to any research studies assessing the claim that Havening is an effective therapy for any of the disorders listed on the site. One study has been published designed to assess that claim. In that study, 27 participants completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and social adjustment before, and one week and two months after, a Havening intervention. Scores on the different measures were better after the intervention than before. The authors note that the study is limited by \\"its small sample size\\" and \\"lack of control group\\". Because of the lack of a control group, there is no way to know if the change in scores on the self-report measures is a result of the Havening intervention, a placebo effect, or some other factor related to the passage of time. Proponents claim that Havening \\"increases the levels of serotonin which can disrupt reconsolidation of the link between the traumatic memory of the event and the distress it causes.\\"  References  Further reading Counseling ","title":"Havening"},{"id":"51093706","text":" This is a list of aircraft in numerical order of manufacturer followed by alphabetical order beginning with 'Mx'.

As a member of the United States women's national rugby sevens team, she won a bronze medal at the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens, and a silver medal at the 2015 Pan American Games. She was also captain of the United States Women's Rugby Sevens team for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Early life and high school  Kelly Griffin was born and raised in Berkeley, California and played soccer and basketball starting at the age of 6. She attended Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California, where she played basketball for coach Gene Nakamura, who called Griffin's 2003 team the group he was \\"most fond of\\" from his 24 seasons as head coach.  Collegiate rugby  Griffin moved from Berkeley to Los Angeles to attend UCLA in 2004, and her freshman she year joined the UCLA Women's Club Rugby team, known as the UCLA Bruin Rangers. She helped lead UCLA to several national playoff appearances, and was named a USA Rugby AIG Women‚Äôs Collegiate All-American in 2007 and 2008. Additionally she was selected for the USA Rugby Under-23 team in 2006 and 2007.  Women's Premier League  After graduating from UCLA with an applied math degree in 2008, Griffin returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and joined the Berkeley All Blues Women's Rugby Club. During the 2011 season of the Women's Premier League, Griffin won the 7s National Championship with the All Blues and was named tournament Most Valued Player. The All Blues also won the 2011 Women's Premier League Championship, with Griffin leading the league in tries scored. Additionally, Griffin won the 2011 Women's All-Star National Championship with Pacific Coast team, rounding out her three championships in a six-month period.  USA Rugby Eagles Women's Sevens  In early 2012, Griffin signed a full-time training contract with USA Rugby, and along with 7 other women, became the first professional female rugby players in the United States. Griffin moved to Chula Vista, California to train at the Olympic Training Center with the rest of the contracted 7s players. From 2011/2012 on, Griffin has played in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, captaining the USA team for several tournaments. Additionally, going into the 2016 Summer Olympics, Griffin leads the country in appearances on the World Sevens Series Circuit, and is the only athlete of the \\"original eight\\" to have remained in residency throughout the four-year lead up to the 2016 Olympics. In addition to the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, Griffin competed with the USA Eagles Sevens at the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens. After an undefeated campaign in pool play, the USA went on to claim the bronze medal by beating Spain in sudden death overtime 10-5 in the 3rd place match. In June 2015, Griffin was selected as captain of the USA Women's Sevens team for the North American and Caribbean Rugby Association Championship, which also served as an Olympic qualifying tournament. The USA would win the NACRA gold medal, and also qualify for the 2016 Rio Summer Olympicss by beating Mexico in the Championship game, 88-0 .

He was born in Pre√üburg which at that time was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the family moved to Vienna in 1909. Following the frontier changes mandated in 1919, he spent much of his adult life and career in that city, although he spent six of the Hitler years exiled in Mexico. Sources most frequently name him as Bruno Frei, but he is also sometimes identified as Karl Franz, a pseudonym under which some of his work was published. Life =Early years= Benedikt Freistadt was born in Pre√üburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia). His father, Michael Freistadt, was in business. The family was poor, although through his mother, born Berta Hauser, he was related to Heinrich Heine. Pre√üburg was a cultural melting pot, and in an age when national identity and language had become important, it is noteworthy that his mother's first language was Hungarian although fluency in German, his father's first language, was necessary outside the front door. In any case, when he was 12 the family relocated to Vienna. Three years later, when he was 15, he abandoned his training for the rabbinate. =Journalism= Bruno Frei made his earliest journalistic contributions in 1917. He provided material for the recently established left-liberal Viennese newspaper \\"Der Abend\\". He was much influenced by the newspaper's thoughtfully Communist proprietor, Karl Colbert. It was a mark of the times that on 18 March 1918 \\"Der Abend\\" was closed down by the authorities: it was relaunched as \\"Der neue Abend\\" on 10 June 1918, but reverted to its former title on 31 October 1918. Frei was at this point not a full-time journalist, since in 1915/16 he also commenced his study of Philosophy at the University of Vienna. While at university he was able to attend lectures and presentations by Sigmund Freud, Max Adler and Karl Kraus. He came into contact with socialist groups and in 1918 himself joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutsch√∂sterreichs / SDAP)  as it was known till 1933. In the revolutionary ferment that followed national military defeat he drew close, politically, to the group around Josef Frey (who later became a Communist Party official). He was awarded his doctorate on 30 June 1920 for a dissertation entitled \\"The Ethics of Pirkei Avot as a Paradigm for Ethics of Judaism\\" (\\"Die Ethik des Pirque Aboth als Paradigma einer Ethik des Judentums\\"). =Berlin= In 1920 he relocated to Berlin to work as foreign correspondent for \\"Der Abend\\". According to his own writings, he was disappointed that the revolutionary events that marked Germany during 1918/19 had not triggered more than a feeble echo in Vienna. Berlin, he stated, was a \\"workers' city\\" and as such at the heart of \\"events\\" in a way that Vienna was not. In Berlin he was a frequent visitor to the Romanisches Caf√© where he got to know politically like-minded left-wing writers including Egon Kisch and Anton Kuh. Another member of the circle was Stefan Gro√ümann, who was editor of a weekly cross-party political journal called Das Tage-Buch (literally: \\"The Diary\\") for which Frei contributed material. During his time in Berlin Frei also set up, with L√©o Lania, the \\"ABC Press Agency\\". In the winter of 1923/24, with widespread destitution in Germany threatening to erupt into street violence, the German Communist Party was banned, and the left-wing \\"ABC Press Agency\\" came under close police scrutiny. Frei published his first contribution in the political weekly, Die Weltb√ºhne in 1923. Although not a mass-market publication, within the German speaking world, Weltb√ºhne enjoyed a far higher profile with the politically aware than the newspapers and magazines for which Frei had been writing up till now. After Carl von Ossietzky took over as editor in chief, in 1927, Frei became a more frequent contributor, joining the permanent staff in 1929. =Vienna= In the meantime, in 1927/28 he returned for a year or so to Vienna, taking on leadership of foreign policy coverage at \\"Der Abend\\". He stayed in Austria long enough to publish, in addition, the first comprehensive study of the 1918 sailors' mutiny at the Cattaro Bay naval base. In 1928 he undertook a reporting visit to the Soviet Union, which formed the basis for a volume entitled \\"In the Country of the Red Power\\" (\\"Im Lande der roten Macht\\"), published in 1929. =Return to Berlin= In 1929 he was persuaded by Willi M√ºnzenberg to make a permanent return to Berlin. M√ºnzenberg was setting up \\"Berlin am Morgen\\" a new daily newspaper, providing a Communist perspective and targeting a mass readership, and he offered Frei the job of managing editor. The newspaper provided a platform for a number of leading writers of the political left, and it continued to be published until banned, in 1933. =Prague exile= The political backdrop changed in January 1933 when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Frei himself was not, at this stage, a card carrying Communist Party member, but most of his professional friends and colleagues were. With his ear close to the ground, he was among the first to understand that the government would use the Reichstag fire of 27 February to justify a round-up of Communists in Germany. He resolved to flee abroad in order to avoid being caught up in the programme of mass arrests that indeed ensued. He quickly arranged to flee with Franz Carl Weiskopf, a fellow newspaper editor based in Berlin who also had a home in Prague. In Prague they created \\"Gegen-Angriff\\" (\\"Counter-attack\\"). The magazine, which first appeared in September 1933 and continued to appear, with Bruno Frei its editor in chief, till 1936, was published both as a conscious provocation and as a rejoinder to \\"Der Angriff\\" (\\"The Attack\\"), founded as a Nazi newspaper by Joseph Goebbels and published since 1927 in Berlin. =Paris exile= In 1934 Bruno Frei belatedly joined the German Communist Party, which had been illegal in Germany since the previous year. The party leadership had, for the most part, managed to emigrate, some to Moscow and many others to Paris which quickly became a de facto headquarters for the German Communist Party in exile. Frei emigrated from Prague to Paris in 1936. His work was published in various antifascist newspapers and journals such as \\"Neue Deutsche Bl√§tter\\" (literally: \\"New German pages\\") and \\"Nouvelle d‚ÄòAutriche\\" (\\"News of Austria\\"). It was also in 1936 that he became a co-editor for the \\"News of Germany\\" press agency, also serving as secretary for the Paris-based Protection League for German Authors abroad (\\"Schutzverband deutscher Schriftsteller im Ausland\\"). =War and arrest= War resumed in September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland and the French government (like the British government) declared war on Germany. A period of eerie \\"normality\\" followed. However, in May/June 1940 the German army invaded France, rapidly occupying the northern half of the country and installing a puppet government in the south. The 1938 merger of Austria with Germany had left Bruno Frei as a citizen of Hitler's Germany, but in May 1940 he was stripped of both his German citizenship and of his university doctorate because he was Jewish. In June the French authorities (like the British) responded to events by arresting large numbers of political refugees who had fled to Paris a few years earlier in order to escape the Nazis. Frei was one of these \\"anti-Hitler people\\" identified as enemy aliens and arrested. Well informed, as ever, he had already prepared his little suitcase and was ready when the police arrived unannounced in the middle of the night. The French arresting officer spotted books about Stalin and Hitler in his apartment and appeared unable to comprehend that the books were actually unequivocally critical of the dictators in questions. It was only when he was taken to a huge room in a nearby police station that was filled with fellow German exiles from Naziism that Frei appreciated the colossal scale of the mass arrest in progress. They were then taken to the Roland Gaross Sports Arena. In the arena he briefly caught sight of his fourteen-year-old son who called out to him \\"Mummy is....\\", but he heard no further. After a few days the internees were transported. Frei's destination was the huge camp at Le Vernet, in the far south. After his arrest Frei was separated from his family, and he was left unaware of whether or not they had also been arrested. It was only later that he discovered what had happened to his wife, Maria. The German army had over- run Paris very rapidly, and the city had suffered only a single German air- raid, but in that bombing raid Maria Freistadt had been killed. =Camp Vernet= Conditions at Camp Le Vernet, which had hitherto operated as a reception centre for republicans escaping from Franco following the defeat of the Second Spanish Republic, were initially less savage than those encountered in the concentration camps in Germany, but security was progressively tightened, and in 1941 the authorities prepared to separate out the many Jewish-German internees for transportation to purpose built concentration camps Germany where an uncertain fate would await them. Supported by contacts in the international writers' associations, and with help from Gilberto Bosques, the heroic Mexican consul in Marseilles, Bruno Frei succeeded in obtaining release and a passage to Mexico, travelling there via Trinidad and the USA. =Mexico exile= In Mexico Frei was one of many German refugees from Naziism. In Mexico City he co-founded and then became chief editor of the magazine \\"Freies Deutschland\\" (\\"Free Germany\\"). He also became a member of \\"Austrian Republican Action in Mexico\\" (\\"Acci√≥n Republicana Austriaca en M√©xico\\"). In 1943 he joined the exiled Austrian Communist Party and co-founded with another publication, \\"Austria Libre\\". =Return to Vienna= He returned to Vienna in April 1947. In 1948 he took over as chief editor of the newly re- established daily newspaper, \\"Der Abend\\", produced by the Communist Party publisher, Globus-Verlag. He switched in 1956 and a stint as foreign correspondent for the newspaper Volksstimme, in Beijing, followed, till 1959. During the later 1950s he was engaged in a series of journalistic projects. Together with Ernst Fischer und Viktor Matejka he launched the Communist oriented journal Wiener Tagebuch, serving as its editor in chief from 1960 till 1964. His memoirs were published in 1972. Bruno Frei died at Klosterneuburg, a short distance upstream from Vienna, on 21 May 1988. Family Bruno Freistadt was married to Maria Muellauer (1890-1940). Their son, Hans Freistadt, was born in Vienna on 6 September 1925. There was also a daughter, Lisa Freistadt. Maria Freistadt was killed in an air raid on Paris in June 1940. The children both crossed to the USA in 1940, though it is not clear from sources whether they crossed to North America on the same ship as their father. Once in the USA, Hans Freistadt was supported by Jewish refugee organizations as he worked through high school and Chicago University. He subsequently earned a doctorate in Physics from North Carolina, acquired US citizenship in 1944, and appeared all set for a distinguished career as a nuclear physicist. He then fell foul of McCarthyism, however, and after robustly refusing to recant his socialist beliefs, was stripped of his university fellowship following a (briefly) high-profile hearing before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. He now trained successfully for an alternative career, as a physician. Hans Freistadt died in 2015. Unlike her brother, Lisa Friestadt was able to join her father in Mexico, like him later returning to Vienna after the war.

Life  After completing his studies in Rouen, La Touche entered the Society of Jesus where he remained until the age of fourteen. After leaving, he devoted himself to poetry and began with an ode on the birth of the Duke of Burgundy entitled Mars au berceau (1751, in-8¬∞). The only tragedy that he made and which made his name live, Iphig√©nie en Tauride, was presented at the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais 4 June 1757. If one believes mademoiselle Clairon, the fifth act, which the actors were not satisfied with, was re-built this very day by the author, yet the curtain rose at half past five. The success of Iphig√©nie en Tauride was all enthusiasm. Guimond asked again loudly, let himself get on stage and fainted with joy as he withdrew. His play, remarkable in several respects and remained as one of the best second-rate tragedies, however, was abused by Fr√©ron, Grimm and Geoffroy who called it a \\"burlesque farce,\\" an \\"extravagant hodgepodge.\\" In imitation of the Greeks, or simply following the example of Coll√©, the author fulfilled his subject, without introducing any love episodes, and maintaining the simplicity of Euripides' plan failed not of interest nor pathetic. Many loans were reported: the scene of recognition was drawn entirely from the opera Iphig√©nie by Duch√© in 1704 ; the one where Iphig√©nie asks Orestes about the fate of the family of Atreus, whose background is in Euripides, recalled by some details Oreste et Pylade by Lagrange-Chancel (1697), but improving it. The author was also criticized for exaggerating Thoas' stupid ferocity uselessly for the action, and for not having enough prepared nor motivated the outcome. As for style, it was said that the heavy, monotonous, versification, the declamatory pieces and Iphig√©nie en Tauride language mistakes were saved by the energy and heat that animated all of the work that was printed several time (Paris, 1758, 1784, 1811, 1815, 1818, in-8¬∞). Guimond de La Touche also left an √âp√Ætre √† l‚Äôamiti√© (London, 1758, in-8¬∞) ; les Soupirs du clo√Ætre, ou le Triomphe du fanatisme (1765, in-8¬∞), a satire against his former colleagues, the Jesuits.

The well is famous for its relation to the legend of the hero Bayajidda defeating the snake Sarki. The well and Bayajidda's supposed dagger are now a tourist attraction. The legend According to Hausa myth, Hausa communities have been living in Central Sudan (much of modern-day Northern Nigeria & some part of Niger) for over 2000 years. Daura was believed to be one of the largest Hausa cities of that time. It had queens as head of government that oversee the affairs of the people. During the reign of Queen Daurama, the major source of water for Daura was the Kusugu well. But people were only allowed to fetch water on fridays because of a strange snake that lives inside the well. That was how people continue to starve until one day when a person who was believed to be a Baghdadi prince, Bayajidda (Abu Yazid) came to Daura because he could not get the throne after the death of his father. The brave Prince after lodging in the house of one old woman in the name of Ayyana, requested for water, but he was not given enough. He then requested to be shown the well to fetch water. He was warned about a strange snake. He went to the well and eventually killed the snake after a fight. The queen then married him and he became a King. Because he could not speak Hausa before, people started calling him Bayajidda, meaning, he don‚Äôt understand before. He had seven children that ruled over the seven Hausa states that are called Hausa Bakwai. The Kusugu well is where the giant snake Sarki was killed with a by Bayajida in the 10th century because the snake would only allow the people of Daura to fetch water from the well only once a week, mainly Fridays. = Arrival of Bayajidda in Daura and slaying of the serpent = Bayajidda left his wife and child in Garun Gabas and continued on to the village of Gaya near Kano - which others believe to be Gaya in modern Niger -, where he had the local blacksmiths made him a knife. He then came to the town of Daura (located in modern-day Katsina State), where he entered a house and asked an old woman for water. She informed him that a serpent named Sarki (sarki is the Hausa word for king) guarded the well and that the people were only allowed to draw water once a week. Bayajidda set out for the well and killed the serpent with the sword and beheaded it with the knife the blacksmiths had made for him, after which he drank the water, put the head in a bag, and returned to the old woman's house. (The well where this is said to have happened is nowadays a tourist attraction.) The next day, the people of Daura gathered at the well, wondering who had killed the snake; Magajiya Daurama, the local queen offered sovereignty over half the town to whoever could prove that he killed the snake. Several men brought snake heads forth, but the heads did not match the body. The old woman, owner of the house Bayajidda was staying in informed the queen that her guest had slain it, after which Daurama summoned Bayajidda. Having presented the snake's head, proving to her that he was the one who had slain Sarki, he turned down the offer of half the town instead requesting her hand in marriage; she married him out of gratitude for slaying the serpent.
