Biography Early life He was born in Raipur, Chhattisgarh (erstwhile Madhya Pradesh) to Hafiz Ahmed Khan, who hailed from Peshawar. He passed his matriculation from Laurie Municipal High School, Raipur, and later completed his B.A. from Morris College, Nagpur in 1944. Thereafter he studied M.A. for a year at Aligarh Muslim University . Early in life, he started writing poetry using his pen name Takhallus. Soon after, he assumed his name, Habib Tanvir. Career Khalid Abidi, Prof. Desnavi Playwrighter Habib Tanvir. In 1945, he moved to Bombay, and joined All India Radio (AIR) Bombay as a producer. While in Bombay, he wrote songs for Urdu and Hindi films and even acted in a few of them. He also joined the Progressive Writers' Association (PWA) and became an integral part of Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) as an actor. Later, when most of the prominent IPTA members were imprisoned for opposing the British rule, he was asked to take over the organisation. In 1954, he moved to New Delhi, and worked with Qudsia Zaidi's Hindustani Theatre, and also worked with Children's theatre, where he authored many plays. Later in the same year, he produced his first significant play Agra Bazar based on the works and times of the plebeian 18th-century Urdu poet, Nazir Akbarabadi, an older poet in the generation of Mirza Ghalib. For this play he brought together local residents and folk artistes from Okhla village in Delhi and students of Jamia Millia Islamia creating a palette never seen before in Indian theatre. Additionally, the play was not staged in a confined space, rather a bazaar, a marketplace. After this, he continued to work with non-trained actors and folk artistes like the folk artists of Chhattisgarh. Stay in Europe In 1955, when he was in his 30s, Habib moved to England. There, he trained in Acting at Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) (1955) and in Direction at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (1956). For the next two years, he travelled through Europe, watching various theatre activities. One of the highlights of this period, was his eight-month stay in Berlin in 1956, during which he got to see several plays of Bertolt Brecht, produced by Berliner Ensemble, just a few months after Brecht's death.Habib Tanvir:samar, 2001 This proved to have a lasting influence on him, as in the coming years, he started using local idioms in his plays, to express trans-cultural tales and ideologies. This, over the years, gave rise to a \\"theatre of roots\\", which was marked by an utter simplicity in style, presentation and technique, yet remaining eloquent and powerfully experiential. Return to India A deeply inspired Habib returned to India in 1958 and took to directing full-time. He produced Mitti ki Gaadi a post-London play, based on Shudraka's Sanskrit work, Mrichakatika. It became his first important production in Chhattisgarhi. This was the result of the work he had been doing since his return ‚Äì working with six folk actors from Chhattisgarh. He went on to found \\"Naya Theatre\\", a theatre company in 1959. In his exploratory phase, i.e. 1970‚Äì73, he broke free from one more theatre restriction ‚Äì he no longer made the folk artistes, who had been performing in all his plays, speak Hindi. Instead, the artistes switched to Chhattisgarhi, a local language they were more accustomed to. Later, he even started experimenting with \\"Pandavani\\", a folk singing style from the region and temple rituals. This made his plays stand out amidst the gamut of plays which still employed traditional theatre techniques like blocking movements or fixing lights on paper. Spontaneity and improvisation became the hallmark of his new theatre style, where the folk artistes were allowed greater freedom of expression. His next venture with Chhattisgarhi Nach style, saw another breakthrough in 1972, with a staging of the play titled Gaon Ka Naam Sasural, Mor Naam Damaad. This was based on a comic folk tale, where an old man falls in love with a young woman, who eventually elopes with another young man.The Hindu, 2 January 2005 By the time he produced his seminal play, Charandas Chor in 1975, the technique became popular. This play immediately established a whole new idiom in modern India theatre; whose highlight was Nach ‚Äì a chorus that provided commentary through song. He also brought in Govind Ram Nirmalkar, a noted Nacha artist who would later go on to win Padma Shri and Sangeet Natak Akademi Awards, to play the lead role. Later, he collaborated with Shyam Benegal, when he adapted the play to a feature- length film, by the same name, starring Smita Patil and Lalu Ram. He was awarded the prestigious Jawarharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1979 for research on Relevance of Tribal Performing Arts and their Adaptability to A changing Environment. In 1980, he directed the play Moti Ram ka Satyagraha for Janam (Jan Natya Manch) on the request of Safdar Hashmi. During his career, Habib has acted in over nine feature films, including Richard Attenborough's film, Gandhi (1982), Black and White and in a yet-to-be-released film on the Bhopal gas tragedy. His first brush with controversy came about in the 1990s, with his production of a traditional Chhattisgarhi play about religious hypocrisy, Ponga Pandit. The play was based on a folk tale and had been created by Chhattisgarhi theatre artists in the 1930s. Though he had been producing it since the sixties, in the changed social climate after the Babri Masjid demolition, the play caused quiet an uproar amongst Hindu fundamentalists, especially the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), whose supporters disrupted many of its shows, and even emptied the auditoriums, yet he continued to show it all over.Ponga Pandit controversy His Chhattisgarhi folk troupe, surprised again, with his rendition of Asghar Wajahat's Jisne Lahore Nahin Dekhya in 1992. Then in 1993 came Kamdeo Ka Apna Basant Ritu Ka Sapna, Tanvir's Hindi adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.Traveling Shakespeares in India In 1995, he was invited to the United States by the Chicago Actors Ensemble, where he wrote his only English language play, The Broken Bridge. In 2002, he directed Zahareeli Hawa, a translation of Bhopal by the Canadian- Indian playwright Rahul Varma, based on the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. During his illustrious career he brought works from all genres to stage, from ancient Sanskrit works by Shudraka, Bhasa, Vishakhadatta and Bhavabhuti; to European classics by Shakespeare, Moli√®re and Goldoni; modern masters Brecht, Garcia, Lorca, Gorky, and Oscar Wilde; Tagore, Asghar Wajahat, Shankar Shesh, Safdar Hashmi, Rahul Varma, stories by Premchand, Stefan Zweig and Vijaydan Detha, apart from an array of Chhattisgarhi folk tales. Legacy In 2010, at the 12th Bharat Rang Mahotsav, the annual theatre festival of National School of Drama, Delhi, a tribute exhibition dedicated to life, works and theatre of Habib Tanvir and B.V. Karanth was displayed. The 13th Bharat Rang Mahotsav opened with an Assamese adaptation of his classic play Charandas Chor, directed by Anup Hazarika, a NSD graduate.

At the 2016 Australia Census, Redbank had an unemployment rate of 14.5%, more than double the Australian unemployment rate of 6.9%.  History  The origin of the suburb name is from a description of the area provided by Major Edmund Lockyer whilst exploring in a boat along the Brisbane River. While the Redbank area is known for its agricultural and pastoral origins, it has a more varied history. In the late 1850s, the first farmers in the area settled on the river flats situated to the north of the current railway station. This settlement featured a brickworks, sawmill, stores, cottages, a school and nondenominational church, though due to severe flooding, it was relocated south of the railway station some years later. In the early years, the rich black loamy soil of the plains supported crops of maize, potatoes and fodder, while cotton became a significant crop in the 1860s and 1870s. By the beginning of the 20th century, dairying became more important with the establishment of several creameries in the area.

For many years, he was the director of the pre-historic department of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. He was involved in numerous excavations, both in Europe and the Middle East, and contributed significantly to archaeological science. In his time, he was seen as Germany's most senior and accomplished prehistorian. Life and early career Carl Schuchhardt was born in Hanover, Germany, in 1859 as the eldest of four children of a prominent local copper engraver and graphic artist. After completing school in Vegesack, Schuchhardt studied classical philology, modern languages and archaeology in Leipzig, G√∂ttingen and Heidelberg. After 1883 he worked briefly as a teacher in Konstanz and Karlsruhe before taking a position as private tutor to the young sons of Romanian prince Alexander Bibescu. His time in Romania allowed him to study the many earthwork fortifications in the Dobrogea and elsewhere, his work bringing him to the attention of renowned German archaeologist Theodore Mommsen. On Mommsen's recommendation, Schuchhardt received a travel scholarship from the Imperial German Archaeological Institute, spending 1886-87 in Greece and Asia Minor, participating in the excavations of Pergamon under Carl Humann. This period exposed him to the systematic excavation techniques developed by the German archaeologists, Alexander Conze and Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld. Schuchhardt was also commissioned by Heinrich Schliemann's publisher, F. A. Brockhaus in Leipzig, to prepare a one-volume popular review of Schliemann's discoveries. Immediately a best-seller and translated into several European languages, Schuchhardt's \\"Schliemann‚Äôs Excavations: An Arch√¶ological and Historical Study\\" was a significant boost to Schuchhardt's early career and remains available as a reprint to this day. Museum director In 1888, after a brief stint in Berlin, Schuchhardt was appointed as director of the Kestner-Museum in his hometown of Hanover. From this position, he worked to develop the museum's collections and also pursued a variety of archaeological researches in northwestern Germany which allowed him to refine his technique of excavation. In 1892 he was asked by August von Oppermann to assume editorship of the monumental \\"Atlas of Prehistoric Fortifications in Lower Saxony\\", a work that would occupy Schuchhardt through 1916. He was also instrumental in excavations at Haltern and was closely involved in important national research projects such as the Reichslimeskommission (Imperial Limes Commission) and the Roman-Germanic Commission (Mason, Croitoru 2016, pp. 42-45). He also was long-term head of the Nordwestdeutscher Verband f√ºr Altertumsforschung (Northwest German Association for Archaeological Research), which took a leading role in coordinating regional cooperation in archaeological research. In 1908, Schuchhardt was appointed director of the pre-historic department of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, part of the Royal Museums in Berlin. He held this post until his retirement in 1925, seeing the museum through the difficult period of World War I, the beginning economic depression in the early Weimar years, and the move to new quarters. At the same time, Schuchhardt conducted a number of highly systematic digs of prehistorical sites around Potsdam, before reaching out after the end of World War I to sites in Lusatia and along the Baltic Sea, including a search for the fabled Slavic fortresses of Vineta and Rethra.Schuchhardt, Karl, Arkona, Rethra, Vineta -- Ortsuntersuchungen und Ausgrabungen. Berlin, H. Schoetz & Co, 1926. (Extinct cities, Earthworks, in German). Akademie der wissenschaften, Berlin. Before World War I, Schuchhardt was also active outside of Germany, studying prehistoric sites in England (including Stonehenge), Brittany and Malta. More controversially, he acquired a number of fossils and examples of Paleolithic art from the Dordogne region of France between 1910 and 1914 in association with Swiss archaeologist Otto Hauser, as well as the famous Craiova Hoard (a group of \\"Scythian\\" silver pieces) obtained under questionable circumstances while excavating in German-occupied Romania in 1917-1918. In March 1918, Schuchhardt became one of the first archaeologists to utilize aircraft reconnaissance in establishing the course of the so-called Dobrogea Walls between Constanta and Cernavoda (Mason, Croitoru 2016, 331-350). Interpretation of archaeological finds controversy In 1909 Schuchhardt founded the Journal of Prehistory (Pr√§historische Zeitschrift), which remains one of the leading scientific journals in its field. In the following years, he was involved in a lengthy controversy with the Berlin-based archaeologist Gustaf Kossinna on the issue of the \\"ethnic interpretation\\" of archaeological finds.H. Gr√ºnert, Gustaf Kossinna (1858‚Äì1931): Vom Germanisten zum Pr√§historiker. Ein Wissenschaftler im Kaiserreich und in der Weimarer Republik, Rahden/Westf., Verlag Marie Leidorf, 2002 One of the disputes was over the interpretation of the 1913 discovery known as the Eberswalde Hoard. The disputes with Kossinna served to underscore differences between the Berlin school of \\"pre-historians\\" that had been based in the strongly natural- science/medical/anthropological tradition of pathologist Rudolf Virchow,A. Lewerentz, Rudolf Virchow und die Berliner Gesellschaft f√ºr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte: Einfluss auf den Aufbau pr√§historischer Sammlungen im Berliner V√∂lkerkundemuseum bis 1902, in Menghin, W. (ed.), Das Berliner Museum f√ºr Vor- und Fr√ºhgeschichte: Festschrift zum 175-j√§hrigen Bestehen, Berlin: Museum f√ºr Vor- und Fr√ºhgeschichte, 2005 (= Acta Praehistorica et Archaeologica, Bd. 36/37), 103 ‚Äì 121 and the \\"classical archaeologists\\" (Schuchhardt's background) with their focus in the traditional archaeologies of Near East, Greece and Rome. Despite Schuchhardt's efforts at compromise and reconciliation, the increased politicization of archaeology and its allied fields during the Nazi period, unfortunately, did not contribute to any real accommodation between the two camps, even after Kossinna's death in 1931.B. Arnold, The Past as Propaganda: Totalitarian Archaeology in Nazi Germany, reprinted in Murray, T., Evans, C., Histories of Archaeology: A Reader in the History of Archaeology, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, 120 ‚Äì 144 Schuchhardt was also instrumental in proposing an antiquities law (Denkmalschutzgesetz) that regulated and protected archaeological sites in Prussia. Although himself never a Nazi, Schuchhardt's role during the Third Reich has been controversial: in particular, he has been criticized for not more strenuously resisting Nazi efforts to marginalize and persecute scientists of Jewish background (Mason, Croitoru 2016, 93-99). Family Schuchhardt died in December 1943 in Bad Arolsen, where he and his family had gone to escape the bombing of Berlin. He was survived by his wife, Margarete (n√©e Herwig, 1868-1949), two sons, classical archaeologist Walter-Herwig Schuchhardt (1900-1976), for many years a professor in Freiburg; and Wolfgang (1903-1993), and two daughters, Ewa Hebing-Schuchhardt (1897-1985) and K√§the (1901-1945). His younger son, Wolfgang, together with his wife and elder daughter, Ewa, were active in the Anthroposophic Movement in Germany (Mason, Croitoru 2016,99-103). Honours Schuchhardt was a fellow of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and affiliated with the German Archaeological Institute. He was deputy chairman of the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory, 1916 to 1919 and its chairman from 1926 to 1929. He was an honorary member from 1925 of the Lower Lusatian Society for Anthropology and Archaeology. With the death of Kossinna in 1931, Schuchhardt became Germany's most senior prehistorian during the Nazi era. Notes Bibliography Schuchhardt was a prolific writer and a recent attempt at a full bibliography lists 258 titles of books and articles (Mason, Croitoru 2016, pp. 104-117).

It was decided that the imagery of exploding buildings was no longer suitable. Eventually the city imagery was replaced with igloos, to match the arctic theme of Tux, the Linux penguin, who stars in the game.

Like Missile Command, players attempt to protect their cities, but rather than using a trackball-controlled targeting cross-hair, players solve math problems that label each comet, which causes a laser to destroy it. Features The game has multiple user support (useful for schools), LAN multiplayer mode, on-screen tutorials and a training mode - over 50 bundled lessons ranging from simple number typing up through all four basic arithmetic operations with negative numbers and \\"missing number\\" questions (e.g. \\"3 x ? = 12\\").

It is the ancestral seat of the Parker Baronets. The hall was mostly constructed in the 16th century, incorporating parts of a medieval building held by the abbots of Bury St Edmunds which had been in use since before 1065. It has similar roots to nearby Kentwell Hall. It passed from the abbots during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and was later granted by Queen Mary to Sir William Cordell. From Cordell it passed via his sister to Thomas and Mary Savage before being sold back into another male Cordell line. James Howell described the hall and garden in the times of Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers in a letter in 1619.Joseph Jacobs, Epistolae Ho-Elianae: the familiar letters of James Howell, vol. 1 (London, 1892), pp. 106-7. During the Stour Valley Riots of 1642 the house was attacked and damaged by an anti-Catholic crowd. In 1786 it was sold to Harry Parker, son of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker. Beatrix Potter was a cousin of the family and was a frequent visitor to the hall from the 1890s onwards. One wing of the hall was gutted by fire in February 1942 but rebuilt after World War II, retaining the external Tudor brickwork with 1950s interior design. The hall was first opened to the public in 1955 by Ulla, Lady Hyde Parker. In 1960 it passed into the care of the National Trust. It is generally open on weekend afternoons in April and October, and on afternoons from Wednesday to Sunday during May to September.

Still motion is a method of displaying many images one after another as frames, using the technique of \\"frame-by- frame\\", similar to the concept of stop motion. The difference between this and stop motion, however, is that still motion is not a method of animation and therefore, each frame does not have to be related in any way. It is a style of editing which is usually used to create an intense effect. Overview Still motion started as a method to intensify a scene. Mostly used in horror films, a sequence of images would appear on screen at a relatively fast speed to intensify the moment. It is also usually accompanied by unnerving music. It could also be used to signify flashbacks, dreams or summaries and lead to a conclusion of some sort. Sometimes, it could be slower and pictures fade in and out, like a slideshow. The attributes of a still motion movie are less confined than that of a stop motion movie. A still motion movie can contain images of anything and need not have any composition relation with its predecessor frame. All frames should have the same dimensions, however, each image may have its own dimensions within a frame. This method has been accused by many of subliminal messaging. Since the subconscious mind is said to pick things up much faster than the rest of the brain, one could say that a hidden message in a still motion movie, it may allow the brain to receive the message without the human eye having time to register it. History The technique has been used in many forms of media. The most common form of still motion now exists as Adobe Flash or Gif animation banners on website advertisements. Examples *In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the infinite improbability drive of the Heart of Gold is represented by a still motion sequence of seemingly unrelated items accompanied by 'popping' sounds, finishing with the Heart of Gold. *In Lost, Season 3, Episode 7, \\"Not in Portland\\", the character 'Karl' was brainwashed by a screen showing a still motion movie show various images and texts. *In Chuck, Season 1, Episode 1, \\"Pilot\\", Charles Bartowski, sees a still motion movie containing U.S. intelligence files to become the intersect. *In Heroes, Season 2, Episode 8, \\"Four Months Ago...\\", Peter Petrelli, sees a still motion movie when he retrieves his memory. *Psyop created this still motion movie for Adidas' Adicolor: Blue *In Vanilla Sky, David Aames sees a still motion movie of his life before he hits the ground  See also  * Stop motion * Go motion  External links  * Her Morning Elegance, a video clip made with still motion animation.

Childhood and youth Guggiari was born in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay the son of Ana Brun and Pedro Bruno Guggiari, considered by many the most remarkable among the mayors of Asunci√≥n. He completed his elementary and high school education in the San Jose School of Asunci√≥n and his engineering studies in Buenos Aires where he also graduated as a sculptor at the Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes ‚Äú Ernesto de la C√°rcova‚Äù, coming into contact with artists Libero Badii, Alicia Pe√±alba, Lucio Fontana and Curatella Manes and learning to value the avant-garde movements of the time. After the bloody civil war of 1947-1954 in Paraguay, Guggiari's liberal and democratic ideas gained him exile, cultural emargination and imprisonment on several occasions, during the thirty-year dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. The lack of an official national art fair in Paraguay led him to create the ‚ÄúBosque de los artistas‚Äù, in his own property, a fair which opened every Christmas from 1970 to 1995 becoming a Must of artistic creators, reaching a participation of 250 artists in the last editions. History and works Guggiari's body of work is large and has won prizes. Some have freedom as the central theme: ‚ÄùHungria o Libertad‚Äú, which received a special mention in the V Bienal of S√£o Paulo (1959); ‚ÄùKennedy‚Äù, which obtained the first prize in sculpture in the Salon Esso of Young Artist of Latin America, organized by the OEA (1965): ‚ÄùRejas‚Äù, inspired in the prisons of the Stronist dictatorship; ‚ÄùNNUU‚Äù, a seven meters structure, which is located at the entrance of the Dachau concentration camp (Germany) and symbolizes the United Nations in a form near the building of the NNUU,with perforations as wounds in two fronts-United Nations as a name, because the violence of the world continues-and as a sign of hope in each hole of the violence, a nest of real pigeons as a murmur of peace (199). Another theme is the vital, between to be and stop being. In this line there is ‚ÄùParto‚Äù, with a message of transcendence despite the pain, ‚ÄùInmanencia‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDel polvo eres y polvo seras‚Äù. As a homage to the dreams that did not come true, what could not be, he carved ‚ÄúAra rupi a‚Äù about which Livio Abramo said once at the presentation: ‚ÄùBecause of the capacity of adapting is deep artistic sensibility to the spirit of this time, Hermann B. Guggiari has a special place in the plastic art of Paraguay and the continent. His art is complex, absorbing all technical possibilities of our culture and civilization and he fuses them as his instrument in order to express the fundamental values of men.‚Äù ‚ÄúBrote‚Äù, an homage to his father, mayor of the city of Asunci√≥n who planted trees and created the green spaces of the city, is a sculpture inscribed within his optimistic themes. ‚ÄùHistoria‚Äù, presented at the Expo 92 in Sevilla, was selected by the organizers of the world event to be exposed at the entrance of the ‚ÄúPabellon de las Americas‚Äù. His moral theme appeared in his ‚ÄúCristo‚Äú, whose original is at the entrance of the church La Crucecita, in the Sajonia neighborhood, in Asunci√≥n. A copy of this work was presented at the X Bienal of S√£o Paulo (1971) and obtained the Golden Medal; regarding this successful participation the critic Arnold Kohler, from Switzerland, said in the newspaper Tribune de Geneve: ‚Äù There are two artist in the Bienal of Sao Paulo, both sculptors, who having followed different steps, one figurative and the other abstract, have reached a high perfection and spirituality. The first one, Hermann Guggiari, Paraguayan-created a form of an angel emerging from the wall, a dramatic and sublime work.‚Äú He is also the author of other ‚ÄúCristos‚Äú, associated to the ecological area, such as the one in the temple of Maria Auxiliadora, of Asunci√≥n, and the ‚ÄúCristo clavado por los troncos quemados‚Äù, of the few remaining woods in Paraguay. Within this subject, he made in the streets, in the second Bienal of Medellin (Colombia), the ‚ÄúCross‚Äù of Medellin, as an homage to the Colombian Christian martyrs. Another ‚ÄúCruz ametrallada‚Äù made as an homage to the Christian country men of the agro leagues, murdered during the dictatorship of Stroessner. ‚ÄúProceso‚Äù deserves special mention atemporal multispacial, with an integration of films, photos, sound, made with machine guns and used several times as ‚ÄúCruz‚Äù. On sustained development he presented in the university city of Fort Hays, Kansas, United States, a sculpture symbolizing the development of this state as the world granary. (1980) ‚ÄúGaviota‚Äù (1982) is a sculpture presented in Punta del Este (Uruguay) in a mixed exposition of sculptors of Latin America, in the Playa Brava; it's a protest against the death of the coast birds due to the black ties produced by the petrol pollution. He also made a monument to ‚ÄúPeriodista martir Santiago Leguizamon‚Äú (1991), located on the street with the name of the press man, victim of murder bullets. In 1994 he made a ‚ÄúHomenaje a Miro‚Äù in an international congress in Panama. Other sculptures of his are monument to ‚ÄúA los heroes del CHACO‚Äù in the harbour of Asuncion, the image of ‚ÄúMaria Auxiliadora‚Äù, of 8,5 meters, made in stainless steel, and the monument of ‚ÄúExalumnos del Colegio San Jose muertos en la Guerra del Chaco‚Äù, made in quebracho wood. He was a member of various international juries, co-founder of Centro de Arte Moderno de Asuncion, founder and first president of the Centro de Escultores del Paraguay, founder of the Movimiento Ecologico Paraguayo (1990). In 1995 he was condecorated by the Paraguayan government with ‚Äúthe national merit order ‚Äú, as a Commendatore.

A Pale is an \\"area, jurisdiction\\". See also: The English Pale in Ireland. Its capture by the English is the subject of Auguste Rodin's 1889 sculpture The Burghers of Calais. In 1558, the expanding Kingdom of France annexed the Pale of Calais in the aftermath of the Siege of Calais. The region was represented in the Parliament of England by members sitting for the Calais constituency. Historically part of the Flemish cultural region, the Pale was trilingual; French, English, and Flemish were commonly spoken. The name derives from Caleti, an ancient Celtic people who lived along the coast of the English Channel. History noble of Edward III minted in Calais between 1361 and 1369. Calais fell after the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346 to Edward III of England following a siege. Its seizure gave him a defensible outpost where his army could regroup, and the city's position on the English Channel meant that, once it was taken, it could be resupplied easily by sea. Its retention was confirmed under the Treaty of Br√©tigny, signed on 8 May 1360, when Edward renounced the throne of France, in return for substantial lands in France, namely Aquitaine and the area around Calais. By 1453, at the end of the Hundred Years' War, it was the only part of mainland France to remain in English hands. It was used as a base for English expeditions operating against France such as in 1492 when Henry VII oversaw an attempt to capture Boulogne. While it was possible to resupply and defend Calais easily by sea, in the absence of any natural defence it depended on fortifications built up and maintained at some expense. However, its main defence had been that both the French and the Burgundians coveted the city, but each preferred to see it under the English rather than their rival. Changing political circumstances with the division of Burgundian interests in the Low Countries between France and Spain meant that, in 1550 when England surrendered the area around Boulogne, which Henry VIII had taken in 1544, the approaches to Calais were opened. The Pale of Calais remained controlled by England until lost by Mary I to France in 1558 when, following secret preparations, 30,000 French troops, led by Francis, Duke of Guise, took the town of Calais. Its loss was recognised under the Treaty of Cateau-Cambr√©sis (1559). In England there was shock and disbelief at the loss of this final Continental territory. The chronicler Raphael Holinshead reported that a few months later Mary, on her death bed, told her family: \\"When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Calais' lying in my heart\\". However, the loss of the Pale of Calais was not as severe on the English economy as might have been expected, as by this time England was focusing its trade on the Habsburg Netherlands. During the English rule, the people of the Pale of Calais retained their identity as French and Flemish speakers. Geography The area of the Pale of Calais comprised the communes of Andres, Ardres, Balinghem, Bonningues-l√®s-Calais, Calais, Campagne-l√®s-Guines, Coquelles, Coulogne, Fr√©thun, Guemps, Gu√Ænes, Les Attaques, Hames-Boucres, Hervelinghen, Marck, Nielles-l√®s-Calais, Nouvelle-√âglise, Offekerque, Oye-Plage, Peuplingues, Pihen-l√®s-Gu√Ænes, Sangatte, Saint-Pierre (Calais absorbed Saint-Pierre-l√®s- Calais inhabited with inhabitants in 1885, now southern part of Calais), Saint-Tricat and Vieille-√âglise. The area of the Pale of Calais is difficult to define because the boundaries were vague due to swampy land and artificial waterways and were constantly changing. The pale extended from Gravelines almost to Wissant and covered about . The French were continually reclaiming small pieces of the territory, particularly in the southwest. Much of the area of the Pale consisted of wetlands and the territory was roughly divided into highlands in the west and lower country in the east.

Announcer Lee Whiting also moved from KSFR to KKHI. In late 1958, KSFR moved to 10 Claude Lane, a later home of KFRC. In September 1961, KSFR's power was increased to 35,000 watts. On June 1, 1962, KSFR began broadcasting in multiplex stereo; however, Levitt was criticized by media critic Bob Foster in The San Mateo Times for rushing into stereo without conducting field tests because there were some serious technical problems with the signal. These were soon resolved and KSFR became the first San Francisco station to broadcast classical music full-time in stereo. KSFR moved to 211 Sutter Street in 1965. Levitt sold KSFR to Metromedia in 1966, remaining at 211 Sutter Street. Metromedia, the fourth largest broadcasting company in the nation, after NBC, CBS and ABC, also bought San Francisco station KEWB 910 AM, renamed KNEW, to be similar to its WNEW in New York. It bought KSAN-TV channel 32, acquiring this call sign. Under the original agreement, Levitt was to stay on as KSFR general manager for five years and the classical music format would be maintained. Metromedia continued the classical music format for a couple of years, producing a special series of programs honoring conductor Arturo Toscanini during the 1967 centennial of his birth. However, in October 1967, Metromedia replaced Levitt as general manager. KSAN (1968 to 1980) On May 21, 1968, the call letters changed to KSAN and the format switched to freeform music format. Metromedia transferred the KSAN calls from its TV station, which it renamed KNEW-TV. (The KSFR call letters currently belong to a National Public Radio station in Santa Fe, New Mexico.)KSFR Radio 94.9 FM - San Francisco The timing of the change from KSFR to KSAN was triggered by an event at another station. On March 18, 1968, KMPX program director Tom Donahue turned in his resignation after a series of conflicts with station management. This led directly to a strike by many Donahue-loyal KMPX staff members. They began picketing outside the station's offices, and were soon supported in their efforts by popular bands such as the Grateful Dead and Blue Cheer, as well as the station's devoted listeners. The staff at sister station KPPC-FM in Pasadena walked out the next day. KMPX and KPPC owner Leon Crosby refused to cave in to his striking staff, and brought in replacements at both stations to continue the progressive rock format. Several popular rock bands ‚Äî including The Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead ‚Äî insisted that the station not play their music, in a show of support to the picketers. The eight-week strike ended on May 13, with no resolution between the former staffers and Crosby. KMPX continued with the same format, but the controversy opened the eyes of larger broadcasting companies to the potential for rock and roll on FM. Seeing an opportunity to jump into a hot new radio format against a smaller company, Metromedia decided to switch the format of KSAN from classical music to freeform rock, and hired Donahue and most of the displaced KMPX staffers, who started at the station on May 21. Metromedia also hired the former KPPC staffers to work at KMET in Los Angeles, which made a similar format switch. Donahue eventually became general manager of KSAN, while also programming consulting for sister station KMET.Donahue: A True Visionary of Rock - Joel Selvin - San Francisco Chronicle - May 3, 1975 KSAN, also known as Jive 95,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/jobs/leave-em-laughing-and- enlightened.html became a groundbreaking and legendary rock station, influencing other stations across the country. On December 7, 1969, KSAN broadcast a show discussing what had just happened the night before at the free Rolling Stones performance at Altamont Raceway. Hosted by Stefan Ponek, the four-hour show fielded calls from a range of people who attended the event and a few who helped organize it, including Rolling Stones personnel and members of the Hells Angels. This broadcast is extensively documented in the 2000 Criterion DVD release of Gimme Shelter, the result of a restoration effort that included the filmmakers. In the early 1970s, the station rose to number one in the 18‚Äì34 demographic,Arbitron developing a devoted cult following that lasted for many years.SF Bay Area Radio History During its heyday, KSAN had maintained a strong counterculture reputation. News reports often contained political commentary, with stories about the Vietnam War, the Nixon Administration, growing marijuana and drugs.The Nowtopian (formerly \\"Attitude Adjustor\\"): History circling through Chile When the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst, they used KSAN to communicate their message and demands, via cassette tapes.sla The station enlisted the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this ordeal, as they became an unwilling go-between in the Hearst kidnapping. On April 28, 1975, Tom Donahue died from a heart attack. A sampling of Tom Donahue on KSAN during the late 1960s can be heard on \\"The Golden Age Of Underground Radio\\" compilation. The station started to decline in popularity, with new station KMEL rising in popularity. By 1978, the station adopted a tighter presentation, with a playlist replacing the longtime freeform ethic. They also added more new wave and punk music, such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash and Blondie. California Historical Radio Society is trying to produce a KSAN documentary of the 1968 to 1980 era. Country era (1980 - 1997) KSAN's famed rock format ended on November 15, 1980, when the station switched to a country music format, likely influenced by the success of the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy which greatly increased the popularity of country music, as well of sister station KNEW, which had switched to country music in July 1974.the end Under the country format, KSAN thrived as a ratings leader thanks to Program Director Bob Hamilton, and then Lee Logan, Operations Manager from 1987 to 1994, and Head of Programming/West Coast for Malrite. It was during the Logan years that the KSAN/KNEW combo were consistently a top 3 combo based on Arbitron. With Marlene Augustine leading the marketing and Music Director Richard Ryan, along with air personalities such Frank Terry, Sam Van Zandt, Steve Jordan, Jon Wailin, Tom Benner, Teri King, Dave Ware, Tim Anthony, and Buddy Baron, KNEW/KSAN was a massive force in the market. Later talent included Welch and Woody in the Morning, and Rick Neal. WiLD 94.9 (1997 - current) Just before midnight on July 2, 1997, air personality Rick Neal played \\"The Dance\\" by Garth Brooks as the last song of the country format on KSAN 94.9. At one minute past midnight, KSAN swapped frequencies with KYLD, then on 107.7 FM. The two frequencies simulcasted until Midnight on July 7, when 107.7 FM, now with the KSAN call letters, began stunting with construction noises and song clips as a prelude to a flip to classic rock on July 11. In the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, KYLD was sold that year to Chancellor Media (before merged with Capstar to become AMFM, and later, merged with iHeartMedia's predecessor Clear Channel Communications). The move eliminated the ongoing competition with now-sister station KMEL; KMEL maintained its audience approach and format, while KYLD's Rhythmic format shifted to a Pop-heavy Rhythmic direction as the market had no Top 40/Pop station of its own. KZQZ was the last CHR/Top 40 station in The Bay Area, as they dropped the format in 2002 for a classic hits format. Up until February 2015, KYLD was a reporter to Nielsen BDS and Mediabase on their Rhythmic panel, but was moved to both trades' Top 40/CHR panel. The Top 40 void, however, would finally be filled by two new competitors. In September 2006, KYLD got some competition when KFRC changed their oldies format to a Rhythmic AC format. KFRC changed their call letters to KMVQ in May 2007, and by November 2008, shifted to Top 40/CHR. By September 2009, KNGY joined the fray by dropping its Dance format for Top 40/CHR as well, becoming KREV. While KREV has some-what struggled to attract an audience, KMVQ has become a serious competitor to KYLD, as KMVQ has beaten the station in several ratings periods, sometimes by a wide margin. In popular culture The station was briefly featured in Colette Carr's music video for her 2013 single \\"Ham,\\" where its logo can be spotted in the iHeartRadio app, on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, just before the three-minute mark. Controversy In 1993, a story was circulating that President Bill Clinton tied up traffic on an LAX runway for over an hour while getting a haircut on Air Force One from the hairstylist Cristophe. KYLD's morning DJ Mancow Muller staged a parody of the incident on the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge during rush hour. He used vans to block the westbound lanes on the bridge while his then sidekick, Jesus \\"Chuy\\" Gomez, got a haircut. As a result of this stunt, Muller was not only fired from the station, but prosecuted and subsequently convicted of a felony by a San Francisco Municipal Court. His sentence included three years probation, a $500 fine and 100 hours of community service. KYLD eventually paid $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by a bridge commuter. After Muller's departure, KYLD replaced his program with yet another successful‚Äîand yet later, another controversial‚Äîmorning show, The Dog House, hosted by JV (Jeff Vandergrift) and Elvis (Dan Lay). Their program became the #1 rated morning show in the Bay AreaThe Doghouse is the top-rated morning program in the Bay Area in the demographic age groups 12‚Äì24 and 18‚Äì34. receiving higher ratings than Howard Stern. [Stern's] show is second to KYLD'S \\"Doghouse\\" in the morning slot. Despite their success in the ratings, they would find themselves in trouble with station management over a series of stunts that would get them in hot water with the local authorities. One stunt in particular had members of the show dressed up as escaped inmates (and law enforcement officials to fine them for the prank and endangering the public) and causing a walkout at a San Jose high school. But the last straw for The Dog House came on April 21, 2005, when station management fired the show after they made offensive comments toward two female members of the San Francisco Renegades Drum and Bugle Corps. The band's members, Lisa Johnson and Robin Kinoshita, were at the station to promote an annual fundraiser when JV and Elvis allegedly made lewd remarks towards them.\\"KYLD Puts the Dogs Out\\" from Allbusiness.com (May 2, 2005) JV has since returned to KYLD as their morning host. On August 6, 2008, KYLD PD Jazzy Jim Archer and evening host Joe Breezy were fired over an April Fool's Day 2008 prank, in which the station promised to give away a pair of breasts from \\"Dr. Sanders.\\" Unfortunately, it was a promo to give away chicken breasts from Kentucky Fried Chicken. The winner was not impressed and filed a complaint against the station.From Radio-Info Booster KYLD is rebroadcast on the following FM Booster: HD Programming KYLD-HD2, also known as \\"Evolution\\", is a subcarrier of KYLD. The station began broadcasting as \\"WiLD en Espanol\\" on January 19, 2006, offering a commercial-free, jockless Rhythmic/Dance Top 40 format targeting a bilingual Hispanic audience. In early 2007 it was replaced by a new format, the brainchild of Program Director \\"Jazzy Jim\\", which focuses on future hit music, thus the name \\"FuZiC\\". It's a unique blend of Unsigned Artists and Independent Label releases alongside \\"Album Cuts\\" from Established Superstar Artists and \\"Foundation Songs\\" (tracks that gave much inspiration to today's music). FUZIC is also the only Bay Area HD-2 Channel to have \\"Jocks\\" and \\"Mix-Shows\\". In 2007 they were nominated for Top HD-2 Channel in the U.S. It has since changed to iheart's \\"Evolution\\" format, which airs electronic dance music.

It is a not for profit organization established in 1975. The National Council for Black Studies was founded and first housed at the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) by the UNC Charlotte Black Student Union.  History  Within the context of the Civil Rights Movement, a growing recognition of the need for the study of African-American world experience spurred student movements on several campuses for inclusive educations. The Black Studies movement (1968-1969) and the Black University concept (late 1960s) helped create more African and African diaspora-centered courses on various campuses. In April 1968, a national conference for Black teachers took place. Dr. Bertha Maxwell Roddey spearheaded NCBS in 1975 as part of this larger movement for African American studies. However, before its inception, Dr. Maxwell Roddey's pioneering work at UNC Charlotte included a Black Studies program that served as the inspiration and backdrop for the NCBS's structure, philosophy, and aims, in addition to the meetings and conferences that Dr. Maxwell Roddey organized.  Dr. Maxwell Roddey's Pioneering Efforts at UNC Charlotte  Dr. Maxwell Roddey realized the need for Black Studies education at UNC Charlotte, and although not originally a program that conferred an undergraduate or graduate degree, the Black Studies program at UNC Charlotte was integral to the creation of NCBS. Dr. Maxwell Roddey was the first black teacher at UNC Charlotte and also a co-founder of the Afro-American Cultural Center in North Carolina, now the Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts + Culture. She was also the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority from 1992-1996. The Black Studies program at UNC Charlotte was conceptualized to address the \\"academic, intellectual, social, and economic life of the Black student.\\" This was realized through a series of phases, which were levels of academic courses through which students would complete; they are as follows: * Phase I: Who Am I? * Phase II: Why Am I Here? * Phase III: Where Did I Come From? * Phase IV: Where Do I Go From Here? Each phase included community service projects and the higher levels or phases also included research projects while the lower levels or phases were intro-level or survey classes concerning African American history and other disciplines. The Black Studies committee envisioned the program to both benefit the community and work in tandem with the entire university through an interdisciplinary approach.Black Studies at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Black Studies Brochure (Charlotte, North Carolina: UNC Charlotte, 1975-1976). Currently housed in the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Several organizations were affiliated with the Black Studies program including: the Black Student Union, Black Gospel Choir, Basketball, Student Government, and various Black and historical Black sororities and fraternities.  Early History of NCBS  The initial philosophy of the Council was that \\"Education should engender both academic excellence and social responsibility.\\" The NCBS desired to expand and strengthen academic units and community programs concerned with African American studies. It originally operated as an organization for Black Studies professionals with the aim of developing the field as a respected academic discipline.  Mission & Philosophy  Members of NCBS are committed to the proliferation of the field of Africana Studies. Their work has promoted and retained K-12, community college, and university curricula inclusive to the experience and contributions of African diaspora peoples and other marginalized peoples. NCBS actively: * Facilitates, through consultation and other services, the recruitment of Black Scholars for all levels of teaching and research in universities and colleges; * Assists in the creation and implementation of multicultural education programs and materials for K-12 schools and higher education institutions; * Promotes scholarly African-centered research on all aspects of the African World experience; * Increases and improves informational resources on Pan-African life and culture to be made available to the general public; * Provides professional advice to policymakers in education, government and community development; * Maintains international linkages among Africana Studies scholars; and * Works for the empowerment of African People.  Current Efforts  The California Bill ACR-71 Africana studies programs, led to success with the efforts of former NCBS member and president Dr. Shirley Weber, is a testament to the continuing need for the African studies academic disciplines' support by state legislatures. Current NCBS board member and department chair of the Africana Studies program at California State University at Long Beach, Dr. Maulana Karenga is the founder of the Pan-African holiday Kwanzaa. NCBS also has a community grant available for members to apply for. The funding has helped new leaders and scholars bring African Studies to various communities. NCBS is currently housed at The University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio, with its previous base in Atlanta, Georgia.

The first is Actors' Fund of America. BC/EFA supports five major social service programs at The Fund, each of which provides direct assistance to entertainment industry professionals and performing artists who are dealing with a variety of problems, including AIDS, HIV, and HIV-related issues. These seven social service programs are the HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Al Hirschfeld Free Health Clinic, the Phyllis Newman Women's Health Initiative, the Actors Health Insurance Resource Center, the Actors Fund Work Program, the Stage Managers' Project and The Dancers' Resource. Since 1988, Broadway Cares has given $73 million to The Actors Fund.

Awards are presented to the shows raising the most money and to the winning presentation. During this fundraising period, actors return to the stage after bows and ask patrons to donate as they leave the theater. Some actors have objected to this, because they oppose asking patrons for more money, or because they do not wish to break character. The shows are in competition to raise funds, and use various approaches, such as auctioning signed memorabilia, to raise more than other shows. Easter Bonnet Easter Bonnet is an annual spring fundraiser in the theatre community, produced by and benefiting Broadway Cares. For six weeks, shows fundraise in their theatres, whether they're on Broadway, Off-Broadway, or touring. Volunteers and cast members hold red buckets after each performance and collect donations. Some shows sell autographed Playbills, posters, and props. Other shows offer auctions to meet the cast backstage or win an autographed prop. At the end of the six weeks, each show is invited to participate in the two-day Easter Bonnet competition. During this competition, performers from participating shows sing and dance while wearing their shows' unique \\"Easter Bonnets\\". Guest judges then choose award recipients for best bonnet design and performance. The 2014 judges at the 28th Annual Easter Bonnet Competition were Gregg Barnes, Christopher Hanke, Carly Rae Jepsen, Michael McKean, Jim Norton, Patrick Page, Annie Potts, Anthony Rapp, and two judges who won their spot on the panel through an auction at the 27th Annual Broadway Flea Market and Grand Auction.

He came to England about 1519, and was naturalized in 1543, and was one of a number of foreign artists of the Tudor Court, being appointed Serjeant Painter in 1543. The English evidently found his Italian name too complicated, and he is normally called \\"Antony Toto\\" (in effect \\"Anthony Tony\\") in the records; he was already called \\"Toto di Nunziato\\" in Italian records. His father was Nunziata d'Antonio, a painter who died in Florence in 1525. \\"Toto\\" had been signed on in Florence on 28 September 1519 as an assistant to Pietro Torrigiano, who was already in England, but in fact left there for good later that year. Vasari relates that Toto had worked in the shop of Nunziata's friend Ridolfo Ghirlandaio where he had painted a number of pictures that were sent to England (just as his fellow shop assistant Bartolomeo Ghetti is said to have made paintings that were sent to King Francis I of France before he himself departed for the French court). He had a Florentine colleague Bartolommeo Penni, brother of the much more distinguished Gianfrancesco, Raphael's right-hand man, and Luca, a member of the School of Fontainebleau.Getty biography of Luca Both Toto and Penni probably came to Henry from Cardinal Wolsey, as they first appear in the accounts just after Wolsey's fall in October 1529. Henry VIII appointed him Serjeant Painter, and he died still in office under Edward VI. He was the first Serjeant Painter who can be evidenced as an artist rather than an artisan. None of his paintings are known to survive, but his New Year gifts to Henry, presumably his own work, are documented as including a Calumny of Apelles (1538/39) and a Story of King Alexander (1540/41), and then in 1552 a portrait of a duke \\"steyned upon cloth of silver\\" for Edward VI. In March 1538 Toto's servant was paid for bringing to the king at Hampton Court Palace a \\"depicted table of Colonia\\".Horace Walpole, Toto and Penni are presumed to have spent most of their time after 1538 working on Nonsuch Palace, including elaborate stucco work for Henry's most advanced building, now vanished. Toto was married, though little seems to be known about his wife, and had at least one daughter, Winifred, who married Sir Charles Calthorpe, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). She died in 1605. Toto's services were evidently valued by the Crown, as he died a rich man, owning among other properties the manor of Ravensbury. None of his father's works survive, and little is known of his work, though he is mentioned in Vasari, who would not have known him personally. A document of 1517 names Nunziata and his son Toto as witnesses to the will of a legnaiuolo named Giuseppe di Lorenzo in the parish of San Pancrazio in September 1517. Surprisingly, here Nunziata is identified not as a painter but as a bombardier (‚ÄòNunziato Antonii Dominici bombardiere‚Äô). Apparently as an old man he must have fallen upon hard times. It was common for out-of-work craftsmen to moonlight as bombardiers (well-known examples include Raffaello da Montelupo and Zanobi Lastricati), though it was generally the province of masters in the more physically demanding arts, such as cannon- founders, sculptors, and scalpellini. Nunziata is a rare, if not unique example of a Renaissance painter working as a bombardier. On 28 September 1519 Nunziata personally recorded his consent as his son Antonio, called Toto del Nunziata, contracted to work abroad with Pietro Torrigiani for four and a half years. At the time Toto signed on with Torrigiani he was several months past his twenty-first birthday; technically, therefore, his father's permission was not required for the contract. Nunziata may have wished to give his formal assent in order to ensure that there would be no qualms about the legitimacy of Toto's contract. On the other hand, his recollection of his son Toto's exact age may merely have been a bit shaky.

He played for the Canberra Raiders of the National Rugby League. Nagas primarily played on the . He is of Vanuatuan descent. Canberra Raiders Nagas a Kyogle Turkeys junior, a or , started with the Raiders in 1992 with a single appearance on the wing in a loss to the Newcastle Knights. 1993 saw Nagas appear in nine games for Canberra where he scored 4 tries. In 1994 Ken Nagas hit form and he played 18 games and scored 11 tries, many of them length of the field runs, the most famous being against St George in Round 10 at Bruce Stadium in Canberra when he ran the length of the field to score while holding the ball in one hand, keeping his shorts up with the other. Nagas went on to play on the wing in Canberra's 36‚Äì12 Grand Final win over Canterbury-Bankstown where he scored 2 of Canberra's 7 tries. Nagas, like the rest of the Canberra Raiders players, signed with Super League in 1995 and although his great form continued, scoring 14 tries from 19 games, he along with team mates Laurie Daley, Bradley Clyde, Brett Mullins, Ricky Stuart and David Furner (other than Nagas, all were players on Australia's 1994 Kangaroo Tour), were left out of 1995 representative teams as only Australian Rugby League contracted players were selected. Canberra finished equal top on the 1995 ladder with Manly but after defeating rivals Brisbane 14‚Äì8 at Suncorp Stadium, the defending premiers were knocked out in the Preliminary Final by eventual premiers Sydney Bulldogs 8‚Äì25. In the 1997 World Club Championship, Nagas scored six tries for Canberra against Halifax, a club record. In the 1997 post season, Nagas was selected to play for Australia in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Great Britain. After eleven seasons with the one first-grade club, knee problems forced Nagas to retire midway through 2002. Representative career Nagas was eligible to represent New South Wales rather than his home state of Queensland in State of Origin and elected to do so, a decision he later regretted. He played for the Blues in games II and III of the 1994 State of Origin series, but after his two try performance in Canberra's Grand Final win over Canterbury, was sensationally left out of the 1994 Kangaroo tour in preference to young Brisbane Broncos winger Wendell Sailor. He was also selected as a winger for New South Wales in the 1997 Super League Tri-series. Nagas played in games I (against Queensland) and III (against New Zealand), scoring two tries in each game as well as the 'Grand Final' of the series against Queensland at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium. The Tri- series Final is known as the longest professional game of rugby league in Australian history. Noel Goldthorpe kicked a field goal in the 104th minute to win the game 23-22 for NSW after scores were locked at 18-18 after full-time and 22-22 after extra time. In 1997 Nagas played on the wing for Australia in their 34-22 win over New Zealand in the inaugural ANZAC Test at the Sydney Football Stadium. He later went on to play in the season ending loss to the Kiwis at the North Harbour Stadium in Auckland, before appearing in all 3 tests of the Super League Test series against Great Britain in England at the end of the year. However, while the rest of the rugby league world counts all tests played under the Super League banner as being legitimate test matches, the Australian Rugby League refuses to acknowledge the games from the rebels. Thus unfortunately, Ken Nagas, despite appearing in 5 tests during 1997, is listed as never having represented his country in official Australian records. Later years In 2004, Nagas was named as a member of the Canberra Raider's best Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to have played for Canberra. He is currently the trainer for the Canberra Raiders Toyota Cup (Under-20s) team.

Youth Cayo Sila Godoy was born in Villarrica Paraguay on December 4, 1919. His mother and his uncles were talented musicians who exposed him at an early age to the piano, violin, mandolin, harp and tropical guitar. He studied music first with his uncle Marciano Echauri, and from the age of 16, harmony with Juan Carlos Moreno Gonzalez. Sila left his home of Villarrica at the age of 16 to accept a scholarship at the National Music Conservatory in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. By age 24 he graduated from the conservatory as a professor of music theory and musicology. Following graduation he was awarded a grant to continue his musical education in Buenos Aires, where he remained for nine years under the tutelage of Consuelo Mallo L√≥pez. During these years Sila concentrated on refining his technique into the virtuosity admired today. First Steps In 1948, The Chamber Music Association from Buenos Aires gave him a diploma for the best concert of the season of that year. In 1953, as a request from the National Government, he went on a cultural and artistic tour, following the road of Mangore. He offered concerts, gave lectures and gathered a lot of information and documents on the great Paraguayan composer. Between 1959 and 1962 he participated on specialization courses with Andr√©s Segovia. In 1959 Andr√©s Segovia invited Sila to study in Spain, with all expenses paid, at his renowned classical guitar course at M√∫sica en Compostela. For three years he studied and traveled with Segovia. In 1963 Godoy, at the personal invitation of President John F. Kennedy, first visited the United States to do a concert tour. During this trip he was featured as a broadcast soloist on the Voice of America and played with such notable American guitarists as Charlie Byrd, Sophocles Papas and Richard Pick. In subsequent US tours he has played in most major cities and in 1977 volunteered to tour Kansas, Paraguay's \\"sister state\\" where he also taught master classes at Wichita State University. More recently he has toured Japan (1980), Australia (1983), and has made numerous appearances in the Latin American nations. In 1977, sponsored by the program ‚Äú Friends of the Americas ‚Äú, chapter Paraguay ‚ÄìKansas, he Developer activities in the state of Kansas, offering courses of specialization, speeches, and performances in the main cities such as Wichita, Topeka, and Lawrence. In 1980, he traveled to Japan on a concert tour, and in 1983 to Australia, as well as other cities in America and Europe. Mentions In 1994, he was appointed as musical advisor of the Vice Minister of Culture in Paraguay and member of the National Advisor Board of Culture. Godoy's creative style is characterized by the presence of elements derived from popular music with an harmonic contemporary treatment, including his last compositions, with an obvious tendency to atonality. His work as a music teacher has produced the appearance of young talents that honor the Paraguayan art today and who have been a public and critical success. In that sense, he stands out with the brilliant and exquisite composer and virtuosic guitarist, Luz Maria Bobadilla, who was admitted to study for four years with the great master, due to her outstanding quality of performance. Works Among his records the following ought to be mentioned : Sila Godoy in concert, recorded in New York City, USA, in 1982; Sila Godoy, recorded in Australia, in 1983; Aranjuez and Madrigal, two volumes on cassettes, which are gatherings from his two previous recordings, in 1994; The Music of Agustin Barrios Mangore and Jose Asuncion Flores, a compact disc with a gathering of his best recordings in 1994. As a researcher, he has published, together with Luis Szar√°n, the book ‚ÄúMangore, Life and Plays of Agustin Barrios‚Äú, and he has been preparing ‚ÄúThe Documents of Barrios‚Äú and ‚ÄúBarrios seen by his contemporaries‚Äù. Among his creations for guitar, ‚ÄúHabanera‚Äù, ‚ÄúMoto perpetuo‚Äù, ‚ÄúExtasis‚Äù, ‚Äú Cuatro obras para guitarra clasica‚Äù,‚ÄùFiesta Campesina‚Äù,‚ÄùCancion Intima‚Äù,‚ÄùOracion a Tania‚Äù, ‚ÄúCapricho\\" are highly recommended. His arrangements of the plays of Jose Asuncion Flores, a great composer of the musical genre known as Guaranias are notable, as well as his transcriptions for guitar, featuring the modern and very personal versions of ‚ÄúNde renda pe aju‚Äù and ‚ÄúGallito Cantor‚Äù. He died in Asunci√≥n, where he devoted his life to lectures, speeches and didactic concerts, as well as offering radio and television shows.

Biography He was born in Cavalese in County of Tyrol (today located in Trentino, Italy). He was initially taught drawing by an uncle, Franz Sebald Unterberger, and then in the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, where another uncle, Michelangelo Unterberger, was the co-director from 1751-1758. He then traveled to Venice and Verona, where he studied under Giambettino Cignaroli; and finally in 1758, to Rome. In Rome, he befriended and fell under the influence of Anton Rafael Mengs, and copied the works of Pietro da Cortona, in whose style he produced two altar-pieces of St. Jules and St. Agnes for the cathedral of Brixen. In 1772, he joined the Accademia di San Luca under the sponsorship of Mengs. In 1772, he and Mengs were commissioned to decorate the Papyrus room in the Vatican Library with themes from classic Roman frescoes, including grotteschi and other painted ornament, Starting in 1780, he led a team of artists replicating on canvas the Vatican Loggia designed by Bramante and Raphael. The commission had been communicated by Giacomo Quarenghi, the architect to Empress Catherine II of Russia. Quarenghi replicated the classic decoration gallery in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Hermitage decorations He also decorated the Stanza d'Ercole (1784‚Äì86) in Villa Borghese for Marcantonio Borghese. Once called Stanza del Sonno because of the statue of Sleep by Alessandro Algardi. The frescoes depict the Apotheosis of Hercules in the center surrounded by four of stories of his life, Receiving the horns of Achelous; Hercules and Lichas; Nessus and Deianeira, and the Death of Hercules. In 1790-91, Unterberger also helped design the playful Fontana dei Cavalli Marini (fountain of the sea horses) and the architectural capriccio of a hemi-facade (simulated ruins) of the Temple of Faustina in the Borghese gardens.Villa Borghese Gardens on Pincian Hill. His works were mostly historical, but he also executed genre subjects, landscapes, and fruit and flower-pieces. He painted some genre paintings now in the Liechtenstein Gallery in Vienna. He painted a Madonna with St. John for the Ferdinandeum at Innsbruck; a Martyrdom of St. Pontianus for the cathedral at Spoleto; and an Assumption for the Loreto Cathedral. A number of his works can be seen in the Pinacoteca Civica Fortunato Duranti. He saw the commission for the decoration of a ceiling of the ducal palace of Genoa go to Giandomenico Tiepolo instead of him. He died in Rome.His brother Ignaz Unterberger was a prominent painter who was active in Vienna. One of his pupils was Giuseppe Turchi and Antonio Longo.

This was before the widespread availability and use of fax services in homes and businesses. Eventually judged a commercial failure, it was discontinued just over two years later. History Zapmail was offered at two levels of service. When sending documents in low volumes for customers, FedEx would collect the document as normal, bring it to the local depot where it would be sent by fax to a depot near the recipient's address. There the document would be printed, packaged and delivered to its destination. For higher volume users, FedEx would install a ‚ÄúZapmailer‚Äù fax machine in the client's premises, usually in the mail room. To provide the fax network, FedEx had to invest heavily in fax machines from NEC, which at the time were expensive. Additionally, rather than use the PSTN public phone network, the documents were carried over the company's own packet-switched network, requiring still more investment. The FedEx strategy was driven by an expectation that customers would pay a premium to have their documents delivered in hours instead of overnight. At the same time, by migrating document traffic from trucks and aircraft, significant savings could be made in the FedEx transportation network. These savings could later be used to offer discounted services to increase volumes and margins. The Zapmailer did not conform to the ITU-T (formerly CCITT) specifications which had been developed for fax transmission over public networks. This meant the Zapmailer could not communicate with the growing numbers of Group 3 fax machines entering service. Large clients in particular, and later most others, were able to buy their own fax machines and transmit documents themselves. Once this began to happen, customers could see that it was more cost effective to buy their own machine rather than pay for regular Zapmail services. This remained true despite price reductions from $35 to $10 per ten pages. Quality problems with both the equipment and the transmission lines led the company to stop taking orders in March 1986. At that time the company stated that losses had accumulated to $200m and that an equipment upgrade was required. It was also stated that the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù transmission would be carried by satellite. This plan could not be realised due to the destruction of the space shuttle Challenger and the resulting grounding of the shuttle fleet. It was further announced in August that the upgraded equipment would be compatible with Group 3 fax standards. By this time, machine deliveries from NEC numbered in the thousands while customers were only in the hundreds. It was decided the service was a commercial failure and it was discontinued in October. $320m was written off and the employees of the Zapmail service were re-deployed within the company. Drawbacks * Color and high resolution images could not be transmitted * Confidentiality ‚Äì the uncovered documents had to be handled by FedEx employees at both ends of the fax transmission * In some cases, there was customer confusion of how the service worked * Fax machines, like many examples of electronic equipment, became affordable even for smaller companies * Problems such as inability to transmit light toned originals and telephone line limitations persisted * Because the service was still centered on the mailroom, often the speed advantage was lost in the internal mail system * Machines were not compatible with public networks Post script Jim Barksdale, FedEx COO at the time of the Zapmail launch, went on to become CEO of McCaw Cellular and later of Netscape. Fred Smith, founder and CEO, has been described as follows: ‚ÄúA guy like Fred Smith doesn‚Äôt build a company like FedEx without taking some risks and making some mistakes, but clearly the successes far outweigh the failures‚Äù. The equipment used for Zapmail was reportedly sold to an electronics recycler for scrap value. It was the height of the 1980s DRAM shortage as PCs and Faxes were becoming popular. The Los Gatos, California company that purchased this scrap for a reported $1 million removed the DRAM chips and sold them for a reported $8 million profit.

In 1942, de Mar√© had published his first book, titled Britain Rebuilt. The subsequent years saw the publication of further books and articles within the architectural press. Many of the subjects covered in these works are represented within the collection held by the public English Heritage Archive. Canals and waterways feature significantly in de Mar√©‚Äôs work. In 1948, he boated a dozen of the English canals during a 600-mile tour, photographing the landscapes, buildings and people he encountered. This journey resulted in a 1949 article for the Architectural Review documenting canal life and buildings. The following year saw the publication of The Canals of England. The book provided an historical and technical description of inland waterways punctuated by de Mar√©‚Äôs photography. In 1956, he was commissioned to travel throughout England to photograph early industrial sites and buildings. The resulting images were combined with JM Richard‚Äôs text in The Functional Tradition in Early Industrial Buildings, which was published by the Architectural Press in 1958. The functional tradition within architecture had received little attention from contemporary architects until this study, but the work coincided with and promoted an increased interest in the qualities of early industrial structures. His work in the 1960s reflected the other end of the industrial spectrum, focussing on modern power generation plants, to which his photographs frequently conferred a sculptural quality.

It was one of the first colleges to offer degree-level and masters-level study in osteopathy. The College's Principal is Dr. Kerstin Rolfe.  History  The College was founded as the British College of Naturopathy and Osteopathy (BCNO) in 1936. Its original site was bombed in 1942 during World War II and the naturopathic pioneer, Stanley Lief, founder of Champneys Spa, donated a house in London‚Äôs Hampstead as a new campus. This building, which is now named Frazer House and is Grade II-listed, is still the core of the BCOM campus. The college was renamed to the British College of Osteopathic Medicine in 2002.  Courses  BCOM currently provides the following degree pathways:  Masters in Osteopathy  This pathway also includes a Diploma in Osteopathy, which offers eligibility to register with the General Osteopathic Council. A four-year integrated masters, allowing direct entry for undergraduates which takes them to a Masters in Osteopathy and eligibility to professionally register in the UK. This course attracts public funding for eligible students for all four years.  BSc (Hons) Osteopathy for Diplomates (Conversion Course)  This degree is a conversion-to-degree course for already-registered Osteopaths. The first two courses also include a Diploma in Naturopathy. A BCOM graduate will normally be eligible for registration with both the General Osteopathic Council. BCOM also supports MPhil/Ph.D. study.  Clinics  BCOM operates an outpatient teaching clinic from its Frazer House site in Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead. The Clinic is served by both clinical students under either direct (pre-registration) or on-call (post-registration) supervision from experienced and registered osteopaths with a wide range of experience. Clinical experiential learning is a fundamental of osteopathic education. Frazer Clinic has 24 treatment rooms, a full clinic reception and a dedicated IT and seminar suite. Well established in the local community around BCOM‚Äôs Frazer House campus in Hampstead, Frazer Clinic is used for most of the clinical training undertaken by undergraduate students. Lief Clinic, also on campus, at the Lief House site, was inaugurated in 2004 as a research clinic. The Lief Clinic is normally staffed by postgraduate students and BCOM faculty members engaged in research. Before registering, UK osteopathy students take a Clinical Competence assessment. BCOM students have regularly achieved a 100% pass rate at first attempt, which is held to be best practice in the UK Osteopathic sector.

It is one of the suburbs of the Greater Springfield Development. At the , the suburb recorded a population of 3,524.  Geography  Brookwater is bordered by Bellbird Park to the north, Augustine Heights to the west, Springfield to the east, and Springfield Central in the south. History Brookwater was named and bounded in 2003. The Urban Development Institute of Australia judged Brookwater to be the best residential subdivision in 2006. Residential areas Brookwater is a mix of low-to-medium-density housing. Most blocks within it comprise more than each. The residential area is divided between three precincts: The Point (Gated), The Retreat, The Address and The Crest. The Point is a small exclusive gated community, sitting on one of the most elevated locations in Brookwater. Seven plots offer golf-front sites, nestled beside the 14th and 15th fairways of the golf course designed by Greg Norman. Homesites in The Point range in size from . The Point can be accessed through Canopy Court. The Address is surrounded by the 1st, 2nd & 3rd holes and practice fairway of the Brookwater championship golf course. The Retreat is a secluded area nestled on the elevated ridgeline and surrounded by natural tree lined gullies, off Ridgewood Drive. It is adjacent to the Sanctuary Rise Park. Homesites range from . The Crest precinct has 22 homesites ranging from . It is surrounded by Augusta Parkway, Forester Avenue and Crest Ride Parade. These houses have panoramic mountain views while also being close to parks, walking trails, schools, shops and public transport. Other areas Brookwater is approximately north of the Orion Springfield Central shopping centre and approximately north of a Woolworths shopping centre, restaurants and caf√©s. 45% of Brookwater has been safeguarded as green space and will never be built on.

It is known as calico aster, starved aster, white woodland aster, one-sided aster, and calico American-aster. Description Flowers of calico aster Growing to tall by wide, Symphyotrichum lateriflorum is a clump-forming herbaceous perennial with alternate, simple leaves on stiff, hairy, purplish stems. Small white or pale lilac composite flowers are borne in corymbs up to across in late summer and fall. Distribution Symphyotrichum lateriflorum is present in the United States in all states east of the Mississippi River, in those states on the west Mississippi River bank (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana), South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. It is also present in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service's PLANTS Database, in addition, records a presence in British Columbia. However, Flora of North America states that it was an ephemeral there that did not persist. It is native throughout its current range. NatureServe lists it as critically imperiled (S1) in Kansas. Taxonomy It was formerly included in the large genus Aster as Aster lateriflorus. However, this broad circumscription of Aster is polyphyletic, and the North American asters are now mostly classified in Symphyotrichum and several other genera. It is one of sixteen \\"bushy asters and relatives\\" within Symphyotrichum subsect. Dumosi as described by J.C. Semple. Infraspecies Neither J. C. Semple nor Catalogue of Life recognize infraspecies of S. lateriflorum. However, the following infraspecies for S. lateriflorum were circumscribed to by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service's PLANTS Database, NatureServe, and ITIS : * S. lateriflorum var. angustifolium ‚Äì narrow-leaved calico aster, present in Ontario, Canada, as well as the U.S. region of New England except Rhode Island, and in the states of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Wisconsin. NatureServe lists it as possibly imperiled (S2) in Kentucky. * S. lateriflorum var. flagellare ‚Äì present in Oklahoma and Texas. * S. lateriflorum var. horizontale ‚Äì present in all U.S. states east of the Mississippi River excluding Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana. Also present west of the Mississippi in Minnesota, Missouri, and Arkansas. NatureServe lists it as imperiled (S2) in New Jersey. * S. lateriflorum var. spatelliforme ‚Äì present only in Florida. * S. lateriflorum var. tenuipes ‚Äì slender-stalked calico aster. Present in North America only in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island, and in the U.S. states of Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. The autonym is S. lateriflorum var. lateriflorum . NatureServe lists it as critically imperiled (S1) in Nebraska in addition to Kansas. According to _Flora of North America_ , \\"[m]uch genetic and phenotypic variation is encountered within the complex; a thorough study is needed before a coherent taxonomy can be achieved.\\" Ecology The rust fungi Puccinia dioicae and Puccinia asteris occur on the leaves. Banded woolly bear caterpillars (Pyrrharctia isabella) eat the leaves. Numerous bees and wasps visit the flowerheads, including Andrena nubecula, Apis mellifera (non-native), Augochlora pura, Augochlorella aurata, Bombus impatiens, Lasioglossum coriaceum, Lasioglossum cressonii, Lasioglossum ephialtum, Lasioglossum imitatum, Lasioglossum versatum, Pseudopanurgus andrenoides, Pseudopanurgus compositarum, Cerceris kennicottii, Dolichovespula maculata, and Vespula maculifrons. The fly species Eristalis arbustorum, Eristalis dimidiata, and Toxomerus marginatus have been recorded visiting the flowers. Uses Like other asters, this plant is valued in gardens for providing late color after the main flowering season has finished.

It is a rhizomatous perennial plant, native to Western China. It has flowers which range from white to a soft lavender or pale blue in colour, with orange- yellow crests and purple dots. The plant's broad, shiny leaves are attached to bamboo-like stems. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description Iris confusa is similar in form to Iris japonica and Iris wattii. Iris confusa is larger than Iris japonica in all parts, with more attractive foliage. Compared to Iris wattii, it is smaller and has smaller flowers. I. confusa has stout, creeping rhizomes. They are short and bamboo- like.Simon Rickard It also has short stolons.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) On the upper side of the rhizome are various scars and the remains of last season's leaves. The plant has a creeping habit, eventually forming thick clumps.British Iris Society (1997) Jenny Hendy and Annelise Evans (Editors) This plant has 10 or more leaves that are grouped together as a fan-shape. Unlike, most irises, the foliage is held at the top of the bamboo-like stems, rather than basally, so it looks more like a palm. The sword-shaped, or strap-shaped, leaves are yellowish-green, to bright green, glossy on the upper side,} and glaucous on the underside. They are lighter in colour than Iris japonica leaves, and are normally thought to be evergreen. The leaves can grow to between tall and wide. They veins are not noticeable, and the leaves tend to flop over. It has flattened, (bamboo) cane- like stems,Holly Kerr Forsyth (Editor) that can grow up to between tall. It has 5‚Äì8 slender flower branches (or pedicels) near top of the plant. The stiff pedicels are 1.5‚Äì2 cm long. The stems can lie along the ground (after flowering) and can eventually produce roots, creating larger clumps of this plant. There are 4‚Äì6 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are generally membranous. They are 1.5 cm wide. The stems hold between 3 and 5 flowers, in spring and early summer, between April and May. In the UK, it can flower in early spring, if the plant is protected from freezing. The flowers are short lived, but since one large plant can have as many as 75 flowers, a continuous display can last for several weeks. The flowers are in diameter, and come in shades of soft lavender, to pale blue, to white.John Greenlee I. confusa has 2 sets of tepals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals, known as the 'standards'. The falls are elliptical, have a rounded outer portion (retuse), and have a wide limb (section of the petal closest to the stem); they are cm long and 1.5‚Äì2 cm wide. On the fall is a yellow or yellow-orange ridge (or crest). Surrounding the crest/ridge are orange-yellow, or pale mauve, or purple spots. The standards are broadly lanceolate and have a rounded top (retuse). They are 2.5 cm long and 1 cm wide. Both sets of tepals have wavy or scalloped edges. It has pale blue style branches, 2 cm long and 8mm wide, which have fringed lobes. The perianth tube is 1.5 cm long, enclosing 1.5 cm stamens, a 6mm ovary and yellow anthers. The plant produces an ellipsoid seed capsule, between May and July, cm long and 1‚Äì1.4 cm wide, with 6 visible ribs. Inside the ripened capsule are \\"D\\"-shaped, dark brown seeds. Genetics I. confusa is diploid, with 15 pairs of chromosomes. In 2009, a study was carried out on ten Iris species from China. Including Iris confusa, Iris japonica and Iris wattii. It was found that Iris japonica and Iris wattii, were more closely related to each other than to Iris confusa.  Taxonomy It is pronounced as (Iris) EYE-ris (confusa) kon-FEW- suh. It has the common name of 'bamboo iris'. It is written as ÊâÅÁ´πÂÖ∞ in Chinese script, and known as bian zhu lan in Pidgin in China. Bian zhu lan is translated into English as 'flat bamboo-orchid'. The Latin specific epithet confusa refers to confusus from ‚Äì uncertain, easily mistake and mingle.Sue Gordon (Editor) In 1911, William Rickatson Dykes obtained seeds from Pere Ducloux, a French missionary (1864-1945), who had found specimens of the iris in Yunnan. Dykes later compared the plants (he grew) in 1915, with specimens in the Kew Gardens Herbarium, and thought they were similar to Iris wattii, and so were a form of Iris wattii. Between 1924 and 1926, Dr. Stapf of Kew re- examined the specimens and concluded that they were more similar to Iris japonica. He died in 1933, without publishing his findings. In 1931, Major Lawrence Johnson found a specimen near Tengyeh, in Yunnan. It was looked at by Kew and realised to be a specimen of Iris wattii. It was first published and described by Joseph Robert Sealy in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1937. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003 and then updated on 2 December 2004. Iris confusa is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate regions of Asia. Range It is found in China, within the Chinese provinces, of Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Habitat It grows beside forests (and woods), in open groves, on hillside grasslands (and meadows), and in ditches. It can also be found growing on in the midst of rocks and scrub on sharp or steep slopes. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Cultivation It is hardy to between USDA Zone 9 ‚Äì Zone 11. It is thought hardy to ‚àí5C, it can be left outdoors in warm parts of the USA, such as California. It is also hardy to European Zone H4. In Britain (and some parts of Europe), it is classed as Tender, so can be grown in a pot and then over-winter in a cool greenhouse. In Australia, it can be grown beneath shrubs, used as frost protection. It can be grown in well-drained, light rich (containing humus) soils. It can tolerate neutral or acidic soils (PH levels between 6.5 ‚Äì 7.8). It slightly prefers acidic soils (including peat banks). It can tolerate positions between full sun and partial shade. It does prefer sites out of strong winds, due to the height of the plant and delicate flowers. It has average water needs during the growing season. But wet or damp conditions during the winter may cause the root to rot. It can be grown in a mixed flower border. Due to its shallow roots, the iris prefers a mulch of peat, well decayed leaf mould or similar. The mulch also helps with the frost protection as well. It can be also grown in containers, in sheltered positions. Such as a 30‚Äì35 cm wide pot, which is well drained and filled with ericaceous soils. It can be affected by slugs and snails. The stems and dead leaves should be removed after flowering to keep the plant tidy and help it, for next years growth. Then the stems should be removed to ground level. It is found in specialised iris nurseries, and plants can be seen growing within the temperate house at Kew. Propagation It can also be propagated by division or by seed growing. The division of the rhizomes should done after flowering, between September and November. It also can be propagated by stem cuttings. If the cuttings are immersed in water for between 1‚Äì2 weeks. The roots will soon emerge and the new plant can be potted, and prepared for the garden later. Better results are gained if the water, contains lumps of charcoal.

Hybrids and cultivars It has several named cultivars.

Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. Uses I. confusa is used within Yunnan as an ingredient in Chinese herbal medicines. Within the province of Guangxi, the Kam people of 'Gaoxiu Village', use the leaves (of the iris) for healing broken bones and sprains. The leaves are macerated and applied as a poultice, with a splint for supporting and immobilizing the affected area of the body. Plant healer, 'Yang Chang Jun' believes that Iris confusa is among the most valued medicinal plants for treating fractures and sprains. A patent in China, was made for Iris confusa medicinal tea, (made from the blue flowers of the iris), which is thought to help patients with acute tonsillitis, acute laryngopharyngitis, acute bronchitis, nephritis edema and urinary tract infections.

Early life  Wilson was born to Willie C. Wilson Jr and his wife Doris in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and had four brothers and one sister. He began playing trumpet at the age of nine, and attended O Perry Walker High School in Louisiana, going on to study at the New Orleans Center For Creative Arts (NOCCA) under the tutelage of Clyde Kerr Jr, Ronald Benko, Dr Burt Breaud, and band director Augustus Walker at O Perry Walker Sr High School. At 17, Wilson earned a music scholarship to Ohio Wesleyan University, where he studied classical trumpet with Larry Griffin, graduating with a bachelor's degree in music education. He then attained his master's degree at the world-renowned Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, studying jazz performance and composition with Ralph Alessi, Mike Cain, and Fred Sturm, and classical trumpet with Barbara Butler.  Career  After graduating from Eastman, Wilson moved to New York, where he started his own band ‚Äì the Abram Wilson Quintet ‚Äì as well as regularly performing with the Roy Hargrove Big Band and with rhythm and blues legend Ruth Brown, appearing on her Good Day for the Blues release in 1999. Arriving in London in 2002, Wilson performed with the Julian Joseph Big Band before meeting the directors of Dune Records (the record label responsible for producing British Jazz artists such as Jazz Jamaica, Gary Crosby, Soweto Kinch and Denys Baptiste) and signing in 2003 to the label, where he regularly performed with his fellow label-mates as well as leading his own bands. From mid-2004, Abram worked in a secondary school in Walthamstow, London, where he taught music for a year until he could work more in his performing career and recording. In October 2004, Abram launched his career as a solo artist with the release of his debut album for Dune, Jazz Warrior (DUNECD011), to great critical acclaim. He was then commissioned by the Cheltenham Jazz Festival (under the Jerwood Rising Star Programme) and Birmingham Jazz to create an extended work for premiere at the Festival in 2006. This new work entitled Ride! ‚Äì Ferris Wheel To The Modern Day Delta (DUNECD016) was recorded and released on Dune in April 2007. In late 2011 he left Dune Records. In 2005 at Nashville's International Songwriting Competition Wilson won first prize in the jazz category for his composition \\"Monk\\". In his later project, Roll Jordan Roll - a tribute to the Fisk Jubilee Singers  he collaborated in 2007 with British gospel legend Nicky Brown and noted gospel historian Viv Broughton. Before his death he had been working on a composition and recording project based on the life of American pianist Philippa Schuyler. On June 9, 2012 Wilson at the age of 38 succumbed to colon cancer, having married his long-term partner Jennie (n√©e Cashman) the day before, Friday June 8, 2012.

The term may also be applied to the members who hold that position. The members holding the balance of power may guarantee their support for a government by either joining it in a coalition government or by an assurance that they will vote against any motion of no confidence in the government or will abstain in such a vote. In return for such a commitment, such members may demand legislative or policy commitments from the party they are to support. A person or party may also hold a balance of power in a chamber without any commitment to government, in which case both the government and opposition groupings may on occasion need to negotiate for that person's or party's support. Australia House of Representatives In the 1940 federal election of the 74 seats in the House of Representatives, the United Australia/Country Coalition won 36 seats, the Labor Party won 32, the Non-Communist Labor Party won 4, and there were two independents, leaving the United Australia government of Robert Menzies without a majority in the lower house. The Coalition continued in government with the support of the two independents. The following year, the Non-Communist Labor Party, a breakaway Labor faction associated with former New South Wales premier Jack Lang, was readmitted to the Labor Party, and after the removal of Menzies by his own party, the independents in Parliament switched their support to Labor, allowing Opposition Leader John Curtin to form a minority government until his landslide reelection in 1943. After the 2010 federal election of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives, both the Labor Party and the Liberal/National Coalition held 72 seats, and there was one Greens, one MP was a member of the National Party of Western Australia (which is not part of the Liberal/National Coalition), and four independents. After several weeks of negotiations, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard eventually retained power after signing separate confidence and supply agreements with the Greens and three of the independents. The agreements required the non-government party to support the government in a no-confidence motion and on supply bills, in return for the passage of some legislation, such as setting up an emissions trading scheme in the case of the Greens (see Gillard Government¬ßMinority government). The Labor minority government was able to govern for the full term of the house. Senate : The Senate, which serves as the nation's upper house and as a house of review, was established on the basis of ensuring that the smaller Colonies joining the Commonwealth were given equal representation, as required under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. Between 1901 and 1918, Senators were elected on a first past the post system, changing to each state voting as one electorate on a preferential system from 1918 until 1948. During this period, the majority party in the lower house also generally had a commanding majority in the Senate. Since 1949, Senators are elected on the basis of achieving a transferable quota in each State or Territory. In more recent years, this method of election has generally resulted in a multi-party mix. In the early years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, Senators were more inclined to vote along State lines, with some exceptions. The Senate has the power to reject, amend or defer bills passed by the lower house, thus obliging the government of the day to negotiate with minor parties in the Senate (or the opposition) in order to pass its legislation. The Australian Senate cannot directly bring down a government, though it can pass an indicative motion of no confidence and has the power to defer or block supply bills, as notoriously occurred in the constitutional crisis of 1975 which was precipitated, in part, by the deferment of supply through a manipulated balance of power. Canada Compared to other Westminster Systems, minority governments are far more common in Canada. Much of this is credited to the relatively uneven electoral demographics of the country, with most national parties relying on regional bases. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, minority Parliaments were quite common in Canada, and produced many subsequent political compromises through political cooperation, mostly between the Liberal Party of Canada and the New Democratic Party of Canada, which included the Canada Pension Plan and Universal Healthcare during the tenure of Lester B. Pearson. After the 1980 election, minority governments became less common in Canada for the next several decades, but the 2004 general election returned Canada to minority government, and the subsequent general elections of 2005‚Äì06 and 2008 would also result in minority governments, but the 2011 general election gave Stephen Harper's Conservatives a clear majority in the House of Commons for the first time since the merging of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance. Despite the frequency of minority governments, however, coalitions are rare to nonexistent in Canadian democracy, especially in federal politics, and especially in the modern era. A notable exception was the political crisis that arose during the 2008‚Äì09 Canadian parliamentary dispute, in which the three opposition parties attempted to form a coalition government to oust the Conservative Party of Canada, which held a minority mandate in the House of Commons. This coalition failed, however, due to Governor-General Micha√´lle Jean's resulting prorogation of Parliament until January 2009. At the provincial level, by contrast, coalitions have governed in the provincial Parliaments of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and British Columbia. Sweden With Sweden having proportional representation, small parties in the centre of politics often have vast influence over government formation, such as in the 2014 and 2018 election cycles, where the original coalitions could not form majorities in the Riksdag and bipartisan agreements were formed in bids to deny the Sweden Democrats the balance of power that was apparent by both election results. In 2018, the Social Democrats entered a pact with two centrist parties. This required the government to go against several key promises from the campaign regarding no tax cuts for high-income earners due to the coalition lacking a majority to stay otherwise. The Sweden Democrats voted for opposition budgets after both elections, leaving the leftist government to govern on right-leaning financial terms for the first halves of 2015 and 2019. Under the previous bloc-dominated politics, the balance of power was less flexible, with the smallest party of the governing bloc usually holding the balance of power courtesy of close elections. United Kingdom The normal UK response to a \\"hung\\" or \\"balanced\\" parliament is the formation of a minority government. Coalitions or even formal agreements by one party to support the government of another party are rare. 1847‚Äì1852 Conservative 325, Whig and Radical 292, Irish Repeal 36, Irish Confederate 2, Chartist 1. Total seats 656. The 1847 United Kingdom general election produced a House of Commons in which no group had a clear majority. Candidates calling themselves Conservatives won the largest number of seats. However, the split among the Conservatives between the majority of Protectionists, led by Lord Stanley, and the minority of free traders, known also as the Peelites, led by former prime minister Sir Robert Peel, left the Whigs, led by prime minister Lord John Russell, in a position to continue in government. The Irish Repeal group won more seats than in the previous general election, while the Chartists' Feargus O'Connor gained the only seat the party would ever hold. 1885‚Äì1886 Liberal 319, Conservative 249, Irish Parliamentary Party 86, Others 16. Total seats 670. As a result of the 1885 United Kingdom general election there was no single party with a majority in the House of Commons. The Irish Nationalists, led by Charles Stewart Parnell had the balance of power. The Conservative minority government (led by the Marquess of Salisbury), which had come to office earlier in the year after the Parnellites and dissident Liberals had defeated the Liberal government of W.E. Gladstone, improved its position in the election but not sufficiently to obtain a majority. During the general election Parnell had called on Irish voters in Britain to vote Tory (i.e. Conservative). However, as Gladstone was willing to propose a measure of Home Rule for Ireland which Salisbury opposed, Parnell decided to bring down the Conservative ministry when the new parliament met. A Liberal minority government came into office in January 1886. 1892‚Äì1895 Conservative and Liberal Unionist 313, Liberal 272, Irish Nationalists 81, Others 4. Total seats 670. The situation was similar to that in 1885‚Äì86. Following the 1892 United Kingdom general election, although the Irish Nationalists were split between pro and anti-Parnellite factions, they all still preferred the pro- Home-Rule Liberals to the anti-Home-Rule Unionists of Salisbury. The Conservative government was defeated early in the new parliament and Gladstone formed a new Liberal minority government. 1910‚Äì1915 January 1910 United Kingdom general election Liberal 274, Conservative and Liberal Unionist 272, Irish Nationalists 82, Labour 40, Other 2. Total seats 670. December 1910 United Kingdom general election Liberal 272, Conservative and Liberal Unionist 271, Irish Nationalists 84, Labour 42, Other 1. Total seats 670. The Liberal government of H.H. Asquith continued in office as a stable minority administration. Despite strains, both the Irish and Labour members preferred a Liberal government to a Conservative one. This continued to be the case until Asquith formed a Liberal-Conservative-Labour coalition to prosecute the First World War. 1923‚Äì1924 1923 United Kingdom general election Conservative 258, Labour 191, Liberal 158, Others 8. Total seats 615. The 1923 general election led to the defeat of the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin. The Labour Party of Ramsay MacDonald formed a minority government in January 1924. Although the party with the balance of power (Asquith's Liberals) appeared to be in a very strong position, the Labour leaders made a deliberate decision not to reach any agreement with the Liberals. As the Liberal Party did not want to join forces with the Conservatives and could not afford a quick general election, they were left in the awkward position of having to vote with the government on measures they had not been consulted about. The Labour government eventually fell when, in a debate about alleged political interference in a decision whether to prosecute a Communist newspaper editor, the Conservative Party abandoned its own motion and voted for a Liberal one which thus passed and caused the resignation of the Labour government. 1929‚Äì1931 1929 United Kingdom general election Labour 287, Conservative 260, Liberal 59, Others 9. Total seats 615. The situation was similar to 1923‚Äì1924. However the Labour Party was the largest party in the House of Commons, so the Liberals (now led by David Lloyd George) could abstain without bringing down the new Labour minority government. As the world economic situation worsened, MacDonald had some discussions with Lloyd George. These led to a government bill to introduce the Australian style alternative vote electoral system. This measure was being obstructed by the Conservative Party and dissident Labour politicians and had not become law before the Labour government fell. A National government was formed, in 1931, with the support of a part of the Labour Party and Conservative and Liberal leaders. February‚ÄìOctober 1974 February 1974 United Kingdom general election Labour 301, Conservative 297, Liberal 14, Others 23. Total seats 635. This election led to the Conservative government of Edward Heath losing its majority, with Harold Wilson's Labour Party winning four more seats. However no two parties (other than Conservative and Labour) could jointly provide a majority in the House of Commons. The balance of power was held jointly by the Liberals and others (Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party, with the Northern Irish members)‚Äîwho were unlikely to act together. Heath entered into discussions with the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. No agreement was reached, mostly because Heath was not prepared to agree to electoral reform. Also, the Liberals were not keen to support a government which had just lost an election (although it did narrowly win the popular vote). In any event, a Conservative-Liberal coalition would have been a minority government and would have needed the support of the Ulster Unionist Party (which had recently broken with the Conservatives) to command a bare majority of seats. Heath resigned and Wilson then formed a minority government. 2010‚Äì2015 2010 United Kingdom general election Conservative 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57, Others 29. Total seats 650. This election led to David Cameron's Conservative Party being the largest party with no majority. The balance of power was held jointly by the Liberal Democrats and others (the Green Party, Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party, with the Northern Irish members)‚Äîwho were unlikely to act together. Labour incumbent Gordon Brown and Cameron announced their intentions to enter discussions with the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, open to signing a deal to allow a government to be formed. Having stated before the election that the party with the largest number of seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour were also held, but Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a stumbling block to formulating a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. Thus, Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September 2010. With Labour attempting to form its own coalition government, the Conservatives promised the Liberal Democrats a referendum on changing the voting mechanism to the Alternative Vote (AV) system. In response Labour said that they would introduce AV then hold a referendum asking the public to approve it. However, by 11 May, the possibility of a Lib-Lab deal was looking unlikely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding that he would not be able to form a government, Gordon Brown announced his resignation on the evening of 11 May. Cameron became Prime Minister and announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. As one of his first moves, Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Later that day, the two parties jointly published the Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement specifying the terms of the coalition deal.

He worked in the final quarter of the 5th century BC. The Eretria Painter is assumed to have been a contemporary of the Shuvalov Painter; he is considered one of the most interesting painters of his time. Many of his best works are painted on oinochoai and belly lekythoi. His paintings often depict many figures, moving in groups across all available surfaces. He also painted such vessels as figure-shaped vases or head-shaped kantharoi. Even as the vase shapes he painted on are unusual, his themes are conventional: athletes, satyrs and maenads, and mythological scenes. There are also some careful studies of women. He also painted white-ground vases. A lekythos in New York shows a funeral scene, typical of white-ground painting: Achilles is mourning Patroclus; the nereids bring him new weapons. The Eretria Painter's drawing style influenced later artists, e.g. the Meidias Painter and his school.  Bibliography  *John D. Beazley. Attic Red Figure Vase Painters (2nd edition).

Plot Bette Davis and Pat O'BrienWhen orphaned Jimmy Mason is taken in by his Aunt Emma and Uncle Henry, he meets their boarder, Matt Kelly, who impresses the young man with his boastful swagger and alleged political connections, although in reality he's a bootlegger. The boy's life is disrupted when, as one of Kelly's hired hands, he refuses to identify his boss during a police raid and is sentenced to three years of hard labor in reform school, where he befriends a sickly boy named Shorty, who eventually is sent to solitary confinement. When Jimmy realizes his new pal is seriously ill and desperately needs medical attention, he escapes and goes to Kelly and Kelly's girl friend, Peggy Gardner, for help. Peggy contacts newspaper columnist Frank Gebhardt, who is anxious to expose the conditions at the state industrial school. The authorities find Jimmy at Gebhardt's office, but before they can apprehend him Kelly admits his involvement in the bootlegging operation and the boy is set free. He discovers Shorty has died, victimized by a corrupt system.

The term itself is largely a misnomer of its misapplication from geopolitics in the twentieth century (for example, the Cold War) and European politics in the nineteenth century involved, for example, in the assessment of the conditions of war following the Napoleonic campaigns across Europe (see Metternich) In confederations (decentralised federations), it is more likely that the balance of power will be in favour of the sub-national level of government (that is, states or provinces).

The famous Moore Street open-air fruit and vegetable market is Dublin's oldest food market. The market there is a famous landmark on the northside of the city. Easter Rising Irish Volunteers commanded by Patrick Pearse surrendered to British forces on 30 April 1916, from a terrace of houses on Moore Street at the end of the Easter Rising. Five of the seven signatories of the Irish Proclamation of Independence‚ÄîPatrick Pearse, James Connolly, Thomas Clarke, Joseph Plunkett, Sean MacDermott, and future leader Michael Collins‚Äîsurrendered from the terrace. Planning controversy From 1998 Dublin City Council planned to demolish the terrace in order to redevelop the area, but this was opposed by groups who held this terrace and the battlefield trail running from the GPO down Moore Lane and Henry Street and into Moore Street to be an important part of Irish history, some referring to the location as \\"Ireland's Alamo\\". The National Graves Association began its campaign in 2002 after being alerted to the removal of a commemorative plaque from the facade of no. 16 by concerned citizen Patrick Cooney, which led to setting up the \\"Save 16 Moore Street committee\\" in 2005. Numbers 14-17 Moore Street were declared a national monument in 2007, guaranteeing their retention. However, plans for a ‚Ç¨1.25 billion retail and residential scheme on nearby O'Connell Street, intended to be built by Joe O'Reilly (CE of the Chartered Land Group, which developed the Dundrum Town Centre), are controversial. At Easter Rising commemorations in April 2009, opponents of the scheme contended that it would involve major alterations to numbers 14-17 and pledged to challenge it at forthcoming public hearings. Objectors, including families of the signatories of the Irish Proclamation of Independence (all signatories were executed by the British in the fortnight after the Rising), have pledged to seek an EU ruling to preserve the terrace if the developer's plan to subsume it and Moore Lane into the planned mall surrounding the GPO is waved through by the Irish Government. In November 2012, the legal representative for relatives of the 1916 leaders told the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht that Chartered Land accepted that it does not have the money to build the development due to the developer's debts. In the meantime, the interior and exterior of the houses have reportedly deteriorated badly. In January 2013, a report by the Technical Group of Irish parliamentary representatives called for the Moore Street quarter to be saved and opposed the shopping mall plan In August 2015, Chartered Land proposed to swap Nos.14-17 (which had a preservation order on them since 2007) for Nos. 24-25, which were owned by the local authority. distributed leaflets and lobbied elected Councillors. Following strategic lobbying by the Save Moore Street Committee which included relatives of the 1916 executed leaders, the proposal was defeated by a large majority at a Dublin City Council meeting in November of that year. SMSFD continued in the broader campaign to save the quarter, including the street market, which it perceived as also being under threat and already under pressure and declining. In September of that year, the State agency NAMA sold Chartered Land's property assets to, vulture capitalists Hammerson (British) and Allianz (German).https://www.irishtimes.com/busines/commercial-property/nama-sells- off-o-reilly-s-property-debt-to-uk-and-german-investors-1.2370360 However, in March of that year it was announced in the media that the State had purchased Nos. 14-17 from Chartered Land for a total of ‚Ç¨4 million, and would be preparing a museum there in preparation for the centenary commemorations of the Rising in the following year. Although the acquisition by the State was welcome by most campaigners, the plan was opposed, since it would take place in the context of the demolition of the rest of the terrace and the building of the shopping centre around the four houses. In January 2016 the Save Moore Street Committee was monitoring the buildings on a daily basis and saw that demolition work was about to begin. Despite a continued campaign of trying to engage with the minister, legal action was triggered by campaigners. In tandem with the action the houses were occupied by protesters from a variety of political backgrounds and held for five days. A long time Save Moore Street campaigner, Colm Moore, supported by the committee and \`1916 relatives took a number of legal challenges on State decisions regarding the street to the High Court. Justice Max Barrett gave an interim order that no demolition take place until the case had been heard and the occupiers left the building. Subsequently, after hearing heavy machinery at work within the buildings and the refusal of the Minister of Heritage to permit independent inspection of the work, refusing access to a delegation of members of the Irish parliament and the Lord Mayor of Dublin, activists of the Save Moore Street 2016 campaign group, which had arisen out of the occupation, blockaded the site and prevented building workers gaining access. The blockade was maintained for almost six weeks and was lifted only with the delivery of the Barrett judgement. On 18 March, having heard the case of Mr. Moore and the State's defence, Justice Barrett declared that not only the whole terrace but the surrounding street and lanes constituted a national historic 1916 Battleground.https://www.irishtimes.com/.../surprise-moore-street-judgment- leaves-government-in-a-quan‚Ä¶ The Minister of Heritage, Heather Humphreys, with the support of the Government cabinet, lodged an appeal against this decision, the hearing of which was scheduled for late December 2017. The SMS2016 campaign group has also organised a number of public events. Campaigners and traders have claimed that the street market is being run down, with campaigners claiming this is a deliberate policy of convergency of interests of property speculators, vulture capitalists, some Dublin City Council officials and the Government. In popular culture Moore Street market is shown in the 2014 film Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie. The title character of Mrs. Brown is shown to run a family-owned market, passed down from eldest daughter since 1802. The market comes under threat from developers who wish to turn the street into a giant shopping centre. The street is also the subject of the best-selling book Moore Street - The Story of Dublin's Market District by historian Barry Kennerk. Kennerk demonstrates that Moore Street was once just part of a larger commercial area. His work is the first to recount the entire history of street-trading in the locality since the eighteenth century, taking in thoroughfares that are now covered by the Ilac Centre shopping complex. These included Little Denmark Street, Cole's Lane, Anglesea Market and Riddell's Row.Kennerk, Barry (Mercier Press, 2012). Moore Street: The Story of Dublin's Market District. On 3 February 2013, the Irish Independent remarked that although Kennerk welcomes plans to acknowledge the part that Moore Street played during the 1916 Rising, its rejuvenation as a battlefield historical quarter should not come at the expense of the area's \\"soul\\". A broader interpretation of the Casual Trading Act (1995) could facilitate a more viable business model - one that allows traders to engage in the sale of craft goods and finished food products, thus helping to ensure the market's protection as a cultural treasure. Part of Kennerk's vision for the area also includes moving the 'footprint' of the market east into Moore Lane and Henry Place with lock-up facilities and garages turned into businesses, thus helping to recreate a sense of the market district that once existed prior to the 1970s. It could become the Camden Market of Dublin.'Battle lines are being drawn over the fate of Ireland's Alamo', Irish Independent. Retrieved 3 February 2013.

The exact cause is unknown, although it is logical to assume it is from faulty innervation of eye muscles.  Presentation  The eye drifts upward spontaneously or after being covered. The condition usually affects both eyes, but can occur unilaterally or asymmetrically. It is often associated with latent or manifest-latent nystagmus and, as well as occurring with infantile esotropia, can also be found associated with exotropias and vertical deviations. DVDs are usually controlled from occurring with both eyes open, but may become manifest with inattention. Usually some level of dissociative occlusion is required - to trigger the brain to suppress vision in that eye and then not control a DVD from occurring. The level of dissociative occlusion required may involve using a red filter, a darker filter or complete occlusion (e.g. with a hand). Onset DVD typically becomes apparent between 18 months and three years of age, however, the difficulties of achieving the prolonged occlusion required for accurate detection in the very young make it possible that onset is generally earlier than these figures suggest.  Mechanism  Dissociation refers to the situation where the innervation of one eye causes it to move involuntarily and independently of the other eye. Usually both eyes work together as described by Hering's and Sherrington's laws of innervation. A DVD is a slow upward and sometimes temporal movement of one eye, with cortical suppression of the vision in that eye while it is deviated. On returning downward and possibly inward to take up fixation, the DVD slow movement will be reversed. The dissociative movement seen 'objectively' should not be confused with the dissociation that occurs 'subjectively' - as when the brain begins to not visualise both images simultaneously (by ignoring or suppressing vision in that eye). Diagnosis A test called the Bielschowsky Darkening Wedge Test can be used to reveal and diagnose the presence of dissociated vertical deviation, although any (or no) amount of dissociative occlusion may also prompt it to occur. The patient is asked to look at a light. One eye is covered and a filter is placed in front of the other eye. The density or opacity of this filter is gradually increased, and the behaviour of the eye under the cover (not of the eye beneath the filter) is observed. Initially, if DVD is present, the covered eye will have elevated, but as the filter opacity is increased the eye under the cover will gradually move downwards. This Bielschowsky phenomenon is present in over 50% of persons with prominent DVD, all the more if the DVD is asymmetric and amblyopia is present as well. The Bielschowsky phenomenon is also present in the horizontal plane in patients with prominent DHD (dissociated horizontal deviation).  Differential diagnosis  DVD is often mistaken for over-action of the inferior oblique extra-ocular muscles. DVD can be revealed on ocular movement testing when one eye is occluded by the nose on lateral gaze. This eye will then elevate, simulating an inferior oblique over action. However, in a unilateral case, overaction of the superior rectus muscle in the unaffected dominant eye, can also be a causing factor as well as causing a V pattern exophoria.  Treatment  Management of this condition is surgical and typically involves reducing the strength of the superior rectus muscle or anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle of the affected eyes. Several different surgical procedures exist for the correction of DVD including: inferior oblique anteriorization, inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection, superior rectus recession, superior rectus recession plus posterior fixation suture, and inferior oblique myectomy, though there is insufficient evidence to determine which procedure results in the best outcomes for patients.

The term was also used to distinguish \\"clean-blooded\\" Christians from Christians who descended from Muslim families ‚Äì although the overwhelming majority of Spain's Muslims were themselves descendants of native Iberians who converted to Islam under Muslim rule. After the expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497, all the Jewish population in Iberia became officially Christian. The New Christians were always under suspicion of apostasy. The creation of the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 and the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536 was justified by the need to fight heresy. It was believed that many New Christians were practicing their original religion in secret and large numbers were Crypto-Jews. The term was thus introduced in order for \\"Old Christians\\" to distinguish themselves from the converts (conversos) and their descendants, who were seen as potential heretics and threats to Catholic orthodoxy. New Christians of Muslim heritage were referred to pejoratively as moriscos, meaning Moor-like. Those of Jewish heritage were termed marranos (swine, pigs). The system and ideology of cleanliness of blood ostracized New Christian minorities from society, regardless of their actual degree of sincerity as converts, giving far more privileges to Old Christians, the majority of the population. In Portugal, the legal distinction between New and Old Christian was ended through a legal decree issued by the Marquis of Pombal in 1772.

Examples Examples of quadratic residue codes include the (7,4) Hamming code over GF(2), the (23,12) binary Golay code over GF(2) and the (11,6) ternary Golay code over GF(3). Constructions There is a quadratic residue code of length p over the finite field GF(l) whenever p and l are primes, p is odd, and l is a quadratic residue modulo p. Its generator polynomial as a cyclic code is given by :f(x)=\\\\prod_{j\\\\in Q}(x-\\\\zeta^j) where Q is the set of quadratic residues of p in the set \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,p-1\\\\\\\\} and \\\\zeta is a primitive pth root of unity in some finite extension field of GF(l). The condition that l is a quadratic residue of p ensures that the coefficients of f lie in GF(l). The dimension of the code is (p+1)/2. Replacing \\\\zeta by another primitive p-th root of unity \\\\zeta^r either results in the same code or an equivalent code, according to whether or not r is a quadratic residue of p. An alternative construction avoids roots of unity. Define :g(x)=c+\\\\sum_{j\\\\in Q}x^j for a suitable c\\\\in GF(l). When l=2 choose c to ensure that g(1)=1. If l is odd, choose c=(1+\\\\sqrt{p^*})/2, where p^*=p or -p according to whether p is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4. Then g(x) also generates a quadratic residue code; more precisely the ideal of F_l[X]/\\\\langle X^p-1\\\\rangle generated by g(x) corresponds to the quadratic residue code. Weight The minimum weight of a quadratic residue code of length p is greater than \\\\sqrt{p}; this is the square root bound. Extended code Adding an overall parity-check digit to a quadratic residue code gives an extended quadratic residue code. When p\\\\equiv 3 (mod 4) an extended quadratic residue code is self-dual; otherwise it is equivalent but not equal to its dual. By the Gleason‚ÄìPrange theorem (named for Andrew Gleason and Eugene Prange), the automorphism group of an extended quadratic residue code has a subgroup which is isomorphic to either PSL_2(p) or SL_2(p).  Decoding Method  Since late 1980, there are many algebraic decoding algorithms were developed for correcting errors on quadratic residue codes. These algorithms can achieve the (true) error-correcting capacity ‚åä(d ‚àí 1)/2‚åã of the quadratic residue codes with the code length up to 113. However, decoding of long binary quadratic residue codes and non-binary quadratic residue codes continue to be a challenge. Currently, decoding quadratic residue codes is still an active research area in the theory of error- correcting code.  References  *F. J. MacWilliams and N. J. A.

Percent of women in the workforce among all women aged 20‚Äì64 years in the European Union in 2011 February 2013 Proportion of women in senior and middle management positions (2017) Since the industrial revolution, women have increasingly participated in the workforce outside of the home in industrialized nations, with particularly large growth seen in the 20th century. Largely seen as a boon for industrial society, women in the workforce contribute to a higher national economic output as measure in GDP as well as decreasing labor costs by increasing the labor supply in a society. Women's lack of access to higher education had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like law and medicine was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, Cambridge University only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate. Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, the labor market shifted. Office work that does not require heavy labor expanded, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term careers rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs. The increasing rates of women contributing in the work force has led to a more equal disbursement of hours worked across the regions of the world. However, in western European countries the nature of women's employment participation remains markedly different from that of men. Although access to paying occupations (the \\"workforce\\") has been and remains unequal in many occupations and places around the world, scholars sometimes distinguish between \\"work\\" and \\"paying work\\", including in their analysis a broader spectrum of labor such as uncompensated household work, childcare, eldercare, and family subsistence farming. In 2019 around 74.6 million of around 123 million women age 16+ in America are working or looking for work.  Areas of study  As the Civil War raged in the U.S., Virginia Penny of Louisville, Kentucky was finished her research project and published the ground-breaking 1862 book, How women can make money married or single, in all branches of the arts and sciences, professions, trades, agricultural and mechanical pursuits.How women can make money married or single, in all branches of the arts and sciences, professions, trades, agricultural and mechanical pursuits (Philadelphia, 1862) Hoping to offer hard facts about what women in the workforce would encounter, Penny had interviewed thousands of employers, using both a survey via the postal mail and in person ‚Äì when she would also interview workers. Many of her site visits were in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. She distilled her research to list over 500 jobs that were open to women as well as the information about the jobs and potential availability for women. She also indicated when employers offered their reasons for wage differentials based on gender. She dedicated her book \\"to worthy and industrious women in the United States, striving to earn a livelihood\\", and the book garnered much attention from reviewers and scholars across the country. She sold her rights to the book to another publisher who put it out as an encyclopedia, The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work,The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work in 1863. It sold better once it was re-titled again in 1870 as How Women Can Make Money, Married or Single. In its several different versions, 36 editions were published between 1862 and 2006, and six editions of the adaptation in German (first published in 1867). In the twentieth century, division of labor by gender has been studied most systematically in women's studies (especially women's history, which has frequently examined the history and biography of women's participation in particular fields) and gender studies more broadly. Occupational studies, such as the history of medicine or studies of professionalization, also examine questions of gender, and the roles of women in the history of particular fields. Women dominate as accountants, auditors, and psychologists. In addition, modern civil rights law has frequently examined gender restrictions of access to a field of occupation; gender discrimination within a field; and gender harassment in particular workplaces. This body of law is called employment discrimination law, and gender and race discrimination are the largest sub-sections within the area. Laws specifically aimed at preventing discrimination against women have been passed in many countries; see, e.g., the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in the United States.  Women and Economic Development  Women in informal employment as share of female employment in 2017. Global research clearly delineates the correlation between women's role in the economy and an increase in the standard of living. In the 2001 World Bank Report entitled, \\"Engendering Development,\\" the connection between women's involvement in the economy and growth is more clearly stated, \\"While disparities in basic rights; in schooling, credit, and jobs; or in the ability to participate in public life take their most direct toll on women and girls, the full costs of gender inequality ultimately harm everyone‚Ä¶ignoring gender disparities comes at a great cost‚Äîto people's well- being and to countries‚Äô abilities to grow sustainably, to govern effectively, and thus reduce poverty\\" (xi). Society's intrinsic value is often associated with contribution and production as a whole, thus women's inability to participate in economy further solidifies a subordinate role in society. \\"The fact that women have fewer opportunities in labor market may contribute to their unequal treatment in the household‚Ä¶Increased opportunities for women in the labor market do indeed translate into better outcomes for women‚Ä¶For the same increase in total household income, an increase in female income of 7 U.S. dollars per month translates into a 1 percentage point increase in the survival rate for girls\\" (Duflo 1057). Women are treated as less than men because their role in the home does not perpetuate survival of the family directly in terms of income. A stark realization of women's economic value in the eyes of under-developed countries is sex selective abortion rights and the alarming phenomenon of \\"missing women\\" (qtd. in Duflo 1051). What many societies fail to realize is that the trade-off to helping a woman instead of a man does not exist. When a woman is empowered with education and involvement in the economy everyone is better off. Women's economic involvement will drive up Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is a foundational standard for higher living. James Wolfensohn of the World Bank states, \\"Education for girls has a catalytic effect on every dimension of development: lower child and maternal mortality rates; increased educational attainment by daughters and sons; higher productivity; and improved environmental management. Together, these can mean faster economic growth and, equally important, wider distribution of the fruits of growth‚Ä¶ More education for girls will also enable more and more women to attain leadership positions at all levels of society: from health clinics in the villages to parliaments in the capitals. This, in turn, will change the way societies will deal with problems and raise the quality of global decision-making\\" (xi). Duflo, Esther. \\"Women Empowerment and Economic Development.\\" Journal of Economic Literature, 2012, 1051‚Äì1079, http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jel.50.4.1051. \\"Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice.\\" The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/ The World Bank. 2001. Oxford University Press.  Paid employment globally  This chart depicts the change in the percentage of women in three professional occupations (dentist, physician, lawyer), from 1970 to 2007. Women still contribute to their communities in many regions mainly through agricultural work. In Southern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa, only 20% of women work at paid non-agricultural jobs. Worldwide, women's rate of paid employment outside of agriculture grew to 41% by 2008. One of the main forms of paid employment for women worldwide is actually a traditional one, that of the market \\"hawker\\". Women have worked outside the home as vendors at markets since ancient times in many parts of the world, such as Central America, South Asia, and Africa. During the 20th century, the most significant global shift in women's paid employment came from the spread of global travel and the development of a large migrant workforce of women domestic workers seeking jobs outside of their native country. The Philippines is a major source of female domestic workers. Before the 1990s, the majority of Filipinos working outside the Philippines were male, but by 2012, an estimated 63% of Filipinos working overseas were female. Estimates of Filipino women working overseas are in the millions. Over 138,000 new domestic workers gained permission to work overseas in 2012, a number that grew 12% from the previous year. Overseas employment often results in the women leaving their own children behind in the Philippines to be cared for by relatives. Domestic employees from the Philippines and other countries have also been subject to exploitation and sex and money extreme abuse, for example in several countries in the Middle East, where they are often employed. It is estimated that remittances from overseas workers (both male and female) bring $1 billion (USD) per month to the Philippines. Workforce participation by sector Attendees at a computer business networking event for potential entrepreneurs, United State. A woman press photographer covers a music fest, Poland, 2008. Women and men often participate in economic sectors in sharply different proportions, a result of gender clustering in occupations. Reasons for this may include a traditional association of certain types of work with a particular gender. There is a wide range of other possible economic, social and cultural variables that impact the gender distribution in different occupations, including within a region or country. An averaging of statistics gathered by the United Nations for 2004 through 2007 reflects these differences (totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding): Sectoral distribution of employed persons, by sector and sex (2004 through 2007) More detailed statistics show large differences even within these regions. For example, 11% of employed women in East Asia are employed in agriculture, a number that rises to 55% in South Asia; 70% of women in Southern Africa are employed in the service sector, while in Eastern, Middle, and Western Africa this number is 26%. Occupational dissimilarity index Choice of occupation is considered to be one of the key factors contributing to the male-female wage differential. In other words, careers with a majority of female employees tend to pay less than careers that employ a majority of males. This is different from direct wage discrimination within occupations, as males in the female-dominated professions will also make lower than average wages and the women in the ]r for the wage differential to disappear. In 1960, the dimilarity index for the United Statnal Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) is established to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for women. In 1920 The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was formed to create equal rights and a safe workplace for women.Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.: Timeline of Events (1921‚Äì1979). In 1956 a group called Financial Women's Association (FWA), was formed. It is an orgadustry with special emphasis on the role and development of women, to attain greater recognition for women's achievements in business, and to encourage women to seek career opportunities in finance and business.\\"20 Women's Organizations You Need to Know\\", Diversity Best Practices, February 28, 2011. In 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by a group of feminists including Betty Friedan. The largest women's rights group in the U.S., NOW seeks to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.MacLean, Nancy. \\"The American Women's Movement, 1945‚Äì2000: A Brief History with Documents.\\" Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009. Founded in 1972, the National Association of Female Executives (NAFE) provides education, networking and public advocacy to empower its members to achieve career success and financial security. Members are women executives, business owners, entrepreneurs and others who are committed to NAFE's mission: the advancement of women in the workplace. Many of these organizations led to legal action and protecting women's rights as workers and empowered women in the workplace. Laws protecting women's rights as workers Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe and First Daughter and Advisor to the U.S. President Ivanka Trump attending the World Assembly for Women to discuss women's rights, Tokyo, 2017. International laws protecting women's rights as workers exist through the efforts of various international bodies. On June 16, 2011, the International Labour Organization (ILO) passed C189 Domestic Workers Convention, 2011, binding signatories to regulations intended to end abuses of migrant domestic workers. It was anticipated that the convention would put pressure on non- ratifying countries to support changes to their own laws to meet the change in international standards protecting domestic workers. Also in 2011, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a law preventing domestic workers from having residency rights granted to other foreign workers, a move that affected an estimated 100,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong. The ILO has previously ratified the Equal Remuneration Convention in 1951, which came into force in 1953, the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, which went into force in 1960 and the Maternity Protection Convention, 2000, which went into force in 2002. In 1966, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which went into force in 1976. UNESCO also adopted the Convention against Discrimination in Education in 1960, which came into force in 1962. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, went into force in 2003. The Home Work Convention, adopted by the ILO, went into force in 2000;the Convention protects the rights of persons doing paid work out of their home, which is frequently women workers. It offers equal protection regarding working conditions, safety, remuneration, social security protection, access to training, minimum age of employment, and maternity protection. Human trafficking often targets young women who are abducted and sent outside their own country to work as domestic workers, often in conditions of extreme exploitation. A number of international laws have been ratified to address human trafficking of women and children. Maternity protection measures are put in place to insure that women will not be discriminated against in the workplace once they return from having a child. They should also not be exposed to any health hazards while they are pregnant and at work. They are allowed time off for maternity leave as well, which allows them to bond with their child; this aspect of development is crucial for infants to gain proper attachment skills. Employers are expected to hold to these policies. Yet many women on maternity leave receive very small amounts of time off to allow for their health along with their babies' health. The amount of time allowed for maternity leave as well as the pay for maternity leave varies by country, with Sweden having the longest amount off with 68 weeks and the United States being one of the worst, with the typical period being 12 weeks without pay.Burn, S. M. (2005). Women across cultures: A global perspective. New York: McGraw-Hill. Women in workforce leadership An information technology networking social for potential entrepreneurs. New Delhi, India Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg, at a townhall Female decision- makers from around Europe are organized in several national and European wide networks. The networks aim to promote women in decision-making positions in politics and the economy across Europe. These networks were founded in the 1980s and are often very different from the \\"service clubs\\" founded in the early days of the century, like Soroptimist and Zontas. \\"Women in Management\\" is about women in business in usually male-dominated areas. Their motivation, their ideas and leadership styles and their ability to enter into leadership positions is the subject of most of the different networks. As of 2009, women represented 20.9% of parliament in Europe (both houses) and 18.4% world average. As of 2009, 90 women serve in the U.S. Congress: 18 women serve in the Senate, and 73 women serve in the House Women hold about three percent of executive positions. In the private sector, men still represent 9 out of 10 board members in European blue-chip companies, The discrepancy is widest at the very top: only 3% of these companies have a woman presiding over the highest decision-making body. List of members of the European Network of Women in Decision-making in Politics and the Economy: *Committee of Women Elected Representatives of Local and Regional Authorities (Council of European Municipalities and Regions) *BPW Europe, Business and Professional Women ‚Äì Europe *Association of Organisations of Mediterranean Businesswomen *Eurochambres Women's Network *European Platform of Women Scientists *Network of Parliamentary Committees for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union *European Network to Promote Women's Entrepreneurship *European Women's Lobby *European Women's Lawyers Association *CEE Network for Gender Issues *European Women Inventors and Innovators Network *European Women's Management Development International Network, EWMD *Femanet ‚Äì Eurocadres *European Professional Women's Network, EPWN *Women's Forum for the Economy and the Society The European Union Commission has created a platform for all these networks. It also funded the Women to the Top program in 2003‚Äì2005 to bring more women into top management. Some organizations have been created to promote the presence of women in top responsibilities, in politics and business. One example is EWMD European Women's Management Development (cited above), a European and international network of individual and corporate members, drawn from professional organisations. Members are from all areas of business, education, politics and culture. Women who are born into the upper class rather than the middle or lower class have a much better chance at holding higher positions of power in the work force if they choose to enter it. According to a study published 2015, of the women who held C-suite jobs in the U.S., 94% played competitive sports, 52% at a university level. Barriers to equal participation What percentage of the US public approves of working wives. As gender roles have followed the formation of agricultural and then industrial societies, newly developed professions and fields of occupation have been frequently inflected by gender. Some of the ways in which gender affects a field include: *Prohibitions or restrictions on members of a particular gender entering a field or studying a field *Discrimination within a field, including wage, management, and prestige hierarchies *Expectation that mothers, rather than fathers, should be the primary childcare providers Note that these gender restrictions may not be universal in time and place, and that they operate to restrict both men and women. However, in practice, norms and laws have historically restricted women's access to particular occupations;civil rights laws and cases have thus primarily focused on equal access to and participation by women in the workforce. These barriers may also be manifested in hidden bias and by means of many microinequities. Many women face issues with sexual abuse while working in agriculture fields as well. Many of the women who work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse in order to keep their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because the fact that they are documented will be brought up and may be deported. Access to education and training Maasai women at USAID literacy event A number of occupations became \\"professionalized\\" through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining regulatory bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular higher educational requirements. As women's access to higher education was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden access to Cambridge University until 1868, and were encumbered with a variety of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted an equal opportunity policy.University of Cambridge, \\"Fact Sheet: Women at Cambridge\\". Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but access to higher education remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries. Even where access to higher education is formally available, women's access to the full range of occupational choices is significantly limited where access to primary education is limited through social custom.UNICEF, State of the World's Children (2007) In low- and middle-income countries, vocational and business training program interventions are carried out with the aim of increasing employment, self-employment and income. A systematic review on vocational and business training for women in these regions summarized the evidence from thirty-five studies regarding the impacts of such training programs. The authors found that these types of programs have small positive effects on employment and income with variability across studies. They found that the effects of training may increase with a stronger gender focus of the program. Access to capital Governor of Bahia, Brazil, attending the first state women's business conference Women operating a cabinet manufacturing business, India Women's access to occupations requiring capital outlays is also hindered by their unequal access (statistically) to capital;this affects occupations such as entrepreneur and small business owner, farm ownership, and investor.\\"DEVELOPMENT: Gender Equality Equals Growth\\", World News, June 2, 2004, available at archive.org. Numerous microloan programs attempt to redress this imbalance, targeting women for loans or grants to establish start-up businesses or farms, having determined that aid targeted to women can disproportionately benefit a nation's economy.United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics. See Erwin Northoff, \\"FOOD: Women Farmers are Invisible Actors in Hunger Drama\\", World News, 2004 February 14. While research has shown that women cultivate more than half the world's food ‚Äî in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, women are responsible for up to 80% of food production ‚Äî most such work is family subsistence labor, and often the family property is legally owned by the men in the family. Discrimination within occupations Unemployment rate in women in 2017. The idea that men and women are naturally suited for different occupations is known as horizontal segregation.Massey, D. S. Categorically Unequal. New York: Russel Sage Foundation. Statistical discrimination in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company for a long period of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.Cabrera, E.F. Opting out and opting in: understanding the complexities of women's career transitions. Career Development International. 12, 218‚Äì237. Women continue to earn less money than men, despite establishing equal pay laws.UNICEF, State of the World's Children (2007), p. 41 (Figure 3.3 \\"Estimated earnings for women are substantially lower than for men\\");p. 36 (chapter 3). According to the textbook Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology, women are at a higher risk of financial disadvantage in modern-day society than men. Statistical findings suggest that women are under paid for similar jobs men complete despite having the same qualifications. The statistical data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor suggests that women are discriminated against in the workforce based on gender. The textbook reads, \\"Women's wages are also more volatile than men's wages, and women face a much higher risk of seeing large drops in income than do men\\" (Kennedy 2008). Anderson clearly demonstrates a significant difference between men and women in the workforce in regards to pay. Women are left more exposed to financial devastation and unemployment. The textbook also mentions that women are often given public positions versus private or leadership positions despite having appropriate work experience, higher education, or necessary skills to qualify. According to the Joint Economic Committee, \\"Among women heading families, the unemployment rate has grown and is higher than the national unemployment rate and twice as high as that for either married men or married women\\" (Joint Economic Committee, 2009). In other words, unmarried women who are the head of household are more vulnerable to financial disadvantage than married men or women. The unemployment rate of women compared to men suggests that single women are discriminated against based on gender. Anderson writes, \\"All women are disproportionately at risk in the current foreclosure crisis, since women are 32% more likely than men to have subprime mortgages (One-third of women, compared to one-fourth of men, have subprime mortgages; and, the disparity between women and men increases in higher income brackets)\\" (Anderson 265). The statistical information illustrates the dramatic difference between men and women in regards to finances. It can be inferred that men are favored in the workforce over women. Women are discriminated against based on their gender and thus are more likely to struggle financially because of discriminatory employers. Sex differentiation focuses on separating men and women in the workplace from different settings and duties, and it leads to the idea of sex segregation. Explanations for sex segregation fall under two main categories of cultural beliefs and men's efforts to preserve their advantages in the workplace. Cultural beliefs about gender and work emphasize sex stereotypes. Certain cultures value these sex stereotypes, assumptions about individuals based on sex, which leads to stereotype thinking about the genders. Jobs become labeled male or female when these sex stereotypes relate to the sexes. Cultural beliefs for sexes lays out the inequality at work women face. In Western and Eastern cultures, men are believed to be superior to women, leading to sex inequality in job duties, authority, and pay. Women are seen as requiring protection and care, and it takes away their opportunities at many jobs. Another explanation of sex inequality is that the dominant group will preserve their position, such as men's efforts to preserve their advantages in the workplace. If women are capable of taking on the duties of male dominated jobs, especially \\"macho\\" jobs, then men's masculinity will no longer be a requirement. Women gaining equality in the workforce threatens undermining men's privileges in any other realm they wish, such as authority, family, or political life. Sometimes the solution men choose is to try to drive the women out of the job. Actions and inactions of women themselves Through a process known as \\"employee clustering\\", employees tend to be grouped throughout the workplace both spatially and socially with those of a similar status job. Women are no exception and tend to be grouped with other women making comparable amounts of money. They compare wages with the women around them and believe their salaries are fair because they are average. Some women are content with their lack of wage equality with men in the same positions because they are unaware of just how vast the inequality is. Furthermore, women as a whole tend to be less assertive and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so. Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys are more likely to be pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that \\"winning is everything\\" is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.Spade, Joan Z. \\"Gender and Education in the US.\\" Gender Mosaics: Social Perspectives. Ed. Dana VannoyOxford University Press, 2000. An additional issue that contributes to income inequality by gender is that women are much more likely than men to take \\"breaks\\" in their careers to have children, often remaining out of the workforce for extended periods of time, while men in the same role or occupation (or other women who do not leave the workforce) most likely are continuing to earn promotions and/or merit-based salary increases. When a woman in this scenario re-enters the workforce, she may be offered a smaller salary or a lower position than she might have merited had she remained in the workforce alongside her colleagues (both male and female) who have not interrupted their careers.  Sex segregation  A form of discrimination in the workplace is sex segregation. Men and women are separated to do different tasks, same tasks in different settings or at different times. Historically, most men did agricultural work while women managed the household, however within time women eased their way into employment, but the segregation they experience remained. Males identify with the masculine identity and their authority are considered appropriate. Male dominated industries do not leave a chance for women to prove possible history in the role, leaving the job identified as a male way of working. Males masculine behavior undermine females in the workforce, and they are forced to endure it. Women's segregation in the workforce takes form of normative masculine cultural dominance. Men put on the image of macho physical toughness, limiting women in their careers. Women find themselves experiencing the concept of \\"doing gender\\", especially in a traditional masculine occupation. Women's standpoint of men's behavior sheds light on mobilizing masculinity. With the feminist standpoint view of gender in the workplace, men's gender is an advantage, whereas women's is a handicap. However, sex segregation can happen by women's and men's own choices of different occupations. Descriptive gender stereotypes emphasize the characteristics a woman possesses. The prescriptive component focuses on the beliefs about characteristics a woman should possess. The descriptive component is expected to lead to workplace discrimination, while the prescriptive component is expected to lead to discrimination against women. If women violate these prescriptions, they are more susceptible to disparate treatment. In other words, if a woman is able to perform a job that generally requires stereotypical male masculinity they receive the discrimination that punishes women for violating the prescriptions of feminine characteristics. Gender inequality by social class Mechanic working on a motorcycle, United States In the last 50 years there have been great changes toward gender equality in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the feminist movement of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right back out of the labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the baby boomers. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period. Effects on the middle and upper classes The addition of women into the workforce was one of the key factors that has increased social mobility over the last 50 years, although this has stalled in recent decades for both genders. Female children of the middle and upper classes had increased access to higher education, and thanks to job equality, were able to attain higher-paying and higher-prestige jobs than ever before. Due to the dramatic increase in availability of birth control, these high status women were able to delay marriage and child-bearing until they had completed their education and advanced their careers to their desired positions. In 2001, the survey on sexual harassment at workplace conducted by women's nonprofit organisation Sakshi among 2,410 respondents in government and non-government sectors, in five states recorded 53 percent saying that both sexes don't get equal opportunities, 50 percent of women are treated unfairly by employers and co-workers, 59 per cent have heard sexist remarks or jokes, and 32 percent have been exposed to pornography or literature degrading women. In comparison with other sectors, IT organisations may be offering equal salaries to women, and the density of women in technology companies may be relatively high, but this does not necessarily ensure a level playing field. For example, Microsoft (US) was sued because of the conduct of one of its supervisors over e-mail. The supervisor allegedly made sexually offensive comments via e-mail, such as referring to himself as \\"president of the amateur gynecology club.\\" He also allegedly referred to the plaintiff as the \\"Spandex Queen\\". E-harassment is not the sole form of harassment. In 1999, Juno Online faced two separate suits from former employees who alleged that they were told that they would be fired if they broke off their ongoing relationships with senior executives. Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet TV network, was sued in January 2000 after male employees referred to female employees as \\"bimbos\\" and forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet. In India, HR managers admit that women are discriminated against for senior Board positions and pregnant women are rarely given jobs but only in private. In addition to this, it has been suggested that there are fewer women in the IT sector due to existing stereotypes that depict the sector as male-orientated. In a recent book, Own It: Leadership Lessons From Women Who Do, author Aparna Jain interviewed 200 women in senior management and leadership positions in India about the problems they face at the workplace and noted that 86% of the women she spoke to experienced harassment in one form or the other. Among the issues she notes are bias, bullying, sexual harassment and the impact of motherhood on women's career. Recently a sexual harassment suit against a senior member shocked the Indian IT sector, as was the sexual harassment case against the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces' (Taj Group) CEO, Rakesh Sarna . A startling example of institutional mechanisms that allow for an unfettered environment for sexual harassment to fester is the Rajendra K. Pachauri scandal at The Energy and Resources Institute in India. Improvements in the education system could be the key to encouraging women to take up roles in this sector. Recognizing the invisible nature of power structures that marginalize women at the workplace, the Supreme Court in the landmark case Vaishaka versus High Court of Rajasthan (1997) identified sexual harassment as violative of the women's right to equality in the workplace and enlarged the ambit of its definition. The judgment equates a hostile work environment on the same plane as a direct request for sexual favors. To quote: \\"Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as: physical contact and advances; a demand or request for sexual favours; sexually coloured remarks; showing pornography; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature\\". The judgement mandates appropriate work conditions should be provided for work, leisure, health, and hygiene to further ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at the workplace and no woman employee should have reasonable grounds to believe that she is disadvantaged in connection with her employment. This law thus squarely shifts the onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies are yet to enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, \\"I have a few IT clients. When I point to the need for a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda.\\" An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: \\"I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company.\\" Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, \\"Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946.\\" As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace. Not surprisingly many cases go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company policy is the first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, \\"We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office\\", thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing \\"woman's purity\\", the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with \\"loose morals\\". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, \\"I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported.\\" The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan \\"It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and there is no guarantee that the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement.\\" Effects on the working class Women in lower wage jobs are more likely to be subject to wage discrimination. They are more likely to bring home far less than their male counterparts with equal job status, and get far less help with housework from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.Edin, K. and Kefalas, M. (2005). Promises I Can Keep: Why poor women put motherhood before marriage. Berkeley, California: University of California Press For the first time in the history of this country, there were distinctive socioeconomic stratification among women as there has been among men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy. Impact issues of female participation in the workforce A 2008 study published in the British Medical Journal[ found that women were 46% more likely to call in sick for short time periods than men and a third more likely than men to take short term sick leave. At 60 days or more, men and women were equal in terms of sick leave. Women in the workforce have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers to be able to take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work. Fertility Increased participation of women in the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this fertility factor effect to be strongest among women aged 20‚Äì39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well. International United Nations data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so., part of However, for countries in the OECD area, increased female labor participation has been associated with an increased fertility. Causality analyses indicate that fertility rate influences female labor participation and not as much the other way around. Regarding types of jobs, women who work in nurturing professions such as teaching and health generally have children at an earlier age. It is theorized that women often self-select themselves into jobs with a favorable work‚Äìlife balance in order to combine motherhood and employment. History 19th century Women have worked at agricultural tasks since ancient times, and continue to do so around the world. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries changed the nature of work in Europe and other countries of the Western world. Working for a wage, and eventually a salary, became part of urban life. Initially, women were to be found doing even the hardest physical labor, including working as \\"hurriers\\" hauling heavy coal carts through mine shafts in Great Britain, a job that also employed many children. This ended after government intervention and the passing of the Mines and Collieries Act 1842, an early attempt at regulating the workplace. During the 19th century, an increasing number of women in Western countries took jobs in factories, such as textile mills, or on assembly lines for machinery or other goods. Women also worked as \\"hawkers\\" of produce, flowers, and other market goods, and bred small animals in the working-class areas of London. Piecework, which involved needlework (weaving, embroidery, winding wool or silk) that paid by the piece completed, was the most common employment for women in 19th century Great Britain. It was poorly paid, and involved long hours, up to 14 hours per day to earn enough wages to survive. Working-class women were usually involved in some form of paid employment, as it provided some insurance against the possibility that their husband might become too ill or injured to support the family. During the era before workers' compensation for disability or illness, the loss of a husband's wages could result in the entire family being sent to a Victorian workhouse to pay debts. Inequality in wages was to be expected for women. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d. Employers stated they preferred to hire women, because they could be \\"more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men\\". Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable. The 1870 US Census was the first United States Census to count \\"females engaged in each occupation\\" and provides an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in sweatshops. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one- third of factory \\"operatives,\\" but teaching and the occupations of dressmaking, millinery, and tailoring played a larger role. Two-thirds of teachers were women. Women could also be found in such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), and hunter and trapper (2). 20th century In the United States, the \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" image, as it has become known, is an iconic representation of the US government's efforts to exhort women to work during World War II, and has been adapted numerous times to represent working women or, more broadly, women overcoming adversity and other proto-feminist messages. In the beginning of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such.Davis, R. L: \\"The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s\\", p.10. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1972, Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until the right man came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially.Davis, R. L: \\"The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s\\", p. 9. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. 1972. Yet at the turn of the 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women and a whole coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.Walker, R. H: \\"Life in the Age of Enterprise\\", pp. 120-121. Capricorn Books, 1971. Working at the Woolwich Arsenal, London, United Kingdom, 1917 In the United States, World War I made space for women in the workforce, among other economical and social influences. Due to the rise in demand for production from Europe during the raging war, more women found themselves working outside the home. In the first quarter of the century, women mostly occupied jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, \\"lace-collar\\" jobs.Green, E: \\"The Uncertainty of Everyday Life, 1915‚Äì1945\\", pp. 57-58. HarperCollins, 1992, In July 1920, The New York Times ran a head line that read: \\"the American Woman ... has lifted her skirts far beyond any modest limitation\\" which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling up their sleeves and skirts and making their way into the workforce. World War II created millions of jobs for women. Thousands of American women actually joined the military: 140,000 in the Women's Army Corps (United States Army) WAC; 100,000 in the Navy (WAVE); 23,000 in the Marines; 14,000 in the Navy Nurse Corps and, 13,000 in the Coast Guard. Although almost none saw combat, they replaced men in noncombat positions and got the same pay as the men would have on the same job. At the same time over 16 million men left their jobs to join the war in Europe and elsewhere, opening even more opportunities and places for women to take over in the job force. Although two million women lost their jobs after the war ended, female participation in the workforce was still higher than it had ever been. In post-war America, women were expected to return to private life as homemakers and child-rearers. Newspapers and magazines directed at women encouraged them to keep a tidy home while their husbands were away at work. These articles presented the home as a woman's proper domain, which she was expected to run. Nevertheless, jobs were still available to women. However, they were mostly what are known as \\"pink-collar\\" jobs such as retail clerks and secretaries. The propaganda to encourage women to return to the home is depicted in the film The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter. The Quiet Revolution Customer account operators working for a large photography firm, United States, 1945 A woman working as wait staff at a diner, United States, 1981 The increase of women in the labor force of Western countries gained momentum in the late 19th century. At this point women married early on and were defined by their marriages. If they entered the workforce, it was only out of necessity. The first phase encompasses the time between the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era gave birth to the \\"independent female worker.\\" From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, as we enter into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35‚Äì44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more \\"respectable\\", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of marriage bars, which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more participation in the work force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity. In the third phase, labeled the \\"roots of the revolution\\" encompassing the time from 1950‚Äì mid-to-late 1970s, the movement began to approach the warning signs of a revolution. Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and intermittent work force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a \\"career\\". To illustrate, most women were secondary earners, and worked in \\"pink-collar jobs\\" as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians. The sexual harassment experienced by these pink collar workers is depicted in the film 9 to 5. Although more women attended college, it was often expected that they attended to find a spouse‚Äîthe so-called \\"M.R.S. degree\\". Nevertheless, Labor force participation by women still grew significantly. The fourth phase, known as the \\"Quiet Revolution\\", began in the late 1970s and continues on today. Beginning in the 1970s women began to flood colleges and grad schools. They began to enter profession like medicine, law, dental and business. More women were going to college and expected to be employed at the age of 35, as opposed to past generations that only worked intermittently due to marriage and childbirth. This increase in expectations of long-term gainful employment is reflected in the change of majors adopted by women from the 1970s on. The percentage of women majoring in education declined beginning (oof) in the 1970s; education was once a popular major for women since it allowed them to step into and out of the labor force when they had children and when their children grew up to a reasonable age at which their mothers did not have to serve primarily as caretakers. Instead, majors such as business and management were on the rise in the 1970s, as women ventured into other fields that were once predominated by men. They experienced an expansion of their horizons and an alteration of what it meant to define their own identity. Women worked before they got married, and since women were marrying later in life they were able to define themselves prior to a serious relationship. Research indicates that from 1965 to 2002, the increase in women's labor force participation more than offset the decline for men. The reasons for this big jump in the 1970s has been attributed by some scholars to widespread access to the birth control pill. While \\"the pill\\" was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the age of majority had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely as a consequence of the Vietnam War; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a \\"big bang\\" revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.  Occupational safety and health  Women tend to have different occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, anxiety disorders, stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job- related stress may be due to the fact that women are often caregivers at home and do contingent work and contract work at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is homicide, which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women. Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries. Women are at lower risk for work- related death than men. However, personal protective equipment is usually designed for typical male proportions, which can create hazards for women who have ill-fitting equipment. Women are less likely to report an occupational injury than men. Research is ongoing into occupational hazards that may be specific to women. Of particular interest are potential environmental causes of breast cancer and cervical cancer. Sexual harassment is an occupational hazard for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including anxiety, depression, nausea, headache, insomnia, and feelings of low self- esteem and alienation. Women are also at higher risk for occupational stress, which can be caused by balancing roles as a parent or caregiver with work.

Such mnemonics have been considered by teachers to be an effective technique for schoolchildren to learn the complex rules of Latin accidence and syntax. One of their earliest uses was in the Doctrinale by Alexander of Villedieu written in 1199 as an entire grammar of the language comprising 2,000 lines of doggerel verse. Various Latin mnemonic verses continued to be used in English schools until the 1950s and 1960s. Authors who have borrowed Latin mnemonics from Latin textbooks for their own works include Thomas Middleton and Benjamin Britten. For example, in Britten's opera The Turn of the Screw, he used the words of a Latin mnemonic that he had found in a Latin grammar book belonging to Myfanwy Piper's aunt for Miles' \\"malo\\" song. Jacques Brel wrote a song in 1962 about a Latin mnemonic verse. Some mnemonics have been recited to hymn tunes.  History  Mnemonic rhymes have been considered by teachers to be an effective technique for schoolchildren to learn the complex rules of Latin accidence and syntax. One of the earliest uses of mnemonic verse to teach Latin was the Doctrinale by Alexander of Villedieu, which was an entire grammar of the language comprising 2,000 lines of doggerel verse produced in 1199. It was used as a standard Latin grammar textbook across Europe for three centuries, and continued to be used in Italy and other places until relatively recently. Apart from Terentianus Maurus' De litteris syllabis et metris Horatii, discovered at Bobbio in 1493, all ancient grammatical texts prior to the Doctrinale had been prose works, with the only verse therein being citations from Roman poets; although some, such as those by Petrus Helias and Paolo da Camaldoli, contain mnemonic verses. Critics of Alexander at the time considered it to be \\"a monstrous idea to squeeze an entire grammar into verses\\". The verse form of Doctrinale in fact arose by accident. Alexander had been employed by the bishop of Dol-de-Bretagne to teach Latin to his nephews, using the grammar of Priscian. He had noticed that the boys could not remember Priscian as prose, so he translated its rules into verse form. When Alexander was away one day, the bishop asked his nephews a grammar question, and was surprised when they answered in verse. The bishop persuaded Alexander to compile and to publish an entire book of such verses, which became the Doctrinale. Many grammarians adopted Alexander's innovation soon afterwards, including John of Garland (incidentally Alexander's harshest critic) who wrote grammatical treatises in verse, Simon di Vercelli (\\"Maestro Sion\\") who wrote Novum Doctrinale somewhere between 1244 and 1268 (it only being transcribed by one of his pupils when he died in 1290), and Everard de B√©thune who wrote Graecismus in 1212. From that point onwards, it was rare for a grammatical work to not at least contain the principal rules as mnemonic verses. Even the new humanistic grammars of the 15th century included mnemonic verses excerpted from Doctrinale or other versified grammars. This method of Latin grammar instruction was used by teachers well into the 20th century, it still being used in English schools in the 1950s and 1960s. Thomas Sheridan wrote several mnemonic poems, with the intention of helping students to remember various parts of Latin grammar, prosody, and rhetoric, which were published as An Easy Introduction of Grammar in English for the Understanding of the Latin Tongue and A Method to Improve the Fancy. One of the shorter ones is \\"Of Knowing the Gender of Nouns by Termination\\": > All nouns in a make Feminine, If you like \\"Musa\\" them decline, Except > they're from a Graecian line, Or by their sense are Masculine.  Examples and analysis  In his opera The Turn of the Screw, Benjamin Britten used the words of a Latin mnemonic that he had found in a Latin grammar book belonging to Myfanwy Piper's aunt for Miles' \\"malo\\" song: > MƒÅlo: I would rather be MƒÅlo: In an apple tree MƒÉlo: Than a naughty boy > MƒÉlo: In adversity The rhyme explains the Latin near-homonym sentence \\"malo malo malo malo\\", where each is a different meaning for one of the two words \\"mƒÅlo\\" and \\"mƒÉlo.\\" One of its functions is to remind students that the ablative of comparison does not employ a preposition and that the preposition typically employed with the ablative of place where is sometimes omitted (typically in verse). Thus \\"in an apple tree\\" can be rendered \\"malo\\", instead of the more common \\"in malo\\". Another author who borrowed from Latin grammar textbooks was Thomas Middleton. In his play A Mad World, My Masters the character Follywit addresses a treasure chest that he is about to rob: > Ha! Now, by my faith, a gentlewoman of very good parts: diamond, ruby, > sapphire, ‚Äôonyx cum prole silexque‚Äò. If I do not wonder how the quean > 'scaped tempting, I'm an hermaphrodite! The Latin phrase is a line taken from William Lily's Latin grammar Brevissima Institutio, from a mnemonic poem entitled \\"The Third Special Rule\\", the particular verse of which is entitled \\"Nouns of the doubtful Gender excepted\\": > Sunt dubii generis, cardo, margo, cinis, obex, Forceps, pumex, imbrex, > cortex, pulvis, adepsque: Adde culex, natrix, et onyx cum prole, sil√©xque; > Quamvis h√¶c meli√πs vult mascula dicier usus. The literal meaning of the phrase is \\"onyx with its compounds, and silex\\". Its use by Middleton is in fact a pun. It has both a surface meaning on the precious metals in the treasure chest and a deeper meaning, given the \\"doubtful gender\\" title of the verse, on Follywit's own cross-dressing. A Latin rhyme for remembering the list of Latin prepositions that take the ablative case is given by William Windham Bradley: > A, ab, absque, coram, de, palam, clam, cum, ex, et e, sine, tenus, pro, et > prae; His super, subter, addito, et in, sub, si fit statio. John Barrow Allen translated it into English as follows: > A (ab), absque, coram, de, palam, clam, cum, ex, or e, sine, tenus, pro, and > prae. And unto these, if rest at be intended, Let in, sub, super, subter be > appended. Another version, taught in the 1950s, was :- > A (ab), absque, coram, de, palam, clam, cum, ex, and e, sine, tenus, pro, > and prae. Add super, subter, sub, and in, When STATE not MOTION 'tis they > mean. https://archive.org/details/KennedysShorterLatinPrimer (Page 109) - > This is the one I was taught. A longer companion verse for the accusative case ended with the line When MOTION 'tis, not STATE they mean. A condensed version is SIDSPACE. Such a mnemonic is a simple collection of words, and the musical rhythm acts as an aid to memory. Thomas Thornely asked \\"whose heart has not been stirred in early youth by the solemn chant\\" of this mnemonic, saying that \\"in this meaningless collocation of syllables we seem to hear the low rumbling of thunder of the Dies Irae and are naturally led to contrast it with the light tripping of the banded prepositions that favour the accusative\\". A similar example is the rosa mnemonic, used by French schoolchildren, which is simply the first declension: > rosa rosa rosam rosae rosae rosa rosae rosae rosas rosarum rosis rosis Jacques Brel's 1962 song about this calls it \\"le plus vieux tango du monde\\" (the world's oldest tango) which fair-haired youngsters \\"√Çnonnent comme une ronde En apprenant leur latin\\" (drone like a round whilst learning their Latin). Mnemonic rhymes have sometimes failed. Jean-Jacques Rousseau once complained of \\"those Ostrogothic verses that made me sick to my heart and could not get into my ear\\". Other children regarded the mnemonics more favourably, setting them to familiar tunes. Edward Hornby would recite the following, which he described as \\"little pearls of poetry\\", to the tune of the hymn \\"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\\": > Third Nouns Masculine prefer Endings o, or, os and er, add to which the > ending es, if its Cases have increase. Many neuters end in er, siler, acer, > verber, ver, tuber, uber, and cadaver, piper, iter, and papaver. Third Nouns > Feminine we class ending is, x, aus, and as, s to consonant appended, es in > flexion unextended.  Classical authors' use  In addition to those learning Latin as a foreign language, classical authors and orators were themselves fond of mnemonics, using both metre and rhyme to mnemonic effect. Examples of this include \\"mox nox\\" (\\"soon night is approaching\\"), \\"mone sale\\" (\\"advise with salt\\"‚Äîi.e. give it with a pinch of salt), and \\"nec habeo, nec careo, nec curo\\" (\\"I have not; I want not; I care not.\\"). One tongue twister used in Latin literature is \\"mala mali malo mala contulit omnia mundo\\" (\\"man's jaw and an apple brought all evils into the world\\").  Footnotes  * Note 1: There were 46 editions printed in Italy alone before 1500. Its use died out in German schools around 1520, but the last Italian edition was published in 1588. * Note 2: A longer sentence is \\"malo malo malo malo malo malo malo, quam dente vento occurrere\\". This uses additional meanings for \\"malo\\" and translates to \\"I would rather meet with a bad apple, with a bad tooth, than a bad mast with a bad wind.\\".

It is an autobiographical piece, in which White sings of his experience at the infamous Mississippi State Penitentiary, known as Parchman Farm. Jazz pianist-vocalist Mose Allison adapted it for his own \\"Parchman Farm\\" and \\"New Parchman\\", which are among his most popular songs. Numerous artists have recorded their own renditions, usually based on Allison's songs. Background Early in his recording career in 1937, Bukka White was arrested and convicted for a shooting incident and was sentenced to Parchman Farm prison in rural Sunflower County, Mississippi. The institution was operated as a hard-time prison labor work farm, which was notorious for its harsh conditions and use of the trusty system. His recording of \\"Shake 'Em On Down\\" became a hit while he was there and as a result, White became somewhat of a celebrity at the prison. While incarcerated, he recorded two songs for John Lomax, who was conducting field recordings for the Archive of Folk Culture at the U.S. Library of Congress. When White was released two and one-half years later in 1940 (the circumstances of his early release have been questioned), he resumed his recording career with producer Lester Melrose in Chicago. Lyrics and style In March 1940, White arrived at the recording studio prepared to record with several songs. When Melrose saw that they were mostly reworkings of current popular blues numbers, he encouraged White to take a couple of days and prepare some new material. White later recalled, \\"I got down to it\\" and returned on March 7 with twelve new songs. One was \\"Parchman Farm Blues\\", which he recorded that day (all twelve were recorded over two days, May 7 and 8, 1940). The song has the elements of Delta blues, including a one-chord modal arrangement and a slide guitar break. However, the melody line is distinctive and relies less on blue notes. White delivers the vocal in his characteristic grainy, guttural style accompanied by his acoustic guitar, with Washboard Sam on washboard percussion. His lyrics allude to his time at Parchman: Parchman Farm chain gang in 1911 White never denied responsibility for the shooting, which he claimed was in self-defense: \\"I shot him where I wanted to shoot him. Broke this thigh\\". Although he usually downplayed his time at Parchman, the difference in his songs after his release is apparent. According to music historian Ted Gioia, \\"the rollicking, carefree ethos of 'The Panama Limited', of 'Shake 'Em On Down', is replaced by a darker, more introspective mood in his later recordings. A sense of pathos enters his music ... [and they] take on a more overtly artistic dimension\\". When he last recorded commercially in 1937, rural-style blues was giving way to urban, ensemble blues styles. By 1940, performers, such as Louis Jordan with jump blues and T-Bone Walker with West Coast blues, were becoming popular and the electrified-Delta sound of Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker was still a few years away. As Gioia notes, \\"It's not clear what audience Melrose had in mind when he agreed to record these songs\\". When \\"Parchman Farm Blues\\" was released as a single by Okeh Records in 1940, it went largely unnoticed. A brief review in the Amsterdam News in July 1940 referred to White's songs as \\"folk music\\" and not part of any current popular style. Subsequently, he only performed sporadically until his rediscovery during the American folk music revival in the early 1960s, when Bob Dylan and others began recording his songs, such as \\"Fixin' to Die Blues\\". \\"Parchman Farm Blues\\" is included on numerous Bukka White and various artists compilations. Mose Allison song Mose Allison in 2007 In 1957, Mose Allison recorded \\"Parchman Farm\\" for his album Local Color. Although it is inspired by White's song, Allison uses a different arrangement and some new lyrics.Herzhaft 1992, p. 465. In pondering his detention in the first verse, the singer claims \\"I ain't never done no man no harm\\"; however, by the last he admits \\"all I did was shoot my wife\\". The song is performed by a trio with Allison on vocal and piano, backed by Addison Farmer on bass and Nick Stabulas on drums. It is an uptempo song, which gains even greater momentum through modulation in the second verse. \\"Parchman Farm\\" is one of Allison's best-known songs. In 1964, he re-recorded it with some new lyrics as \\"New Parchman\\" for The Word from Mose album. Heightening the irony, the first verse includes \\"Sittin' over here on Parchman Farm, the place is loaded with rustic charm\\".An AllMusic review includes, \\"Perhaps this version would be more suited to white-collar criminals\\". \\"Parchman Farm\\" since has been recorded by variety of artists.

They originate in Vietnam and are commonly found in tropical forests there. They eat a variety of foliage, though in captivity they commonly eat blackberry bramble, hawthorn, oak, red maple and rose. Physical characteristics Vietnamese walking sticks are approximately 4-5 inches (10‚Äì12 cm) in length. Their heads are elongated and oval shaped with thread-like antennae. Their chewing mouthparts are specially adapted for eating plant material. Along its thorax are a number of small pointed bumps. Their middle set of legs show small flanges and minute spikes. These walking sticks are brownish in color and have six legs, which is a characteristic of all insects. Both male and female Vietnamese walking sticks have no wings.factsheet Reproduction Medauroidea extradentata is mainly parthenogenetic, meaning they are asexual, making males very rare in the species. The female drops hundreds of eggs onto the forest floor, these eggs hatch in a few months. The eggs of this species are mottled with black and white and capped with black. Life cycle The Vietnamese walking stick is short lived, living between 5‚Äì7 months. Nymphs look nearly identical to their parents except in size. They molt about 6 times before they become adults. At 3 months of age they become able to reproduce. Their main predators are birds and small mammals, though their camouflage helps them combat this.

Robinson (1860‚Äì1950) was an industrialist, inventor, and author of a seminal book on mine ventilation (1922).Pittsburgh: J.R. Robinson, 1922. OCLC 1688262 The book documents his invention of a new device for ventilating mines and preventing the buildup of explosive methane gases underground, thereby dramatically improving mine safety. He founded the Robinson Ventilating Company, forerunner of today‚Äôs Robinson Industries, one of the nation‚Äôs leading designers and manufacturers of industrial fans.  Early life  J.R. Robinson was born in Scotland where his father, Samuel B. Robinson, worked as a master mechanic for the English Crown Coal Company. In 1863, when Robinson was three, his family emigrated to the United States, settling in the coal country of western Pennsylvania. Upon his arrival in the U.S., Samuel enlisted in the Union Army to fight in the American Civil War. When the war ended, he used his coal mining skills to land a job as a designer for the Pittsburgh Coal Company, eventually rising to the position of plant superintendent. By the time he was 12, Robinson was helping his father in the coal mine, earning certification as a journeyman machinist by the time he was 20. Education and New Ventures  Robinson studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University, after which he returned to Pennsylvania. In 1892 he and Samuel co-founded the Robinson Machine Company, which provided machinery and ventilation for the many mines in the region. J.R. served as chief engineer. In that capacity he directed numerous product innovations, including the development of fans, steam boilers, engines, hoists, crushers, and haulers for coal mines and mills. In 1907 Samuel retired and sold the company. The following year, James founded the Robinson Ventilating Company in Pittsburgh, which sold industrial fans he designed and were manufactured by two other companies. America‚Äôs entry into World War I in 1917 placed heavy demands on the nation‚Äôs manufacturers, leading Robinson Ventilating to establish its own manufacturing plant in Blairsville, Pa. In 1921, Robinson moved the plant to Zelienople, Pa., where the headquarters and main manufacturing facility of Robinson Industries are still located today.  Legacy  As a result of his work with the mining industry, Robinson became a major authority on mine ventilation. Until the early 1900s, the principal method of providing ventilation for miners was through \\"natural draft ventilation,\\" which meant simply digging large holes above the mines for ventilation purposes. The problem with this was that methane gases were too heavy to rise through the ventilating holes, and instead accumulated beneath the surface, often triggering explosions. He designed and built a ventilating device that could bring fresh air into mines or force out old air. He summarized his work in a technical article and in his 1922 book Practical Mine Ventilation, which quickly became required reading in college mining and engineering classes. The book remained a staple of course syllabi for many years afterward. It is still held in roughly 30 U.S. libraries.WorldCat Robinson‚Äôs innovations were not limited to the ventilation industry. On a winter‚Äôs day in 1927, while driving to Penn State University to visit his son Rodger, he experienced a great deal of difficulty seeing through the snow and ice accumulating on his windshield. Rather than returning home after his visit he stayed at the university and used his engineering expertise to design and create a device for heating windshields. To ensure that the company would stay in the family, he placed the majority of Robinson Ventilating stock in a trust for his children. Many of his children and their descendants have remained in the business and have helped to grow it and make technical innovations.

They are also found in Southern Africa. The name is derived from Greek: hyalos (·ΩïŒ±ŒªŒøœÇ) crystal, glass; and omma (oŒºŒºŒ±) eye. Hyalomma originated from Iran or the southern part of the former Soviet Union and spread into Asia, the Middle East, southern Europe, and Africa (Larry S. Roberts, 2009). Hyalomma are larger in size and do not have protective shields (indistinct festoons), but have eyes and banded legs. Hyalomma species are difficult to identify due to their hybridization and genetic and morphological variations, caused by harsh environmental conditions and lack of food sources. Hyalomma species are the only ticks to live in such harsh desert conditions. With few hosts available, they are required to be active as soon as a potential host is sensed. Adult Hyalomma can bite humans and transmit serious pathogens. Immature (nymph) Hyalomma usually feed on birds, rodents, and hares and can be the cause of viral disease and rickettsias. Nymphs are often transmitted from one place to another by migrating birds. For example, a migrating bird carrying a Hyalomma marginatum nymph can cause Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (Larry S.Roberts, 2009). Hyalomma species can also transmit rickettsias like Siberian tick typhus, Boutonneuse fever, and Q fever (Larry S.Roberts, 2009).

Function  cAMP is a signaling molecule important for a variety of cellular functions. cAMP exerts its effects by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which transduces the signal through phosphorylation of different target proteins. The inactive holoenzyme of PKA is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. cAMP causes the dissociation of the inactive holoenzyme into a dimer of regulatory subunits bound to four cAMP and two free monomeric catalytic subunits. Four different regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits of PKA have been identified in humans. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the regulatory subunits. This protein was found to be a tissue-specific extinguisher that down-regulates the expression of seven liver genes in hepatoma x fibroblast hybrids Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed.  Clinical significance  Functional null mutations in this gene cause Carney complex (CNC), an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome. This gene can fuse to the RET protooncogene by gene rearrangement and form the thyroid tumor- specific chimeric oncogene known as PTC2. Mutation of PRKAR1A leads to the Carney complex, associating multiple endocrine tumors.

They appeared at the Royal Albert Hall, London on three occasions between 1922 and 1926.Royal Albert Hall Archives, http://catalogue.royalalberthall.com/Default.aspx? They also performed in New York, Amsterdam, and elsewhere in Europe. The L√©ner made the first complete recorded cycle of Beethoven quartets.  Personnel  The founding lineup of the Quartet, which lasted until their break-up at the start of World War II, was as follows: 1st violin *Jen√∂ L√©ner (or Lehner) 2nd violin *Joszef Smilovits Viola *S√°ndor Roth Cello *Imre Hartmann In later manifestations of the ensemble, Paul Rolland (viola) and Laszlo Varga (cello) were players in the L√©ner Quartet.  Origins  Jen√∂ L√©ner was born at Szabadka, Hungary (later annexed to Yugoslavia), on 24 June 1894. He studied at the Royal High School for Music in Budapest. He founded the quartet in 1918 and was its leader.  Recordings  The L√©ner Quartet recorded extensively during the 1920s and 1930s for Columbia Records, a partnership which received a strong impetus from the centenary of Beethoven's death in 1927, when a core of the Beethoven quartets were recorded or begun (L series). This was followed up in 1928 with the Schubert centenary, for which the L√©ner recorded the Octet. The LX prefix records below were mainly issued between 1933 and 1936.

The environment of Brazil is characterized by high biodiversity with a population density that decreases away from the coast. Brazil's large area comprises different ecosystems, which together sustain some of the world's greatest biodiversity. Because of the country's intense economic and demographic growth, Brazil's ability to protect its environmental habitats has increasingly come under threat. Extensive legal and Illegal logging destroys forests the size of a small country per year, and with it a diverse series of species through habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation.USDA Forest Service website, Forest Service International Programs: Brazil, retrieved February 2007. Between 2002 and 2006, an area of the Amazon Rainforest equivalent in size to the State of South Carolina was completely deforested for the purposes of raising cattle and woodlogging. In April 2012 Brazil's powerful farm lobby won a long-sought victory after the National Congress of Brazil approved a controversial forestry bill that environmentalists say will speed deforestation in the Amazon as more land is opened for producing food.Brazilian Forestry Legislation Advances April 26, 2012 By 2020, at least 50% of the species resident in Brazil may become extinct. There is a general consensus that Brazil has the highest number of both terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of any single country in the world. Also, Brazil has the highest primate diversity, the highest number of mammals, the highest number of amphibians, the second highest number of butterflies, the third highest number of birds, and second highest number of reptiles. There is a high number of endangered species, many of them living in threatened habitats such as the Atlantic Forest. Biota Climate Geography  Climate change Energy Protected areas Waste management In August 2010 the President signed the National Policy on Solid Waste (NPSW) which became the first national law to deal with waste management. However, various states and municipalities already had laws and regulations on the books concerning waste management. The law calls for the Ministry of the Environment to compile a National Plan on Solid Waste with a 20-year horizon to be updated every four years. Environmental policy and law Brazil has one of the most complete environmental legislations in the world. However, the laws in this legislation haven‚Äôt been adequately enforced in the past, compromising their effectiveness towards protecting the natural environment in this nation with a rich biodiversity of fauna and flora. The Brazilian Environmental Policy (1981) was the first real breakthrough concerning environmental protection and sustainability. Before this, there were polluting emissions guidelines that allowed industries to pollute to a certain extent without being liable to any environmental damage. However, after this policy was passed, strict liability was applied which determined that industries were accountable for all the pollution they were causing. Therefore, from then onwards, polluters would be responsible for all the damage they caused. Just after this policy was implemented, laws were introduced that authorised public prosecutors to act in defence of the environment, and later on, another law was introduced which allowed NGOs to do the same. The Brazilian Ministry of the Environment is the agency in charge of coordinating, supervising and controlling the Brazilian Environmental Policy. It is also responsible for promoting the use of sustainable natural resources and applying sustainable development within the formulation and implementation of national policies. Environmental licensing is a legal obligation before any potentially damaging and polluting activities take place in any part of Brazil‚Äôs territory. A framework has been created by the federal government called the National Environment System (SISNAMA), which includes local state government environment agencies, the National Environmental Council (CONAMA) and the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), in order to facilitate the licensing process. IBAMA is the Brazilian government‚Äôs main tool for providing information with regards to environmental welfare and protection, and acts as the ‚Äúenvironmental police‚Äù. Despite its administrative and financial autonomy, it is responsible for implementing new policies and standards for environmental quality, evaluating environmental impacts, examining environmental degradation and for distributing environmental licenses. IBAMA has the power to impose administrative fines, but when more serious environmental crimes are committed, it is responsible for informing federal authorities for further prosecution. The challenge Brazil is currently facing is to find a solution as to how powerful actors can be encouraged to abide by environmental regulation and enforce these policies. In order to address this, former president Luis In√°cio Lula da Silva signed a decree on July 22, 2008 that would improve the process of imposing fines and sanctions on people and institutions committing environmental crimes. Monitoring the occurrence of environmental crimes and policing areas in a country with vast expanses of forests, including the Amazon Rainforest and the Atlantic Forest has proved to be a difficult task. IBAMA and the Brazilian Armed Forces are the main organisations used by the federal government to actively protect Brazil‚Äôs natural ecosystems. The main tactics used to deter environmental degradation and to improve sustainability is to use direct force, such as fines and jail terms. This reflects the command-and-control system in which regulation and environmental protection is carried out in Brazil.

The name of the bluff commemorates Lyman Dayton, for whom a city in Hennepin County was also named.A Walk Through The HistoricThird Street Neighborhood On the edge of the southern and highest part of Dayton's bluff, in Indian Mounds Park, is a series of seven large aboriginal mounds, high, that overlook the river and the central part of the city. History Dayton's Bluff contains remnants of the earliest inhabitants of the Twin Cities. The landmarks found in its historic district and the community around it tell the story. Indian Mounds Park preserves some of the burial sites of an early group that came to the area more than a thousand years ago. Kaposia, a large Dakota Indian village, existed below Dayton's Bluff from the late seventeenth century until the mid-nineteenth century. Its residents lived along the river and performed their burial rites on the cliffs above. They were followed by the Metis (mixed bloods) and European-American farmers‚Äî often former Fort Snelling soldiers who tilled the land in the late 1830s and 1840s. The sacred site of Carver's Cave was destroyed by railroad construction in the 1880s. The development of Dayton's Bluff as a ‚Äúsuburban‚Äù residential location began in the 1840s. The area was named for Lyman Dayton, an early pioneer real estate operator who owned extensive properties and built a home on the Bluff in the 1850s. The community became part of what historians call ‚Äúthe walking city‚Äù and was started so early that many of its streets were laid out parallel to the Mississippi River rather than in a north/south manner. Feed, flour, and lumber mills were built in the area in the 1850s to take advantage of Phalen Creek as a source of water power. When a railroad was built north of East 7th Street in the late 1860s, more industries, including Hamm's Brewery, grew up along its corridor. Soon a railroad depot called ‚ÄúPost's Siding‚Äù was built at present- day Earl Street and East 7th Street, and a community of workers surrounded the industries. It was the start of what would be a long history of manufacturing in the community. Because of its landscape and vistas, many wealthy residents chose to construct estates on large lots. A group of prosperous German Americans clustered together. However, the Bluff was never an exclusive enclave of the rich. A St. Paul paper of the time noted that ‚Äúin the eastern part of the city, on Dayton's Bluff . . . several hundred dwellings have been erected.‚Äù Most of the homes were ‚Äúof the medium class, for the use of mechanics and employees of the numerous factories that are springing up.‚Äù The 1880s through the early 1900s was a time of prosperity. The streetcar arrived and the neighborhood expanded. New development, both commercial and residential, sprang up near the streetcar line, which went up East 7th Street and ended at Duluth Street. The era saw the arrival of new industries, including lumber companies, farm equipment companies, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M), and Seeger Refrigerator, which later became the Whirlpool Corporation. In 1857, Lyman Dayton, a well-known land and railroad speculator from Vermont, platted his \\"Addition to St. Paul\\" on the eastern border of St. Paul. The area was separated from the early settlement along the river by a ravine that was first bridged and was then filled. The early developers of the area were named Burns, McLean, and Wakefield, and contributed their names to area streets. The area was separated from the early settlement along the river by a ravine, but inaccessibility did not deter Dayton and a handful of other businessmen who built large and costly houses. Farther to the south, beyond present day I-94 in the Mounds Park area, river-oriented residential development was also occurring. The earliest settlers had views of the growth of the city at the Lower Levee and along East Seventh Street, and could see the building of the rail yards as they stretched along the river and up the Phalen Creek valley. As the blocks of \\"Dayton's Bluff\\" (as it came to be known) were developed, a sense of the steep, rolling terrain was retained. Houses crowned terraced hilltop sites, and porches and prominent windows were oriented towards views of distant river bluffs. Carpenters and masons used quality materials in their construction, and provided hardwood floors and trim, spacious rooms, and interesting architectural details at porches and rooflines. In the 1860s and the 1870s, a number of Saint Paul businessmen built elaborate limestone houses along the bluff. These houses are long gone, but several old brick houses remain, and brick and stone are evident throughout the Dayton's Bluff historic district in foundations and in chimneys. Stone, brick, and concrete were also used for lintels, sills, and decorative trim. Wood building products, including siding, shingles, and decorative trim were used extensively by the nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century builders of Dayton's Bluff. Many of the historic windows of Dayton's Bluff have a double-hung sash and a vertical orientation. Most of the houses and rowhouses built in the Dayton's Bluff Historic District before 1920 had unenclosed front porches. The porch usually stretched across the full width of the front facade, but in some cases only covered the entry. A great variety of machine-made trim was added to even the simplest wooden houses of Dayton's Bluff, while iron, cast iron, terra cotta, tile, and brick also can be seen. Lyman Dayton Dayton was born in Southington, Connecticut, and died in St. Paul. He came to Minnesota in 1849, settled in St. Paul, invested largely in real estate, and was the president of the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad. The Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad Company was incorporated under Minnesota legislation enacted in 1861 and received grants of lands approved by the U.S. General Land Office for transfer. Gates A. Johnson, Sr., (1826‚Äì1918) was the chief engineer of the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad Company from 1861 to 1870 and was the St. Paul City Engineer in 1860, the Ramsey County surveyor from 1864 to 1866, and the chief engineer of the Hastings, Minnesota River and Red River of the North Railroad Company in 1866. William L. Banning (1814‚Äì1893) was the president of the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad Company in 1866. William Branch & Company was engaged in surveying and construction on the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad from 1865 to 1869. Modern Dayton's Bluff The Euclid View Flats, part of the Dayton's Bluff Historic District. Dayton's Bluff is one of St. Paul's undiscovered cultural resources. Beginning as a fashionable residential locale for the wealthy, it evolved in the early 1880s into a suburb of broad social and economic diversity; a place for every man (and woman) to build his house and watch the world grow up around him. That world was made up of breweries and railroads and their workers, carpenters and masons, janitors, grocers and teachers, all with growing families; and interspersed among these, a mix of clerks, salesmen and managers that collected at dawn along Third Street for their daily assault on the heart of the city. Many of the original homes still stand today and have already celebrated their one-hundredth birthday. The current interest in the revitalization of Dayton's Bluff focuses largely on the fine older buildings which are the record of the area's long history. The Dayton's Bluff Historic District was approved by the St. Paul City Council in August, 1992. The creation of the Historic District recognizes the historical and architectural significance of this early St. Paul neighborhood and is an important part of neighborhood revitalization in St. Paul's District 4. Dayton's Bluff was named \\"The Best Undiscovered Neighborhood\\" by the local publication, City Pages, in 2010. Their publication stated:  Houses First plotted out to rival Summit Hill as a home to the rich and mighty. While it never reached the glory of its rival it nevertheless left architectural treasures and inspiring views of the Mississippi River. A famous house in the Dayton's Bluff area is the Wakefield House or the William Wakefield house located at 963 Wakefield Avenue, Saint Paul, Minnesota. The whole block is named after the house and is centered on it. There are two alleys for the one block that dead-end into the house. The house was built in 1860, and the name of the street was changed in 1892. The house is set farther back then the other houses on the street, so that it is hard to view from the street. The house has been restored so that its appearance is reminiscent of its past glory. The current owners offer 1800s-style parties, including tea parties. The Schornstein Grocery and Saloon, designed by architect Augustus F. Gauger, was built in 1884. It was a popular gathering place for German Americans, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Industry In 1910, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) moved its headquarters and manufacturing facilities from Duluth to a single building on Forest Street in Dayton's Bluff, according to the Saint Paul Historical Research Team. Marjorie Pearson, the author of the article worked for Summit Envirosolutions, Inc. They shut down their Saint Paul Plant in 2009. The building now houses the main offices of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.

Goodman. The pair also published the classic textbook The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics in 1941, and Gilman served as an editor for its first six editions. Gilman served on the faculties of the Yale School of Medicine, the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he founded the Department of Pharmacology. He was a member of U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Life and career Gilman was born February 5, 1908, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Joseph Gilman and Rebecca Ives Gilman. Joseph Gilman owned a music store in Bridgeport, and his son learned to play several musical instruments. Unlike his father, however, Alfred Gilman turned to science, receiving a bachelor's degree from Yale College in 1928 and Ph.D. in Physiological Chemistry from Yale in 1931 for a dissertation entitled \\"Chemical and Physiological Investigations on Canine Gastric Secretion.\\" He then joined of the Department of Pharmacology at the Yale School of Medicine as a postdoctoral fellow, where he and Louis S. Goodman, a young M.D., became colleagues and close friends. In 1934, a year before joining the Yale faculty as an assistant professor, he married Mabel Schmidt. Their daughter, Joanna, was born in 1938, and their son, Alfred Goodman Gilman, in 1941. The younger Alfred Gilman, whose middle name was taken from Louis Goodman, followed his father into pharmacology and was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology. While teaching together, Goodman and Gilman perceived a need for an updated textbook in pharmacology that reflected advances in medicine and clarified the linkages between pharmacodynamics and pharmacotherapy. With assistance from Mabel, the text was first published in 1941 by the Macmillan Publishing Company as The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, and Gilman remained a senior editor for its first six editions. The seventh was releases shortly after his death. Shortly after publishing the first edition of his textbook, Gilman became section chief of pharmacology at the US Army's Edgewood Arsenal. Still affiliated with Yale, where Dean Milton C. Winternitz had recently signed a government contract with the Office of Scientific Research and Development to investigate agents of chemical warfare, Gilman and Goodman were assigned a study of nitrogen mustard. Interested in bone marrow depletion effects of mustard gas discovered by Edward and Helen Krumbhaar during World War I, Gilman and Goodman conducted trials on mice to research on the compounds' cytotoxic properties for white blood cells. In August 1942, only a few months after their initial experiments, they began trials on a patient of thoracic surgeon Gustaf Lindskog whose lymphosarcoma had not responded to radiation therapy. Although the intravenous nitrogen mustard regimen caused the tumor to completely recede, it regenerated within a month, and the patient died several months later. A larger clinical trial followed, and a paper was released after the studies were declassified in 1946. Gilman and Goodman are credited with the first use of intravenous chemotherapy treatment. After leaving his Army post in 1946, Gilman joined the faculty of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons and moved to White Plains, New York, then became the chairman of the new Department of Pharmacology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1956. During this period, Gilman shifted his focus to diuretics and kidney function. Gilman returned to Yale in 1973, where he remained as a lecturer until his death. He died at home in New Haven in 1984. Awards and honors Gilman was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1964 and chaired its Drug Efficacy Review Committee. He received an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth College in 1979.

History Ionic was launched at Harland and Wolff‚Ä≤s yard at the Queen's Island in Belfast on 22 May 1902. She was originally built to carry passengers and refrigerated meat between the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and began her maiden voyage from London to Wellington via Cape Town on 16 January 1903. Ionic was the first ship on the New Zealand route to be fitted with a Marconi wireless set. She was built with only one buff-coloured, black topped smokestack and four passenger decks. Ionic was also equipped with four masts. She was fitted with electrical lighting and had an open promenade deck and the golden White Star Line stripe along her hull. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, Ionic was requisitioned as a troop ship for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and in 1915 she narrowly missed a torpedo by less than 15 yards while steaming through the Mediterranean Sea. On 31 January Ionic returned to her former New Zealand passenger service via the Panama Canal. In 1927 Ionic came to the aid of the crew aboard a French fishing vessel, Daisy, that had run aground in Grand Banks. Ionics final refit before the Cunard-White Star merger was completed in 1929.

According to Suidas, he was a brother of Antigonus I Monophthalmus, who was afterwards king of Asia, by which an uterine brother alone can be meant, as the father of Antigonus was named Philip. Both of these statements point to his being of noble birth, and appear strangely at variance with the assertion that he was a mere professional grammarian Grammatodidascalus, a statement which Robert Geier conjectures plausibly enough to refer in fact to Marsyas of Philippi. Suidas, indeed, seems in many points to have confounded the two. The only other fact transmitted to us concerning the life of Marsyas, is that he was appointed by Demetrius Poliorcetes to command one division of his fleet in the Battle of Salamis in Cyprus (306 BC) (Diodorus, xx. 50.). However, this circumstance is alone sufficient to show that he was a person who himself took an active part in public affairs, not a mere man of letters. It is probable that he followed the fortunes of his stepbrother Antigonus. His principal work was a history of Macedonia, Makedonika, in 10 books, commencing from the earliest times, and coming down to the wars of Alexander in Asia, when it terminated abruptly in 331, with the return of the monarch into Syria, after the conquest of Egypt and the foundation of Alexandria. It is repeatedly cited by Athenaeus, Plutarch, Harpocration, Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus and Justin (historian). Suidas also speaks of a history on the education of Alexander, (ŒëŒªŒµŒæŒ¨ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒÆ) and a treatise on the history of antiquities of Athens (ŒëœÑœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨) in 12 books,which is considered by Bernhardy and Geier to be the same with Archaeology of Marsyas the younger.

Halper (born June 4, 1944) is an American foreign policy scholar and retired Senior Fellow at the University of Cambridge where he is a Life Fellow at Magdalene College. He served as a White House official in the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan administrations, and was reportedly in charge of the spying operation by the 1980 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign that became known as \\"Debategate\\". Through his decades of work for the CIA, Halper has had extensive ties to the Bush family. Through his work with Sir Richard Billing Dearlove, he had ties to the British Secret Intelligence Service MI6. Halper acted as an FBI informant during the bureau‚Äôs investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. A subsequent Inspector General report later named Halper as a \\"confidential human source\\", reporting on the conversations of officials within the Donald Trump campaign. Education Halper graduated from Stanford University in 1967. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Oxford in 1971. He was appointed Director of American Studies at the University of Cambridge's longstanding Department of Politics and International Studies in 2001. He received a second Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 2004. Career  United States government (1971‚Äì1984)  Halper began his United States government career in 1971 in the United States Domestic Policy Council, part of the executive office of the president, serving until 1973. He then served in the office of management and budget until 1974, when he moved to the office of the White House chief of staff as assistant to the chief of staff where he had responsibility for a range of domestic and international issues. During this time, Halper worked as an assistant for three chiefs of staff, Alexander Haig, Donald Rumsfeld, and Dick Cheney. He held this position until January 20, 1977. In 1977, Halper became Special Counsel to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee and Legislative Assistant to Senator William Roth (R-Del.). In 1979 he became National Policy Director for George H. W. Bush's Presidential campaign and then in 1980 he became Director of Policy Coordination for the Reagan- Bush Presidential campaign. Halper played a central role in a scandal in the 1980 election. But it was not until several years after Reagan‚Äôs victory over Carter that this scandal emerged. In connection with his position Halper's name came up in the 1983/4 investigations into the Debategate affair, which was a spying scandal in which Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials passed classified information about Carter administration‚Äôs foreign policy to Reagan campaign officials in order to ensure the Reagan campaign knew of any foreign policy decisions that Carter was considering (Iran hostage crisis). Reagan Administration officials cited by The New York Times described Halper as \\"the person in charge\\" of the operation. Halper called the report \\"just absolutely untrue\\". In 1983, United Press International (UPI) suggested that Halper‚Äôs handler for this operation was Reagan‚Äôs Vice Presidential candidate, ex-CIA-Director George H. W. Bush, who worked with Halper‚Äôs father-in-law, ex- CIA-Deputy-Director Ray S. Cline. After Reagan entered the White House, Halper became Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. Upon leaving the Department in 1984, he remained a Senior Advisor to the Department of Defense and a Senior Advisor to the Department of Justice until 2001.  Business (1984‚Äì1990)  From 1984 to 1990 Halper was chairman and majority shareholder of the Palmer National Bank of Washington, D.C., the National Bank of Northern Virginia and the George Washington National Bank. Palmer National Bank was used to transfer money to Swiss Bank Accounts controlled by White House aid Oliver North.

Col. Oliver North sent arms and money to the anti-Sandinista guerrilla Contras in Nicaragua. One of Palmer‚Äôs founders, Stefan Halper, had no previous banking experience, but was George H.W. Bush‚Äôs foreign policy director during Bush‚Äôs unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign.‚Äù Patricia Goldstone: Interlock. Art, Conspiracy, and the Shadow Worlds of Mark Lombardi, page 120 Academic and media (1986‚Äì2000) From 1986 to 2000 Halper wrote a national security and foreign policy-focused weekly newspaper column, syndicated to 30 newspapers. Halper has worked as a senior foreign policy advisor to various think-tanks and research institutions, including the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and The Center for the National Interest, where he is a Distinguished Fellow. He has served on the Advisory Board of Directors of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies and contributed to various magazines, journals, newspapers and media outlets. These include: The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, the BBC, CNN, SKY NEWS, ABC, CBS, NBC, C-Span, and a range of radio outlets. Professor Halper is a member of the Cosmos Club in Washington D.C., and the Travellers Club in London. United States government research (2012‚Äì2016) From 2012 to 2016 Halper received $1 million in contracts for ‚Äúsocial sciences and humanities‚Äù research from the Defense department's Office of Net Assessment, some of which Halper subcontracted to other researchers. Forty percent of the money had been awarded before Trump announced his candidacy in 2015. Secretive opposition research for the 1980 Reagan Campaign The New York Times reported that for Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign, Halper was the \\"person in charge\\" of running a \\"highly secretive\\" operation to get \\"inside information\\" about the Carter Administration's foreign policy and pass it to the Reagan campaign. Halper was running the operation out of Reagan's campaign headquarters according to Reagan Administrative officials. Those sources also said that several other retired Central Intelligence Agency officials were involved in the operation. Halper had been the deputy director of the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs shortly before taking on the operation research assignment. Halper was officially a campaign aide responsible for providing 24 hour news updates and policy ideas. Halper, worked under Robert Garrick, the director of campaign operations, who in a telephone interview said that Halper was supposed to help with communications, but I kind of thought he had another agenda going -he was always on the phone with the door closed, and he never called me in and discussed it with me. David Prosperi, another Reagan campaign aide, said, He provided us with wire stories and Carter speeches, but people talked about his having a network that was keeping track of things inside the Government, mostly in relation to the October Surprise. Ray S. Cline, Halper's father-in-law and a former senior Central Intelligence official, dismissed the Reagan aides' disclosures as a romantic fallacy. FBI Operation ‚ÄòCrossfire Hurricane‚Äô Halper acted as an FBI informant for Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, and was a subject of the Spygate conspiracy theory initiated by President Donald Trump in May 2018. His FBI handler, initially identified only as \\"Case Agent 1\\", was later identified as Stephen M. Somma, a counterintelligence investigator. Trump's theory falsely alleges that the Obama administration implanted a paid spy in the 2016 Trump campaign \\"for political purposes\\" to gather information in support of Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Beginning in summer 2016, Halper spoke separately to three Trump campaign advisers ‚Äì Carter Page, Sam Clovis and George Papadopoulos ‚Äì but there is no evidence that Halper had actually joined Trump's campaign. Halper first met Carter Page at a symposium at the University of Cambridge organized by Steven Schrage. Page said that he \\"had extensive discussions\\" with Halper on \\"a bunch of different foreign-policy-related topics\\", ending in September 2017. A former federal law enforcement official told The New York Times that their initial encounter at a London symposium on July 11‚Äì12, 2016 was a coincidence, rather than at the direction of the FBI. Clovis's attorney said that Clovis and Halper had discussed China during their sole meeting on August 31 or September 1, 2016. On September 2, 2016, Halper contacted Papadopoulos, inviting him to London and to write a paper on Mediterranean oil fields, which he did. On September 15, 2016, Halper asked Papadopoulos if he knew of any Russian efforts to disrupt the election campaign; Papadopoulos twice denied he did, despite Joseph Mifsud telling him the previous April that Russians had embarrassing Hillary Clinton emails, and Papadopoulos bragging about it to Alexander Downer in May. The New York Times reported in April 2019 that the FBI had asked Halper to approach Page and Papadopoulos, although it was not clear if he had been asked to contact Clovis. In May 2019, the Times reported that Page had urged Halper to meet with Clovis and that the FBI was aware of the meeting but had not instructed Halper to ask Clovis about Russia matters. The Times also reported that the FBI also sent an investigator using the name Azra Turk to meet with Papadopoulos, while posing as Halper's assistant. The Times stated that the FBI considered it essential to add a trained and trusted investigator like Turk as a \\"layer of oversight\\", in the event the investigation was ultimately prosecuted and the government needed the credible testimony of such an individual, without exposing Halper as a longtime confidential informant. Trump‚Äôs Spygate allegations were rebutted,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/23/there-is- no-evidence-for-spygate-but-there-is-a-reason-that-trump-invented-it/ despite renewed interest in April 2019 after attorney general William Barr testified to Congress that ‚Äúspying did occur‚Äù on the Trump campaign, although his characterization of ‚Äúspying‚Äù was unambiguous and he was specific. He stated he was assembling a team to examine the matter. His statement was based upon the Justice Department inspector general report and who had been looking into it and related matters for some time. Prior to his 2016 activities, Halper had a February 2014 encounter at a London intelligence conference with Michael Flynn, then the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and later a Trump supporter and first national security advisor. Halper became so alarmed by Flynn‚Äôs close association with a Russian woman that a Halper associate expressed concerns to American authorities that Flynn may have been compromised by Russian intelligence. Flynn was forced out of the DIA six months later, although public accounts at the time cited other reasons for his removal, including his management style and views on Islam. = Lawsuit = The \\"Russian\\" woman, former Cambridge academic Svetlana Lokhova sued Halper in 2019 for $25 million, alleging he had conspired with multiple news outlets to spread the false and salacious narrative that she had seduced Flynn on orders from the Russian government. Halper filed a response to the lawsuit in which he declared that he is entitled to the legal immunity ordinarily afforded to federal agents, \\"even if the lawsuit's allegations are true\\". Halper's motion to dismiss stated in part:\\"Private individuals who participate in FBI investigations are subject to the federal common law qualified immunity applicable to government agents.\\"  Department of Justice Report  A 2019 Department of Justice report, according to the New Your Times, reports that an undercover F.B.I. agent posed as Mr. Halper‚Äôs assistant during a 2016 London meeting with George Papadopoulos. However, the report's author, Michael Horowitz, did not find any evidence that Mr. Halper tried to infiltrate the Trump campaign.  Consideration for Trump administration role  Axios reported in May 2018 that during the transition Trump top trade advisor Peter Navarro had recommended Halper for an ambassadorship. Personal life Halper's former wife, Sibyl Cline, is the daughter of the former CIA deputy director for intelligence, Ray S. Cline. He retired from Cambridge University in 2015, and now lives in Virginia in the U.S. He consults for Crossword Cybersecurity chaired by Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6.

Born in Jaffa in 1941, Said Hammami fled the British Mandate of Palestine with his family upon the breakout of hostilities which preceded the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. After a brief stop at a refugee camp in Egypt, his family moved to Lebanon and then settled in Jordan, where his father re-established himself as a fruit and vegetable trader. After attending high school in Jordan, Said Hamami moved to Syria for university education. It was in Damascus that his interest in politics took shape, as he joined the Arab Ba'th Party while still at college studying English Literature. After his graduation from university, he worked as a journalist in Damascus and then traveled to Saudi Arabia where he found a job as a school teacher. His stay there was not to last long, as his devotion to the Palestinian cause took him back to Syria, where he soon quit the Ba'th Party to join the Palestine Liberation Organization, soon after its establishment in May 1964. He quickly climbed the ranks of the organization and become a member of the Palestinian National Council at the young age of 30. Hammami was appointed by Yasser Arafat to be the first diplomatic delegate of the PLO to the UK in 1973, heading their Office in London. There, he began to promote co-existence between the Palestinians and Israelis, calling for a two-state solution to the Question of Palestine. In 1974 and 1975, Said Hammami, in interviews to journalists and newspaper opinion pieces, articulated what has sometimes been considered the first indication of PLO acceptance of a two-state solution.Ayoob, Mohammed. The Middle East in world politics. 1981, page 90Cesarani, David. The Jewish chronicle and Anglo-Jewry, 1841-1991. 1994, page 230. A 1974 interview with Joseph Finklestone in The Jewish Chronicle was controversial among Israelis, because much of the Israeli populace of that period (including Golda Meir), held that \\"Palestinians\\" were not \\"a distinct entity\\" with a legitimate identity. In London, he also established contacts with British politicians and journalists, as well as building relations with Israeli peace activists, most notably Uri Avnery, who wrote a book about him after his assassination, which he entitled \\"My Friend the Enemy\\". Assassination Hammami was assassinated in his office in London on 4 January 1978, where he was serving as the representative of the PLO to the United Kingdom. The perpetrator was allegedly Abu Nidal's breakaway faction of the PLO.

It lies within the German half of the Wasgau region, the southern part of the Palatinate Forest.  Location  Drachenfels Castle is about north of the Franco-German border on the eponymous 150-metre-long bunter sandstone rocks which are on a ridge at an elevation of above sea level. The highest part of the rocks was turned into a keep or bergfried. Because of its present appearances the remains of the tower are known as the Backenzahn (\\"molar tooth\\") by the locals and make it one of the most striking castles in Rhineland-Palatinate. Not far from the Drachenfels are several other historic castles: just to the south-east is Berwartstein; a similar distance to the north-west are the three castles of Dahn; Lindelbrunn is northeast and the group of castles on the Franco-German border - the Wegelnburg (German) and the Hohnebourg, L≈ìwenstein and Fleckenstein (all on the French side) - are to the southwest. Man-made chambers have been hewn out of a rock massif opposite the castle, the so-called Buchkammerfels, which lies on the Heidenberg, high. The date and function of these Heidenkammern are unknown: it is speculated it may have been an outpost of the Drachenfels.  Name and history  The dragon inscribed on the wall of the old castle hall The name of the castle could have come from the dragon carved in the sandstone wall of the old great hall of the castle. However, because it has not been dated, it is also possible that the dragon was inscribed on the wall because of the castle's name. The origins of the castle are largely unclear. Archaeological finds here can be dated to the mid-13th century, but the castle was already in existence in the early 12th century. In 1209 the brothers Conrad and William of Drachenfels were first mentioned in the records. Historian, Johann Lehmann (1797‚Äì1876), named a Burkhard of Drachenfels between 1219 and 1221 who was in service for the House of Hohenstaufen, but he gave no references.Johann Georg Lehmann: Urkundliche Geschichte der Burgen und Bergschl√∂sser der bayrischen Pfalz. 5 vols., 1857‚Äì66; reprint by Urausgabe Kaiserslautern, Pirmasens, 1969 Other documents confirm that, in 1288, a dispute was settled between the cousins Rudolph and Anselm of Drachenfels on the one hand and the Bishop of Worms on the other. The oldest surviving seal of these two cousins depicts a dragon in a pointed shield (Spitzschild). From the early 14th century the seal contained a deer's skull or a wild goose. The first lesser nobleman who it is known with any certainty had a connexion with this castle in the Wasgau is Walter of Drachenfels (also Waltherus de Drachenvels) in 1245. In 1314 the lords of Drachenfels were promised compensation payments for a campaign by the city of Strasbourg against Berwartstein Castle, during which the nearby castle at Drachenfels was also besieged and damages. In 1335 there was a conflict with Strasbourg in which the lords of Drachensfels were accused of being robber barons. At this time Drachenfels was besieged and partially destroyed, forcing its lords to gradually sell off parts of the castle from 1344. As a result, Drachenfels became a jointly-owned castle or Ganerbenburg, whereby several families or individuals divided the estate between themselves. In 1510 the rebellious imperial knight, Francis of Sickingen, also bought a share in the castle. On 10 May 1523, after his defeat by the allied armies of three imperial princes, the castle was finally destroyed., although the Burgvogt, who occupied it with just eight servants, had surrendered without a fight owing to the odds that he was faced with. The victors refused to allow the castle to be rebuilt. What was left of the castle after it had been slighted was used as a quarry. In 1778, a descendant of its owners, Freiherr Franz Christoph Eckbrecht von D√ºrkheim, built a manor house in the village of Busenberg with the stones from Drachenfels, which is known today as the Schl√∂sschen (\\"little palace\\"). The church in Busenberg was also built from stones from the ruined castle.  Description   Eastern castle rocks and older lower ward  Eastern castle rock from the south with putlocks and other man-made marks Eastern lower ward Climb to the outer ward from the more recent gate tower The moderate remains of the castle in the eastern part of the site are dominated by the so-called Backenzahn, the castle rock in the east. On the rock only a few original wall courses have survived. All the same, a climb up the steps partially carved into the rock conveys an idea of the strength of the fortification. On the plateau of the former bergfried are the remains of a cistern. In the rooms hewn out of the rock, putlock holes and other manmade marks chiselled into the sandstone indicated that it was once entirely covered by timber framed or stone buildings. Considerably more has survived of the lower ward and gate system. In 1903, the gate tower was enhanced by two round-arched portals. Since 1990, the remains of two other towers, a small outer bailey as well as walls and buildings have been the focus of conservation and excavation activities by the \\"Directorate General for Cultural Heritage in Rhineland-Palatinate\\". The visitor first enters the tower, which admittedly was added later, but is made throughout of rusticated ashlars with lifting holes on which numerous stone marks can be seen. Access to the upper ward was achieved through an older tower built against the rock. Today there is a staircase between the two gate towers, originally there was probably an equestrian staircase here. In the courtyard of the lower ward, two outbuildings have partly survived. At the basement entrance of the western building, the year 1515 can be seen. In the basement of the other building is the castle well, now filled in.  Western castle rock and later lower ward  In the castle's later years the somewhat lower western rock was built on. The reason for such extensions is usually a change in ownership of castles, such as conversion of the original fief into a joint inheritance or Ganerbschaft. However, no walls can be seen on the western rock, and it is not even accessible. Elements of the ascent and a guardroom on the south side of the rock have survived. The site on the western rock had a separate, small, lower ward and its own gate system southeast of the castle rock, of which the remains of a flanking tower with embrasures has survived. In building the castle on the western rock, a multi-storey building was built over the old moat. Of this, only the putlock holes have survived, several of which pierce the old image of a dragon carved into the rock. To the north the courtyard was enclosed by a semicircular wall.

Its location is at a height of 572m, making it the highest ruined castle in the Palatinate Forest. Wegelnburg was founded by the Hohenstaufens in the 12th or 13th century. It had to protect the border of the Hohenstaufens‚Äô territory. In 1272, the castle was destroyed because the castellan had committed a breach of the peace. The von Wegelnburg family rebuilt the castle. In 1330 the Wegelnburg was pawned to the Palatinate and in 1417 it was given to the Duchy of Zweibr√ºcken through barter. Because of the Treaty of Nijmegen the castle was destroyed by French troops under General Monclar in 1679. Owned by the Palatinate and then by Bavaria, the Wegelnburg was given to Rhineland-Palatinate and has been administered by its Castles Administration since 1963. During the restoration work from 1979 until 1982 the remains of the castle were saved and large amounts of rubble were removed. Wegelnburg Castle was divided into three wards: a lower, middle and upper bailey, the lower bailey only being established on the western side. The internal gateway has been preserved and restored. Rock staircases, hewn into the sandstone rock, enable access to the upper ward. Niches, various timber holes, another stair and some renewed arches can be seen in the lower and middle wards. The foundation walls on the sandstone rock are remarkable because of the smooth transition of the wall and the rock. Together with the rock caves they belong to the upper and middle bailey.

Location The castle stands on a foothill of the Haardt range of sandstone hills which rises abruptly from the Rhine Plain on the north-eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest. Together with the small village of the same name, immediately to the west, it is above sea level, above the right bank of the Eckbach stream. Below the castle, by the ochre- coloured rocks bordering the winding approach road, the so-called Blitzr√∂hren (literally \\"lightning pipes\\") reach the surface. These are not true fulgurites caused by lightning strikes, but columns of hard, iron-rich mineral exposed by erosion and sintering of the softer sandstone. The Haardtrand-Im Baumgarten nature reserve borders the eastern slopes of the castle hill.  History  It is presumed that the castle was constructed by Count Frederick III of Leiningen (d. 1287), and it remained a possession of the House of Leiningen - until 1689, when it was destroyed during the War of the Palatine Succession by French troops. Together with Neuleiningen Castle, on the opposite hillside metres to the north, it controlled access to the Eckbach valley. To the south- east, upstream, stands the Leiningen family seat of Altleiningen.  Layout  The staircase tower in 2005 Plan of the castle On three sides the outer walls of the castle follow the edge of the steep-sided hill spur. The wall on the fourth side was protected by a moat, now completely filled in. Surviving structures include: the outer walls, a gate tower on the western side near the northwest corner of the site, a battery tower with embrasure in the centre of the south side, and the vaulted cellar and foundations of a large dwelling. Attached to this is a staircase tower, erected in the 16th century, which is still standing. The ruins are in private ownership but there is limited public access. A visit is repaid with views across the Rhine Plain, the Bergstrasse and the Odenwald.

Along with E. V. Krishna Pillai, another of the notable Malayalam satirists, Sanjayan is known to have developed the genre of light essays in the language. Besides satires, he also wrote literary criticisms and translated Othello into Malayalam language.  Biography  Malabar Christian College during Sanjayan's days Sanjayan was born on June 13, 1903 in Thalassery, a town in Kannur District of the south Indian state of Kerala to Madavil Kunjiraman Vaidyar and Manikkoth Paru Amma. His father died when the boy was eight years old and he was brought up by his mother. He did his schooling at Brennan Branch School, the present day Government Brennen Higher Secondary School, after which he studied at Government Brennen College, Thalassery, Victoria College, Palakkad and Madras Christian College from where he earned an honours degree in English language and literature. By this time, he had already mastered Sanskrit language and had acquired a working knowledge of German and French languages. Though he started his career as a clerk in government service soon after his graduation, he resigned the job after a short while to move to teaching by joining Malabar Christian College as a member of faculty. During this period, he had a change of mind and started studying for law, passing the FL examination. However, he could not continue his studies due to personal issues but resumed the studies in 1932, studying for Bachelor of Law, which was also abandied due to ill health; he contracted tuberculosis. While undergoing treatment and during his convalescence, he studied Vedanta and Hindu astrology. After recovering from the disease, he moved his residence to Kozhikode in 1935 to take up the editorship of Kerala Pathrika, a newspaper founded by Chengalathu Kunhirama Menon but in 1938, joined Malabar Christian College again as a faculty where he worked until 1942. Sanjayan married Karthyayani Amma, his cousin, in 1927 and had a son from the marriage which was short-lived as his wife died in 1930. He also lost his only son in 1939. He died on September 13, 1943, at the age of 40, at his Thalassery residence.  Legacy  Sanjayan's contribution to the Malayalam literature were mainly satirical essays criticizing the contemporary social state. Along with E. V. Krishna Pillai, he is considered as the pioneer of humorous and light essays in Malayalam literature. Somarajan Padinjarittam, who translated Sanjayan's writings into English under the title, Selected Works - Sanjayan, compared him to writers such as P. G. Wodehouse, Stephen Leacock, James Thurber, and Mark Twain. It is reported that, even when criticising the socio-political issues, he did not resort to personal slagging. His oeuvre is composed of saitirical verses such as in Hasyanjali, literary criticisms compiled as Sahitya Nikasham and Aaru Niroopanangal and books such as Vyamayanam and Adhyopaharam. he also translated Othello of William Shakespeare into Malayalam. Sanjayan's career as a journalist started with his assignment as the editor of Kerala Pathrika in 1935 which lasted for only a year until he founded Sanjayan, an eponymous humour journal, in 1936. Later, he was the editor-in-chief of Viswaroopam, a satirical magazine where he made satirical remarks even on such names as Vallathol Narayana Menon. He also wrote in Mathrubhumi and one of his satirical pieces on the atrocities of the British Army earned the newspaper a temporary ban.

It was known as Diocese of Massa Marittima before 1978. Up until 1458, it was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Pisa; since 1458, it has been a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Siena.\\"Diocese of Massa Marittima-Piombino\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016.\\"Diocese of Massa Marittima-Piombino\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved March 11, 2016. The territory of the diocese includes the islands of Elba and Pianosa, and (up to 1817) Capraia. History Massa Maritima was first mentioned in the eighth century. It grew at the expense of Populonia, an ancient city of the Etruscans. Populonia was besieged by Sulla, and in Strabo's time was already declining; later it suffered at the hands of Totila, King of the Lombards, and in 817 of a Byzantine fleet. After this, the bishops of Populonia abandoned the town, which was destroyed in the 9th century, and moved their seat to Castrum Corniae.Kehr Italia pontificia III, p. 268. In the eleventh century, the bishops established their residence at Massa, though continuing to call themselves bishops of Populonia. Bishop Martinus (1181‚Äì1196) is the first to be called Bishop of Populonia e Massa.Cesaretti, p. 33. Galli, p. 346. On 22 April 1138, Populonia was made a suffragan of Pisa by Pope Innocent II, who had once been living in exile in Pisa; the bull stated that the grant was a compensation for Pisa's loss of the overlordship of the bishops of Corsica earlier in the century.J. von Pflugk-Harttung, Acta pontificum romanorum inedita Vol. II (Stuttgart 1884), pp. 294-295, no. 332. Before 1138, Populonia had been directly subject to the Holy See (Papacy), and attended the Roman synods.Kehr, pp. 268, 271 no. 10. In 1226 Massa became a commune under the protection of Pisa. In 1307 it made an alliance with Siena, which was the cause of many wars between the two republics. On 22 April 1459, Pope Pius II issued the bull \\"Triumphans Pastor\\", in which he raised the diocese of Siena to metropolitan status, and assigned to it as suffragans the dioceses of Soano, Chiusi, Massa, and Grosseto.: \\"Necnon filias nostras praedictas Suanensem, Clusinensem et Grossetanensem et Massanensem Ecclesias, cum suis civitatibus et dioecesibus, iuribus el pertinentiis universis, Ecclesiae Seuensi et arcbiepiscopis praefatis, tamquam illorum metropolitanis et de eorum provincia....\\" The Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), in order to ensure that all Catholics received proper spiritual attention, decreed the reorganization of the diocesan structure of Italy and the consolidation of small and struggling dioceses. It also recommended the abolition of anomalous units such as exempt territorial prelatures.In its decree Christus Dominus, section 22, it stated: \\"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units.\\" This applied to Populonia, which had a tiny population but was part of the name of the diocese, while the much larger city of Piombino, which was a civil administrative center, had no recognition.\\"Cum vero civitas Populonia, olim opibus copiosa, nunc ad paucos incolas redacta sit dum e contra urbs Plumbinum in praesens incolarum, magistratuum ac publicorum munerum habentium, negotiorum et religionis operum prospera incrementa susceperit....\\" On 14 May 1978, at the instruction of Pope Paul VI, the name \\"Populonia\\" was removed from the name of the diocese, and the name \\"Piombino\\" substituted. The name \\"Populonia\\", however, was preserved as the name of a new titular diocese.Acta Apostolicae Sedis Vol. 70 (Citta del Vaticano 1978), p. 434. \\"...titulus Ecclesiae Populoniensis in indicem sedium titularium inseratur atque Episcopis conferatur qui titulares nuncupantur.\\" The first known Bishop of Populonia was Atellus, or Asellus (about 495). Among the bishops of Massa were Antonio da Massa Marittima (1430), a former minister general of the Franciscans, and legate of Pope Boniface IX; Leonardo Dati (1467), author of poetic satires. Massa Marittima's most famous native son was Saint Bernardino (of Siena) (1380‚Äì1444), whose father was the governor of Massa at the time of Bernardino's birth. Chapter and cathedral Co- cathedral of Sant'Antimo in Piombino The cathedral of Massa, begun in the first years of the 11th century, is dedicated to Saint Cerbonius, one of its earliest bishops, who was named protector of the city. The cathedral is also a parish church. Its earliest construction is Romanesque, but, beginning in 1287, it was extended under the supervision of Giovanni Pisano. The present cathedral structure was consecrated by Bishop Vincenzo Casali (1585‚Äì 1587) on 23 March 1586. The cathedral is served and administered by a Chapter, composed of two dignities (the Archpriest and the Provost) and ten Canons.Ughelli, p. 702. In 1679, there were only six Canons. In 1770 there were eight Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 260, note 1; VI, p. 280, note 1. Since the cathedral has parishioners, the Archpriest is responsible for their spiritual care.In 1679, the city had only 150 inhabitants; in 1770, the population was around 400. The co-cathedral in Piombino, once the convent of the Augustinian monks, was built through the generosity of the Lord of Piombino, Jacopo d'Appiano, between 1374 and 1377.Cappelletti, pp. 711-712. The Augustinians were ejected in 1806, under the regulations of the French occupation, and S. Antimo was severely damaged. The co-cathedral is dedicated to Saint Antimo.Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica Vol. LXXVIII (Venezia: Emiliana 1856), p. 33. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. Bishop Nicolaus Beruti, O.P. (1394‚Äì1404) held a diocesan synod on 20 May 1396, at which, having considered the effects of the wars and famine, it was decided to reduce the decima (tithe).Cesaretti, p. 155. A diocesan synod was held by Bishop Vincenzo Casali (1585‚Äì1587) on 10‚Äì11 April 1586.Constitutiones et Decreta synodalia D. Vincentii Casalii Massae et Populoniae Episcopi anno 1586. habita. Bononiae: Io. Rossium 1586. On 18‚Äì20 April 1723, Bishop Eusebio Ciani (1719‚Äì1770) presided over a diocesan synod, held in the cathedral at Massa. He held another synod in 1746, at which the parish priest of the island of Capraia was raised to the dignity of archpriest.The title of archpriest lasted from 1746 to 1817, when Capraia was incorporated into the diocese of Genoa. Arturo Ferretto, \\"I Primordi e lo sviluppo del Cristianesmo nel in Liguria ed in particolare a Genova,\\" Bishop Giovanni Battista Boracchia (1892‚Äì1924) held a diocesan synod in Massa on 11‚Äì13 October 1921.

The two main fluid compartments are the intracellular and extracellular compartments. The intracellular compartment is the space within the organism's cells; it is separated from the extracellular compartment by cell membranes. About two- thirds of the total body water of humans is held in the cells, mostly in the cytosol, and the remainder is found in the extracellular compartment. The extracellular fluids may be divided into three types: interstitial fluid in the \\"interstitial compartment\\" (surrounding tissue cells and bathing them in a solution of nutrients and other chemicals), blood plasma and lymph in the \\"intravascular compartment\\" (inside the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels), and small amounts of transcellular fluid such as ocular and cerebrospinal fluids in the \\"transcellular compartment\\". The interstitial and intravascular compartments readily exchange water and solutes but the third extracellular compartment, the transcellular, is thought of as separate from the other two and not in dynamic equilibrium with them.  Intracellular compartment  The intracellular fluid, also known as cytosol, is all fluid contained inside the cells. It is the matrix in which cellular organelles are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the cytoplasm. The cell membranes are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in osmotic equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulfate ions. In the cell nucleus the fluid component of the nucleoplasm is called the nucleosol.  Extracellular compartment  The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its extracellular fluid (ECF) contains about one-third of total body water. Intravascular compartment The main intravascular fluid in mammals is blood, a complex mixture with elements of a suspension (blood cells), colloid (globulins), and solutes (glucose and ions). The blood represents both the intracellular compartment (the fluid inside the blood cells) and the extracellular compartment (the blood plasma). The average volume of plasma in the average () male is approximately . The volume of the intravascular compartment is regulated in part by hydrostatic pressure gradients, and by reabsorption by the kidneys.  Interstitial compartment  The interstitial compartment (also called \\"tissue space\\") surrounds tissue cells. It is filled with interstitial fluid, including lymph.http://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/FluidBook/fl2_1.php Interstitial fluid provides the immediate microenvironment that allows for movement of ions, proteins and nutrients across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the blood capillaries and recollected by lymphatic capillaries. In the average male () human body, the interstitial space has approximately of fluid. Transcellular compartment The third extracellular compartment, the transcellular, consists of those spaces in the body where fluid does not normally collect in larger amounts, or where any significant fluid collection is physiologically nonfunctional. Examples of transcellular spaces include the eye, the central nervous system, the peritoneal and pleural cavities, and the joint capsules. A small amount of fluid, called transcellular fluid, does exist normally in such spaces. For example, the aqueous humor, the vitreous humor, the cerebrospinal fluid, the serous fluid produced by the serous membranes, and the synovial fluid produced by the synovial membranes are all transcellular fluids. They are all very important, yet there is not much of each. For example, there is only about of cerebrospinal fluid in the entire central nervous system at any moment. All of the aforementioned fluids are produced by active cellular processes working with blood plasma as the raw material, and they are all more or less similar to blood plasma except for certain modifications tailored to their function. For example, the cerebrospinal fluid is made by various cells of the CNS, mostly the ependymal cells, from blood plasma. Fluid shift Fluid shifts occur when the body's fluids move between the fluid compartments. Physiologically, this occurs by a combination of hydrostatic pressure gradients and osmotic pressure gradients. Water will move from one space into the next passively across a semi permeable membrane until the hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients balance each other. Many medical conditions can cause fluid shifts. When fluid moves out of the intravascular compartment (the blood vessels), blood pressure can drop to dangerously low levels, endangering critical organs such as the brain, heart and kidneys; when it shifts out of the cells (the intracellular compartment), cellular processes slow down or cease from intracellular dehydration; when excessive fluid accumulates in the interstitial space, oedema develops; and fluid shifts into the brain cells can cause increased cranial pressure. Fluid shifts may be compensated by fluid replacement or diuretics. Third spacing \\"Third spacing\\" is the abnormal accumulation of fluid into an extracellular and extravascular space. In medicine, the term is often used with regard to loss of fluid into interstitial spaces, such as with burns or edema, but it can also refer to fluid shifts into a body cavity (transcellular space), such as ascites and pleural effusions. With regard to severe burns, fluids may pool on the burn site (i.e. fluid lying outside of the interstitial tissue, exposed to evaporation) and cause depletion of the fluids. With pancreatitis or ileus, fluids may \\"leak out\\" into the peritoneal cavity, also causing depletion of the intracellular, interstitial or vascular compartments. Patients who undergo long, difficult operations in large surgical fields can collect third-space fluids and become intravascularly depleted despite large volumes of intravenous fluid and blood replacement. The precise volume of fluid in a patient's third spaces changes over time and is difficult to accurately quantify. Third spacing conditions may include peritonitis, pyometritis, and pleural effusions. Hydrocephalus and glaucoma are theoretically forms of third spacing, but the volumes are too small to induce significant shifts in blood volumes, or overall body volumes, and thus are generally not referred to as third spacing.

Winram was educated at Liverpool Collegiate Institute. He worked for his father as a mechanical engineer until emigrating to Canada and settling in the County of Simcoe, Ontario. In 1878, he moved to Manitoba, where he was a farmer in the Pembina Mountain district. He was acclaimed to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as the Liberal candidate for the electoral district of Dufferin South in 1879 and was re-elected in 1883 and 1886, and then was acclaimed for Manitou in 1888. From August 28, 1888 to February 12, 1891, he was the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

This includes the bilateral ties between Canada and the individual Latin American states, plurilateral ties between Canada and any group of those states, or multilateral relations through groups like the Organization of American States (OAS). Canada and Latin America share ties of geography as part of the Western Hemisphere and history through the shared experience of European colonization. Culturally, Canada shares with the other societies in the Americas a mixture of European, Amerindian, and immigrant influences. For both Canadians and Latin Americans, the importance of relations with the United States may overshadow relations with each other. However Canada's importance in the region has risen since joining the OAS in 1990. Historical relations to 1968 In the decades following Canadian Confederation in 1867, Canada had limited political involvement, but after 1898 had significant economic ties in the Caribbean, Mexico and Brazil and Canadians went as businessmen and missionaries to a number of other countries.J.C.M. Ogelsby, Gringos from the Far North, Essays in the History of Canadian-Latin American Relations, 1866-1968. Macmillan 1976. As Canadian foreign policy was largely constrained by Canada's ties to the British Empire, political and economic relations remained tethered and controlled. Even after Canada gained political autonomy in foreign relations with the Statute of Westminster (1931) relations with Latin America remained weak due to domestic economic turmoil.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 11-12. Following increased solidarity between regions in Latin America throughout the 1800s came the birth of the Pan-American Union in 1910. Between 1909 and 1941 Latin American states (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and others) repeatedly appealed for Canadian involvement in union. In accordance with the Monroe Doctrine the United States actively opposed Canadian involvement as Canada's foreign relations were subject to the interests of a European power, Britain. Nevertheless, Canada remained outside of the union for reasons of economic disinterest.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 11-12. + McKenna, Peter. \\"Canada and the OAS\\". (Ottawa: Carlton University Press, 1995) 66-67. By the early 1940s, Canada had become a relatively important industrial producer that was in desperate need of integration in additional foreign markets. Devastation in Europe due to World War II made Latin America a logical alternative. Unfortunately for Canadian interests, the period following the Second World War marked an important shift in the world political and economic order that saw the growth and spread of communism. The onset of the Cold War had important implications for Canadian foreign policy. Significantly, Canadian officials saw Latin America as a region particularly vulnerable to the spread of communism because of vast underdevelopment and socio-economic disparities.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 31. More importantly for Canada, however, was the immense propagation of American economic and political dominance and Americanization throughout the world. While Canada, like the United States during the early cold war years, could be viewed as a liberal-democracy devoted to the spread of capitalism and free market ideals, the Canadian form of the ideology was inherently more accepting of socialist facets. Effectively, Canada grew closer to many Latin American states and often acted as a mediator between the United States and Latin America.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 47. Trudeau years 1968‚Äì1984 Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau attending the North‚ÄìSouth Summit along with his Mexican counterpart, President Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo in Canc√∫n, Mexico; October 1981. The early years of Pierre Trudeau's time in office as Prime Minister of Canada marked an important shift in Canada's role in international politics. During this time Canada, under Trudeau's realist and pragmatist ideals, began to view relations with previously untapped global regions such as Latin America as vital to Canada's future political and economic interests. Trudeau illuminates these ideas: \\"We have to take greater account of the ties which bind us to other nations in this hemisphere ‚Äì in the Caribbean, Latin America ‚Äì and of their economic needs. We have to explore relations with Latin America, where more than 400 million people will live by the turn of the century and where we have substantial interests\\" Stevenson, Brian J.R. \\"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 114.‚Äì Pierre Elliot Trudeau Between October and November 1968, Canada sent a delegate of various ministers to tour nine Latin American states (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala)Stevenson, Brian J.R. \\"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 116. as a stage in Canada's foreign policy review. From the excursion Canada aimed to a) evaluate potential benefits from increased relations, b) explore global policy congruence with individual Latin American states, c) improve overall relations in South America. Ultimately, the mission garnered results on several fronts related to issues of economic cooperation, integration and growth, security and nuclear non-proliferation, as well as general information gathering.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 75, 81. The 1968 mission had two profound institutional effects. First, the mission directly led to the creation of a Latin American task force in 1969. This task force was at the forefront of issues involving Canada's role/potential role in joining the Organization of American States (OAS). Second, the mission was elemental in establishing the founding principles of the Latin American section of Trudeau's complete revision of foreign policy ‚Äì a series of documents entitled \\"Foreign Policy for Canadians\\" released in 1970.Daudelin, Jean. \\"Canada and the Americas: a Time for Modesty\\". Behind the Headlines 64.3. (Canadian Institute of International Affairs 2007) 2. This series of documents considered massive changes in global power dynamics (e.g. the reduced threat of communism), the role of non-state actors, and the absolute necessity of preserving Canadian independence.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 67. In the years following these diplomatic advancements came several key initiatives, programs and institutions. In 1971, to deal with issues of Latin American integration, Trudeau founded the Bureau of Western-Hemispheric Affairs. In 1972, Canada officially entered the OAS under observer status and joined the Inter-American Development Bank to increasingly aid developmental initiatives in Latin America. Further, by 1972, Canada had seen an increase of roughly 40% in exports to the region in only 4 years and made tremendous progress with individual states like Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. In spite of some minor shortcomings in certain Latin American states, Canada was overwhelming pleased with advancements in relations between the two regions by 1973.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 83-84, 90. By the mid-1970s Canada's national policy toward Latin America ‚Äì and other regions of the globe ‚Äì had almost completely diverged from that of the United States. This was an especially momentous time in Canadian foreign politics because, until this point, Canada had been under the vast political and economic influence of her neighbour to the South. This incredible divergence was essentially manifested in Mitchell Sharp's \\"Options for the Future\\" (otherwise known as the 'Third Option Paper'), which reaffirmed the tenets of \\"Foreign Policy for Canadians\\", but considered U.S.‚ÄìCanada relations in greater detail. Sharp's paper advocated the growth of Canadian economic, political and cultural 'distinctiveness', but did not encourage alienation from America. Ultimately, Sharp's ideas had a profound and lasting effect on Canadian policy and were central to the outward growth of Canada in the international sphere for many years.Stevenson, Brian J.R. \\"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 95. By and large, the 1970s represented a period of growth in Canada‚ÄìLatin America relations that produced episodes of incredible significance and garnered tremendous potential for future relations. Importantly, the emerging distinctiveness of Canada on the global stage (in an increasingly multi-polar international system) was particularly visible in relations with Latin America. In radical deviation from the policies and ideological attitudes of the United States, Canada pursued policies of tolerance and acceptance with respect to Latin American states. Canadian tolerance was evident throughout the 1970s ‚Äì with the acceptance of thousands of leftist Chilean refugees between 1970 and 1980, opposition to various American political interventions in South America, or Trudeau's tour of Mexico, Venezuela, and Cuba in 1976.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 106. New notions of trans-hemispheric integration/relations began to take prominence as Canada found itself involved in Latin American affairs in a meaningful way. By the late 1970s Canada called for the progressive advancement of the OAS that was deemed by Canadian observers as ineffective and deficient. By 1979, Canada sought global channels and forums, namely the United Nations, to vocalize discontent, concerns, and thoughts on inter-American affairs that included trading blocs, nuclear proliferation issues, and human rights abuses (in the case of Argentina).McKenna, Peter. \\"Canada and the OAS\\". (Ottawa: Carlton University Press, 1995) 92-94. The period between 1980 and 1984 would mark the final term of Trudeau. By this point, Canadian interests and objectives in the hemisphere were completely unsynchronized with the views and objectives of the United States (especially under the conservative reigns of Ronald Reagan, 1981‚Äì1989). During this time, Canada favoured leftist policies both at home and abroad and continued to nurture ideological diversity, while the United States, under Reagan, emphasized the importance of laissez-faire capitalism, (in a resurgence of anti-communist discourse), reduction of the welfare state, and discrete military intervention to accommodate American interests in Latin America and the world. Reagan's rationale was unequivocally based in the decline of American hegemony and aimed to bring prominence back to America by staunch opposition to left-wing movements in Latin America such as the Nicaraguan Sandinistas.Stevenson, Brian J.R. \\"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 96, 97 Importantly, however, Canada revived Third Option ideals of political and economic distinctiveness that was briefly lost to Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives from June 1979 to February 1980. Diversification and distinctiveness of Canadian policy were evident in Trudeau's creation of the National Energy Program, the extension of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the formulation of specific Central American policy in 1982. Such advancements in Canadian policy were almost immediately contested by the United States. At any rate, Canada had good reason to be optimistic in the international sphere. Unfortunately, just as Trudeau's policies of peace and diplomacy in Latin America began to peak the Latin American debt crisis retarded any potential growth beginning in 1982. In fact, in a four-year period between 1980 and 1984 Canadian exports to Latin America were cut in half. Despite this setback, Canadian investment in the region remained high and the government of Canada remained committed to the pursuit of mutually beneficial relations between the two regions.Stevenson, Brian J.R. \\"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 96-97. Post-Trudeau policy Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Argentine President Mauricio Macri in Buenos Aires, 2016. The Mulroney years were a tumultuous time for Canadian foreign policy. Brian Mulroney, after being elected in 1984, almost immediately began to retract the ideals of distinctiveness ushered in by Sharp and Trudeau in favour of closer ties with the United States. Most notably, Mulroney would negotiate the landmark Canada‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement in 1987 (which would later evolve into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)). However, in spite of overarching support for American policies Mulroney did deviate and even oppose American policies in several key respects. Importantly, Canada remained vocally opposed to Reagan's various anti-communist interventions in Latin America under Mulroney, and accepted refugees from several Latin American states. Yet, the acceptance of ideological diversity under Trudeau had already been fundamentally altered as Mulroney pursued policies based in American style neo-liberal economic policy and laissez faire capitalism. Clearly, these ideals were increasingly manifested and enforced in Latin American and helped garner widespread regime transition.Stevenson, Brian J.R. \\"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 97-99. While the onset of the Cold War helped spur interconnectedness between Canada and Latin America the erosion of Soviet power in the late 1980s gave way to an even more robust partnership. By 1985 the Soviet empire was becoming increasingly bankrupt and unable to promote socialist ideology abroad. For many leftist Latin American states this generated a significant void in support for their vast nationalist/leftist movements. Thus, from the altering world balance came the proliferation of peace talks, the emergence of new economic regimes, and increasingly intertwined relations between the Northern and the Southern Western hemisphere. Canada's policies towards the region revolved around this new economic order that saw the distribution of power slipping from a bipolar system to multiple states, organizations, and corporations.Rochlin, James. \\"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 164. One of the most crucial developments of trans-hemispheric relations for Canada during Mulroney's time in office came in Canada's official enrollment in the OAS in 1990. Until this point Canada's position on the institution was that it existed as a tool of American political and economic preponderance in Latin America. However, with the erosion of Cold War tensions, waning American hegemonic interests in the region, and the proliferation of democracy throughout Latin America Canada saw the increasing importance of the OAS as a unifying institution.McKenna, Peter. \\"Canada and the OAS\\". (Ottawa: Carlton University Press, 1995) 143-145. Canada's acceptance into the OAS in 1990 marked the continuation of strengthened interaction with the Americas. Along with the political and economic benefits associated with this union came increased support of democratic ideals and free trade discourse, as well as increased discussion of trans-hemispheric issues such as racism, sexism, wealth distribution and other social-cultural concerns.McKenna, Peter. \\"Canada and the OAS\\". (Ottawa: Carlton University Press, 1995) 159. One prominent factor in the evolution of Canadian policy toward Latin America is seen in the concept of globalization. The process of globalization has had a major and in integrating Canada and Latin America; at the same time, this increasing integration has also fueled globalization. The emergence of strong and diverse foreign markets (especially those in countries like Brazil and Mexico) has ushered in a series of foreign policy adjustments in Canada that have revolved around investment, development, and increased commerce in such markets. In recent years Canadian policy adjustments have helped furnish an increase in total trade with Latin America ‚Äì $50 billion in 2006 (up 500% from 1990). Likewise, North American led implementation of western style laissez faire capitalism, trade liberalization policies, and the dissolution of tariffs has had an overwhelming effect on Northern integration (and in some cases, dominance) of Latin America. Yet the effect of globalization on integrating the regions through foreign policy extends beyond politics and economics. The mass movement of people and information across borders (an inherent facet of globalization) has also garnered policy changes in respect to migration and cultural movement over the past few decades.Daudelin, Jean. \\"Canada and the Americas: a Time for Modesty\\". Behind the Headlines 64.3. (Canadian Institute of International Affairs 2007) 18, 19. Since the early 1990s Canadian relations with Latin America have, to an extent, leveled off and Canada can be considered an important actor in the continued development, growth and integration of the entire hemisphere. However, in many ways, the future of Canada as a part of the Americas remains uncertain. Questions of complete hemispheric economic integration, unified currency and free trade remain prominent issues in the media. In 2007, for one of his first major trips overseas, Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited Colombia, Chile, Barbados and Haiti, while the same time the governor general, Micha√´lle Jean, was visiting Brazil. Observers said this was intended increase Canada's visibility in the region and to remind Canadians of the region's importance.The Economist - \\"Harper steps out\\" In 2010, Canada was specifically excluded (along with the United States) from a newly formed regional body, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, which includes all other sovereign states in the Americas. Canada‚ÄìVenezuela relations Canada's most important initiative in its foreign policy toward Latin America in recent years has been its efforts, along with partners in the hemisphere, to pressure the regime of Nicol√° Maduro in Venezuela to allow free and fair elections and end the political, economic and humanitarian crisis in this key South American nation. Canada-Venezuela relations have been on good terms since the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the two countries in the 1950s. Those relations however began to sour under Conservative Prime Minister Harper and President Hugo Ch√°vez, and became sour under Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau (2015- ). Indeed, over the past few years, Canada has stepped out of its comfort zone in hemispheric affairs, to speak and act forcefully, as Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland put it, in solidarity with \\"the people of Venezuela and their desire to restore democracy and human in Venezuela\\". On January 23rd, 2019, Minister Freeland issued the statement that ‚ÄúCanada recognizes Juan Guaid√≥, President of the National Assembly, as the interim President of Venezuela.\\" On that occasion she called the Nicol√°s Maduro government \\"despicable\\". Ottawa imposed targeted sanctions (under the Special Economic Measures Act and the new Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act) against 70 Maduro government officials. Canada has sanctions and related measures in place against nineteen other countries in the world, but only against Venezuela in the southern hemisphere. Canada has been an active member of the Lima Group to put pressure on the Maduro regime. The Lima Group was established on August 8, 2017, in Lima, Peru, to coordinate participating countries‚Äô efforts and apply international pressure on Venezuela. Meetings of the group have been regularly attended by representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia.

It was built in the 12th century.  Location  The ruins are on a hill, high, on the northern side of the Speyerbach valley (Speyerbachtal) in the Palatinate Forest (Pf√§lzerwald).  History  In the 12th and 13th centuries, Elmstein was built as a Palatine castle in order to guard the route through the valley. The feoffees held the title of Schenk, a German aristocratic title that originally meant cup bearer. The castle occupied by the Electorate of the Palatinate. Between 1220 and 1230, the lower curtain wall was built. Emperor Louis IV of Bavaria ceded the castle to his cousin, the Count Palatine. From 1419 to 1437, the castle was occupied by Count John V of Sponheim. In 1466, the castle was enfeoffed by Frederick I the Elector, to Erhard of Remchingen. In 1513, in the course of changes of ownership, Henry of Pagk was given the castle as a fief. During the German Peasants' War in 1525 the castle was damaged. Count Palatine John Casimir inherited the castle in 1576. The castle was also damaged during the Thirty Years' War in 1648. In 1689, during the War of the Palatine Succession, the castle fell into a permanent state of disrepair. Since then, the castle has been in private ownership. Remains The remains of the parts of the original curtain walls, the palas and the shield wall are still able to be seen today.

The screenplay by David Boehm is a remake of the Barbara Stanwyck film Illicit (1931), both crediting a story (actually a play) by Edith Fitzgerald and Robert Riskin. The film focuses on a pair of lovers, commercial illustrator Helen Bauer (Bette Davis) and advertising writer Don Peterson (Gene Raymond), who have been living together quite happily (in separate apartments) for some time. One night, after hiding in Helen‚Äôs bedroom until their party guests have all left, Don announces that he is tired of sneaking around. He wants marriage‚Äîand possibly children‚Äîand Helen finally agrees, although she is afraid that it will wreck their relationship. Her predictions of trouble‚Äîincreased by the stresses of opening their own advertising agency‚Äîcome true, but in the end, with the serendipitous intervention of their perpetually inebriated friend, Van (Frank McHugh), they reconcile and resume the mixed blessings of wedded bliss. Plot Helen Bauer (Bette Davis) is a glamorous, successful, headstrong, and very liberated New York graphic artist with modern ideas about romance. She is involved with Don Peterson (Gene Raymond) but is not prepared to sacrifice her independence by entering into matrimony. The two agree to wed only to pacify Helen's conventional immigrant father Adolphe (Alphonse Ethier), whose Old World views spur him to condemn their affair. They form a business partnership, but financial problems at their advertising agency put a strain on the marriage and Don begins seeing Peggy Smith (Kay Strozzi), one of his married clients. Convinced it was marriage that disrupted their relationship, Helen suggests they live apart but remain lovers. When Don discovers Helen is dating his business rival, playboy Nick Malvyn (Monroe Owsley), he returns to Peggy, but in reality his heart belongs to his wife. Agreeing their love will help their marriage survive its problems, the two reconcile and settle into domestic bliss. The plot is unusual for its time in that Helen is not denigrated for her beliefs about marriage and Don is not depicted as being a cad. In addition, although they are sleeping together and unmarried, neither is concerned about the possibility of children, and certain dialog could suggest that they are using birth control.

Zanuck resigned from Warners to form his own production company, Twentieth Century Pictures, which eventually merged with Fox to become 20th Century Fox. The prologue to the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? includes a scene from Ex-Lady as an example of former child star Jane Hudson's failure to achieve screen success as an adult due to her lack of talent. Davis and Raymond in a scene from the trailer for Ex-Lady. Critical reception The New York Times in a contemporary review from 1933, described the film as \\"an honestly written and truthfully enacted picture of the domestic problems which harass two persons in love with one another\\".New York Times review In contrast, a more recent review in TV Guide called it a \\"lame little melodrama notable chiefly for being the first film to have Bette Davis' name above the title\\".TV Guide review Legacy In her 1962 autobiography, Davis expressed her disdain for the film calling it a ‚Äúpiece of junk‚Äù. She also stated that the film ‚Äúwas supposed to be provocative and provoked anyone of sensibility to nausea‚Äù. For the film, Davis had been given the Hollywood glamor girl treatment, which she resented for she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt the type to be glamorized‚Äù. She was even more outraged over the marketing campaign for the film which ‚Äúfalsely pictured her as half-naked‚Äù on the films posters, declaring that her shame was only exceeded by her fury. She hated this film and this part of her career so much that she admitted her ‚Äúconscious tastefully avoided‚Äù all memories of this film. Despite Davis‚Äôs dislike of the film, she admittedly had more disgust for Parachute Jumper (1933) In 2013, the Warner Archive Collection included this film in its DVD box set of Forbidden Hollywood Collection: Volume 7; with The Hatchet Man (1932), Skyscraper Souls (1932), and Employees' Entrance (1933).

He continued to add material until at least 1666, five years before he was murdered in 1671. The original 17th century manuscript was bequeathed to University College Dublin (UCD), by Dublin solicitor Arthur Cox in 1929, and can be consulted in UCD Library Special Collections. The manuscript can be viewed online at Irish Script on Screen, which is available in English, and in Irish. Leabhar na nGenealach, was reprinted, and published in a five volume edition in Dublin in 2004 as The Great Book of Irish Genealogies. Description and compilation Described by Eoin MacNeill \\"by far the largest and fullest body of Irish genealogical lore\\", it contains roughly twice as much material as found in the Book of Ballymote and the Book of Lecan. It preserves notes on families from all parts of Ireland, Gaelic Scotland, the pre-Gaelic, Viking and Old English peoples of Ireland. It features an eighteen-page preface, nine 'books' or divisions and a seventy-four-page Clar or general index in double columns. It consists of eight hundred and seventy one pages, 95% of which is in Mac Fhirbhisigh's handwriting. The remainder is in the hand of an unknown amanuensis, and incorporates some pages written in 1636 by M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh. Many questions concern Leabhar na nGenealach. In the words of Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le: > \\" ... who or what prompted Mac Fhirbhisigh to undertake the compilation of > Leabhar na nGenealach? ... how much planning and organisation (such as the > collection of source material) preceded the writing of the book ..? Did he, > at any time during the compilation ... entertain hopes of seeing it printed > ...? Unfortunately, we have very little in which to base even the most > tentative of answers to these questions. We simply do not know ...\\" Nor is it known how he supported himself in Galway, though he did commissions for the Poor Clares and John Lynch while there. O Muraile suggests that it was a work compiled in his spare time, in between possible tutorial work for the children of local families (see The Tribes of Galway). Unlike the Four Masters, he appears to have had neither patron nor sponsorship of any sort. As to the question of why he wrote Leabhar na nGenealach, Mac Fhirbhisigh himself stated it was his intention to \\"... do mh√≥rughadh gl√≥ire D√© agus do gh√©unamh i√∫il do ch√°ch i ccoithchinne / to increase the glory of God and to give knowledge to everyone generally\\". Thus it appears to have been a labour of love, and as a strong defence of traditional Gaelic learning, though not uncritically so. That it seems to be a book written for all the peoples of Ireland is indicated by the following: > \\"Na slioinnte, iomorra, da suarraighe at√°id, n√≠ fuigfeam dar nde√≥in > √©anghloinneadh aca gan a aireamh √≥ a cheap f√©n / of the surnames, moreover, > however undistinguished they may be, we do not willing leave a single one of > them without reckoning it from its own stock\\". Contents D√≠onbhrollach (preface) This preface states it was ... compiled by Dubhaltach Mac Fhiribhisigh of Lec√°n, 1650. The d√≠onbhrollach describes the contents of the book, including: * An extended title on the contents, place and time of writing, author and purpose of composition. * A defence of senchas, the truthfulness and validity of the tradition. * Critical remarks on the supposed descent of all the Irish from M√≠l Esp√°ine * Mac Fhirbhisigh's law, which states: > It is customary for great lords that, when their families and kindreds > multiply, their clients and their followers are oppressed, injured and > wasted. [translation by Thomas Charles Edwards in Early Irish & Welsh > Kinship, p. 221] * How Leabhar na nGenealach deals with all race and all peoples of Ireland ‚Äì free and unfree tribes, Fir Bolg, Gaels and all subsequent invaders. * A note on dialect. * An apology by Mac Fhirbhisigh for any deficiencies of this first draft ...Till God give us another time more tranquil than this to re-write it. R√©mhr√°dh (introduction) Begins with the following introduction: \\"Senchus genealach gabh√°ltas uasal √âreann agus Albansgot go ccraobhsgaoileadh a ccineadhach √≥ cr√©udth√≥s na n-aimsior n-aicsidhe gus ani√∫ (mar ghebh mid / The history of the genealogies of the invasions of the nobles of Ireland and of the Scots of Alba with the genealogical branchings of their races from the beginning of visible times until today, as we find, according to the order\\". Mac Fhirbhisigh draws upon a recension of Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (The Book of the Taking of Ireland) by M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh for a summary which deals with the legendary invaders of Ireland from the time of Parthol√≥n to M√≠l Esp√°ine. Following this, Mac Fhirbhisigh begins the book proper, with the genealogies of S√≠ol √âreamh√≥in (√ârim√≥n). Leabhar I to IV This is the first division or 'book' of Leabhar na nGenealach. Titled \\"Craobhsgaoileadh Cloinne Parthol√≥n\\" (the propagation of the family of Parthol√≥n) it describes the ancestry and descendants of Parthol√≥n, who was the leader of the second group of people to settle in Ireland. It covers pages 27 to 30 in the autograph of the work. The following divisions cover all the invaders of Ireland up to the Milesians. Leabhar V Book five comprises some three hundred and fifty pages of the autograph, representing just under half of the total text. It concerns the following groups and dynasties, and their many sub-divisions: Cen√©l nE√≥gain and Cen√©l Conaill (Northern U√≠ N√©ill); Clann Cholm√°in and S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine (Southern U√≠ N√©ill); U√≠ Bri√∫in and U√≠ Fiachrach (Connachta); Airg√≠alla (including the U√≠ Maine, the D√©isi and the D√°l Riata); the Laigin. While much of Book Five's information is derived from the Book of Lecan or the Book of Ballymote, Mac Fhirbhisigh added material not found in either of these sources; indeed, much of it is entirely unique to Leabhar na nGenealach. In a small number of cases ‚Äì √ì N√©ill and Mac Suibhne ‚Äì this is due to Mac Fhirbhisigh updating pedigrees to his own lifetime. In the UF tract this applies to the later generations of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh, their pedigree appearing in no later manuscript. The Leabhar Oirghiallach is in many instances very obviously drawn from versions of the Books of Lecan and Ballymote, yet once again there is unique material concerning Clann Mac Domhnaill, a Gall√≥glaigh family. They derive from a leabhar teagloim, and a Leabhar Balbh Sh√©mus Mec Fhirbhisigh, neither of which now survives. The latter, The Dumb Book of S√©amus Mac Fhirbhisigh was written by Mac Fhirbhisigh's great-grandfather, S√©amus mac Diarmada Chaoich. Other sources for the remaining subjects include: Senchus fer n-Alban; the Book of U√≠ Maine, from sections now missing; Amhra Colm Cille; Opus chronologicum by Ubbo Emmius; versions of De Sh√≠l Chonairi M√≥ir, De Maccaib Conaire, the Duan Albanach; the poem 'Saor do leann√°n, a Leamhain' by Muireadhach Albanach √ì D√°laigh (fl. 'c'. 1200). Leabhar Laighin is in part derived from the books of Lecan and Ballymote, and the Book of Glendalough (aka Book of Leinster). However, once again, entirely unique material found in no other surviving manuscript is preserved here by Mac Fhirbhisigh. The only source explicitly named ‚Äì though he refers vaguely to other books ‚Äì is once called Leabhar Buidhe Lecan Mec Fhirbhisigh, now lost. Leabhar VI This book outlines the history and genealogical ramifications of the descendants of √çor son of M√≠l Esp√°ine, known as the S√≠ol √çr. The material was derived from Leabhar U√≠ Dubhag√°in (aka Leabhar Ua Maine). This section is followed by a shorter one treating of the D√°l nAraidi and the descendants of Fergus mac R√≥ich. It ends with a version of Clann Ollamhan Uaisle Eamhna, similar to, though not exactly, the one found in Leabhar Ua Maine. Mac Fhirbhisigh added \\"a great amount of additional material ... both in the margins and interlineally ... those inserted between the lines are variant readings, some of them of considerable interest, deriving as they do from quite a different recension of the work; ... represented by just one manuscript older than LGen, namely RIA B iv2.\\" Leabhar VII Book seven deals with the descendants of Ebhar mac Milidh, written or begun in 1649, comprising pages 599 to 689 (eight-five pages are blank). As Mac Fhirbhisigh intended to merely summarise material, he did not reproduce the original texts, which were extracts from Saltair Chaisil, written in Latin. Pages 640.5 to 645.5 feature the descendants of Brian B√≥ruma, such as the O'Briens, including the Anglo-Irish Plunkett family. This was a fabrication, based on the Plunkett's status in the late 16th century, claiming them as descended from King Donnchad mac Briain, who died in Rome in 1064. As did Geoffrey Keating, Mac Fhirbhisgh reserves doubts on this, though pointing out that it should not be discounted merely because of Donnchad's age, as \\"there is no period in a man's life in which he may not beget.\\" The families of Eustace, Bennett and Power, along with others, are given the same ancestor. Further sections concern the descendants of Cian mac Ailill Aulom, which were at least partly assembled in the early 8th century. The final section is at least in part derived from the Book of Ui Maine. Leabhar VIII Titled Naoimhsheanchas, this book concerns the genealogies of the Irish saints. \\"This now extends from p. 692 to p. 753, but it contains various layers of material inserted at different times and from quite a variety of sources. They include the Book of Leinster, the Book of Ui Maine, Leabhar Breac, and C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh's recension of Naoimhsheanchas Naomh Inse F√°il. Mac Fhirbhisigh thought well enough of √ì Cl√©irigh's additions to incorporate them into LGen. While most of the text was written at that period [i.e., c.1650], it is clear from variations in the ink and handwriting that Dubhaltach made numerous later additions to the work. The most notable of these appear to date from 1653, and other insertions may have been made in 1657 and 1664.\\" The Naoimhsheanchas is set out in much the same manner as Leabhar na nGenealach itself; \\"... the layout of the saints genealogies (on pp. 697‚Äì739) exactly parallels the sequence of the secular genealogies of the Gaoidhil (or Gaelic people) in LGen.\\" R√©m R√≠ogharaidhe √âreann, a catalogue of the Kings of Ireland to 1198, concludes the book. Mac Fhirbhisigh's main source is very likely to be RIA MS C iii3 or volume c of the autograph section of the Annals of the Four Masters ‚Äì which he refers to as Leabhar Airison Fhearghaill U√≠ Ghadhra, Fearghal √ì Gadhra being a patron of the annals ‚Äì covering the years AM 2242 to AD 1171. Mac Fhirbhisigh notes that the text was completed \\"...i cCol√°isde na Gaillmhe dhia C√©adaoin vii. Augusti. anno MDCXLIX / in the college of Galway, 8 August 1649.\\" Given that Galway was within days of plague, famine and siege, O Muraile expressed the wish \\"for the merest hint by Mac Fhirbhisigh of what conditions were like in the stricken city while he was penning his list of Irish kings!\\" Leabhar IX and the Cl√°r Covering pages 768 to 852, it consists of eleven distinct sections, almost all on the post-Gaelic invaders (Vikings, Normans, Welsh, etc. ..). Pages 853‚Äì932 comprise the Cl√°r, or index of the secular genealogies, while pages 926‚Äì932, Cl√°r Naomh n√âireann, is an index concerning Irish saints. It finishes with a dedication and note by Mac Fhirbhisigh: Ad maiorem Dei gloriam, DF do theagair agus rus graif for Iuil, 1653 / To the greater glory of God. D[ubhaltach Mac] F[hirbhisigh] arranged and wrote it during July (?) 1653. This is followed by three poems from pages 935 to 957: 'Triallam timcheall na Fodla'; Tuilleadh feasa ar Eirinn oig'; 'Foras focal luaightheal libh' Cuimre na nGenealach The Cuimre is an abridgement of Leabhar na nGenealach. The original is now lost, but it survives in two apparently incomplete 18th century transcripts; RIA MS 24 N2, and Maynooth Irish MS B 8. While containing about 30% of the material of Leabhar na nGenealach, it also contains much new, and some unique material. Mac Fhirbhisigh began it on Monday 1 April 1666, at his home at Castletown, Co. Sligo. By Saturday 5 May, he had completed some 45% of the surviving material, and would appear to have finished prior to returning to Dublin and working for Sir James Ware. Mac Fhirbhisigh was stabbed to death by Thomas Crofton in a shebeen at Doonflin, Co. Sligo, in January 1671. Modern edition Leabhar na nGenealach was edited and published in 2004 as The Great Book of Irish Genealogies. The editor, Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le, had been studying the book since 1971.

Like almost all castles in this region it was built on sandstone. History The Falkenburg was probably built in the 11th century as a successor to the nearby Wilgartaburg and to protect the adjacent villages. In the documents of Archbishop Erkinbald of Mainz, letters dating to 1019 describe a rock outcrop called the Falkenstein considered as the most northerly border belonging to the principality of Kaiserslautern. Werner I of Bolanden is thought to have begun construction of the castle on this rock in 1125; he was a vassal of Duke Frederick II of Swabia. At the Bolanden family monastery in Hane were records of Sigbold of Falkenstein in 1135; he was one of the first to take the name of the castle for himself. Then in 1233 the imperial ministerialis, Phillip IV of Bolanden, was the first to clearly say that he was from Falkenstein in a legal document. A Werner of Falkenburg is mentioned among legal documents dating from 1290. From 1300 to 1313 the castle was enfeoffed to Frederick IV of Leiningen. Then in 1317 it was given in fee to Counts Palatine Rudolph II and Rupert I by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1375, Emich V of Leiningen became the owner of the castle and in 1398 the fiefdom of Falkenstein became its own county. From 1420, the Bolanded/Falkenstein lineage died out and the counts of Virneburg took over the castle until 1456 when it went into the possession of the counts of Dhaun- Oberstein. In 1458, the Duke of Lorraine took over and became the high feudal lord. The Falkenburg survived the German Peasants' War of 1524‚Äì1525. In 1545, with the fall of the empire the House of Austria took over under the charge of the Austrian government in Freiburg. During the 30 Years' War the castle was captured, first by Spanish troops in 1631, and then again by Swedish troops in 1632, before being finally retaken by troops from Lorraine. The castle was demolished by the French Marshal Sch√∂nbeck in 1638. The entire region of Frankenweide was administered from Falkenburg until the castle was destroyed, when it was then moved to Wilgartswiesen. Restoration work on the castle was carried out in the 1930s and 1970. Location The elongated castle is in two parts: a upper ward that was connected by a staircase to the lower ward with its gateway and drawbridge. The bergfried occupied an area of . Its walls were thick and its remains high. The ruins include a cistern, a gatehouse, a rock chamber, living quarters (a palas) and further wall remnants on the castle rock.

He first appeared during the period that fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. The Whizzer has super-speed powers, which (in his original origin story) he acquired from an infusion of mongoose blood. He appeared in both USA Comics and All Winners Comics from 1941 to 1946, and was revived by Marvel in the 1970s. Publication history Robert Frank's incarnation of the Whizzer debuted in USA Comics #1 (Aug. 1941), published by Timely Comics. The character was created by penciller Al Avison and an unnamed writer. Source lists \\"Al Avison and Al Gabrielle\\" as that character's creator. However, USA Comics #1 (Aug. 1941) at the Grand Comics Database lists Avison as penciler for the character's debut, and Gabriele solely as inker, not generally considered a co-creator position. One source credits Stan Lee as that writer, but there are no other sources to support the credit. The Whizzer appeared regularly in USA Comics through issue #17 (Sept 1945). At the same time, he was also appearing regularly in All Winners Comics, from issue #2 (Sept 1941) through #21 (Dec 1946). In issues #19 and #21, he was part of the All Winners Squad, a superteam that also included Captain America, Bucky Barnes, the Human Torch, Toro, the Sub-Mariner and Miss America. These were the character's last appearances during the 1940s. Writer Roy Thomas reintroduced the Golden Age Whizzer in Giant-Size Avengers #1 (Aug. 1974). Two years later, in The Avengers Annual #6 (Nov. 1976), writer Gerry Conway reinterpreted the character's origin and history so that the \\"transfusion of mongoose blood\\" was not the source of the power, but the factor that \\"triggered a latent mutant ability\\". Thomas, in the World War II flashback series The Invaders #5‚Äì6 (March‚ÄìMay 1976), expanded on the character's wartime career as a sometime- member of the retroactively created superhero team the Invaders. Thomas later additionally made the Whizzer a full-time member of the home-front heroes the Liberty Legion, in Marvel Premiere #29‚Äì30 (April‚ÄìJune 1976). Neither team had existed in Timely Comics. Fictional character biography Robert L. Frank was born in St. Louis, Missouri. The origin of the Golden Age character begins while Robert Frank is on a trip to Africa with his father, Dr. Emil Frank, where Robert is bitten by a cobra. Dr. Frank saves Robert by a transfusion of mongoose blood, and soon discovers that his son has developed super-speed. Frank then decides to fight crime and eventually accepts the offer of Invaders member Bucky, who forms the superhero team the Liberty Legion to rescue the other Invaders, who have been brainwashed by the villain the Red Skull.Marvel Premiere #29‚Äì30 (Apr.‚ÄìJune 1976). Marvel Comics When the Liberty Legion and Invaders eventually disband after World War II, the Whizzer joins the newly formed All-Winners Squad. The Whizzer afterward spent some years battling alcoholism and depression, and was, for some time, homeless in the Bowery section of Manhattan. He also works as a nuclear laboratory technician. In 1942, the Whizzer acquired a new sidekick, a stereotyped African-American friend named Slow-Motion Jones. In the modern age, the Whizzer reappears as an aging hero who had married fellow superhero Miss America. The Whizzer encounters and briefly serves with the Avengers, who aid him in controlling his son Nuklo. He is reunited with Nuklo, but suffers a heart attack. At the end of this adventure, the Whizzer erroneously believes himself to be the father of the mutant twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.Giant-Size Avengers #1 (Aug. 1974). Marvel Comics. The Whizzer was later duped by the Living Laser into battling the Avengers,Avengers #152 (Oct. 1976) and suffers a second heart attack.Avengers #153 (Nov. 1976). He then battled the Atlanteans and Namor alongside the Avengers.Avengers #155‚Äì156 (Jan.‚ÄìFeb. 1977). After a humbling defeat at the hands of the supervillain Count Nefaria the Whizzer retires. He later returns to fight a final battle against an old war-time foe called Isbisa. The Whizzer dies after suffering a fatal heart attack while fighting Isbisa, but his sacrifice enables his son Nuklo to be cured of his excessive radiation level and begin a normal life. The Whizzer died believing Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were his children. Arnim Zola later created a proto-husk of Whizzer from his DNA. The Whizzer clone has no lines and is killed by Deadpool who mocks him as \\"a legend to make mercs laugh at night\\".Deadpool #0 (1998). Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Due to a reaction between his latent genetic mutation and an injection of mongoose blood, Robert Frank has the ability to move at superhuman speed and has superhuman reflexes. He can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. In his prime, he could attain speeds faster than he could in middle age, running at approximately 100 mph. The Whizzer has learned a unique, self-taught fighting style that exploits the ability to move at superhuman speeds.

This depiction of the Whizzer gained his powers powers from an experiment meant to recreate the process that empowered Captain America alongside four other individuals who became the Black Marvel, the Destroyer, Miss America, and the Thunderer during World War II. However, due to the limited nature of their powers, they had to use special rings in order to activate them. After Captain America apparently sacrificed himself to stop the Red Skull from activating a doomsday device, Frank and the remaining heroes took the keys to it and retired. Years later, Kingpin's Insidious Six attack the retired heroes to steal the keys, leading to them joining forces with Spider-Man to stop them and the Red Skull's forces after the latter resurfaces. * Robert Frank appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"S.H.I.E.L.D.

They number over 7,500 and live in 39 villages of the central area of the island. Like the Alune people in the west, the Wemale people originate from a common ancestral group called the Patasiwa. The Wemale language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and it is divided into a northern and a southern variety, having dialects known as Horale, Kasieh, Uwenpantai, Honitetu and Kawe. Northern Wemale is spoken by about 5,000 people and the Southern Wemale is spoken by about 3,700 people.List of languages in Indonesia The Hainuwele legend is an origin myth from the Wemale and Alune folklore. It was recorded by German ethnologist Adolf Ellegard Jensen in a 1937-1938 expedition to the Maluku Islands.Adolf Ellegard Jensen: Hainuwele. Volkserz√§hlungen von der Molukken-Insel Ceram. Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main 1939 Description Wemale warriors. Traditionally the Wemale lived off forest products. Much of their diet was based on the sago palm. They also practiced shifting cultivation. Males used to engage in warrior activities against neighboring groups. Females used to spend most of their day collecting products from the forest in tall conical baskets that they carried on their backs. The top of these baskets had a characteristic funnel-shape and whatever was caught was tossed inside by the women with a swift and graceful movement. The Wemale men carried long knives. Both sexes wore little clothing because of the humid environment. Women wore rattan girdles around their waist. Same as with the Alune, the coming of age celebration for girls was an important occasion. The Wemale built large and elaborate houses with wood, sticks and palm leaves. These houses were very skillfully built in order to keep the interior dry and comfortable. The culture of the Wemale people has changed very much during the last few decades because of the impact of consumerism upsetting traditional values. Also the political and religious restlessness and the resulting conflict in Indonesia affected many islands of the Maluku area. See also *Alfur people *Hainuwele Bibliography *Sachse, F. J.

History Bolton was created a free borough in 1253 when William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby granted a charter. However the borough did not develop into a self-governing town, remaining under the control of officials appointed by the lord of the manor. By the eighteenth century the town was rapidly expanding and the Bolton Improvement Act 1792 established two local government bodies for the area: the Great Bolton Improvement Trustees, and the Police Commissioners for the Township of Little Bolton In 1838, under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the townships of Great Bolton and Little Bolton, along with the Haulgh area from Tonge with Haulgh township, were incorporated as a municipal borough, making it the second to be created in England (after Devonport). However, there was doubt about the validity of the charter, with the local Conservatives refusing to stand for the first council elections, and the magistrates of Salford Hundred disputing the jurisdiction of the new corporation. The first elections to the town council were uncontested, with Whigs and Radicals holding all seats. The council was highly supportive of The People's Charter. The legality of the charter (as well as those of Devonport, Birmingham and Manchester) was resolved by the Borough Charters Confirmation Act 1842.Borough Charters Confirmation Act 1842, C.101 The Act forced the new municipality to compensate the officers of the old corporation. The first contested elections were held in November 1842 and Conservatives gained control in 1844. In 1850 the borough corporation took over the Great Bolton and Little Bolton trusts established in 1792. In 1889, as it had a population in excess of 50,000, Bolton was constituted a county borough by the Local Government Act 1888. As a county borough, Bolton was independent of the administration of Lancashire County Council, although it remained part of the county for judicial, shrievalty and lieutenancy purposes. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the County Borough of Bolton was abolished and its territory transferred to Greater Manchester to form part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton. Boundaries and wards The original borough was divided into six wards: Bradford, Church, Derby, East, Exchange and West. The borough was extended in 1872, taking in the Daubhill area, which became the seventh ward of Rumworth. In 1873 the number of wards was increased to eight, with the formation of a new North ward. In 1877 a further enlargement added the ward of Halliwell. The Bolton, Turton, and Westhoughton Extension Act 1898 allowed the county borough to absorb Astley Bridge Urban District and the bulk of Bolton Rural District (the civil parishes of Breightmet, Darcy Lever, Deane, Great Lever, Heaton, Lostock, Middle Hulton, Smithills and Tonge). The area added to the borough was divided into eight wards (Astley Bridge, Tonge, Darcy Lever- cum-Breightmet, Great Lever, Hulton, Deane-cum-Lostock, Heaton, and Smithills), increasing the total number to seventeen. The Exchange Ward was subsequently abolished and the borough had sixteen wards until its abolition. Political control As noted above, the first elections of the council were uncontested, with Whigs and Radicals forming an administration. Following the entry of Conservative candidates in 1842, they gained a majority in 1844. Until 1887 the only groupings on the council were the majority Conservative and minority Liberal groups, with elections frequently uncontested. The Bolton Engineers' Strike of 1887 led to a highly politicised situation and eight Labour representatives were successful. Three years later the council returned to two-party politics. There was little change over the next decade, although individual Labour and Home Rule candidates were returned. From the beginning of the twentieth century a Labour grouping began to emerge. By the 1920s Labour had become the second largest party on the council. The Liberals became the third party, while a Women's Citizen Association councillor sat on the council from 1921 to 1927. In 1933 the Conservatives lost their majority, and the council was under no overall control until 1937. Conservatives regained control in 1937 and held it at the following year's vote. Elections were postponed for the duration of World War II., with the next municipal election being held in 1945. The Labour Party gained 17 seats from both the Conservatives and Liberals, and in 1946 gained control for the first time. The council was then under Labour control until 1949, Conservative from 1949 to 1952 and Labour from 1952 to 1954. After a year under no overall control, Conservatives were in power from 1955 to 1958 and Labour from 1958 to 1961. A Labour-Liberal coalition governed Bolton for two years before Labour regained a majority in 1963 The Conservatives regained the borough in 1965 and held it for seven years. In 1972, the final election before the borough's abolition was held, with Labour regaining control. Demographics Coat of arms left A coat of arms was associated with the town prior to the borough's incorporation. This consisted of a shield bearing two bendlets or diagonal bands, variously depicted as gold on red or black on gold. The crest above the shield was an elephant bearing a castle on its back. In 1890 Major Otley Parry redesigned the arms for the borough, the new design being officially granted by letters patent from the College of Arms on 5 June. The blazon of the arms was as follows: Gules two bendlets or a shuttle with weft pendent between an arrow point upwards and a mule spinning spindle in chief palewise all of the last and an escutcheon in base of the second thereon a rose of the first barbed and seeded proper, and for a Crest: Upon a rocky moor an elephant statant proper on its back a castle Or and thereon a rose as in the Arms the trapping per pale gules and vert and charged with a mitre also Or. The bendlets do not seem to have had any particular significance: the corporation claimed that they represented a \\"soldier's belt\\". This was a common explanation for the heraldic symbol at the time. A number of symbols were added to the arms. In the upper part of the shield was an arrow, recalling that archers from Bolton played a part at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Next to this were two symbols of the cotton industry: a spindle from Samuel Crompton's spinning mule and a weaver's shuttle. In the lower section of the shield was a gold escutcheon bearing the red rose of Lancaster, denoting that the town was in Lancashire. The elephant and castle crest of the unofficial arms was retained. The elephant was believed to have been derived from the arms of the City of Coventry, and the green and red colouring of the trappings was taken from the city's arms. The presence of the elephant was explained by the fact that Bolton anciently lay within the Diocese of Mercia, the see of which was at Coventry. The gold mitre in the crest referred to the diocese. The elephant stood on a representation of a \\"rocky moor\\": a depiction of the town's old name of Bolton-le-Moors. In 1958 the corporation received a further grant of supporters and heraldic badge. The additions to the arms were blazoned as follows: Supporters: On either side a lion sable gorged with a wreath argent and sable each supporting a staff Or flying therefrom a banner that on the dexter vair Or and gules that on the sinister argent on a bend azure three stags' heads caboshed Or; Badge or Device: Upon an oval gules encompassed by a garland of six roses also gules barbed seeded and leaved proper an arrow point upwards enfiled by a crown palisado Or. The black lions came from the arms of Flanders, in recognition of the fact that Flemish immigrants founded Bolton's textile industry. They supported flags bearing the arms of the two families who held the Earldom of Derby and principal manors of Bolton: the Ferrers and Stanley families. The motto adopted was Supera Moras or \\"Overcome Delays\\". It was a pun on the Latin name of the town: \\"Bolton- super-Moras\\". Bolton Corporation Transport In 1880 Bolton Corporation began the construction of a network of horse tramways in conjunction with the councils of the neighbouring urban districts of Astley Bridge, Farnworth and Kearsley. The services were leased to a private operator, and by 1898 had reached 31 miles in length. In 1897 the corporation gained powers to operate the tramways themselves, and began the process of electrification. The corporation officially took over operation on 1 January 1900, with horse traction ending on the following day. Later the same year the tram lines were extended to Horwich. In 1902 the sections in Farnworth and Kearsley were taken over by Farnworth Urban District Council, who passed operation to South Lancashire Transport in 1906. In 1909 Bolton and SLT began a joint-running arrangement with corporation trams reaching Atherton and Leigh as well as Farnworth and Kearsley. The tramways continued to be extended until 1924, and from 1927 Bolton provided some of the trams for South Lancashire's routes. Bolton first experimented with omnibuses in 1904 - 1907, with steam and petrol-electric vehicles. Motor bus operation began in 1923. Express services followed in 1927, run jointly with operators such as Manchester and Salford corporations, the Stalybridge, Hyde, Mossley and Dukinfield Transport Board and Lancashire United Transport. The first tramway replacement by buses was in 1933, and the last Bolton tram ran on 29 March 1947. Bolton Corporation continued as a bus-only operation until it was acquired by the SELNEC PTE on 1 November 1969. One Bolton Corporation Transport bus, a 1956 Leyland PD2, is preserved at the Museum of Transport Manchester. Utilities right Water supply In 1847 the corporation took over the privately owned waterworks. The main concern of the water undertaking was to secure supplies of water for manufacturing industry, as the existing hard water was damaging boilers. In 1864 they also acquired the Turton and Entwistle Reservoir, contained by the Entwistle Dam for the supply of drinking water. In 1971 the Jumbles Reservoir in the Bradshaw Valley was opened. The County Borough Corporation supplied water to a number of neighbouring authorities including the municipal boroughs of Farnworth, Radcliffe and Swinton and Pendlebury, and the urban districts of Kearsley, Turton, Westhoughton and Worsley Under the Water Act 1973 the undertaking passed to the North West Water Authority.The North West Water Authority Constitution Order 1973 (1973 No. 1287) Electricity Electric lighting was introduced by the Corporation in 1894. The original power station, in Spa Road, was found to be inadequate, and a new facility and Back o' th' Bank Power Station came into service in 1914. Under the Electricity Act 1947 the electricity supply and generating industry was nationalised, and Bolton's Electricity Department was merged in North Western Electricity Board.Electricity (Allocation of Undertakings to Area Boards) Order, 1948 (1948 No. 484) Gas In 1872 the Corporation acquired the Bolton Gas Light and Coke Company, which dated from 1818. Taken over were works at Gas Street/Moor Lane and Lum Street, with headquarters at Hotel Street. The Corporation reconstructed the works and built a new facility at Spa Road comprising offices, workshops and testing rooms. In 1949, under the terms of the Gas Act 1948, the undertaking passed to the North Western Gas Board. Neighbouring districts The former districts which had surrounded the County Borough of Bolton.

Published by DAW Books in 1972, it is the first novel in his Green Star Series. The story (and the entire series) is told from the point of an unnamed first-person narrator who is 30 years old, very wealthy but crippled, and who knows some eastern arts including soul casting. Plot summary One night the narrator sees a green star in the night sky, and casts his soul towards it. He finds a cloud-covered planet which revolves around it and sees that its surface is covered with trees that (from his perspective) seem several miles high. Later, he follows a retinue of humans riding on horse-sized (based on humans retaining earthly size, as he explains at one later point in the novel and another later in the series) dragonflies (which he finds out later are known as zaiphs) to a splendid city which sparkles like a jewel collection. One of the men in the retinue, cruel-faced and clad in bright yellow, presents a proposal (which the author cannot yet hear) to the ruler of the city, a princess who looks about 14. At that point, the author is drawn to a large man's body preserved inside a casket‚Äîwhich he revives to the consternation of the yellow retinue, and the cheers of the jewel-city's nobles. As he has taken the body of a man preserved for over a hundred years (whose soul was banished by a sorcerer), the author has to \\"relearn\\" Laonese, the universal language of the planet; he learns that the Jewel-city is known as Phaolon, considered the most splendid city on the planet; that its beautiful ruler is princess Niamh the Fair; that the yellow-clad man was Akhmim ruler of the rival city of Ardha (also known as \\"yellow city\\"). He is also \\"brought up to speed\\" (the body he took was that of a warrior named Chong The Mighty) on swords, bows, and other weapons. One day, when Chong and Niamh are out on a hunt for celebrating the Festival of mating zaiph, they are confronted by a huge (somewhat larger than a Bengal tiger) lizard known as ythid; the lizard is killed by an arrow from Chong's friend Panthon, but the spilled blood causes Niamh and Chong to fall into the web of an elephant-sized spider or xoph. As they escape from it, Niamh is drawn to a flower, which turns out to be a vampire species‚Äîbut before it can kill her and Chong, the two are rescued by a band of outlaws. The outlaw band is led by a female, Siona, who falls in (unrequited, as he loves Niamh) love with Chong. Chong makes friends with one of the rescuers, Yurgon‚Äîbut an enemy of another of the band, weasel-faced Sligon (who manages to find out about the secret of Niamh and Chong). Later, Sligon reveals the secret to Siona (whose father was banished by Niamh's) and strikes Chong with a poisoned dagger‚Äîonly to be immediately slain by Siona. Chong aids Niamh in getting to the zaiph pens (to escape) prior to succumbing to the wound and poison‚Äîat which point the narrator (on earth) regains consciousness. Under the Green Star was followed a year later by When the Green Star Calls. Reception Lester del Rey reported that Carter's writing here had more of the virtues of Edgar Rice Burroughs's adventure stories than other novels where Carter attempted to imitate Burroughs.Del Rey, Lester. \\"Reading Room\\", If, June 1973, pp.170-71.

Timothy, (1 January 2013) Lineage and Honors History of the 409 Air Expeditionary Group (USAFE), Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB, AL (partly updated by Haulman, Daniel L.) The group trained with its A-20s until 10 February 1944 when it moved to RAF Little Walden, England, arriving on 7 March 1944, when it became part of Ninth Air Force. On 13 April, it flew its first combat mission against a target in France. The 409th was originally trained in low-level attack missions. However, the group was busy flying medium-altitude bombing runs from 10,000 ft. Over 100 missions were flown by the group, attacking coastal defenses, V-1 and V-2 launch sites, airfields and other targets in France in preparation for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy. The group supported ground forces during the Battle of Normandy by hitting gun batteries, rail lines, bridges, communications, and other objectives. During July 1944, it aided the Allied offensive at Caen and Operation Cobra, the breakout at Saint-L√¥ with attacks on enemy troops, flak positions, fortified villages, and supply dumps. The group moved to Bretigny Airfield, France on 10 September to support United States Third Army's advance toward Germany. A total of ten aircraft had been lost by the group flying from Little Walden. In December 1944, the group began to convert to the Douglas A-26 Invader, but its upgrade was delayed as it provided close air support during the Battle of the Bulge, attacking lines of communication during December 1944 and January 1945. It flew its A-26s in combat from Bretigny and, after February from Laon- Couvron Air Base, until 3 May 1945, when flew its last mission against an ammunition dump in Czechoslovakia. After V-E Day, the group began its return to the United States in June and gathered at Seymour Johnson Field North Carolina in August. It moved to Westover Field on 6 October 1945 and was inactivated there on 7 November 1945. War on Terror F-16s fly observation formation off the wing of a KC-10The F-16s are deployed from Spangdahlem Air Base. KC-10 Extenders were deployed to the 409th Air Expeditionary Group The group was converted to provisional status, redesignated the 409th Air Expeditionary Group and assigned to United States Air Forces Europe, which activated it in November 2001 as an air refueling unit at Camp Sarafovo, Bulgaria as part of the leadup to the Iraq War. It conducted flying operations from Burgas Airport. The 409th Group was responsible for refueling operations in support of the US-led Operation Iraqi Freedom. Its mission included the use of six McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender aircraft, deployed from McGuire Air Force Base New Jersey, to help keep coalition aircraft fueled and flying on their air routes through Bulgaria and on to the theater of war. At the time, the 407th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron formed part of the group. The 409th was inactivated in June 2003.The Camp Sarafavo planes included some assigned to Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base. The New Jersey airmen joked casually upon arrival that the tail designator SJ for Seymour Johnson stood for South Jersey instead.

Published by DAW Books in 1973, it is the second novel in his Green Star Series, starting after the first novel, Under the Green Star, finished. The unnamed narrator once again thrusts his soul towards the Green Star. On the way, he passes over the moon and sees an iron pillar in a crater. Plot summary This time, when he reaches the Green Star planet, he sees a boy about 16 spreadeagled to a branch with rawhide, so as to be killed by marauding animals (or to die of starvation, so his body may be scavenged). A huge scorpion or phuol attacks the boy and then withdraws (waiting for its venom to paralyse, so it can then consume his still-living flesh later). At that point, a man comes out from concealment behind branches, kills the phuol with a lightning-emitting wand, and rescues the boy in a sky-sled, which the narrator follows to a city which appears dead (later finding out this is so). The rescuer applies salves and injections to the boy, who dies during the night (known to the narrator, but not the rescuer) whereupon the narrator takes possession of the just-dead body; it takes him a little while to reconcile the memories of this new body, whose name he finds to be Karn the Hunter (of Red Dragon Tribe‚Äîthe \\"Red Dragon\\" being a reference to the ythid), with his soul memories from his earlier incarnation as Chong The Mighty. Karn soon finds out that the dead city (known as Sotaspra) is a taboo area of the planet, only visited (or inhabited) by some scientists/savants such as his rescuer Sarchimus (self-titled \\"The Wise\\"). Indeed, Sarchimus considers all of the other savants of the city as rivals, chief of them Hume \\"Of The Many Eyes\\". Sarchimus warns Karn not to go exploring on his own‚Äîwhen Karn disobeys, he discovers the city is full of many mutant creatures, including a \\"death- fungus\\" which he narrowly misses, \\"crawler-vines\\" which try to strangle him and an amorphous creature Sarchimus calls \\"saloog\\", all of which were formed due to radiation from the crystals of which Sotaspra was constructed (when the crystals had energy, and the city was alive). Karn is astute enough to understand that Sarchimus did not rescue him for altruistic reasons. Sometime later, when Sarchimus has gone on an errand, Karn goes to another area where Sarchimus has forbidden him access‚Äîa set of doors sealed with Sarchimus' symbol, a scarlet hand. Doing so, he discovers that Sarchimus' experiments are partly guided by an original inhabitant of the city. Karn had earlier seen some statues of winged humanoids in very commonplace positions‚Äîbut these were made of chalk, a rather brittle material; the inhabitant is the last living member of these \\"genii\\" as Karn thinks of them, over a million years old. The immortal, Zarqa the kalood (meaning \\"flying ones\\") tells him that the statues are the result of a failed experiment of immortality which produced a compound known as \\"Elixir of Light\\". Even correctly formulated, the Elixir lengthened the lives of male kaloodha but sterilised them as a price‚Äîwhile having no effect on the females, thus causing a slow extinction of this noble race; the statues are the result of consuming this elixir mixed lacking a crucial ingredient. Sarchimus has much-tortured Zarqa to find out the formulation‚Äîat the time Karn finds him, he has revealed all except one ingredient but not the correct formula. Karn is also told that there is another human captive, a Phaolonian, in the tower (who he finds at a later opportunity‚Äîrecognising by face, but not by name‚Äîto be named Janchan). Eventually, Sarchimus treats Karn to a drugged feast (and then chains him) as a prelude to testing the Elixir on him‚Äîboasting that Zarqa (he doesn't reveal the name, as he does not know of Karn's knowledge) has revealed the correct formula to him. Karn is invigorated and strengthened greatly by the Elixir, but cannot break the chains fastened to him. Pleased at this sight, Sarchimus consumes the rest‚Äîand finds himself petrifying to chalk. Zarqa (who had been held in an energy-barrier set to Sarchimus' frequency) then releases Karn (and reveals to him the missing ingredient to be a component distilled from phuol venom‚ÄîKarn was protected by residues of the venom from the stinging he had earlier received), who then releases Janchan. The three then find a map to Ardha and Phaolon‚Äîwhich they find are about 3,000 farasang (a unit of time misused by Laonese also for distance) away. Janchan enters Ardha and obtains employment as a soldier. In this employ, he finds Niamh (who was recaptured by Siona's band after her escape attempt and then given to Arjala the \\"goddess\\" of Ardha as captive‚Äîdue to rivalry between Arjala and Akhmim, this allowed some power-josting). Soldiers in Arjala's employ have also captured Zarqa and display him as an amphasand, a mythical creature sacred to the Laonese. Janchan makes careful plans to rescue Niamh and Zarqa. Karn meanwhile has been attacked by a large bumblebee or zzumalak, which he mortally wounds‚Äîonly to land in a swimming pool where the bee drops him. Taking some coins from this house, he runs into a trio of men who fight and capture him‚Äîwho turn out to be of the assassin guild. One of this trio, Klygon, soon trains Karn in the arts of the guild. The chief of the guild, an obese man named Gurjan Tor (who most-closely resembles Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars), asks Karn to kill Niamh and Zarqa with a poisoned stiletto‚Äîand posts Klygon as his \\"partner\\" to ensure that Karn will not fluff the job or run away. Karn and Klygon fly to the temple tower (where Niamh is held) on zaiphs, and find that Janchan (and Zarqa) in the process of rescuing Niamh. Janchan's rescue goes somewhat awry as Arjala is present with two (very large, muscular eunuch) temple guards. Janchan's plans have been made in order to AVOID having a fight with these toughs (as he particularly fears they may raise an alarm); in desperation, he throws a lamp at one, breaking both it and the eunuch's skull (and discovers that the doomed eunuchs are also mute). The dead eunuch's body strikes Arjala knocking her unconscious‚Äîand forcing Janchan to rescue her as well. He quickly grabs Arjala and Niamh and puts them in the sky-sled with Zarqa. Karn who has seen this is now afraid that Klygon may kill him‚Äîas promised to Gurjan Tor.

Retrieved 26 November 2007. While most of the sinkings involved conventional weapons, four of them involved chemical weapons. The disposal site for the chemical weapons was a three-mile (5 km) area of the Atlantic Ocean between the coast of the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas.Wagner, Travis. \\"Hazardous Waste: Evolution of a National Environmental Problem\\", (Project Muse), Journal of Policy History, 16.4 (2004) pp. 306-331. Retrieved 26 November 2007. The CHASE program was preceded by the United States Army disposal of 8000 of mustard and lewisite chemical warfare gas aboard the scuttled SS William C. Ralston in April 1958.Kraft, James C. \\"The Last Triple Expander\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings February 1977 p. 67 These ships were sunk by having Explosive Ordnance Demolition (EOD) teams open seacocks on the ship after they arrived at the disposal site. The typical Liberty ship sank about three hours after the seacocks were opened. Decommissioned Liberty ships were filled with obsolete munitions and sunk at sea. Operations  CHASE 1  The mothballed C-3 Liberty ship John F. Shafroth was taken from the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay and towed to the Concord Naval Weapons Station for stripping and loading. A major fraction of the munitions in CHASE 1 was Bofors 40 mm gun ammunition from the Naval Ammunition Depot at Hastings, Nebraska. CHASE 1 also included bombs, torpedo warheads, naval mines, cartridges, projectiles, fuzes, detonators, boosters, overage UGM-27 Polaris motors, and a quantity of contaminated cake mix an army court had ordered dumped at sea. Shafroth was sunk 47 miles (76 km) off San Francisco on 23 July 1964 with 9799 tons of munitions.  CHASE 2  Village was loaded with 7348 short tons of munitions at the Naval Weapons Station Earle and towed to a deep-water dump site on 17 September 1964. There were three large and unexpected detonations five minutes after Village slipped beneath the surface. An oil slick and some debris appeared on the surface. The explosion registered on seismic equipment all over the world. Inquiries were received regarding seismic activity off the east coast of the United States, and the Office of Naval Research and Advanced Research Projects Agency expressed interest in measuring the differences between seismic shocks and underwater explosive detonations to detect underwater nuclear detonations then banned by treaty.  CHASE 3  Coastal Mariner was loaded with 4040 short tons of munitions at the Naval Weapons Station Earle. The munitions included 512 tons of actual explosives. Four SOFAR bombs were packed in the explosives cargo hold with booster charges of 500 pounds (227 kg) of TNT to detonate the cargo at a depth of 1000 feet (300 m). The United States Coast Guard issued a notice to mariners and the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife and the United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries sent observers. The explosives detonated seventeen seconds after Coastal Mariner slipped below the surface on 14 July 1965. The detonation created a 600-foot (200 m) water spout, but was not deep enough to be recorded on seismic instruments.  CHASE 4  Santiago Iglesias was loaded with 8715 tons of munitions at the Naval Weapons Station Earle, rigged for detonation at 1000 feet (300 m), and detonated 31 seconds after sinking on 16 September 1965.  CHASE 5  Isaac Van Zandt was loaded with 8000 tons of munitions (including 400 tons of high explosives) at the Naval Base Kitsap and rigged for detonation at 4000 feet (1.2 km). On 23 May 1966 the tow cable parted en route to the planned disposal area. Navy tugs USS Tatnuck (ATA-195) and USS Koka (ATA-185) recovered the tow within six hours, but the location of sinking was changed by the delay.  CHASE 6  Different sources describe CHASE 6 differently. Naval Institute Proceedings indicates Horace Greeley was loaded at the Naval Weapons Station Earle, rigged for detonation at 4000 feet (1.2 km), and detonated on 28 July 1966. Other sources describe CHASE 6 as the Liberty ship Robert Louis Stevenson loaded with 2000 tons of explosives at Naval Base Kitsap in July 1967 as part of the ONR and ARPA investigation to detect underwater nuclear tests. Robert Louis Stevenson failed to sink as rapidly as had been predicted and drifted into water too shallow to actuate the hydrostatic-pressure detonators. The tug Tatnuck involved in towing Robert Louis Stevenson was reported by Proceedings as towing Izaac Van Zandt a year earlier for CHASE 5.  CHASE 7  Michael J. Monahan was loaded with overage UGM-27 Polaris motors at the Naval Weapons Station Charleston and sunk without detonation on 30 April 1967.  CHASE 8  The first chemical weapons disposal via the program was in 1967 and designated CHASE 8. CHASE 8 disposed of mustard gas and GB-filled M-55 rockets. All of the cargo was placed aboard a merchant hulk (the S.S. Corporal Eric Gibson) and was then sunk in deep water off the continental shelf.  CHASE 9  Eric G. Gibson was sunk on 15 June 1967.  CHASE 10  CHASE 10 dumped 3000 tons of United States Army nerve agent filled rockets encased in concrete vaults. Public controversy delayed CHASE 10 disposal until August 1970. Public awareness of operation CHASE 10 was increased by mass media reporting following delivery of information from the Pentagon to the office of U.S. Representative Richard McCarthy in 1969. Both American television and print media followed the story with heavy coverage. In 1970, 58 separate reports were aired on the three major network news programs on NBC, ABC and CBS concerning Operation CHASE. Similarly, The New York Times included Operation CHASE coverage in 42 separate issues during 1970, 21 of those in the month of August.  CHASE 11  CHASE 11 occurred in June 1968 and disposed of United States Army GB and VX, all sealed in tin containers.  CHASE 12  CHASE 12, in August 1968, again disposed of United States Army mustard agent and was numerically (although not chronologically) the final mission to dispose of chemical weapons. Aftermath Operation CHASE was exposed to the public during a time when the army was under increasing public criticism, especially the army's Chemical Corps. CHASE was one of the incidents which led to the near-disbanding of the Chemical Corps in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Concerns were raised over the program's effect on the ocean environment as well as the risk of chemical weapons washing up on shore. The concerns led to the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, which prohibited such future missions.Pike, John. \\"Operation CHASE\\", 27 April 2005, Globalsecurity.org.

It is based in London, United Kingdom, with an office in New York City.  History  Incisive Media is a business-to-business (B2B) information and events company founded by Tim Weller, in 1994 with the launch of Investment Week. It acquired Timothy Benn Publishing (owner of Post Magazine) in August 2000. It was listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in December 2000 which valued the business at c. ¬£73m. During the next six years the business completed a number of acquisitions including Matching Hat, Risk Waters, Initiative Europe (Unquote), Search Engine Strategies, Global Professional Media, Asian Venture Capital Journal and Pacific Prospect. However, as a public company it was difficult to take advantage of some of the larger consolidation opportunities that existed, so in December 2006 Tim Weller led a management buyout deal backed by Apax Partners that valued Incisive Media at ¬£275 million. Within a few months of going private, Incisive Media completed the acquisitions of MSM International and UK publishing business VNU Business Publications Ltd, formerly part of The Nielsen Company, from venture capital group 3i in 2007. In August 2007 the company completed a $630m deal to acquire ALM, an American magazine publisher that was backed by Bruce Wasserstein, doubling the size of the group again and creating a company with an enterprise value of over $1bn. However, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the downturn in the financial services market, Incisive Media's markets came under significant pressure and the debt levels were no longer sustainable. In October 2009 Incisive Media announced the refinancing of the Group's debt. ALM was separated from the Group and was Acquired by RBS and Apax Partners. In the same month Incisive Media agreed to a debt-for-equity swap with its lenders. In January 2016 Incisive sold the British magazine Legal Week to the US legal business publisher ALM.  Awards  The group received five nominations for the June 2010 Association of Online Publishers awards, and was voted Digital Publisher of the Year. Also it received the same award in 2013, in 2016 and most recently in 2017. Incisive followed this up with a win for Pensions and Benefits UK at the 2017 UK Conference awards.

Retrieved December 28, 2008. His father was Richard James Bellamy. He moved to Hollywood in 1920 with his parents; his father was a railroad engineer. After graduating from Hollywood High School in 1935, Bellamy received a degree from Los Angeles City College and took a job as a messenger for Columbia Studios. Within four years, Bellamy had worked his way up to second assistant director before taking time off to serve in the U.S. Navy's photographic unit during World War II. When Bellamy returned to Hollywood, he became a well-respected TV director who was particularly adept at Westerns. Although he directed nearly two dozen feature films, Bellamy was best known for his work on The Lone Ranger, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Rawhide, The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, The Virginian and Tales of Wells Fargo. Family fare was his forte in the 1950s. He directed shows like Jungle Jim, Lassie, Leave It to Beaver and The Donna Reed Show. In the 1960s, he focused on sitcoms like Bachelor Father, Get Smart, The Munsters, McHale's Navy, and the final season of My Three Sons. Medical dramas, like Marcus Welby, M.D. and Trapper John M.D., as well as sitcoms such as M*A*S*H and The San Pedro Beach Bums, kept him busy in the 1970s. Before retiring in 1986, Bellamy directed the science fiction miniseries, V, and many episodes of Fantasy Island and Hart to Hart. After his retirement, Bellamy and his wife moved to New Mexico. The state had provided him with many different filming locations. In 2002, the Motion Picture and Television Fund gave him the prestigious Golden Boot Award. Bellamy died on November 30, 2003, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the age of 86. It is reported that he died of a myocardial infarction (heart attack). He had three children, Michael, Earl Jr, and Karen. His first wife died 9 years after Earl Jr was born. His second wife (mother of Karen) committed suicide.

It is the 38th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot While looking for work, the Stooges botch an attempt to steal a watermelon from a deliveryman (Cy Schindell), which lands them in trouble with a cop (William Irving). The trio wind up at the offices of the Canvas Back Duck Club, a hunting organization run by conmen Blackie (Lynton Brent) and Doyle (Wheaton Chambers) needs some salesmen and the trio has no trouble getting the job because, unbeknownst to them, the whole thing is a scam. Dressed in duck-hunting gear, Moe, Larry and Curly invade the police station and barge right into the office of the police chief (Bud Jamison). By the time the group arrives at the lodge, the \\"club owners\\" are long gone, and an old man assures them that there are no ducks to be found. In a panic, Moe and Larry try to solve this dilemma by hurling decoy ducks and rubber decoys over the pond. Curly arrives at last with a large flock of ducks (√† la the Pied Piper of Hamelin) and leads them into the water. Eventually, the old man shows up (with the sheriff) ranting that Curly has stolen his prize domestic ducks, worth $5 apiece. The cops realize they have been swindled and point their guns at the Stooges, who flee the scene.

The syndrome is outwardly characterized by tonic spasms and partial seizures within the first few months of life, and receives its more elaborate name from the pattern of burst activity on an electroencephalogram (EEG). It is an extremely debilitating progressive neurological disorder, involving intractable seizures and severe intellectual disabilities. No single cause has been identified, although in many cases structural brain damage is present. Presentation Ohtahara syndrome is rare and the earliest-appearing age-related epileptic encephalopathy, with seizure onset occurring within the first three months of life, and often in the first ten days. Many, but not all, cases of OS evolve into other seizure disorders, namely West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The primary outward manifestation of OS is seizures, usually presenting as tonic seizures (a generalized seizure involving a sudden stiffening of the limbs). Other seizure types that may occur include partial seizures, clusters of infantile spasms, and, rarely, myoclonic seizures. In addition to seizures, children with OS exhibit profound mental and physical disabilities. Clinically, OS is characterized by a \\"burst suppression\\" pattern on an EEG. This pattern involves high voltage spike wave discharge followed by little brain wave activity. It is named for the Japanese neurologist Shunsuke Ohtahara (1930-2013), who identified it in 1976.  Signs and Symptoms  MRIs of a normal individual (left) and a patient with microcephaly caused by genetic mutation (right) Both female and male infants born with OS may experience symptoms while asleep or awake. Many children die from OS within their first 2 years of life, while those who survive maintain physical and cognitive disabilities such as excessive fatigue, difficulty feeding, chest infections and slow developmental progress. Although birth history and head size of infants is typically normal, microcephaly may occur. Certain genetic variants manifest with additional signs such as dyskinetic movements and an atypical Rett-syndrome appearance. *Tonic seizures and spasms *Muscle stiffness *Dilated pupils *Diplegia *Hemiplegia *Tetraplegia *Ataxia *Dystonia Causes  No single cause of OS has been identified. In most cases, there is severe atrophy of both hemispheres of the brain. Cerebral malformations such as hemimegalencephaly, porencephaly, Aicardi syndrome, olivary-dentate dysplasia, agenesis of mamillary bodies, linear sebaceous nevus syndrome, cerebral dysgenesis, and focal cortical dysplasia have been noted as suspect causes.  Pathophysiology  Although it was initially published that no genetic connection had been established, several genes have since become associated with Ohtahara syndrome. It can be associated with mutations in ARX, CDKL5, SLC25A22, STXBP1, SPTAN1, KCNQ2, ARHGEF9, PCDH19, PNKP, SCN2A, PLCB1, SCN8A, ST3GAL3, TBC1D24, BRAT1 and likely others. Less often, the root of the disorder is an underlying metabolic syndrome, though mitochondrial disorders, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, and enzyme deficiency remain elusive as causes. Their mechanisms are not entirely known. Diagnosis Electroencephalogram (EEG) displaying burst suppression patterns. Onset of bursts are indicated by solid arrows; offset, by open arrows. In both A and B, the interval between each vertical dotted line is one second The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and on typical electroencephalographic patterns based on time of onset. Typically, onset of seizures and spasms have been indicative of OS diagnosis, while MRI and Abormal EEG \\"burst suppression\\" pattern can confirm.Genetic testing with chromosomal microarray analysis followed by an epilepsy gene panel or whole exome sequencing may be considered after MRI imaging has been exhausted. Differential diagnoses between other epileptic encephalopathies such as West syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are distinguished by myoclonic seizures and differences in spike-and-wave patterns on EEG. Treatment Treatment outlook is poor. Anticonvulsant drugs and glucocorticoid steroids may be used to try to control the seizures, but their effectiveness is limited. Most therapies are related to symptoms and day-to- day living. For cases related to focal brain lesions, epilepsy surgery or functional hemispherectomy may be considered. Risk factors include infection, blood loss, loss of vision, speech, memory, or movement. Therapy for those with OS are based on severity of seizure activity and are supportive in nature. This may include treatment for abnormal muscle tone, stomach or lung problems. A ketogenic diet may be suggested for reduction of symptoms. Should the child survive past the age of three, vagus nerve stimulation could be considered. No recent findings allude to preventive methods for pregnant mothers.  Prognosis  Prognosis is poor for infants with OS, and can be characterized by management of seizures, effects of secondary symptoms and shortened life span (up to 3 years of age). Survivors have severe psychomotor impairments and are dependent on their caretaker for support. Family members of infants with OS may consult with a palliative care team as symptoms may worsen or develop. Death is often due to strain from seizure activity, pneumonia or other complications from motor disabilities. Prospects of recovering from OS after hemispherectomy surgery has been shown to be favorable, with patients experiencing \\"catch up\\" in development.  Epidemiology  Incidence has been estimated at 1/100 000 births in Japan and 1/50,000 births in the U.K. Approximately 100 cases total have been reported but this may be an underestimate. since OS neonates with early death may escape clinico-EEG diagnosis. Male cases slightly predominate those of females.  Current Research  Currently, only one clinical trial has been performed to examine the efficacy of High-definition (HD) transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) in reducing epileptiform activity. Notable cases Ivan Cameron, son of David Cameron, former leader of the British Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the UK, was born with the condition and cerebral palsy. He died aged six on 25 February 2009, while his father was still opposition leader. Dr William H. Thomas, a United States doctor, has two daughters with this condition.

A Republican businessman, Gould was appointed by President Richard Nixon to serve as United States Ambassador to Luxembourg, a position he would hold from 1969 through 1972. In 1973, Gould was appointed as Ambassador to the Netherlands also by President Nixon, serving until 1976. He is part of the fourth generation of the Gould family of financiers, philanthropists and diplomats, which includes his father Kingdon Gould Sr., grandfather George Jay Gould and great-grandfather Jay Gould, with associated generations of mothers, siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces and nephews. Early life Gould was the third child and the only son of Kingdon Gould, Sr., and his wife, Annunziata Lucci. He attended Millbrook School in 1938 and graduated in 1942. He attended Yale University for two months in the spring of 1942 before serving in the United States Army in World War II and was the recipient of two Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars. After returning from England in 1945, he married Mary Bruce Thorne in 1946; they had four sons, including Kingdon Gould III (born 1948), Frank, Thorne and Caleb, as well as five daughters, Lydia, Candida, Melissa, Annunziata and Thalia. Gould returned to Yale to complete his undergraduate degree and then to study law, graduating in 1951. He was the grandfather of United States Olympic cyclist Georgia Gould. Diplomatic career Gould served as United States ambassador to Luxembourg from May 1969 to October 1972 during the Richard Nixon administration. He later served as ambassador to the Netherlands from October 1973 to September 1976 under a second appointment by President Nixon, and continued serving through most of the Ford Administration. When President Nixon delivered his resignation speech in August 1974, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger was visiting with Gould in The Hague during his tenure as Ambassador to the Netherlands. When discovering that Burger would swear in Gerald Ford to the presidency, Burger told Gould: \\"Do you understand the irony, Kingdon? That man [Nixon] appointed me to the highest office, and I wrote the opinion [that forced Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes and papers as evidence in the trial of presidential aides accused of covering up the Watergate scandal]\\". Later life and death For many years Gould was business partner of Nick Antonelli in the Washington DC parking and real estate development PMI Parking Management Inc. From 2013 until his death, he served as a trustee to the Baltimore Council on Foreign Affairs, a nonpartisan organization \\"dedicated to educating citizens about foreign affairs\\". Gould's donations to Republican candidates and party organs attracted the attention of the media, as for instance in 2006 when the New York Times reported that he had donated $25,000 to the Republican National Committee. In addition to his business and political interests, he was known in the area as a donor to a range of educational institutions. He also figured in the creation of the Capital Crescent Trail; having purchased the DC portion of the newly abandoned Georgetown branch from CSX in 1989, he sold the route to the National Park Service the following year. In his retirement, Gould was known in the Baltimore-area as a donor to a range of educational institutions.

The island has a long history of winemaking dating back to at least the 7th century BC when it was mentioned in the works of Homer.Homer. Odyssey, X.235. During this time the area competed with the wines of Chios for the Greek market. An apocryphal account details one of the brothers of the poet Sappho as a merchant trading Lesbos wine with the Greek colony of Naucratis in Egypt. The most noted Lesbos wine was known as Pramnian which draws similarities today to the Hungarian wine Eszencia.H. Johnson. Vintage: The Story of Wine. Simon and Schuster, 1989, , p. 44. The popularity of Lesbos wine continued into Roman times where it was highly valued along with other Aegean wines of Chios, Thasos and Kos.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine (Third Edition). Oxford University Press, 2006, , p. 5. Viticulture and wine The warm Mediterranean climate of Lesbos provides a suitable climate for viticulture to flourish. While the exact grapes for the Pramnian are not known, its method of production was recorded . The grapes were allowed to hang on the vine, like that of a late harvest wine, till they were at their ripest points. After harvest, they were piled in large containers to the point that the weight of the clusters crushed the grapes underneath them producing free run juice without the use of a wine press. This juice was said to be very thick and a sort of nectar. Other types of Pramnian While Lesbos is considered by some scholars to be the main source of Pramnian, there is association of the name with wines from Smyrna and Icaria. The Greek writer Athenaeus used the term in almost a generic way to refer to any dark, long lived wine of good quality. Athenaeus's description also paints a different description than of a Tokay-like wine, instead of a wine that is dry and very strong.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine (Third Edition). Oxford University Press, 2006, , p. 328. The resulting grape must is very high in sugar and even after a brief fermentation period it still retains high residual levels and creates a viscous, honeyed sweet wine. Modern winemaking In the beginning of the 19th century the spread of phylloxera to Lesbos as well as the island's specialization in ouzo led to the stagnation of Lesbian wine production. After this point in time, wine was only privately produced on the island by farmers, until 1997, when Methymnaeos, the first winery producing bottled wine in the history of Lesbos, began operations in the village of Chidira. Methymnaeos solely produces organic wine made exclusively from the revived Chidiriotiko grape variety of the island. This variety, saved from extinction by phylloxera because of its use by the winery, is cultivated on the sulfuric lava which formed the Petrified Forest of Lesbos. This soil favors organic farming. The resulting organic wine has a rather distinct taste, characteristic of modern Lesbos Wine and attributable both to the unique Chidiriotiko grape variety of the island and to the terroir where it is grown.M.

History Ariano (currently Ariano Irpino), a very ancient town of the Hirpini, is built on the hills, fifteen miles from Beneventum. Possibly its name is of pagan origin: Ara Jani. There are no documents that fix the time of its conversion to Christianity. Beneventum, at the beginning of the fourth century, had a bishop, and the Gospel may have reached Ariano from that city. The Bishop of Beneventum was one of the nineteen prelates who were present at the Synod of Rome, held in the year 313.See Routt, Reliquiae Sacrae, III, 312, and Harnack, Die Mission, etc., 501. Ariano was an episcopal city from the tenth century and perhaps before that time. It is first mentioned in the Bull of Pope John XIII (965-972) to establish the Archdiocese of Beneventum; it is named as a suffragan see. The first bishop known to have occupied this see was Menardus, a native not of Padua, Ferdinando Ughelli believed, but of Poitiers, which Vitale has shown. In 1070, he erected in his cathedral a marble baptistery on the walls of which verses were inscribed. In the following year Menardus was at the consecration of the church of Monte Cassino by Pope Alexander III. Tradition has a whole series of bishops prior to him as is proved by a declaration of 1080 made in favour of the monastery of St. Sofia in Beneventum.

SOCS1 orthologs have been identified in several mammals for which complete genome data are available.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the STAT-induced STAT inhibitor (SSI), also known as suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS), family. SSI family members are cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling. The expression of this gene can be induced by a subset of cytokines, including IL2, IL3 erythropoietin (EPO), GM- CSF, and interferon-gamma (IFN-Œ≥). The protein encoded by this gene functions downstream of cytokine receptors, and takes part in a negative feedback loop to attenuate cytokine signaling. Knockout studies in mice suggested the role of this gene as a modulator of IFN-Œ≥ action, which is required for normal postnatal growth and survival.

Release and underboss Toward his release in the mid 1990s, the Colombo family entered a huge battle for the power of leadership in the family. The acting boss Victor Orena demanded complete power over the family from Carmine Persico, and the two factions went to war during the early 1990s. The Persico faction claimed victory in 1993, and with half the family on trial, DeRoss was released in the late 1990s, just as he was arrested and prosecuted again for racketeering and loansharking charges but acquitted due to lack of evidence. However, his former union cooperator, Chickie Amodeo, had been banned from all contact with union officials and imprisoned again in 1994. Upon DeRoss' release, many Colombo members were imprisoned and demoted by Persico, as they chose to support Orena in his failed attempt to overthrow Persico.

She was married to Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., mother of two Maryland State Senators, and grandmother of one. Background The daughter of Kieffer Albert Jackson and Dr. Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, Mitchell attended Frederick Douglass High School, Morgan State College and graduated, cum laude, from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.S. in education in 1931. Four years later, she earned a M.A. in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania as well. In 1950, she became the first African-American woman to graduate from the University of Maryland School of Law, and the first African- American woman to practice law in Maryland. Career In her earlier years, Mitchell traveled extensively throughout the U.S. for the Bureau of Negro Work and the Methodist church, speaking and teaching courses in race relations. From 1935 to 1938, she was special assistant to Walter F. White, NAACP Executive Secretary, serving as National Youth Director. There, she organized and developed programs for the organization's Youth and College Division. Mitchell was the president of Maryland's NAACP Baltimore City branch when she advocated for Baltimore school desegregation and after the 1954 United States Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education, she was a major campaigner for making Maryland the first southern state to have integration. She also filed many other cases to desegregate numerous other aspects of segregated life including restaurants, parks and swimming pools. Mitchell also ran voter registration drives in the 1940s, '50s and '60s to help influence and rally African Americans in Baltimore to vote. Mitchell founded the Baltimore City- Wide Young People's Forum in 1931, and the NAACP Youth Movement in 1935. In 1942, she directed a march on Maryland's Capitol with 2,000 citizens as well as the first citywide \\"Register and Vote\\" campaign. The campaign resulted in 11,000 new voter registrations on the books. In 1958, she directed the NAACP's \\"Register to Vote\\" campaign which resulted in over 20,000 new registrations. Mitchell was also recognized in the political arena for being a crusader and leader. She was named to the White House Conference on \\"Women and Civil Rights\\" by John F. Kennedy and in 1966 she was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the White House Conference \\"To Fulfill These Rights\\" which dealt with finding solutions concerning African Americans in relation to economic security, education and justice. In 1987, Mitchell was inducted, along with her mother, into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. The NAACP has also recognized Juanita Jackson Mitchell for her accomplishments and has created a \\"Juanita Jackson Mitchell Award for Legal Activism\\" to honor her feats as a black woman in the legal field. Mitchell family In 1938, Mitchell married Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., who was known nationally for being a civil rights activist, being dubbed \\"the 101st Senator.\\" She was the daughter of Dr. Lillie Jackson, who was also a major civil rights leader and who also was president of the NAACP Baltimore branch and was known as \\"Mother of Freedom.\\" Juanita Jackson Mitchell came from a long line of civil activists and continued the line. She was the mother of former state senators Michael B. Mitchell and Clarence M. Mitchell, III. Her grandson, Keiffer J. Mitchell, Jr., was a member of the Baltimore City Council and ran for Mayor of Baltimore in 2007. Juanita Mitchell was rendered a quadriplegic in November 1989 after falling down a flight of stairs. While undergoing therapy for that injury, she suffered a stroke, her second since 1985; she was 79. Juanita Jackson Mitchell died in Baltimore of a heart attack and complications from the strokes in July 1992.

Murray and Sunnucks give the year of death as 1792, but Gaige and Hooper & Whyld list 1796. was an 18th-century Italian law professor, priest, chess player, composer and theoretician. He is best known today for his chess writing. Life Ponziani was born in Modena in 1719. In 1742 he graduated in law at the University of San Carlo and was admitted to the College of Advocates in 1745. He was Professor of Civil Law at the University of Modena from 1742 to 1772 when he retired taking a pension and the title of honorary professor. In 1764 Ponziani took orders as a priest and in 1766 he became a canon in the Modena Cathedral. He became Vicar General in 1784, received the title of Protonotary Apostolic, and was made Vicar Capitular in 1785. Ponziani died in Modena and is buried in the Modena Cathedral. Chess writing Ponziani was friend with fellow Modenese chess players and writers Ercole del Rio and Giambattista Lolli, and collectively the trio is known as the Modenese Masters. In 1769 Ponziani published the first edition of Il giuoco incomparabile degli scacchi (The Incomparable Game of Chess). As Ponziani did not include his name in this work (Opera d'Autore Modenese) it was identified to the Anonymous Modenese. The second edition in 1782 was much improved and laid out the principles of the Italian school of chess as exemplified by 17th- century Italian masters such as Gioachino Greco. Although Ponziani identified himself in the second edition, the 1820 translation by English naval officer J. B. Smith using the pen name J. S. Bingham, The Incomparable Game of Chess, attributed the work to del Rio. Ponziani's work is the best practical guide produced by the Modenese Masters. Like writings by del Rio and Lolli, Ponziani deals only with the opening and endgame, with no discussion of the middlegame. In the opening, the primary objective is to obtain the maximum amount of mobility for the pieces, aiming in particular for vulnerable points such as the f2 or f7 square. No importance is attached to formation or maintenance of a pawn center‚Äîpawns are used to drive back enemy pieces. In the opening, Ponziani is best known as the eponym of the Ponziani Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3), although he did not originate it as it was published by Lucena around 1497. His name is properly attached to the Ponziani Countergambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 f5) in the Ponziani Opening as he published the first analysis in 1782. Endgame studies Ponziani's 1769 manuscript contained the endgame study above. White wins as follows: :1. Kf4 Kg7 :2. Kf5 Kh8 :3. Kg5 Or Ke6 or Ke5, but not Kf6?? stalemate. :3...Kg7 :4. h8=Q+!

Ponziani (1782) also gave an example of an endgame blockade or fortress, in which the inferior side is able to hold a draw despite having only two minor pieces for the queen by hemming in the opposing king.

Six thousand sheep were killed on ranches near the base, and the popular explanation blamed Army testing of chemical weapons for the incident, though alternative explanations have been offered. A report, commissioned by Air Force Press Officer Jesse Stay and first made public in 1998, was called the \\"first documented admission\\" from the Army that a nerve agent killed the sheep at Skull Valley. Background Since its founding in 1941, much of the activity at Dugway Proving Ground has been a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included aerial nerve agent testing. According to reports from New Scientist, Dugway was still producing small quantities of non-infectious anthrax of a type used in the making of vaccines as late as 1998, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons.Hambling, David. \\"US army plans to bulk-buy anthrax\\", New Scientist, September 24, 2005. Retrieved November 27, 2007. There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the time period of the Dugway sheep incident. In total, almost of nerve agent were dispersed during open-air tests. There were also tests at Dugway with other weapons of mass destruction, including 332 open-air tests of biological weapons, 74 dirty bomb tests, and eight furnace heatings of nuclear material under open air conditions to simulate the dispersal of fallout in the case of meltdown of aeronautic nuclear reactors. Incident In the days preceding the Dugway sheep incident the United States Army at Dugway Proving Ground conducted at least three separate operations involving nerve agents. All three operations occurred on March 13, 1968. One involved the test firing of a chemical artillery shell, another the burning of 160 U.S. gallons (600 litres) of nerve agent in an open air pit and in the third a jet aircraft spraying nerve agent in a target area about west of Skull Valley. It is the third event that is usually connected to the Skull Valley sheep kill. The incident log at Dugway Proving Ground indicated that the sheep incident began with a phone call on March 17, 1968, at 12:30 a.m. The director of the University of Utah's ecological and epidemiological contact with Dugway, a Dr. Bode, phoned Keith Smart, the chief of the ecology and epidemiology branch at Dugway to report that 3,000 sheep were dead in the Skull Valley area. The initial report of the incident came to Bode from the manager of a Skull Valley livestock company. The sheep were grazing in an area about from the proving ground; total sheep deaths of 6,000‚Äì6,400 were reported over the next several days as a result of the incident.Hoeber, Amoretta M. and Douglass, Jr. Joseph D. \\"The Neglected Threat of Chemical Warfare\\", (JSTOR), International Security, Vol. 3, No. 1.

Possible causes Previously obtained documents said a nerve agent demonstration occurred the day before the sheep deaths. On March 13, 1968, an A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft flew a test mission over the Dugway Proving Ground with chemical dispensers containing the nerve agent VX. One of the dispensers was not completely emptied during the test, and as the A-4 gained altitude after its bombing run, VX trickled out in a trail behind the aircraft, drifted into Skull Valley, north of the proving ground, and settled over a huge flock of sheep.\\"A History Of Chemical Warfare, Greg Goebel (Accessed on January 31, 2010) One explanation in the aftermath of the incident was that a chemical or biological agent had escaped from the Dugway Proving Ground. Circumstantial evidence seemed to support this assertion; the United States Army admitted to conducting open-air tests with VX in the days preceding the sheep kill. The Army intimated that a spray nozzle had malfunctioned during the test causing an aircraft to continue spraying VX as it climbed to higher altitudes.Regis, Edward.

It was reported that a small amount of VX was found in the tissue of the dead sheep. Other information contradicted the initial assumptions. One contradiction to nerve agent exposure as a cause came in the symptoms of some of the sheep following the incident. Several sheep, still alive, sat unmoving on the ground. The sheep refused to eat, but exhibited normal breathing patterns and showed signs of internal hemorrhaging. Regular breathing and internal hemorrhaging are inconsistent with nerve agent exposure, and \\"no other animals of any type, including cows, horses, dogs, rabbits, or birds, appeared to have suffered any ill effects, a circumstance that was hard to explain if VX had in fact caused the sheep deaths.\\" Aftermath The incident affected the Army, and U.S. military policy within a year. The international infamy of the incident contributed to President Richard Nixon's decision to ban all open-air chemical weapon testing in 1969. The sheep incident was one of the events which helped contribute to a rise in public sentiment against the U.S. Army Chemical Corps during and after the Vietnam War.Mauroni, Al. \\"The US Army Chemical Corps: Past, Present, and Future \\", Army Historical Foundation. Retrieved October 10, 2008. Ultimately, the Chemical Corps was almost disbanded as a result. Following the incident, the Army and other state and federal agencies compiled reports, some of which were later characterized as \\"studies\\". A report which remained classified until 1978 and unreleased to the public until nearly 30 years after the incident was called the \\"first documented admission\\" by the Army that VX killed the sheep. In 1998, Jim Woolf, reporting for The Salt Lake Tribune, made the content of the report public for the first time.Norrell, Brenda. \\"Skull Valley's Nerve Gas Neighbors\\", (LexisNexis), Indian Country Today (Rapid City, South Dakota), October 26, 2005. Retrieved November 26, 2007. The report described the evidence that nerve agent was the cause of the sheep kill as \\"incontrovertible\\". The 1970 report, compiled by researchers at the U.S. Army's Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, stated that VX was found in both snow and grass samples recovered from the area three weeks after the sheep incident. The report concluded that the \\"quantity of VX originally present was sufficient to account for the death of the sheep.\\"Woolf, Jim. \\"Army: Nerve Agent Near Dead Utah Sheep in '68; Feds Admit Nerve Agent Near Sheep\\", (LexisNexis),The Salt Lake Tribune, January 1, 1998.

As late as 1997, one year before the report went public, U.S. Department of Defense officials stated that \\"the reason it (the report) was never published is because it wasn't particularly revealing.\\"\\"DoD news briefing ‚Äì Mr. Kenneth Bacon, ASD (PA),\\" (Lexis Nexis, relevant excerpt), M2 Presswire, April 8, 1997.

Also, the probe showed that medical tests the Army had used to claim humans were not affected are now considered inconclusive, and the Pecks had shown other signs of low-level VX exposure.\\"Lethal breeze\\" By Lee Davidson, Correspondent Deseret News Sunday, June 5, 1994 Retrieved July 2, 2012 In popular culture This incident formed the basis for the 1972 motion picture Rage, directed by and starring George C.

Expression Testosterone and DHT treatment of murine 3T3-L1 or human SGBS adipocytes for 24 h significantly decreased the mRNA expression of LKB1 via the androgen receptor and consequently reduced the activation of AMPK by phosphorylation. In contrast, 17Œ≤-estradiol treatment increased LKB1 mRNA, an effect mediated by oestrogen receptor alpha. However, in ER-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7, estradiol caused a dose- dependent decrease in LKB1 transcript and protein expression leading to a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of the LKB1 target AMPK. ERŒ± binds to the STK11 promoter in a ligand-independent manner and this interaction is decreased in the presence of estradiol. Moreover, STK11 promoter activity is significantly decreased in the presence of estradiol.  Function  The STK11/LKB1 gene, which encodes a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, regulates cell polarity and functions as a tumour suppressor. LKB1 is a primary upstream kinase of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a necessary element in cell metabolism that is required for maintaining energy homeostasis. It is now clear that LKB1 exerts its growth suppressing effects by activating a group of ~14 other kinases, comprising AMPK and AMPK-related kinases. Activation of AMPK by LKB1 suppresses growth and proliferation when energy and nutrient levels are scarce. Activation of AMPK-related kinases by LKB1 plays vital roles maintaining cell polarity thereby inhibiting inappropriate expansion of tumour cells. A picture from current research is emerging that loss of LKB1 leads to disorganization of cell polarity and facilitates tumour growth under energetically unfavorable conditions. Loss of LKB1 activity is associated with highly aggressive HER2+ breast cancer. HER2/neu mice were engineered for loss of mammary gland expression of Lkb1 resulting in reduced latency of tumorgenesis. These mice developed mammary tumors that were highly metabolic and hyperactive for MTOR. Pre-clinical studies that simultaneously targeted mTOR and metabolism with AZD8055 (inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2) and 2-DG, respectively inhibited mammary tumors from forming. Mitochondria function In control mice that did not have mammary tumors were not affected by AZD8055/2-DG treatments. LKB1 catalytic deficient mutants found in Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome activate the expression of cyclin D1 through recruitment to response elements within the promoter of the oncogene. LKB1 catalytically deficient mutants have oncogenic properties.  Clinical significance  Germline mutations in this gene have been associated with Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the growth of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, pigmented macules on the skin and mouth, and other neoplasms. However, the LKB1 gene was also found to be mutated in lung cancer of sporadic origin, predominantly adenocarcinomas. Further, more recent studies have uncovered a large number of somatic mutations of the LKB1 gene that are present in cervical, breast, intestinal, testicular, pancreatic and skin cancer. Activation LKB1 is activated allosterically by binding to the pseudokinase STRAD and the adaptor protein MO25. The LKB1-STRAD-MO25 heterotrimeric complex represents the biologically active unit, that is capable of phosphorylating and activating AMPK and at least 12 other kinases that belong to the AMPK-related kinase family. Several novel splice isoforms of STRADŒ± that differentially affect LKB1 activity, complex assembly, subcellular localization of LKB1 and the activation of the LKB1-dependent AMPK pathway.  Structure  The crystal structure of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex was elucidated using X-ray crystallography,; and revealed the mechanism by which LKB1 is allosterically activated. LKB1 has a structure typical of other protein kinases, with two (small and large) lobes on either side of the ligand ATP-binding pocket. STRAD and MO25 together cooperate to promote LKB1 active conformation. The LKB1 activation loop, a critical element in the process of kinase activation, is held in place by MO25, thus explaining the huge increase in LKB1 activity in the presence of STRAD and MO25 .  Splice variants  Alternate transcriptional splice variants of this gene have been observed and characterized. There are two main splice isoforms denoted LKB1 long (LKB1L) and LKB1 short (LKB1S). The short LKB1 variant is predominantly found in testes.

History On August 25, 1855, the Kansas Territorial Legislature created Arapahoe County to govern the western portion of Kansas Territory (in what is now Colorado). The county was named for the Arapaho Nation of Native Americans that lived in the region. In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, precipitating the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. To provide local government for the gold mining region, the Kansas Territorial Legislature split Arapahoe County into six counties on February 7, 1859: a much smaller Arapahoe County, Broderick County, El Paso County, Fremont County, Montana County, and Oro County. None of these six counties were ever organized. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the territorial government, which was seated nearly 600 miles away, and they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. Following the Republican Party election victories in 1860, the United States Congress admitted Kansas to the Union on January 29, 1861. The Kansas Act of Admission excluded the portion of the Kansas Territory west of the 25th meridian west from Washington from the new state, and Arapahoe County and the rest of this region reverted to unorganized territory. On February 28, 1861, Colorado Territory was organized out of the present borders of the State of Colorado to govern this unorganized territory and adjacent areas of New Mexico Territory, Utah Territory, and Nebraska Territory. The new Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties on November 1, 1861, including a new Arapahoe County. Another Arapahoe County existed in southwestern Kansas around 1880, when its population was included in the Federal census of that year, but it was never organized. It became defunct in 1883 and its former area was established in 1887 as Haskell County, Kansas.

CQL was founded in 1969 by leading national advocacy organizations in response to unacceptable conditions and abuses in the treatment of people with disabilities. Today, CQL operates an international accreditation program, provides consultation and technical assistance for quality improvement, conducts research and disseminates knowledge, and promotes the definition of quality of life within the context of community life.

Quality of care or quality of service was defined in terms of organizational processes, with particular emphases on assuring safety, health, and security. During the 1970s and 1980s, CQL developed national consensus standards for organizations providing services to people with intellectual disabilities. The standards reflected the principles and values of professionals, families, provider organizations, and government agencies. CQL standards were published in 1971, 1973, 1978, 1981, 1985, 1987 and 1990. In the early stages of this period, quality in human services focused primarily on the organizations that housed people with disabilities. Over time, the focus shifted to the individuals who were cared for by these organizations. Definitions of quality addressed internal processes necessary to ensure that the service recipient received adequate and appropriate care or treatment. However, the focus remained on program evaluation as the measure of quality.  1990s ‚Äì Personal Outcome Measures¬Æ  CQL shifted the definition of quality from compliance with program or process standards to responsiveness to people. Work on the Personal Outcome Measures¬Æ began in 1991, as CQL held focus group meetings with people with disabilities and their families. People defined the outcomes that were most important to them. CQL introduced the Outcome Based Performance Measures in 1993 and the modified Personal Outcome Measures in 1997. These measures represented a significant departure from traditional quality systems. CQL shifted the focus to measuring individual quality of life. Not only were the measures different, the process of gathering information also changed. Personal interviews with people with intellectual disabilities, people with mental illness, or people with other conditions are the foundation of the data gathering process. The measures are applied and evaluated based on the unique characteristics, needs, and desires of each individual.  2000s ‚Äì Social Capital and Community Life  At the start of the new century, and after ten years of data gathering and analysis, CQL recognized that personal outcomes are most likely to be realized when people are part of communities of concerned and supporting people. CQL once again shifted its definitions of quality by focusing on the social or community context for the attainment of personal quality of life. The individual focus of person-directed outcomes, self-determination and individual choice requires a social context. The challenge for organizations and support groups is not only to engage in person-directed processes; rather, it is to use the person-directed orientation to build social capital and community connections. CQL‚Äôs Quality Measures 2005 is a comprehensive resource on multiple dimensions of quality assessment and enhancement. It builds on the foundations of past standards and moves human service providers forward into the current environment.  2010s - Person-centered Excellence  More than fifteen years of research on the CQL Personal Outcome Measure¬Æ national database revealed the importance of person-centered services and social networks in facilitating personal quality of life outcomes for people. CQL introduced the dialogue on social capital and disability in 2000, and redefined quality within the context of community inclusion. CQL argued that people find meaningful life opportunities and alternatives outside of programs and organizational services. The role of organizations is to connect people with resources and social networks in their communities. Unfortunately, our data and experience indicate that many organizations have difficulty making these connections. This led CQL to embark on the development of new definitions, metrics and improvement methods focused on person-centered supports through the What Really Matters initiative. Over a 12-month period, CQL sought out the best thinkers and innovators across a wide range of human services to guide our work.  History  CQL evolved from the work of the American Association on Mental Deficiency-AAMD (now American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities-AAIDD). In 1952, AAMD published the report of a special committee on standards for institutions serving people with intellectual disability. With funding from the National Institute of Mental Health-NIMH, AAMD undertook a major standards development project, culminating in the publication of the Standards for State Institutions for the Mentally Retarded in 1964. In 1966, AAMD and the National Association for Retarded Citizens (now The Arc), the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) and United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) formed the National Planning Committee on Accreditation of Residential Centers for the Retarded. In 1969 the Joint Commissionon Accreditation of Hospitals invited the National Planning Committee to establish an accreditation council within its structure. The Accreditation Council for Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ACFMR) developed accreditation standards and conducted accreditation reviews of facilities serving people with intellectual disability over the next ten years. In 1979 the Joint Commission reorganized its administrative structure and terminated its agreements with various accreditation councils, replacing them with professional and technical advisory committees. The ACFMR voted to reorganize as an independent, not-for-profit organization ‚Äì to be known as The Accreditation Council for Services for Mentally Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled Persons-ACMRDD. Founding members of ACMRDD were: AAMD (now AAIDD), American Psychological Association, The Arc, Epilepsy Foundation of America, National Association of Private Residential Facilities (now ANCOR), National Association of Social Workers, National Society for Children and Adults with Autism (now Autism Society of America), and UCP. In 1981 the American Occupational Therapy Association and the Council for Exceptional Children also became sponsoring organizations. ACMRDD‚Äôs work in updating the standards and review methodology was initially supported by the Administration on Developmental Disabilities in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. During the 1980s and 1990s, the name of the organization evolved from ACMRDD to The Accreditation Council on Services for People with Disabilities-ACD, and in 1997 it became The Council on Quality and Leadership- CQL. During the 1980s, CQL published new editions of standards and conducted a national accreditation program for organizations providing services to people with disabilities. CQL‚Äôs design and dissemination of habilitation standards emphasized the interdisciplinary team process, individualized program planning, behavior intervention, and the promotion of disability rights. The Standards for Services influenced federal certification requirements for the Intermediate Care Facilities for intellectual disability (ICF/MR) program. The Health Care Financing Administration-HCFA, now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-CMS, acknowledged that its regulations were based on the 1983 draft CQL standards. CQL standards were also recognized by the U.S. courts in several landmark cases, including: * Wyatt v Stickney (State of Alabama, 1972) * Evans v Washington (District of Columbia, 1978) * The Arc v Schafer (State of North Dakota, 1982) * Lelsz v Kavanagh (State of Texas, 1987) * Baldridge v Clinton (State of Arkansas, 1991) The courts affirmed that CQL standards represented a reliable benchmark for ensuring that individuals with disabilities were receiving appropriate services and that their rights, safety, and security were assured. During this period, CQL operated as a standards organization and accreditation organization, with a particular focus on quality in services for people with intellectual disability and other developmental disabilities. In the 1990s, CQL shifted to a broader focus, moving beyond habilitation planning and measures of organizational process. Work began on the Outcome Based Performance Measures, renamed Personal Outcome Measures in 2000. These new measures were a departure from previous editions of standards and redefined quality in services in terms of an organization‚Äôs capability to facilitate outcomes for people. CQL used the term ‚Äúpersonal outcomes‚Äù in contrast to ‚Äúprocess outcomes‚Äù. Process outcomes are concerned with an organization‚Äôs compliance with norms or regulations. They measure organizational accomplishments, such as number of placements, hours of service delivery, staffing ratios, or number of people served in a program. Personal outcomes focus on the issues that matter most to the person receiving the services provided by the organization. They answer the question of ‚Äúhow well did the organization deliver its services to meet the individual needs and desires of each person?‚Äù The CQL accreditation process with the Personal Outcome Measures is built around interviews with people receiving services and learning how each person defines the outcomes for him or herself. From this understanding of what each individual wants, the organization is evaluated on how well it delivered person centered services and support. The Personal Outcome Measures apply to people with mental illness, children, youth and families, and other at risk or vulnerable people in the human service system. In 2005, CQL published Quality Measures 2005> emphasizing Community Life as the context for quality. In the Fall of 2010, CQL published the Guide to Person-centered Excellence as the culmination of the What Really Matters Initiative. CQL developed the Guide to Person-centered Excellence to encourage organizations to provide the supports and services for people that really matter. The Guide utilizes CQL's 8 Key Factors and 34 Success Indicators that promote personal quality of life. CQL developed three different applications, one for each setting: services and supports for older adults, people with mental illness, and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The 34 Success Indicators are consistent across all three settings, while the narratives are tailored to apply to the specific audience and service setting. CQL continues to place the Personal Outcome Measures¬Æ at the foundation of work with organizations. One-to-one conversations with people receiving supports are the most powerful source of knowledge and understanding when it comes to defining excellence and person-centeredness.  Services  CQL provides the following services: * Accreditation - Utilize a proven framework for quality monitoring and enhancement through person-centered, internationally-recognized approaches. * Training - Choose from more than a dozen on-site training options featuring in-depth and applicable information to improve skills and knowledge. * Certification - Increase quality and consistency in the use of the Personal Outcome Measures¬Æ by individuals, organizations, and governmental agencies. * Research - Access studies, findings, and analysis affecting the human services field, as well as gain insight through CQL‚Äôs PORTAL Data System. * Consultation - Apply customized solutions tailored to your unique needs in human services, with collaboration and guidance by CQL staff members. * Tools & Resources - Implement best practices at your organization through a robust library of webinars, guides, manuals, briefs, videos, and articles.

As the number of missions, schools and converts grew, different regions became distinct vicariates covering portions of the original territory.  History  Early years The archbishop of Algeria, Charles Lavigerie, founded the society of Missionaries of Our Lady of Africa of Algeria in 1868. The society came to be known as the \\"P√®res Blancs\\" or \\"White Fathers\\" from the white habits of the missionaries. At first the main activity was to care for Arab orphans in Algeria, but conversion of the people of Central Africa was an objective from the start. Ten missionaries left Algiers in 1878 to establish posts at Lakes Victoria Nyanza and Tanganyika. R.P. Ganachan of the White Fathers penetrated the region of Unyanyembe in 1879, and tried unsuccessfully to settle at Tabora. The White Fathers reached Lake Tanganyika in January 1879, and established a station at Rumonge on the east side of the lake. The Apostolic Vicariate of Tanganyika was established on 27 September 1880 from the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa. The missionaries founded the mission of Mulwewa opposite Rumonge, on the west side of the lake, in the region of Massange in response to an appeal from Massange. The mission was founded by Father Deniaud, the Superior of the Tanganyika mission, with Fathers Moinet and Delaunay, leaving Rumonge on 25 November 1880. In 1891 R.P. Guillet managed to open an orphanage at Tabora, which was soon moved to Kipalapala an hour's walk away. R.P. Lourdel established a post at Djiue-la-Singa in 1894, abandoned on 13 March 1885. On the west shore of Lake Tanganyika the White Fathers founded the stations of Kibanga on 11 June 1883, Mkapakwe on 12 September 1884, Mpala on 8 July 1885 and Baudouinville on 8 May 1893. The local potentate, Rumaliza, tolerated the foundation of the missions at Mulwewa and Kibanga, but prevented establishment of a station at Ujiji, at the extreme northeast of the lake. The mission at Mulwewa was abandoned soon after the acquisition of the stations of Mpala and Karema in 1885. Charbonnier The first Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika was Jean- Baptiste-Fr√©zal Charbonnier. Charbonnier left Algiers for Tanganyika in October 1884, with a large staff. Charbonnier was stationed at Karema on the east shore of Lake Tanganyika when Captain L√©opold Louis Joubert arrived on 22 November 1886, on his way to provide assistance to the station of Mpala on the opposite shore of the lake. Joubert remained there for some months at the request of Charbonnier to protect the mission against attacks by slavers. Charbonnier was formally appointed Vicar Apostolic on 14 January 1887. He was ordained bishop by Bishop L√©on Livinhac on 24 August 1887 at Kipalapala, and was the first bishop to be ordained in equatorial Africa. On 11 January 1887, the Apostolic Vicariate of Unyanyembe was separated from Tanganyika, with Bishop Fran√ßois Gerboin as the first Vicar Apostolic. Unyanyembe consisted of the northern portion of the Vicariate of Tanganyika, including the land around Tabora and extending west to include what is now Burundi. Ujiji remained in the Vicariate of Tanganyika, and what is now Rwanda remained in the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Victoria Nyanza. On 11 January 1887 the Apostolic Vicariate of Upper Congo was created, containing the missions to the west of Lake Tanganyika. Joubert left for Mpala, now in the Apostolic Vicariate of Upper Congo, in March 1887. Charbonnier had given him full authority as civil and military ruler of the Mpala region. Charbonnier died at Karema on 16 March 1888. L√©once Bridoux was asked to succeed him. Bridoux Bridoux left Marseille on 17 July 1888 destined for Zanzibar accompanied by six missionaries, including Antonin Guillermain. He arrived at the station of Mpala on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika in January 1889. He found a dispute between Father Fran√ßois Coulbois, who had become head of the mission when Charbonnier died, and L√©opold Louis Joubert, who was in charge of defense and civil affairs. Coulbois did not recognize that Joubert had civil authority, and had imposed tight restrictions on his actions. Bridoux confirmed that Joubert was both civil and military leader, but said that military operations must be purely defensive. Joubert moved to St Louis de Murumbi, some distance away, to avoid identification of his soldiers with the mission. In January 1889 the Mpala mission was cut off from the outside world by the Abushiri Revolt against the Germans in Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam. The mission suffered from repeated and deadly raids. On 31 July 1889 part of the territory was separated as the Apostolic Prefecture of Nyassa. Around the end of May 1890 a group of Arabs prepared to cross the Lukuga River about to the north of Mpala. Some skirmishing occurred between the Arabs and the mission's African forces before Joubert could reach the scene. The Arabs tried to negotiate with the missionaries, saying they would not harm the mission if the priests abandoned Joubert. Bridoux refused. It seemed that serious fighting was going to break out, when a storm arose that destroyed some of the Arab fleet and forced them to withdraw. Bridoux died on 20 October 1890. He was succeeded by Mgr. Adolphe Lechaptois. Lechaptois On 19 June 1891 Lechaptois was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika and Titular Bishop of Utica. He made his base at Karema, which he reached on 8 September 1891. From there he visited the missions of Mpala, Mrumbi and Kibanga on the west shore. The Swahili-Arab slave traders were active in the region, causing great insecurity. The missions could do little except defend themselves, their orphanages and the refugees from the slavers. The Apostolic Vicariate of Upper Congo became independent from Tanganyika in 1892, led by Bishop Victor Roelens. The Apostolic Vicariate of Nyassa became independent from Tanganyika on 12 February 1897, led by Joseph Dupont. Lechaptois founded the missions of Kala, Zimba, Utinta, Mkulwe and Galula between 1895 and 1901. The German colonial authorities in what was then German East Africa generally supported his efforts, although there were some disputes over the demarcation of areas assigned to the Catholic and Moravian missions. During the first part of the 20th century Lechaptois opened many schools, as well as five orphanages. The training center for catechist-teachers moved several times. eventually settling at Zimba. The center at Karema became a junior seminary, and a major seminary was opened at Utinta. Lechaptois died on 30 November 1917 at Karema. Father Avon administered the vicariate until Joseph-Marie Birraux was named the new Vicar Apostolic. Later history On 18 July 1932 part of the territory was transferred to the Mission sui iuris of Tukuyu, later to become the Diocese of Mbeya. On 10 May 1946 the Vicariate was divided into the Apostolic Vicariate of Karema (now diocese of Sumbawanga) and the Apostolic Vicariate of Kigoma.

History Demographics According to the 2000 census, 57,500 people in Utah claimed some Italian ancestry, with about 3,000 being recent immigrants. The percentage of Italian Americans in Utah is about 2.3 percent. Nationally, their percentage is calculated around 5.6 percent, with the majority living in the Northeast, in the Midwest, in California, and in Florida. Notable Italians in Utah *Fortunato Anselmo was the Vice Consul of Italy of Salt Lake City from the 1920s to the beginning of the World War II. He was very respected for his volunteer work in favor of the new Italian immigrants. * Mario Capecchi is the 2007 Nobel Prize winner for Medicine. *Joseph Toronto was the first Italian who came to Utah with the first pioneers in 1848. He was the \\"President's (Brigham Young) herdsman.\\" In 1850 he accompanied Lorenzo Snow in the first Italian Mormon mission in the Turin area, where they converted a few Waldensians. He has many notable descendants in Utah. Organizations Past The main goal of the early fraternal organizations were to provide funding for sick days to members, because at that time there was no coverage for workers. The most important were: Fratellanza Minatori, founded at Sunnyside in 1902. Italian Americanization Club, was based in Salt Lake City, starting from 1919. Societ√† Cristoforo Colombo, operated in Salt Lake City, Ogden and Castle Gate for several years, starting in 1897.Philip F. Notarianni, \\"Italian Fraternal Organizations in Utah, 1897-1934,\\" Utah Historical Quarterly 43 (1975) Present The Italian American Civic League was founded in 1934 and it is still active today. It is the oldest remaining Italian club in Utah and is also a non- profit organization. The Friendly Club was founded in Ogden by a group of northern Italians from the region of Trentino (north of Venice) in 1937. Today it is called the Trentini Club. Italian American Lawyers Association was founded a few years ago. They have monthly meetings. Education As of today, Brigham Young University is the only educational institution in Utah that has a B.A. program in Italian Language and Culture. They also offer a program in Florence and Rome. The University of Utah offers a minor in Italian language, along with a program in Siena. Through OSHER, a beginning language course is also offered. East High School in Salt Lake City offers a short beginning course. Nationally, Italian is the fourth most taught language in schools and colleges, after Spanish, French, and German. Media In the early years of Italian immigration, several newspapers appeared, such as Il Minatore, edited by Mose Paggi, La Gazzetta Italiana, by G. Milano, La Scintilla, by Alfonso Russo and G. Milano, and Il Corriere d'America, by Frank Niccoli and Alfonso Russo. Copies of these newspapers, as well as old pictures, and taped and transcribed interviews of prominent Italians are kept at the Special Collection of the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah. Recently, the In Piazza magazine was published from 1998 to 2004. As of today, there are no Italian paper periodicals published in Utah. Utah Italians Over the years Italy has provided Utah with thousands of people. Some came for religious motivations and most for better economic opportunities. Four thousand came as prisoners of war and a few remained in Utah after the World War II ended. Eight of them rest in a Salt Lake City cemetery after being killed by a camp sentinel. A few hundred Utah soldiers fought in Italy against the Germans and the Fascists and several died. Regarding the number of people, for many years the balance has been in favor of Italy. But starting from the late 1960s, many Mormon missionaries from Utah are active in the major Italian cities. During the past forty years, several thousand of them have spent up to two years in Italy. As a result of their efforts, about 20,000 Italians have converted to Mormonism. Some of them have married former Mormon missionaries. LDS chapels and congregations are present in most Italian cities. The Genealogical Society of Utah has microfilmed a large percentage of Italy‚Äôs Catholic Church and Civil Records. This project is ongoing. Trade and tourism Italy is one of the top 25 of Utah's trading partners. Gold is the major product exported to Italy, followed by computer electronics and software. According to official data, Utah is visited every year by about 12,000 Italians.

The tumors generally begin in layers of connective tissue such as that under the skin, between muscles, and surrounding organs, and will generally start as a small lump with inflammation that grows. At first the lump will be self-contained as the tumor exists in its stage 1 state, and will not necessarily expand beyond its encapsulated form. However, it may develop cancerous processes that can only be detected through microscopic examination. As such, at this level the tumor is usually treated by excision that includes wide margins of healthy-looking tissue, followed by thorough biopsy and additional excision if necessary. The prognosis for a stage 1 tumor excision is usually fairly positive, but if the tumors progress to levels 2 and 3, prognosis is worse because tumor cells have likely spread to other locations. These locations can either be nearby tissues or system-wide locations that include the lungs, kidneys, and liver. In these cases prognosis is grim and chemotherapy and radiation are the only methods of controlling the cancer. Spindle cell sarcoma can develop for a variety of reasons, including genetic predisposition but it also may be caused by a combination of other factors including injury and inflammation in patients that are already thought to be predisposed to such tumors. Spindle cells are a naturally occurring part of the body's response to injury.

See also related articles Amiga Internet and communications software, Amiga music software, Amiga programming languages, and Amiga support and maintenance software for other information regarding software that run on Amiga. History The Amiga originally supported such prestigious software titles as WordPerfect, Electronic Arts' Deluxe Paint, and Lattice C. Newtek's Video Toaster, one of the first all-in-one graphics and video editing packages, began on the Amiga. The Video Toaster was one of the few accessories for the \\"big box\\" Amigas (2000, 3000 and 4000) that used the video slot and enabled users to turn their Amiga into the heart of an entire TV production suite. The later addition of the Video Flyer by Newtek made possible the first non-linear video editing program for the Amiga. The Amiga made 3D raytracing graphics available for the masses with Sculpt 3D. Before the Amiga, raytracing was only available for dedicated graphic workstations such as the SGI. Other raytracing software also included TurboSilver. The Amiga was well known for its 3D rendering capability, with many titles being added to the mix as the years went by. Some titles were later ported to Microsoft Windows and continue to thrive there, such as the rendering software Cinema 4D from Maxon, and LightWave from Newtek, which was originally part of the Video Toaster. The Video Toaster itself has even been ported to the Windows platform. LightWave was used for low-cost computer generated special effects during the early 1990s, with Babylon 5 being a notable example of a TV-series utilizing LightWave. Even Microsoft produced software for use on the Amiga. AmigaBASIC, an advanced BASIC software development environment, complete with an integrated development environment (IDE), was written by Microsoft under contract. Graphics software Amiga had its beginnings in 1985 with a strong attitude for graphics, more so than other PCs of its age due to its peculiar hardware, and its multimedia chipset. The graphical chip Agnus could access directly RAM and pilot it with DMA (Direct Memory Access) privileges, and featured Bit Blitter and Copper circuits capable to move ranges of pixels on the screen and deal directly with the electronic beam of the TV set. It could render graphic screens of various number of colors (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 4096 color HAM modes) starting from 320x200 up to 720x576 pixel graphic pages. Amiga released a vast number of graphics software programs, such as Graphicraft, Deluxe Paint, TVPaint, Photon Paint, Brilliance!, (a program entirely realized upon the suggestions and wishes of well known computer artist Jim Sachs), Aegis Images, ArtEffect, fxPAINT by IOSpirit, Personal Paint from Cloanto, Photogenics, Express Paint, Digi Paint, XiPaint, PerfectPaint, SketchBlock 24 bit painting program by Andy Broad for AmigaOS 4.x users  Graphic applications on AmigaOne systems  Unlike Commodore Amiga systems, AmigaOne systems have no integrated multimedia chipsets. AmigaOne systems, similar to Mac or PC, sport AGP/PCIe graphic cards, embedded audio AC'97 sound system, and can use PCI/PCIe audio cards, even some professional models. The expanded capability of faster CPU performance, and the availability of standard expansion graphic cards, lead to a new generation of graphic software being born for the AmigaOne machines such as Hollywood \\"Visual Programming Suite\\". This made it also easy to port modern Open Source software like Blender3D.  Visual programming  Hollywood suite of programs by German software house Airsoft SoftWair is a multimedia and presentation program available for all Amigas (AmigaOS, MorphOS, AROS) and recently, , a version of Hollywood became available for Microsoft Windows as well. It is able to load Scala projects and Microsoft Powerpoint \\".PPT\\" files. Its module Hollywood Designer is not only a modern multimedia authoring software but also a true complete cross platform multimedia application layer capable of creating whole Amiga programs through a Visual design approach. It also can save executables in various formats: 68k Amiga, WarpUP, AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS executables and Intel X86 code for AROS. Recent versions of Hollywood allow for creating executable programs for Intel Windows machines, Mac OS X for PPC processors and Mac OS X for Intel processors.  Modern graphic software  There are fairly modern, recent graphic software that is available for AmigaOne machines, and some are still usable on Amiga platforms. TV Paint was born in 1991, and it was one of the first commercial 32bit graphic software on the market. Latest Amiga version (3.59) was released in 1994 and actually is distributed publicly, but the source code is still proprietary. It is still a valid graphic program, and continues to be used despite its age, due to its ease of use and its vast number of features. Programs like Candy Factory for AOS 4.0 are designed to create special effects for images, brushes and fonts to create gorgeous internet objects and buttons used in designing web pages. Pixel image editor, formerly Pixel32 is available for MorphOS. Blender 3D is one of the best Open Source cross platform software. Also a first pre-release of GIMP is available on AmigaOS 4.0 through the AmiCygnix X11 graphic engine. Beginning with release 2.1 in 2008, MorphOS has included its own standard Paint utility called Sketch, simple but powerful, and AROS has bundled with the last free version of Luna Paint which become actually a commercial paint program for various operating systems. Graphic utilities As in any Operating Systems there can't exists only bitmap and vector paint software. All around these main software aimed at creating drawings directly by an author, or aimed at manipulating existing image files it exists a vast market of graphic utilities with peculiar features created in order to support main graphic programs. For example, in Amiga it existed very professional software and it is noteworthy to mention at least some the most important and widely used into Amiga market like Cinematte, CineMorph, Morph Plus, Impact!, Essence, Magic Lantern and Pixel 3D Pro, that were only some of the most notorious ones in the vast range of graphic utilities that could be purchased by skilled and professional users of Amiga platform in its golden age. Cinematte utility allow the user to easily make complex photo-realistic composites of subjects that are photographed against a bluescreen, or green screen background. It uses the same sophisticated techniques used worldwide in motion picture technology for precise bluescreen compositing. CineMorph it is a program to automatically create morphing effects between two given original images, and create a compound third image, or even all the animation movie associated with the morphing effect. Morph Plus performed same effects as Cinemorph. Impact! created physics simulation in 3D scenes. Essence was a texture maker to apply textures on 3D surfaces of objects created by 3D tracing programs. Amiga Magic Lantern was a true color animation compressor and player for the Amiga, Pixel 3D Pro utility it was used to create models for 3D objects and save it in various 3D formats, or to transform any model object from a 3D file format to another. Vector graphics Common widely used format for vector graphics in Amiga are EPS and IFF DR2D. It originated from the fact that Amiga was the first platform on which ran Ghostscript natively, and also IFF DR2D was the original standard for vector graphics generated by Amiga ProVector and later adopted by other applications such as Art Expression and Professional Draw. Foremost used Amiga drawing and vector graphics utilities are Aegis Draw, ProDraw (Professional Draw) from Gold Disk Inc., DrawStudio, Art Expression, ProVector, and for some basic vector graphics, also the tools of Professional Page and PageStream are useful. The most modern vector graphics programs on Amiga are actually MindSpace 1.1, which is aimed mainly at design flowcharts, mindtables, UML and diagrams, and Steam Draw a 2D simple vector paint program available for MorphOS. =Flash and SWF= SWFTools is a collection of command line programs to convert and save various raster(bitmap) image formats from and to Flash SWF vector animation format. =Tracing software= On AmigaOS are available the widely used free distributable vector to graphics conversion facilities Autotrace, Potrace, XTrace which can run also in AROS Amiga Open Source clone OS and MorphOS Amiga-Like system. The Desktop Publishing software PageStream has a tracing utility as bundled software. The structured drawing program ProVector had an optional add-on tracing utility named StylusTracer. =DXF, EMF, SVG file formats= Various programs can read DXF (almost all Amiga CAD programs), EMF, SVG, CGM, GEM, WMF, an example of converting tool that reads many formats and output DR2D is the Amiga program MetaView. It exists also a SVG Datatype to support directly in the OS, on any program, the feature of loading and saving files in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. Computer aided design At its beginning Amiga was considered to offer the most powerful graphic platform at a reasonable price. It had various CAD programs available for it, such as X-CAD, IntelliCAD, DynaCaDD, MaxonCAD, IntroCAD, and even programs to design and test electronic circuits, such as ElektroCAD. Animation, Comics and Cartoons Due to the peculiar capabilities of Amiga in multimedia, and the features of the bit blitter circuit, Amiga was capable of performing advanced animation and video authoring at professional level in the eighties, and thus it was created a vast amount of software which filled also this segment of the professional video editing market. For Amiga there were available animation programs like: Aegis Animator, Lights!Camera!Action!, DeLuxe Video, Disney Animation Studio, versions later than 3 of Deluxe Paint, The Director (a BASIC-like language oriented to animation), Scala, Vision from Commodore itself, VisualFX from ClassX, Adorage Multi Effect program from proDAD, Millennium from Nova Design. ImageFX, and Art Department Pro. Comic Setter was an interesting tools to create printed comics by arranging brushes representing comic characters, joining it with background images and superimposing it the right frames and \\"ballons\\" with their own text speech and captions. It could then print in color the comics that were created. Disney Animation Studio was one of the most powerful 2D programs for realizing cartoons. Born on Amiga, this program, equipped also with a complete cell-frame preview feature was used by many cartoon studios worldwide at its age and still used by some several studios in Europe as a useful preview tool. Authoring and VideoFX In its golden age Amiga can count on a vast range of animation and video authoring software; Aegis Animator, Lights!Camera!Action!, DeLuxe Video, Disney Animation Studio, versions later than 3 of Deluxe Paint, The Director (a BASIC-like language oriented to animation), Scala, Amiga Vision from Commodore itself, VisualFX from ClassX, Adorage Multi Effect program from proDAD, Wildfire by Andreas Maschke (ported by author to Java later), Millennium from Nova Design, ImageFX from Nova Design, and Art Department Pro. 3D modeling, rendering and animation 3D rendering and animation software includes Sculpt 3D, TurboSilver, Aladdin4D, Videoscape 3D, Caligari, Maxon Cinema4D, Imagine, LightWave from Newtek, Real3D from Realsoft, Vista Pro, World Construction Set 3D terrain rendering programs, and Tornado3D by the Italian company Eyelight. Amateur and professional video editing Amiga was one of the first commercial computer platform to allow amateur and professional video editing, due to its capability in connecting to TV sets, and deal with Chroma-Key, Genlock signal, at full screen with overscan features, and a good noise-gain ratio. Amiga and its video peripherals (mainly Genlock boxes and digitizing boxes) in the nineties were available at reasonable prices and then this made the Amiga to become one of the professional video market leader platforms. It was also capable of dealing with broadcast video production (Newtek VideoToaster), and in the age around the 1992-1994, despite of the Commodore demise, Amiga knew its golden age as a professional video platform and there were available for Amiga a vast amount of any kind of video software, graphic facilities and reselling of any of gfx and image gallery data files that could be applied to video productions. Amongst these software it is worth mentioning the main Amiga video-editing programs for desktop video with both linear and non linear editing with 4.2.2 capabilities as the ones from Newtek available with VideoToaster Flyer external module for Video Toaster and just called NLE! (Non Linear Editing), Amiga MainActor, Broadcaster Elite, Wildfire by Andreas Maschke for vfx (now in Java), MovieShop for the expansion Amiga cards PAR, VLab Motion, and VLab Pro. Word processing and page layout While desktop video proved to be a major market for the Amiga, a surge of word processing, page layout and graphic software filled out the professional needs starting from the first Amiga text program Textcraft which was a mix between a real word processor and an advanced text editor, but capable of changing page layouts, fonts, enlarging or reducing their width, changing their colors and adding color images to the text. Notable word processing programs for Amiga included the then-industry standard WordPerfect up to version 4.1, Shakespeare, Excellence, Maxon Word, Final Writer, Amiga Writer, Scribble!, ProWrite, Wordworth and the little Personal Write by Cloanto. The page layout software included Page Setter and Professional Page from Gold Disk, and PageStream by Soft-Logik, known today as Grasshopper LLC). Only PageStream was ported to other platforms and continues to be developed and supported by the developers. Graphic software included vector drawing applications like Art Expression from Soft-Logik, ProVector by Stylus, Inc. (formerly Taliesin), Draw Studio, and Professional Draw from Gold Disk. Amiga lacked an office suite as the term is meant now, but integrated software was available. Pen Pal was a word processor integrated with a database and a form editor. Scribble!, Analyze! and Organize! were bundled together as the Works! suite combining a word processor, spreadsheet and database. Despite the similarity in name, it had no connection to Microsoft Works. The page layout language LaTeX was available in two ports: AmigaTeX, which is no longer available (the first LaTeX can be edited with a front end program), and PasTEX, available on Aminet repository. Modern software AbiWord is available today on AmigaOS 4.0 through the AmiCygnix X11 graphical engine, Scriba and Papyrus Office pre-release is available for MorphOS. Text editors Text editors available on Amiga include Vim, Emacs and MicroEMACS (included), Cygnus Editor also known as CED, and GoldED, which then evolved in 2006 into Cubic IDE. The UNIX ne editor and the vi-clone Vim were initially developed on the Amiga. Development of Text editors never stopped in Amiga. Since 2001, in MorphOS, a limited edition version of GoldEd called MorphEd is available, and since 2008 Cinnamon Writer and NoWin ED, a universal editor which runs on any Amiga-like platform, are available. Cinnamon Writer is increasing new features to all new releases and aspires to become a full-featured WordProcessor. Database and spreadsheets In the first age of Amiga (1986‚Äì1989) there were cross-platform spreadsheets available, such as MaxiPlan, which was available also for MS-DOS and Macintosh. Logistix (real name LoGisTiX), one of the first spreadsheets for Amiga, Microfiche Filer Plus was a database which gave the user the experience of exploring data as using microfilms. SuperBase was one of the finest programs available for C64. It was then ported on Atari, Amiga, and later on PC. But on Amiga, it would become a standard reference, available in two versions Superbase Personal and SuperBase Professional It could handle SQL databases and had a query internal language such as BASIC. It was capable of creating forms and masks on records and handling multimedia files into its records years before Microsoft Access. Superbase also featured VCR control style buttons to browse records of any database. Softwood File II was another simple multimedia database which then evolved into Final Data, a good database available for Amiga from Softwood Inc. From the same firm there was Final Calc, a very powerful spreadsheet, similar to TurboCalc from the German company Schatztruhe. ProChart was a tool to draw flow charts and diagrams. Analyze! was a fairly full featured (for the time) spreadsheet developed for the Amiga. Organize! was a flat file database package. Gnumeric spreadsheet has also been ported on Amiga through an X11 engine called AmiCygnix. In recent times MUIbase was born and mainly cross-platform MySQL database language became a reference on Amiga also. SQLite, a self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine, can also be found available on AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS. In February 2010, Italian programmer Andrea Palmat√® ported IODBC standard to AmigaOS 4. Science, entertainment and special use programs Maple V is one of the best general purpose mathematics software (a.k.a. Mathematic-CAD) ever made. It was available for Amiga also, and appreciated by many scientists using Amiga in its time. Distant Suns, Galileo, Digital Almanac and Amiga Digital Universe (from Bill Eaves for the OS4) were stellar sky exploring programs and astronomic calculators. During the age of CDTV many historic, science, and art CDs like Timetable of Science, Innovation, Timetable of Business, Politics, Grolier's Encyclopedia, Guinness Disk of Records, Video Creator, American Heritage Dictionary, Illustrated Holy Bible, Illustrated Works of Shakespeare, etc. were available. Entertainment For Amiga there were literally hundreds of entertainment software. Some notable programs for kids and learning were: Adventures in Math series of floppy disks, from Free Spirit Software, Animal Kingdom series of disks from Unicorn Software, Art School all the series of Barney Bear software, the Discovery series, including Discovery trivia, Donald's Alphabet Chase, Mickey's 123's and Mickey's ABC's by Disney Software, the Electric Crayon and Ferngully series of educational coloring book software (Ferngully was taken from the animation movie), Fun School series of disks, Kid Pix set of disks from the well known Broderbund Software house, which was famous in the nineties, Miracle Piano Teaching System to teach music to kids, various tales of Mother Goose, and World Atlas by Centaur Software. Fractals, virtual reality, artificial intelligence ZoneXplorer from Elena Novaretti is considered amongst Amiga users one of the best fractal experience programs ever made on Amiga, if not on any platform. In 1989 the X-Specs 3D Glasses from Haitex Resources, one of the first interactive 3D solutions for home computers were created. Also created on Amiga, were the multimedia interactive TV non immersive Virtual reality exploring software Mandala from Vivid Group Inc., and the Virtuality System Virtuality 1000 CS 3D VRML all-immersive simulator from W-Industries (then Virtuality Inc.), for game entertainment in big arcade installations and theme parks, based on A3000. Magellan v.1.1 (Artificial Intelligence Software), not to be confused with Directory Opus Magellan, was a program to emulate Artificial intelligence responses on Amiga, by creating heuristic programmed rules based on machine learning in its form of supervised learning. The user would choose into decision trees and decision tables system of AI featured by the Magellan program, in which to input objects, and desired outputs and describe all associate conditions and rules which the machine should follow in order to output pseudo-intelligent solutions to given problems. Route planning AmiATLAS v.6, was a complete Route planner tool for Amiga computers. It provided worldwide interactive maps and found optimal routes for traveling from one place to another. It also featured multiple map loading, an integrated CityGuide-System with information to interesting towns, places or regions, some even with pictures, and information about many parks and points of interest. Personal organizer, notebook, diary software Digita Organizer v.1.1 from Digita International was the best Amiga program to let the user to note about dates, meetings, remember expiry dates, etcetera. PolyOrga for MorphOS by Fr√©d√©ric Rignault. Personal budget, home banking, accounts Easy Banker, Home Accounts, Small Business Accounts, Small Business Manager, Account Master, Accountant, AmigaMoney, Banca Base III, HomeBank, CashMaster, Counting House, etc. Software for special purposes AVT (Amiga Video Transceiver), was a software and hardware Slow-scan television system originally developed by \\"Black Belt Systems\\" (USA) around 1990 for the Amiga home computer popular all over the world before the IBM PC family gained sufficient audio quality with the help of special sound cards. Richmond Sound Design (RSD) created both show control (a.k.a. MSC or \\"MIDI Show Control\\") and theatre sound design software which was used extensively in the theatre, theme park, display, exhibit, stage managing, show and themed entertainment industries in the 1980s and 1990s and at one point in the mid 90s, there were many high-profile shows at major theme parks around the world being controlled by Amigas through software simply called Stage Manager which then evolved into its Microsoft Windows version called ShowMan. There were dozens at Walt Disney World alone and more at all other Disney, Universal Studios, Six Flags and Madame Tussauds properties as well as in many venues in Las Vegas including The Mirage hotel Volcano and Siegfried and Roy show, the MGM Grand EFX show, Broadway theatre, London's West End, the Royal Shakespeare Company's many venues, most of Branson, Missouri's theatres, and scores of theatres on cruise ships, amongst hundreds of others. RSD purchased used Amigas on the web and reconditioned them to provide enough systems for all the shows that specified them and only stopped providing new Amiga installations in 2000. There are still an unknown number of shows on cruise ships and in themed venues being run by Amigas.

Stereotactic core biopsy makes use of the underlying principle of parallax to determine the depth or \\"Z-dimension\\" of the target lesion. Stereotactic core biopsy is extensively used by radiologists specializing in breast imaging to obtain tissue samples containing microcalcifications, which can be an early sign of breast cancer. Uses X-ray-guided stereotactic biopsy is used for impalpable lesions that are not visible on ultrasound. A stereotactic biopsy may be used, with x-ray guidance, for performing a fine needle aspiration for cytology and needle core biopsy to evaluate a breast lesion. However, that type of biopsy is also sometimes performed without any imaging guidance, and typically, stereotactic guidance is used for core biopsies or vacuum-assisted mammotomy. Stereotactic core biopsy is necessary for evaluating atypical appearing calcifications found on mammogram of the breast.

The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. Stereotactic radiation therapy is used to treat brain tumors and other brain disorders. It is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer, such as lung cancer. What differentiates Stereotactic from conventional radiotherapy is the precision with which it is delivered. There are multiple systems available, some of which use specially designed frames which physically attach to the patient's skull while newer more advanced techniques use thermoplastic masks and highly accurate imaging systems to locate the patient. The end result is the delivery of high doses of radiation with sub-millimetre accuracy. Stereotactic External-Beam radiation Therapy, sometimes called SBRT is now being used to treat Small Cell Lung Cancer, and Sarcomas that have metastasized to the lungs. The high doses used in thoracic SBRT can sometimes cause adverse effects ranging from mild rib fatigue and transient esophagitis, to fatal events such as pneumonitis or hemorrhage. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, administers very high doses of radiation, using several beams of various intensities aimed at different angles to precisely target the tumor(s)in the lungs. The images taken from CAT scans and MRIs are used to design a four-dimensional, customized treatment plan that determines each beam's intensity and positioning. The goal is to deliver the highest possible dose of radiation to kill the cancer while minimizing exposure to healthy organs. Since sarcomas often metastasize to the lungs, this treatment is an effective tool in fighting the progression of the disease.

It is the 115th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are three paperhangers who also look after invalid Mary (Mary Ainslee), who always uses a wheelchair. The seemingly helpless blonde, however, is trying to swindle her insurance company out of $25,000, as she is not handicapped in the least. While the Stooges are at work hanging posters, they are taken by one poster that advertises a great hypnotist, Svengarlic (\\"He'll steal your breath away!\\" the poster announces). The Stooges want the hypnotist to work his magic on Mary so that she can walk again, but Svengarlic is more interested in winning an audience by hypnotizing the Stooges. Under his spell, they walk out onto a flagpole high on a building and dance. But a distracted bicyclist knocks Svengarlic over and the Stooges are abruptly awakened. They immediately panic when they see where they are, then the flagpole breaks, sending them flying through an open window. The boys land directly in the insurance office where Mary is about to be handed her check. Startled, she jumps out of her wheelchair, exposing her scheme. Production notes Hokus Pokus was reworked in 1956 as Flagpole Jitters, using ample stock footage. In particular, the two films have different endings: Mary is a fraud here, whereas in the later picture she is actually paraplegic. In the remake Svengarlic is the fraud. The Stooges make a reference to Sing Sing Correctional Facility, in which Shemp believes he has hypnotized Moe into thinking he is locked up in the infamous prison. The character name 'Svengarlic' is a parody of 'Svengali,' the name of a fictional character in George du Maurier's 1894 novel Trilby.Solomon, Jon.

Function  Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the activities of more than 70 polypeptides. The protein that coordinates these activities is the basal transcription factor TFIID, which binds to the core promoter to position the polymerase properly, serves as the scaffold for assembly of the remainder of the transcription complex, and acts as a channel for regulatory signals. TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as TBP-associated factors or TAFs. TAFs may participate in basal transcription, serve as coactivators, function in promoter recognition or modify general transcription factors (GTFs) to facilitate complex assembly and transcription initiation. This gene encodes the largest subunit of TFIID. This subunit binds to core promoter sequences encompassing the transcription start site. It also binds to activators and other transcriptional regulators, and these interactions affect the rate of transcription initiation. This subunit contains two independent protein kinase domains at the N and C-terminals, but also possesses acetyltransferase activity and can act as a ubiquitin-activating/conjugating enzyme. Two transcripts encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene. Histones are often acetylated to open DNA for transcription. TAF1 contains two bromodomains, which each can bind one of two acetyllysine residues at position 5 and 12 in the H4 tail, to stabilize the TBP-TATA box complex.  Clinical significance  A mutation in TAF1 was identified that contributes to a phenotype with severe intellectual disability (ID), a characteristic intergluteal crease, and distinctive facial features, including a broad, upturned nose, sagging cheeks, downward sloping palpebral fissures, prominent periorbital ridges, deep-set eyes, relative hypertelorism, thin upper lip, a high-arched palate, prominent ears with thickened helices, and a pointed chin This is a non-synonymous change in TAF1 that results in an isoleucine (hydrophobic) to threonine (polar) change on the 1337th amino acid residue in the protein (NP_001273003.1). Two other mutations were reported in TAF1 in two families with intellectual disability, although further clinical details were not reported.  Interactions  TAF1 has been shown to interact with: * CSNK2A1, * CCND1, * GTF2F1, * RB1, * TAF7, * TBP, and * UBTF.

The Amiga came with some embedded utility programs, but many more were added over time, often by third-party developers and companies. Original utilities Commodore included utility programs with the operating system. Many of these were original features, which were adopted into other systems: *Installer is a tool for the installation of Amiga software. It features a LISP-like language to handle installations. The Amiga Installer does not support dependencies or track where the installed files are delivered; it simply copies them. *AmigaGuide is a hypertext markup scheme and a browser for writing and reading web page-like documents. AmigaGuide files are text files in a simple markup language, which facilitates editing and localization in any ASCII text editor. Commodore developed the AmigaGuide format before the World Wide Web was widely known. Consumers who bought Amiga computers in a store did not receive documentation on how to write AmigaGuide documents. Utilities borrowed from other systems *Update tools: **AmiUpdate was provided to keep installed third-party programs up to date. **Grunch is a software center for AmigaOS and MorphOS. **MorphUP allows MorphOS users to install and update new third-party software. None of these update systems was widely used by the Amiga community. Commodities and utilities Amiga places system utilities in two standard directories: * The Utilities directory contains programs like IconEdit. * The Commodities directory (volume SYS:Tools/Commodities/ or SYS:Utilities/Commodities under AmigaOS4) contains executable applet-like utilities which enhance system usability, like for example the ScreenBlanker, the default screen saver shipped with AmigaOS. Commodities are usually loaded at system startup. Many require no interaction and do not feature any GUI interface. * A system utility called Exchange allows the user to disable, enable, hide, show, and quit Commodities. Hard disk partitioning * AmigaOS features a standard centralized utility to partition and format hard disks, called HDToolBox. * MorphOS uses an updated version of the SCSIConfig utility (since MorphOS version 2, HDConfig) implemented by third party vendor Phase5. In spite of the name, \\"SCSIConfig\\" possessed a unique feature at the time, which was providing a consistent mechanism to manage all types of disk interfaces, including IDE, irrespective of which interface the disk(s) in question used. Diagnostic tools AmigaOS diagnostic tools are usually programs which display the current state of Exec and AmigaDOS activities. *Active process explorer: Scout, Ranger *System calls and messages: SnoopDOS, Snoopium *Memory management: CyberGuard, Enforcer, MemMungWall, TLSFMem by Chris Hodges *Virtual memory: GigaMem, VMM *Benchmark utilities AmiBench, AIBB *Degrading tools: Degrader (which \\"degrades\\" modern Amiga systems to performance and hardware equivalents of legacy Amiga models) Promoting tools Promoter and ForceMonitor are utilities that allow the user to control the resolution of Intuition screens for Amiga programs. Game loaders WHDLoad is a utility to install legacy Amiga games on a hard disk and load them from Workbench desktop instead of floppies, on which they were often delivered. jst is an older utility which the developer abandoned in order to concentrate efforts on WHDLoad. Old jstloaders can be read with WHDLoad, and jst itself has some early level of WHDLoad compatibility. Command line interfaces and text-based shells The original Amiga CLI (Command Line Interface) had some basic editing capabilities, command templates, and other features such as ANSI compatibility and color selection. In AmigaOS 1.3, the program evolved into a complete text-based shell called AmigaShell, with command history and enhanced editing capabilities. Third-party developers created improved shells because the console-handler standard command line device driver (or \\"handler\\" in Amiga technical language) is independent of the command-line interpreter. This program controlled text-based interfaces into Amiga. Console-handler replacements include KingCON, ViNCEd, and Conman. Some well-known shells from other platforms were ported to Amiga. These included bash (Bourne Again SHell), CSH (C Shell), and ZSH (Z shell). The shells taken from Unix and Linux were adapted into Amiga and improved with its peculiar capabilities and functions. The MorphOS Shell is an example of Z shell mixed with the KingCON console handler. It originated as a Unix-like shell and is provided with all the features expected from such a component: AmigaDOS commands (more than 100 commands, most of which are Unix-like), local and global variables, command substitution, command redirection, named and unnamed pipes, history, programmable menus, multiple shells in a window, ANSI compatibility, color selection, and so on. It also includes all the necessary commands for scripting. Amiga WIMP GUI interfaces Starting from the original Amiga WIMP standard desktop, Workbench, Amiga interfaces were enhanced by third-party developers. Amiga users are free to replace the original Workbench interface with Scalos and Directory Opus. The standard GUI toolkit, called Intuition, was enhanced in OS2.x with the introduction of GadTools; and third parties created their own toolkits such as Magic User Interface (MUI) (the standard on MorphOS systems) and ClassAct, which evolved into ReAction GUI (the standard GUI on AmigaOS 4.0). Amiga Advanced Graphics Systems Many users have added advanced graphics drivers to their Amiga. This lets the AmigaOS handle high resolution graphics, enhanced with millions of colors. Standard GUI interfaces with this capability are CyberGraphX, EGS, and Picasso96. Graphical engines Graphical libraries available on the Amiga include: * Warp3D, a 3D graphic engine for Amiga * TinyGL (MorphOS) and MiniGL (AmigaOS), implementations of subsets of the OpenGL graphics engine * X11, also available through the Amiga versions of Cygnix * Cairo Vector Library, available on AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS * SSA (Super Smooth Animation), a proprietary system for playback at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. proDAD Adorage was the first product to use this. * GTK. On Amiga it is being developed as a GTK_MUI wrapper, to map any existing graphical features of GTK to the standard Magic User Interface (MUI) graphic user interface system. All Amiga systems can also support the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) cross-platform, multimedia, and free software libraries written in C which creates an abstraction over various platforms' graphics, sound, and input APIs, allowing a developer to write a computer game or other multimedia application once and run it on many operating systems. PostScript Amiga supports PostScript through Ghostscript and SaxonScript (included with Saxon Publisher). Ghostview is the foremost used graphical GUI for GhostScript on the Amiga. Since AmigaOS 2.1, in the Prefs (Preferences) system directory, there is a printer preferences program called PrinterPS, which allows the use of PostScript printers on the Amiga. TrueType fonts, color and anim fonts Original Amiga outline fonts (also called vector fonts) were Agfa Compugraphic fonts available since AmigaOS 2.0 with the standard utility Fountain (later called IntelliFont) from Commodore. Third-party developers added support for TrueType fonts using various libraries, such as TrueType Library I and II, and LibFreeType library. The standard diskfont.library also supported bitmap multicolour fonts (ColorFonts), such as the commercial Kara Fonts, or even animated fonts also originally created by Kara Computer Graphics. Font designer software Commodore provided a bitmap font editor called FED. Personal Fonts Maker was the most widely used Amiga software to create bitmap fonts, while TypeSmith v.2.5b was the de facto standard utility to create outline fonts. File management Backup and recovery In the first Amiga OS releases, Commodore included a standard floppy disk recovery utility called DiskDoctor. Its purpose was to recover files from mangled floppy disks. Unfortunately, this utility worked only with AmigaDOS standard disks. A major fault was that it did not save the recovered data on different disks, rather it saved the info on the original and performed its operations directly on the original. It wrote on original disks and destroyed non-AmigaDOS disks (mainly autobooting games) by overwriting their bootblock. DiskDoctor renamed recovered disks to \\"Lazarus\\" (after the resurrected man in the New Testament). These features were undocumented and led to an Amiga urban legend that there was a computer virus nicknamed the Lazarus Virus,DiskDoctor in Amiga Glossary on AmigaHistory Site whose final purpose was to make disks unreadable and renaming it with that name. Third-party developers released data recovery programs such as DiskSalv, which was more often used to validate Amiga filesystems on hard disk partitions. Other Amiga disk repair and backup tools included: *Floppy only: Disk Mechanic, Disk Repair, Dr. Ami *Floppy and hard drive: Ami-Back Tools, Ami-Filesafe Pro, Quarterback Tools, Amiga Tools DeLuxe, Diavolo Backup *Smart File System (SFS): SFS Recover Tool, SFSDoctor, SFSCheck 2, SFSResize 1.0 Disk copiers During the 8 bit and 16/32 bit era, copying software was not considered illegal in many countries, and piracy was not perceived as being a crime by the users of home computers (usually young people). Commodore 64 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum software was copied using cassette decks, while IBM PC, Atari, and Amiga software was copied using special programs called disk copiers which were engineered to copy any floppy disk surface byte by byte, often using special, efficient, and advanced techniques of programming and \\"Disk Track driving\\" to maintain Floppy Disk read/write head alignment. In the early days of the Amiga platform, about 16 disk copiers were created in a short amount of time (1985-1989) that enabled copying Amiga floppy disks, including Nibbler, QuickNibble, ZCopier, XCopy/Cachet, FastCopier, Disk Avenger, Tetra Copy (which enabled the user to play Tetris while copying disks), Cyclone, Maverick, D-Copy, Safe II, PowerCopier, Quick Copier, Marauder II (styled as \\"Marauder //\\"), Rattle Copy, and BurstNibble. Many were legal in many countries until years later. These programs (for example, Marauder, X-Copy, and Nibbler) were then sold in packages complete with instructions, warranty, and EULA like other productivity software. Some floppy drives included LED track indicators to show if the disks were hacked by the original programmers to support up to track 82 of the disk. There were also copying solutions that included both hardware and software, like Super Card Ami II and Syncro Express I/II/III. DFC5 could only copy standard AmigaOS formatted disks for backup purposes; however, it multitasked inside of the Amiga Workbench GUI. X-COPY III, and later the final version, X-COPY Pro, were the most popular Amiga copy programs. They were capable of bit-by-bit copying, also called \\"nibbling\\". Although incapable of true multitasking, the programs were capable of taking advantage of Amiga configurations with multiple floppy drives; for instance, on Amiga systems with four floppy drives, X-COPY was capable of simultaneously copying from a source drive to three others. Coupled with excellent bit-by-bit replication capabilities, these features made X-COPY the de facto standard for copying floppy disks on the Amiga. Another popular copying program was D-COPY,D-COPY by a Swedish group \\"D-Mob\\", which, in spite of some innovative features and better/faster copying routines, failed to gain dominance. Archives and compression utilities The most popular archivers were LhA and LZX. Programs to archive ZIP, Gzip, Bzip2, and RAR files were available but seldom used, and many have an Amiga counterpart, such as 7-Zip. Utilities were available for reading and writing archive formats such as ARC, ARJ (unarchive only), the CAB files common in Windows installation, StuffIt SIT archives from Macintosh, Uuencode (used for encoding binary attachments of e-mail messages), TAR (common on UNIX and GNU/Linux), RPM (from Red Hat), and more. Amiga supported \\"packed\\" or \\"crunched\\" (meaning compressed) executables, which were common in the age of floppy disks, when disk space and memory conservation was critical. These executable binary files had a decompress routine attached to them that would automatically unpack or decrunch (decompress) the executable upon loading into memory. The Amiga also included \\"level depacking\\", implemented by \\"Titanics Cruncher\\", which enabled a binary executable to be decrunched as it was being loaded, requiring a very small amount of memory to do so. In general, packing and crunching was taken from the Commodore 64 cracking scene. Some crunchers, such as Time Cruncher, were \\"ported\\" from Commodore 64, displaying the same visual effects during decrunching. The CPU in the Amiga was completely different from the one in the Commodore 64, requiring a complete rewrite. Noteworthy were TurboImploder and PowerPacker, as they were easy to use, with graphical interfaces. Other popular crunchers were DefjamPacker, TetraPack, DoubleAction, Relokit, StoneCracker, Titanics and CrunchMania. The ability to compress and decompress single files and directories on the fly has been present on the AmigaOS since at least 1994. A similar feature was implemented relatively recently as a property in the ZFS filesystem. The AmigaOS packers and cruncher libraries are centralized by using the XPK system. The XPK system consists of a master library and several (de)packer sublibraries. Programs use only the master library directly, while sublibraries (akin to plug-ins) implement the actual (de)compression. When unpacking/decrunching, the applications do not need to know which library was used to pack or crunch the data. XPK is a wrapper for crunchers; to decrunch non-XPK packed formats requires XFD. Another important invention on the Amiga platform was the ADF format for creating images of Amiga floppy disks, either standard AmigaDOS floppies or non-DOS (\\"NDOS\\") ones, for use in Amiga emulators, such as WinUAE. Amiga emulators and AmigaOS (with third-party software) can use these files as if they were virtual floppy disks. Unlimited virtual floppies could be created on modern Amigas, although WinUAE on a real PC can handle only four at a time, the maximum number of floppy drives that the Amiga hardware could have connected at any one time. All the popular Amiga compression implementations and archive files are now centralized and implemented by a single system library called XAD, which has a front-end GUI named Voodoo-X. It is included in AmigaOS 3.9 and up with UnArc. This library is modular and can handle more than 80 compression formats. Filesystems Amiga can use various filesystems. The historical standards are the original Amiga filesystem, called the Old File System. This was good for floppy disks but wasted space on hard disks and is considered obsolete. The Fast File System (FFS) can handle file names up to 30 characters, has international settings (it can optionally recognise upper- and lower-case accented letters as equivalent) and could also be cached, if the users chose to format the partition with the cache option. The FFS filesystem evolved into FFS2. Modern journaling file systems for Amiga are the Smart File System (SFS) and Professional File System (PFS). The MultiUser File System (MuFS) supports multiple users. Using MuFS the owner of the system could grant various privileges on files by creating privileges for groups and users. It was first available with the Ariadne Ethernet card, and later standalone. The Professional File System suite has a utility to let PFS to be patched to support MuFS and MuFS features. The latest version is 1.8 and was released in 2001. CrossDOS is a utility to read MS-DOS formatted floppy disks in FAT12 and FAT16 filesystem, either 720 KiB double-density format or high-density (1440 KiB) (on connected floppy drives that can read 1440 MS-DOS disks). It is a commercial product, and a slightly cut-down version was included with AmigaOS beginning with version 2.1. The FAT95 library recognizes partitions of various filesystems common in other systems such as FAT16 and FAT32. It also reads DOS floppies and USB pen drives formatted with FAT16 or FAT32. Filesystems like ext2 for Linux, NTFS from Microsoft, and more are supported by third-party developers. MorphOS natively supports SFS, FFS/FFS2, PFS, MacOS HFS, HFS+, Linux Ext2, FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS filesystems. Data/file types The Datatype system of AmigaOS is a centralized, expandable, modular system describing any kind of file (text, music, image, videos). Each has a standard load/save module. Any experienced programmer, using the Amiga Datatype programming guidelines, could create new standard datatype modules. The module could be left visible to the whole Amiga system (thus to all Amiga programs) by copying the datatype into the system directory SYS:Classes/DataTypes/, and the descriptor (used to identify files) into DEVS:DataTypes/. This allows programs to load and save any files for which the corresponding datatypes exist. File descriptors did not need to be embedded in the executable code. An independent system of loaders was not needed for new productivity software. Amiga productivity software tools therefore have a smaller size and a more clean design than similar programs running in other operating systems. Supported Amiga datatypes include: MultiView MultiView is the Amiga universal viewer. It can load and display any file for which a corresponding datatype exists. MIME types Modern Amiga-like operating systems such as AmigaOS 4.0 and MorphOS can handle also MIME types. Any kind of file, due to its peculiar characteristics (thanks to filename extensions), or data embedded into the file itself (for example into file header) can be associated with a program that handle it, and this feature improves and completes the capabilities of Amiga to recognize and deal with any kind of file. Device support USB  The only known historical USB stack for the Amiga was created for the MacroSystem DraCo Amiga clone. It supported only USB 1.0 and ceased with the demise of that platform. Modern USB support drivers for Amiga are: * Poseidon USB stack available for AmigaOS 3, AROS, and MorphOS by Chris Hodges (open-source software). Poseidon has a modular approach to USB, and various hardware devices are supported by a certain number of HID devices. * Sirion USB stack of AmigaOS 4.0 * ANAIIS (Another Native Amiga IO Interface Stack) by Gilles Pelletier FireWire (IEEE 1394) The only known historical Amiga support for FireWire was built for the DraCo Amiga clone by Macrosystem. Only one FireWire interface exists for Amiga. It is named Fireworks, and it was created for the MorphOS system by programmer Pavel Fedin. It is still in an early stage of development and is freely downloadable. Printer drivers The print manager program TurboPrint, by German firm IrseeSoft, is the de facto standard for advanced printing on the Amiga. It is a modular program with many drivers which support many modern printers. PrintStudio Professional I and II are another well known printer driver system for the Amiga. PrintManager v39 by Stephan Rupprecht, available at the Aminet repository, is a print spooler for AmigaOS 3.x and 4.0. Video digitizers Video digitizing includes DigiView; the FrameMachine Zorro II expansion card for A2000, 3000, 4000; the Impact Vision IV24 from GVP; the VidiAmiga real time digitizer; and the Paloma module for the Picasso IV graphics card. Graphic Tablets In the 1980s, SummaGraphics tablets were common. Summagraphics directly supported Amiga with its drivers. In 1994, GTDriver (Graphic Tablet Driver) was the most common driver for serial port tablets, like Summagraphics MM, Summagraphics Bitpadone, CalComp 2000, Cherry, TekTronix 4967, and WACOM. It could also be used as a mouse driver. Graphics tablets now are mainly USB devices and are automatically recognized by Amiga USB stacks. The most widely used driver for graphic tablets is FormAldiHyd. FormAldiHyd can be used with Aiptek, Aldi, Tevion, and WACOM IV (Graphire, ArtPad, A3, A4, A5, and PenPartner) graphic tablets. The Poseidon USB driver, written by the same author as FormAldiHyd, Chris Hodges, directly supports USB graphics tablets, including ones more modern than FormAldiHyd. Scanner drivers Amiga programs often have scanner drivers embedded in their interface and are limited to some ancient scanner models. One example is Art Department Professional (ADPro). In recent times, scanner management is managed by the Amiga Poseidon USB stack. Poseidon detects scanners from their signature, and loads the corresponding HIDD scanner module. The graphical interface is managed by programs like ScanTrax and ScanQuix. Genlocks, chromakey, signal video inverters The Amiga has special circuitry to support a genlock signal and chromakey. Genlock software vendors included GVP (Great Valley Products) (an American hardware manufacturer) and Hama, Electronic Design, and Sirius genlocks from Germany. Infrared/remote controls The IRCom class is a driver that supports the IRCom standard and is available for the USB Poseidon Stack.IRCom Remote Pegasos computers have an internal IrDA port connector for connecting infrared devices, but MorphOS offers no support for it. The internal IrDA port can be used by installing Linux. WiFi and Bluetooth The Amiga can use WiFi external routers connected physically through Ethernet cable and talk with remote WiFi devices. Drivers are available for Prism2 internal PCI and PCMCIA WiFi expansion cards, but there are no drivers for Bluetooth standard devices like mobile phones, Bluetooth handsets, keyboards, or mice.

CalSTRS was established by law in 1913 and is part of the State of California's Government Operations Agency. As of February 2017, CalSTRS is the largest teachers' retirement fund in the United States. CalSTRS is also currently the eleventh largest public pension fund in the world. As of August 31, 2019, CalSTRS managed a portfolio worth $238.3 billion. Membership CalSTRS members, as of June 30, 2018, include employees of approximately 1,740 employers: * School districts * Community college districts * County offices of education * Regional occupational programs Teachers' Retirement Fund The Teachers' Retirement Fund is a special trust fund established by law that holds the assets of the following programs: * Defined Benefit * Defined Benefit Supplement * Cash Balance Benefit The assets come from contributions by members, employing school districts, investment earnings and appropriations from the State of California's General Fund. The fund's investments create a stream of income to add to those assets. The CalSTRS investment portfolio includes stocks, bonds, real estate and short-term investments. Finances As of August 31, 2019, CalSTRS managed a portfolio worth $238.3 billion at market value. As of June 30, 2012, CalSTRS' assets were $143.1 billion at market value ($152.5 billion actuarial value), giving CalSTRS an unfunded liability of $80.4 billion at market value ($71 billion actuarial value). Governance The Teachers' Retirement Board is responsible for maintaining the Teachers' Retirement Fund in order to pay benefits to CalSTRS members and their survivors. Teachers' Retirement Board The Teachers' Retirement Board sets policies, makes rules for and administers CalSTRS. The Board is also responsible for ensuring benefits are paid by the system in accordance with law. The 12-member Teachers' Retirement Board is made up of:California Education Code ¬ß 22200 * Three member-elected positions representing current educators * Five members appointed by the Governor of California and confirmed by the California Senate ** A retired CalSTRS member ** Three public representatives ** A school board representative * Four ex officio members: ** Director of Finance ** State Controller ** State Superintendent of Public Instruction ** State Treasurer Executive staff In February 2002, the Board appointed Jack Ehnes as Chief Executive Officer of CalSTRS to administer the system consistent with the Board's policies and rules. The Board also selected a Chief Investment Officer, (CIO) Christopher J. Ailman, to direct the investments of the Teachers' Retirement Fund in accordance with board policy. Advisory committees Two advisory committees meet regularly to provide forums for active participation in the formation of CalSTRS policies and procedures. The Employer Advisory Committee is composed of county and district employer representatives and CalSTRS staff and meets quarterly, and the Client Advisory Committee includes CalSTRS staff and members from various organizations representing CalSTRS members and benefit recipients and meets regularly coinciding with Board meeting dates. Operations The Board has supported a variety of corporate governance initiatives and actions aimed at keeping the fund stable. A few of the actions taken include: * Support of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that brings dramatic new standards to the corporate boardrooms and accounting profession. * Encouragement of the SEC's efforts to adopt tough regulations to rein in lax business practices * Discussions with individual corporate leaders to express CalSTRS interest in good corporate governance practices. * Litigation to pursue both financial remedies for the system as well as governance reforms On May 28, 2009, CalSTRS announced that individual proxy votes will be publicly available online through a partnership with ProxyDemocracy.org, a nonprofit organization that offers free online investment information about portfolio companies. Like other large pension plans, CalSTRS had previously announced its proxy-vote intentions on selective companies. The addition of online disclosure opens the process to all CalSTRS portfolio companies, allowing other shareholders to know how the pension fund will vote. As of May 2009, CalSTRS holds stock in over 3,800 North American companies. After the December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, California's treasurer, Bill Lockyer, considered ordering CalSTRS to eliminate investments in gun manufacturers. On January 9, 2013, the Teachers' Retirement Board Investment Committee directed staff to \\"begin the process of divestment from firearm companies that manufacture weapons that are illegal in California,\\" and CalSTRS divested from Sturm Ruger and the American Outdoor Brands Corporation, (formerly Smith & Wesson). In January 2018, CalSTRS issued a public letter to Apple Inc. alongside JANA Partners, LLC called \\"Think Differently About Kids\\". The letter encouraged Apple to find new ways to limit the effects of smartphone use on children. CalSTRS is among the signatories of the \\"Principles for a Responsible Civilian Firearms Industry,\\" which seeks to engage firearms manufacturers, dealers, and retailers in promoting gun safety. Headquarters CalSTRS headquarters in West Sacramento, California Opened in June 2009, the CalSTRS headquarters building in West Sacramento is expected to meet members' needs through 2049. Growth in membership, the difference and complexity of the needs of a new generation of retiring teachers, and the need to operate more efficiently and sustainably led to the decision to build a new headquarters. The building, a $266 million, 13-story office tower above two levels of public space, is part of the Sacramento Riverfront Master Plan. The headquarters was designed to meet the Gold certification LEED designation set by the U.S. Green Building Council. Its construction was done by numerous Local Unions and with the aid of Architectural Glass and Aluminum which served as the Glazing Contractor on the project.DC16 The Pride, \\"CalSTRS Goes for Gold By Building Green \\", DC16 The Pride, page 10, Feb 2009 It is expected that construction of the CalSTRS headquarters will add momentum to former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's push for \\"green\\" buildings and speed up a similar movement in private construction. A few of the features designed into the building to qualify for LEED Gold certification are: * Water: low-flow plumbing, efficient irrigation to water native plants that don't need a lot of water. * Materials: At least 10 percent of construction materials include recycled content. * Reduced construction greenhouse gas emissions: At least 20 percent of construction materials come from within of the project site. * Natural light: At least 90 percent of people in the building have a direct line of sight to a window to reduce lighting needs and attempt to increase productivity. In October 2011, the building received USGBC's Platinum certification in Existing Building and Operations Maintenance.

Cases Judge Cook, in the case of Cordelia Botkin, made the first decision for a crime committed in two different states, Delaware and California. The defendant received a life sentence, a ruling upheld by the United States Supreme Court. In a case known as the \\"Gas Pipe Thugs\\" Judge Cook sentenced a defendant who pleaded guilty to hanging without a jury trial, a sentence that the Appellate Court upheld. He also sentenced to death the medical student, Theodore Durrant, who was convicted in November 1895, for the murder of two young women nine days apart in a church. These became known as the \\"belfry murders\\". The defendant unsuccessfully appealed his sentence repeatedly during the three years before his eventual hanging in 1898. Carroll also presided over the 1908 trial of Jang In-hwan for the murder of former diplomat Durham Stevens.

The highway follows existing segments, from south to north, of State Road 37 (SR 37} from Tell City to Eckerty, SR 64 at Eckerty, SR 145 from Eckerty to French Lick, SR 56 from French Lick to Prospect, U.S. Route 150 (US 150, concurrent with SR 56) from Prospect to Paoli, and SR 37 once again from Paoli to Bedford. With the exception of the four-lane Mitchell-to-Bedford segment (SR 37), the majority of the highway is two lanes. Namesake and purpose The highway is named for former Indiana governor Frank O'Bannon, who died after suffering a stroke in 2003 with 16 months remaining in his second and final term. O'Bannon, a Corydon Democrat, who was first elected to the Indiana General Assembly as a State Senator in 1970, had long supported an improved highway linking to Interstate 64 (I-64). This position greatly endeared him to his constituents, who had long dealt with narrow, winding and somewhat dangerous two-lane highways connecting them to the rest of the state. The SR 37/145 Association, which is made up of community and government leaders from Perry, Crawford, Orange and Lawrence counties, considered O'Bannon a strong ally in getting better and faster access to I-64 for their communities. Following his death, the association lobbied the state of Indiana to name the highway in his memory. History Newest stretch of the road On November 21, 2007, the last unfinished segment of the highway opened between St. Croix and Eckerty. The new portion, a stretch of highway numbered as SR 37, was built as a \\"super-two\\" roadway, matching the existing stretch of SR 37 to which it connects at I-64, as well as that of SR 64 and SR 145 which continue the route from Eckerty to French Lick. Improvements to the various segments through the years From Bedford to Indianapolis, SR 37 had been upgraded to four lanes by the early 1980s. South of Bedford, the road remained two lanes. This changed when the state widened an additional of the highway from just south of Mitchell to the west junction with US 50 south of Bedford to four lanes. From Paoli to Mitchell, the road is still a two-lane facility, but it is in relatively good condition and congestion is seldom an issue. However, traffic in Paoli itself is forced to negotiate the town square, which generally resembles a roundabout. From Paoli to the south and west, the highways (SR 37, SR 56 and US 150) are narrow and winding. Orange County's tourist boom may necessitate more improvements Orange County, which has a storied history‚Äîillegal gambling flourished along with the mineral springs in the early years of the 20th century in West Baden and French Lick‚Äîis in the midst of a tourism rebirth. The new French Lick Resort Casino and the restoration of both the French Lick Springs Hotel and West Baden Springs Hotel have drawn many thousands of visitors. In addition, during the winter months, Ski Paoli Peaks, a popular snow-skiing park in Paoli, also draws thousands of tourists. With additional people on the roads, Orange County officials and the Indiana 37/145 Association (see below) are seeking to have the state make more improvements to the SR 56/US 150 leg of the highway. Future The Indiana 37/145 Association continues to lobby for improvements to SR 56 and US 150 from French Lick to Paoli. Aside from spot improvements at intersections and bridges, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) does not plan to make major changes to that segment. The first of the improvements are set for construction in 2009. The association continues to lobby for the original plan‚Äîmaking SR 56 and SR 150 into a \\"super-two\\"‚Äîas traffic generated by the new French Lick Resort Casino was not taken into consideration when the plan was scrapped by INDOT. A by-pass of Paoli, which has been tentatively numbered as SR 237, is one of the state's Major Moves projects scheduled to begin construction in 2012. This segment of SR 237 will likely become part of the Frank O'Bannon Highway.

History   1942‚Äì1945  The 56th Coast Artillery Brigade was constituted on the Inactive list, 14 September 1942. It was activated at Camp Stewart, Georgia on 10 April 1943 and was redesignated the 56th Antiaircraft Artillery Brigade on 28 May 1943. During World War II, Headquarters Battery (HHB) saw action in Belgium and received two Belgian Fourrageres for action at Antwerp and was cited for the defense of Antwerp Harbor. HHB is entitled to permanently display the Belgian Fourragere from the spearhead of its guidon. In 1945, the unit was inactivated at Camp Shanks, New York.  1951‚Äì1961  In 1951, the 56th Antiaircraft Artillery Brigade was reactivated at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts and assigned to the United States First Army. On 5 November 1951 The 56th AAA Brigade transferred from Camp Edwards to Fort Devens, Massachusetts and was assigned to the Eastern Army Antiaircraft Command. They were then transferred to Fort Totten, New York on 24 January 1953. The unit transferred back to Fort Devens on 15 July 1956. They were redesignated as the 56th Air Defense Artillery Brigade on 20 March 1958. The 56th Artillery Brigade was inactivated on 24 December 1964. Moved to Coventry, Rhode Island, Oct 1964. Initially the unit controlled the 11th Artillery Group (Rhode Island) and 15th Group (Massachusetts). Starting in June 1961, the battalions were directly under the brigade. The brigade was inactivated upon move of 24th Arty Group to Coventry in Dec 64. HHB, 11th AAA Group (Continental) was redesignated as HHB, 11th Artillery Group (Air Defense) on 20 March 1958. Transferred from Fort Jackson, SC, to Rehoboth, Massachusetts, 15 May 58. Controlled 4th Battalion, 56th Artillery and 4-68 Arty at Providence, RI. Inactivated at Rehoboth, 25 Sep 60. The 15th AAA Group (Continental) was activated at Ft. Banks, 13 Jul 52. Redesignated as the 15th Artillery Group (Air Defense), 20 Mar 58. Moved to Quincy, Massachusetts, 7 Aug 58. Controlled Boston [3-5 Arty, 3-52 Arty, 1-57 Arty] air defense units under 56th Brigade. Inactivated at Quincy, 24 June 1961.  1963‚Äì1991  = 56th Artillery = In April 1963, the 56th Artillery Group was activated in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, West Germany commanded by Col. Douglas C. France, Jr. The group prepared for the deployment of the new weapons system, the Pershing 1 nuclear missile. Headquarters & Headquarters Battery (HHB) was initially stationed at Hardt Kaserne (formerly Adolf Hitler Kaserne) and moved to Bismarck Kaserne in November 1968. The 56th Artillery Group was redesignated as the 56th Artillery Brigade on 17 August 1970. The brigade was authorized an increased level in command positions in the firing units. Platoon leaders were captains, battery commanders were majors, battalion commanders were lieutenant colonels and the brigade commander was a colonel. With the split of the Artillery Branch into Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery, the brigade was redesignated as the 56th Field Artillery Brigade on 15 March 1972. In 1965 the 56th Artillery Group assumed the critical role of a Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) force and was required to maintain a portion of each unit at the highest level of combat readiness. These portions were to react within seconds of verified orders, and the entire command was to be fully operational within 2 hours of any alert activation. The increased requirements of the QRA mission necessitated some modifications to upgrade the Pershing missile system and at the same time caused the Army to increase the number of launchers at each battalion from four to 36. The newly designated brigade was to command 1st Battalion, 41st Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Battalion, 81st Field Artillery Regiment and 3rd Battalion, 84th Field Artillery Regiment as Pershing firing battalions. Also subordinate to the brigade was 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment, tasked to provide defensive support to the firing units according to their security needs. A host of additional units provided support from medical to logistical, ensuring the brigade's ability to operate. In November 1983, with the Soviets fully invested in the SS-20, and on the verge of bankruptcy, the Americans began fielding the Pershing II. By 1985 all three firing battalions were completely operational with Pershing II and the Soviet Union faced a threat they were financially unwilling to counter. Memorial stone to the victims of the missile accident on 11 January 1985 On 11 January 1985 three soldiers, SSG John Leach, SGT Todd A. Zephier, and PFC Darryl L. Shirley of Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 84th Field Artillery were killed in an explosion at Camp Redleg, Heilbronn. The explosion occurred while removing a missile stage from the storage container during an assembly operation. An investigation revealed that the Kevlar rocket bottle had accumulated a triboelectric charge in the cold dry weather; as the engine was removed from the container the electrical charge began to flow and created a hot spot that ignited the propellant. A moratorium on missile movement was enacted through late 1986 when new grounding and handling procedures were put into place. In January 1986, there was a major reorganization; the 56th Field Artillery Brigade was redesignated the 56th Field Artillery Command and authorized a major general as its commander. 1st Battalion, 81st Field Artillery inactivated and reformed as 1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery in Neu-Ulm. 1st Battalion, 41st Field Artillery inactivated and reformed as 2nd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery in Schw√§bisch-Gm√ºnd. 3rd Battalion, 84th Field Artillery inactivated and reformed as 4th Battalion, 9th Field Artillery in Heilbronn. Along with 3rd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery at Fort Sill, the four firing units were then under the 9th Field Artillery Regiment. Additionally, the 55th Maintenance Battalion redesignated as 55th Support Battalion, E Company, 55th Maintenance Battalion deactivated and reformed as the 193rd Aviation Company, and the communications assets at each battery, were removed and consolidated into the 38th Signal Battalion. Under the reorganization, the 56th Field Artillery Command would always report directly to the highest commander in Europe at the time. Therefore, during peacetime, they reported to the Commander in Chief of United States Army Europe (CINCUSAREUR), whereas, during heightened tension or war, command passed to NATO, with Allied Air Forces Central Europe as their next higher headquarters. Additionally, command levels for the field artillery batteries were increased by one grade over similar units. Platoons were commanded by a captain, and batteries by a major. Battalions continued to follow a lieutenant colonel while the command itself was led by a brigadier general and later a major general. These actions were meant to mitigate the increased responsibilities inherent with the mission they bore. Graffiti covered bunker photographed in 2013 at the former missile storage area (MSA) in Mutlangen near Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was ratified on 27 May 1988. The firing batteries began to draw down their equipment as the missile launchers were destroyed. The Pershing first- and second-stage motors, reentry vehicles, warhead and radar section airframes were returned to Pueblo Depot Activity for elimination. On 30 June 1991, the 56th FA was inactivated, and the final entry for this command's history shows them as \\"discontinued\\" on 30 September 1991. Commanders Major General Raymond E.

A total of 37 units were built, all by the German factory Henschel for the Danish State Railways (DSB). They were among the first AC drive locomotives in serial production. As of 2017, 33 units are still in service., DSB Litra ME  History  The locomotives were designed to haul the more heavy regional services in Sj√¶lland, Denmark, in the early 1980s, replacing much of the old rolling stock in use at the time. The first unit, 1501 arrived in 1981 after many years of delay. Three years later, in 1983, DSB had received a total of 30 units. Although there had been some serious trouble with the locomotives, DSB found a solution on the problems, and an additional seven units were delivered in 1985. As of 2017, 33 units are still in service, three have been scrapped and one is preserved at the Danish Railway Museum. The ME locomotives was expected to be replaced by IC3 train sets when the IC4 train sets were ready to take over Intercity services. The IC4 train set are very unstable in service and have a variety of problems, however, so they are not going to replace the IC3 train sets in Intercity services. As a result of this DSB have ordered 26 new electric locomotives that are going to replace the ME locomotives by 2020. The units were originally painted in DSB's black/red livery, but in 2006 they were all painted dark blue with red details on the side. In October 2016, DSB began painting the locomotives red to match their new logo. The exhaust stack is below the air intake of the Bombardier double-decker coaches used in regional services. The air in the coaches was found to have a high concentration of diesel particulate matter, which induces cancer. DSB changed the air filters in 2013, providing a DPM reduction of 40%. But the concentration could still induce cancer for train staff, because they spend a long time in the coaches.https://ing.dk/artikel/dsbs-gamle- lokomotiver-sender-kraeftfremkaldende-partikler-ind-til-passagererne-173603 doubledecker coaches out of Valby station.

The 361st FG entered combat with P-47 aircraft on 21 January 1944 and converted to P-51's in May 1944. The unit served primarily as an escort organization, covering the penetration, attack, and withdrawal of B-17/B-24 bomber formations that the USAAF sent against targets on the Continent. The group also engaged in counter-air patrols, fighter sweeps, and strafing and dive- bombing missions.

During its operations, the unit participated in the assault against the German Air Force and aircraft industry during the Big Week, 20‚Äì25 February 1944, and the attack on transportation facilities prior to the Normandy invasion and support of the invasion forces thereafter, including the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July. The weight of the heavy P-47 fighters soon began to tell on the wet surface making take-offs tricky. A team of American engineers were called in during January 1944 and, in three days, they constructed a 1,470-yard-long runway with pierced-steel planking.

The group supported the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September 1944 and deployed to Chievres Airdrome, (ALG A-84), Belgium between February and April 1945 flying tactical ground support missions during the airborne assault across the Rhine. The unit returned to RAF Little Walden and flew its last combat mission on 20 April 1945. On 10 November the 361st Fighter Group returned to Camp Kilmer New Jersey and was inactivated. =Cold War= During the Cold War the unit was redesignated as the 127th Fighter Group, and allocated to the Michigan Air National Guard on 24 May 1946. The group was ordered into active service on 1 February 1951 as a result of the Korean War and assigned to Air Training Command. In March 1951 it was redesignated as the 127th Pilot Training Group, being assigned F-51 Mustangs, F-80 Shooting Stars and F-84 Thunderjets while serving as a training organization. The 127th was relieved from active duty in November 1952 and redesignated the 127th Fighter Group. References Notes Bibliography * Cora, Paul B. Yellowjackets!

Description First, a (potentially complicated) Hamiltonian is found whose ground state describes the solution to the problem of interest. Next, a system with a simple Hamiltonian is prepared and initialized to the ground state. Finally, the simple Hamiltonian is adiabatically evolved to the desired complicated Hamiltonian. By the adiabatic theorem, the system remains in the ground state, so at the end the state of the system describes the solution to the problem. Adiabatic quantum computing has been shown to be polynomially equivalent to conventional quantum computing in the circuit model. The time complexity for an adiabatic algorithm is the time taken to complete the adiabatic evolution which is dependent on the gap in the energy eigenvalues (spectral gap) of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, if the system is to be kept in the ground state, the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of H(t) provides an upper bound on the rate at which the Hamiltonian can be evolved at time When the spectral gap is small, the Hamiltonian has to be evolved slowly. The runtime for the entire algorithm can be bounded by: T = O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{g_{min}^2}\\\\right) where g_{min} is the minimum spectral gap for AQC is a possible method to get around the problem of energy relaxation. Since the quantum system is in the ground state, interference with the outside world cannot make it move to a lower state. If the energy of the outside world (that is, the \\"temperature of the bath\\") is kept lower than the energy gap between the ground state and the next higher energy state, the system has a proportionally lower probability of going to a higher energy state. Thus the system can stay in a single system eigenstate as long as needed. Universality results in the adiabatic model are tied to quantum complexity and QMA-hard problems. The k-local Hamiltonian is QMA-complete for k ‚â• 2. QMA-hardness results are known for physically realistic lattice models of qubits such as H = \\\\sum_{i}h_i Z_i + \\\\sum_{i where Z, Xrepresent the Pauli matrices Such models are used for universal adiabatic quantum computation. The Hamiltonians for the QMA-complete problem can also be restricted to act on a two dimensional grid of qubits or a line of quantum particles with 12 states per particle. If such models were found to be physically realisable, they too could be used to form the building blocks of a universal adiabatic quantum computer. In practice, there are problems during a computation. As the Hamiltonian is gradually changed, the interesting parts (quantum behaviour as opposed to classical) occur when multiple qubits are close to a tipping point. It is exactly at this point when the ground state (one set of qubit orientations) gets very close to a first energy state (a different arrangement of orientations). Adding a slight amount of energy (from the external bath, or as a result of slowly changing the Hamiltonian) could take the system out of the ground state, and ruin the calculation. Trying to perform the calculation more quickly increases the external energy; scaling the number of qubits makes the energy gap at the tipping points smaller. Adiabatic quantum computation in satisfiability problems Adiabatic quantum computation solves satisfiability problems and other combinatorial search problems by the process below. Generally this kind of problem is to seek for a state that satisfies C_1 \\\\wedge C_2 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge C_M . This expression contains the satisfiability of M clauses, each clause C_i has the value True or False, and can involve n bits. Each bit here is a variable x_j\\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 0,1\\\\\\\\} so C_i is a Boolean value function of x_1, x_2, \\\\dots , x_n. QAA solves this kind of problem using quantum adiabatic evolution. It starts with an Initial Hamiltonian H_B: H_B=H_{B_1}+H_{B_2}+\\\\dots+H_{B_M} where H_{B_i} shows the Hamiltonian corresponding to the clause C_i, usually the choice of H_{B_i} won't depend on different clauses, so only the total number of times each bit involved in all clauses matters. Then it goes through an adiabatic evolution, ending in the Problem Hamiltonian H_P: H_P=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{C}^{} H_{P,C} where H_{P,C} is the satisfying Hamiltonian of clause C. It has eigenvalues: h_C(z_{1C},z_{2C}\\\\dots z_{nC})= \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\mbox{clause } C \\\\mbox{ satisfied} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\mbox{clause } C \\\\mbox{ violated} \\\\end{cases} For a simple path of Adiabatic Evolution with running time T, consider: H(t)=(1-t/T)H_{B}+(t/T)H_{P} and let s=t/T, we have: \\\\tilde{H}(s)=(1-s)H_{B}+sH_{P} , which is the adiabatic evolution Hamiltonian of our algorithm. According to the adiabatic theorem, we start from the ground state of Hamiltonian H_B at beginning, go through an adiabatic process, and at last ending in the ground state of problem Hamiltonian H_P. Then we measure the z-component of each of the n spins in the final state, this will produce a string z_1,z_2,\\\\dots,z_n which is highly likely to be the result of our satisfiability problem. Here the running time T must be sufficiently long to assure the correctness of result, and according to adiabatic theorem, T is about \\\\varepsilon/g_\\\\mathrm{min}^{2}, where g_\\\\mathrm{min}=\\\\min_{0\\\\le s\\\\le 1}(E_1(s)-E_0(s)) is the minimum energy gap between ground state and first excited state. Comparison to gate-based quantum computing Adiabatic quantum computing is equivalent in power to standard gate-based quantum computing that implements arbitrary unitary operations. However, the mapping challenge on gate-based quantum devices differs substantially from quantum annealers as logical variables are mapped only to single qubits and not to chains. D-Wave quantum processors The D-Wave One is a device made by a Canadian company D-Wave Systems which describes it as doing quantum annealing. In 2011, Lockheed-Martin purchased one for about US$10 million; in May 2013, Google purchased a D-Wave Two with 512 qubits. As of now, the question of whether the D-Wave processors offer a speedup over a classical processor is still unanswered. Tests performed by researchers at Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab (NASA), USC, ETH Zurich, and Google show that as of now, there is no evidence of a quantum advantage.

Artificial production of doubled haploids is important in plant breeding. Haploid cells are produced from pollen or egg cells or from other cells of the gametophyte, then by induced or spontaneous chromosome doubling, a doubled haploid cell is produced, which can be grown into a doubled haploid plant. If the original plant was diploid, the haploid cells are monoploid, and the term doubled monoploid may be used for the doubled haploids. Haploid organisms derived from tetraploids or hexaploids are sometimes called dihaploids (and the doubled dihaploids are, respectively, tetraploid or hexaploid). Conventional inbreeding procedures take six generations to achieve approximately complete homozygosity, whereas doubled haploidy achieves it in one generation.Jain, S. Mohan, S. K. Sopory, and R. E. Veilleux. 1996. In vitro haploid production in higher plants. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers. p.317. Dihaploid plants derived from tetraploid crop plants may be important for breeding programs that involve diploid wild relatives of the crops. History The first report of the haploid plant was published by Blakeslee et al. (1922) in Datura stramonium. Subsequently, haploids were reported in many other species. Guha and Maheshwari (1964) developed an anther culture technique for the production of haploids in the laboratory. Haploid production by wide crossing was reported in barley (Kasha and Kao, 1970) and tobacco (Burk et al., 1979). Tobacco, rapeseed, and barley are the most responsive species for doubled haploid production. Doubled haploid methodologies have now been applied to over 250 species.Maluszynski et al., 2003. Production of Doubled Haploids Doubled haploids can be produced in vivo or in vitro. Haploid embryos are produced in vivo by parthenogenesis, pseudogamy, or chromosome elimination after wide crossing. The haploid embryo is rescued, cultured, and chromosome-doubling produces doubled haploids. The in vitro methods include gynogenesis (ovary and flower culture) and androgenesis (anther and microspore culture). Androgenesis is the preferred method. Another method of producing the haploids is wide crossing. In barley, haploids can be produced by wide crossing with the related species Hordeum bulbosum; fertilization is affected, but during the early stages of seed development the H. bulbosum chromosomes are eliminated leaving a haploid embryo. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), wide crossing with Nicotiana africana is widely used. When N. africana is used to pollinate N. tabacum, 0.25 to 1.42 percent of the progeny survive and can readily be identified as either F1 hybrids or maternal haploids. Although these percentages appear small, the vast yield of tiny seeds and the early death of most seedlings provide significant numbers of viable hybrids and haploids in relatively small soil containers. This method of interspecific pollination serves as a practical way of producing seed-derived haploids of N. tabacum, either as an alternative method or complementary method to anther culture. Genetics of DH population In DH method only two types of genotypes occur for a pair of alleles, A and a, with the frequency of ¬Ω AA and ¬Ω aa, while in diploid method three genotypes occur with the frequency of ¬º AA, ¬Ω Aa, ¬º aa. Thus, if AA is desirable genotype, the probability of obtaining this genotype is higher in haploid method than in diploid method. If n loci are segregating, the probability of getting the desirable genotype is (1/2)n by the haploid method and (1/4)n by the diploid method. Hence the efficiency of the haploid method is high when the number of genes concerned is large. Studies were conducted comparing DH method and other conventional breeding methods and it was concluded that adoption of doubled haploidy does not lead to any bias of genotypes in populations, and random DHs were even found to be compatible to selected line produced by conventional pedigree method.Winzeler et al., 1987. Applications of DHs plant breeding Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci Most of the economic traits are controlled by genes with small but cumulative effects. Although the potential of DH populations in quantitative genetics has been understood for some time, it was the advent of molecular marker maps that provided the impetus for their use in identifying loci controlling quantitative traits. As the quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects are small and highly influenced by environmental factors, accurate phenotyping with replicated trials is needed. This is possible with doubled haploidy organisms because of their true breeding nature and because they can conveniently be produced in large numbers. Using DH populations, 130 quantitative traits have been mapped in nine crop species.Forster and Thomas, 2003 In total, 56 DH populations were used for QTL detection. Backcross breeding In backcross conversion, genes are introgressed from a donor cultivar or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated backcrossing. A problem in this procedure is being able to identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each backcross. The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted backcross conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and molecular marker provides the short cut. In the backcross generation one itself, a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous doubled-haploid genotype.Thomas et al., 2003. Chen et al. (1994) used marker assisted backcross conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe rust resistant lines in barley. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) In bulked segregant analysis, a population is screened for a trait of interest and the genotypes at the two extreme ends form two bulks. Then the two bulks are tested for the presence or absence of molecular markers. Since the bulks are supposed to contrast in the alleles that contribute positive and negative effects, any marker polymorphism between the two bulks indicates the linkage between the marker and trait of interest. BSA is dependent on accurate phenotyping and the DH population has particular advantage in that they are true breeding and can be tested repeatedly. DH populations are commonly used in bulked segregant analysis, which is a popular method in marker assisted breeding.Ardiel et al., 2002; William et al., 2002; Yi et al., 1998. This method has been applied mostly to rapeseed and barley. Genetic maps Genetic maps are very important to understand the structure and organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also provide a framework for the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic mapping for species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations played a major role in facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species. Genetic studies Genetic ratios and mutation rates can be read directly from haploid populations. A small doubled haploid (DH) population was used to demonstrate that a dwarfing gene in barley is located chromosome 5H.Thomas et al., 1984. In another study the segregation of a range of markers has been analyzed in barley.Schon et al., 1990. Genomics Although QTL analysis has generated a vast amount of information on gene locations and the magnitude of effects on many traits, the identification of the genes involved has remained elusive. This is due to poor resolution of QTL analysis. The solution for this problem would be production of recombinant chromosome substitution line,RCSLs, Paterson et al., 1990. or stepped aligned recombinant inbred lines.STAIRS, Kearsey 2002. Here, backcrossing is carried out until a desired level of recombination has occurred and genetic markers are used to detect desired recombinant chromosome substitution lines in the target region, which can be fixed by doubled haploidy.Thomas et al., 2000. In rice, molecular markers have been found to be linked with major genes and QTLs for resistance to rice blast, bacterial blight, and sheath blight in a map produced from DH population.Wang et al., 2001. Elite crossing Traditional breeding methods are slow and take 10‚Äì15 years for cultivar development. Another disadvantage is inefficiency of selection in early generations because of heterozygosity. These two disadvantages can be over come by DHs, and more elite crosses can be evaluated and selected within less time. Cultivar development Uniformity is a general requirement of cultivated line in most species, which can be easily obtained through DH production.International Symposium on Genetic Manipulation in Crops. 1988. Genetic manipulation in crops proceedings of the International Symposium on Genetic Manipulation in Crops, the 3rd International Symposium on Haploidy, the 1st International Symposium on Somatic Cell Genetics in Crops, Beijing, October 1984. Natural resources and the environment series, v. 22. (London: Published for the International Rice Research Institute and Academia Sinica by Cassell Tycooly), p.318. There are various ways in which DHs can be used in cultivar production. The DH lines themselves can be released as cultivars, they may be used as parents in hybrid cultivar production or more indirectly in the creation of breeders lines and in germplasm conservation. Barley has over 100 direct DH cultivars. According to published information there are currently around 300 DH derived cultivars in 12 species worldwide. The relevance of DHs to plant breeding has increased markedly in recent years owing to the development of protocols for 25 species. Doubled haploidy already plays an important role in hybrid cultivar production of vegetables, and the potential for ornamental production is being vigorously examined. DHs are also being developed in the medicinal herb Valeriana officinalis to select lines with high pharmacological activity. Another interesting development is that fertile homozygous DH lines can be produced in species that have self- incompatibility systems.Immonen and Anttila, 1996. Advantages of DHs The ability to produce homozygous lines after a single round recombination saves a lot of time for the plant breeders. Studies conclude that random DH‚Äôs are comparable to the selected lines in pedigree inbreeding.Friedt et al., 1986; Winzeler et al., 1987. The other advantages include development of large number of homozygous lines, efficient genetic analysis and development of markers for useful traits in much less time. More specific benefits include the possibility of seed propagation as an alternative to vegetative multiplication in ornamentals, and in species such as trees in which long life cycles and inbreeding depression preclude traditional breeding methods, doubled haploidy provides new alternatives. Disadvantages of DHs The main disadvantage with the DH population is that selection cannot be imposed on the population. But in conventional breeding selection can be practised for several generations: thereby desirable characters can be improved in the population. In haploids produced from anther culture, it is observed that some plants are aneuploids and some are mixed haploid-diploid types. Another disadvantage associated with the double haploidy is the cost involved in establishing tissue culture and growth facilities. The over-usage of doubled haploidy may reduce genetic variation in breeding germplasm. Hence one has to take several factors into consideration before deploying doubled haploidy in breeding programmes. Conclusions Technological advances have now provided DH protocols for most plant genera. The number of species amenable to doubled haploidy has reached a staggering 250 in just a few decades. Response efficiency has also improved with gradual removal of species from recalcitrant category. Hence it will provide greater efficiency of plant breeding.

It is the 169th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are three paperhangers who also look after invalid Mary, who uses a wheelchair. While working, they are taken by one poster that advertises a great hypnotist, Svengarlic (\\"He'll steal your breath away!\\" the poster announces). The Stooges want the hypnotist to work his magic on Mary so that she can walk again, but Svengarlic is more interested in winning an audience to create a diversion by hypnotizing the Stooges. While the audience watches the Stooges dance on an overhead flagpole, Svengarlic's henchmen are in the process of robbing a bank. But a distracted bicyclist knocks Svengarlic over and the Stooges are abruptly awakened. They immediately panic when they see where they are, then the flagpole breaks, sending them flying through the open window of the bank being robbed, thwarting the theft.

The building once housed the Tennessee Brewing Company, a leader in early brewery production. History The brewery was originally organized in 1877 by G.H. Herbers as \\"The Memphis Brewing Company\\". In 1885, it was bought by J. W. Schorr, Casper Koehler, and associates, and soon became one of the largest breweries of the era. The first beer marketed from the brewery was a Pilsener. Like many other brands of the time, the beers were not usually named. Instead, the type or style of the beer was used as the name, along with the name of the brewery. They also produced several other beer styles. An ad from 1890 lists their styles as Pilsener, Export, Budweiser, Tennessee Pale, and Bavarian. Later, two new brands called Columbian Extra Pale and Erlanger were also produced, before prohibition shut down operations. At one point, more than 1500 workers worked at the brewery. By 1903, production was up to 250,000 barrels per year making it the largest brewery in the south. Prohibition shut down operations, however after prohibition ended, the plant was reopened by J. W.'s son, John Schorr. Very rapidly, they got back up to production speed, and the best known and leading beer sold in Memphis for many years was \\"Goldcrest\\". After 1938 the beer was named \\"Goldcrest 51\\", to honor more than 51 years in the brewing business. Goldcrest 51 was a bottled beer until 1947, when they started using cans. As a somewhat local beer, the brewery actually used returned bottles up until they ceased all operations, in 1954. The building that remains today was erected in 1890 and is basically unchanged from that time (other than renovations performed to keep the building intact for possible further development in the future). The bottling plant was an add-on to the building much later, in 1938. Plans have been made in the past to turn the building into condominiums or shopping space, however none of these have occurred.

The property was appraised in 2005 at $248600. Brewery Tennessee LLC transferred the property for $350000 to The Tennessee Brewery LLC in 1999. It was transferred to Brewery Tennessee LLC in 1995 from Marvin Ratner. After the Tennessee Brewery \\"Untapped\\" event held there during the spring of 2014, the revived interest in the brewery led it to be purchased for $825000 by Billy Orgel, a cell phone tower developer based in Memphis. The event was held again, as a \\"Revival\\" in the spring of 2015, before development work began on the building that fall. The current owner of record is \\"495 Tennessee LLC\\". Modification work has been done to turn the building into apartments, and units are available for reservations on an as available basis.

Bourne's next teaching job was at Helvetia, a mining camp in the Santa Rita Mountains south of Tucson. None of her students spoke English, nor did Bourne speak Spanish. At that time, Arizona had a law forbidding the use of Spanish in school. \\"It was the silliest rule I ever heard of in my life,\\" she said. She sent away for Spanish grammar books, and set aside the last five minutes of each day for the students to teach her Spanish. Bourne entered the University of Arizona in Tucson in 1920, but it took her ten years to graduate, working her way through school, majoring in English and Spanish. After graduating summa cum laude, she took a job in the isolated ranching community of Redington. There she created The Little Cowpuncher, a mimeographed newspaper, written and illustrated by her students. It was begun, as Bourne later explained, as an effort ‚Äúto hold the mirror up to life as we live it here.‚Äù The little paper (and the mimeograph machine) moved with her from school to school for the next 11 years: from Redington to Baboqu√≠vari then to Sierrita, Sasco, Sasabe, S√≥pori and back to Sasabe. With its lively, detailed descriptions of ranch and school life, it is now seen as a unique historical document of Southern Arizona ranching communities from 1932 to 1943. A complete set is available online here. \\"Sister Bourne was a complicated personality. She subscribed to The New Yorker magazine and was a member of the Arizona Cattlemen‚Äôs Association. She was a rancher who hated rodeos because she saw them as animal cruelty. She wouldn‚Äôt divulge her age or details of her private life, but freely offered her (often unpopular) opinions on the social and political questions of the day. She wore red lipstick and faded Levi‚Äôs. She was ahead of her time with her views on bilingualism in the classroom. She had many supporters, but some considered her a pain in the neck. From all reports, her students loved her and probably her cows did too.

It is suffragan to the archdiocese of Benevento.\\"Diocese of Avellino\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved December 4, 2015.\\"Diocese of Avellino\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016. The bishop of Avellino, along with the bishop of S. Agata de' Goti, had the privilege, recognized at the provincial synod of 1654, of being summoned to attend upon the death and obsequies of the archbishop of Benevento. Bishop Lorenzo Pollicini (1653‚Äì1656) attended the provincial synod in Benevento in 1654, and also held a diocesan synod in May 1654. History of the diocese Avellino was traditionally said to have been founded by St. Sabinus, a disciple of Saint Peter the Apostle, at the beginning of the 2nd century. The list of bishops, however, begins in the 12th century. On 5 December 1456, Campania and the former duchy of Benevento were hit with a major earthquake, with over 40,000 dead. It may have been the largest on record for all of southern Italy. It was followed by another on 30 December. Benevento was for the most part destroyed, suffering between 350 and 500 dead. Brindisi, with nearly all of its inhabitants, was destroyed. Apice, in the diocese of Benevento, was completely destroyed, as was Casalduni. 2.000 died at Ariano in the territory of Avellino, and the town was in ruins; Lacedonia was reduced to dust and abandoned completely. Sant' Agata dei Goti was assai conquassata ('practically crushed;). Bella Bona, p. 224. The extensive damage and death may account, at least in part, for the diocesan reorganization of the metropolitanate of Benevento. The Diocese of Frigento, whose list of bishops extends from 1080 to 1455, was united with that of Avellino from 9 May 1466, until 27 June 1818, when it was suppressed. During that time, however, on two occasions, the dioceses were again separated, in both cases to benefit an uncle-nephew pair, one of whom became bishop of Avellino and the other bishop of Frigento, on the understanding that, on the death of either one, the survivor would reunite the two dioceses. In the summer of 1561 the area of Avellino was struck by a series of natural disasters. Trouble began with a major earthquake, centered on the Vallo di Diano in the Basilicata, on 24 July. On the last day of July Avellino was the victim of an extraordinary windstorm with clouds of dust so thick that the sky was obscured, which was followed by a rain of pebbles and lightning flashes, the result of an aftershock of the quake of the 24th. Damages to buildings was severe, and the people abandoned their houses and lived in the open, outside the city. On 2 August at midday a third earthquake hit, less violent than the two preceding ones. The worst of all, whose epicenter was apparently near Avellino, occurred on the afternoon of 19 August. It was felt at Naples, and at Palo near Sale 20 people died; at Sicicgnano 40 died, at Vietro another 20, 40 at Pola, and at Caggiano 30. At Avellino nearly all the houses suffered from serious cracks, especially at the Torri del Castro and the Episcopal Palace.Bella-Bona, p. 233. Baratta, pp. 100-102. In May 1698, when Bishop Scannagatta attended the provincial synod of Benevento, he signed his name Franciscus Episcopus Abellinensis, Frequintinensis, Aquae-putridae seu Mirabellae, et Quintodecimi,Zigarelli, II, p. 56. giving clear evidence of the incorporation of two other ancient dioceses besides Frigento into the diocese of Avellino. Avellino and Frigento were both vacant from 1782 to 1792, due to disputes between the Papacy and the Kingdom of Naples;Cappelletti, XIX, p. 186. and each diocese had its own Vicar General.Zigarelli, II, pp. 184-186. The territory was captured by French forces in 1799, and Napoleon had his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, named Prince of Benevento. From 1801 to 1815, Pope Pius VII was prisoner of Napoleon in France, and was unable and unwilling to cooperate with Napoleon's brother-in- law, Joachim Murat who had been named King of Naples (1808‚Äì1815). In 1815 the Congress of Vienna restored King Ferdinand I of Naples and Sicily (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies), and Pius VII ceded him the papal rights to Benevento (which included Avellino). A concordat (treaty) was signed on 16 February 1818, and in a separate document, dated 7 March 1818, Pius VII granted Ferdinand the right to nominate all bishops in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.Bullarii romani continuatio VII. 2, pp. 1726-1727. In 1861, after the revolution in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in favor of Italian unity under the House of Savoy, Bishop Francesco Gallo of Avellino, who was staying in Naples in the house of the Fathers of the Mission, was arrested and deported to Turin, where he was kept in prison for more than two years. His exile from Avellino lasted until 1866. Cathedral and Chapter In the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, all of the cathedrals, including those of Avellino and of Frigento, were dedicated to the Bodily Assumption of the Virgin Mary into Heaven. The Cathedral of Avellino was begun in the episcopate of Bishop Robert (early 12th century), and carried out during the reigns of King William I of Sicily and William II of Sicily. It was dedicated by Bishop Guillelmus in 1166. It replaced the church which had been built by King Roger II of Sicily and Rainulf Count of Avellino.Zigarelli (1848), p. 39, column 2. Zigarelli (1856), I, pp. 90-91. In 1673 the Chapter of the Cathedral of the Assumption was composed of four dignities and twelve Canons. In the Cathedral of Frigento there were three dignities and seven Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 108 note 1. By 1745 the number of Canons at Avellino had increased to twenty.Ritzler- Sefrin, VI, p. 110 note 1. In 1900 the Chapter was composed of four dignities (the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Primicerius Major, and the Primicerius Minor) and twenty-three Canons (one of whom served as Penitentiary and another as Theologian). The Archdeacon is attested as early as 1250: Zigarelli (1848), p. 38 column 2. Bishops Diocese of Avellino Latin Name: Avellinensis seu Abellinensis Metropolitan: Archdiocese of Benevento :[Sabinus]Sabinus is claimed to have been a disciple of Saint Peter the Apostle (mid 1st century). Lanzoni, p. 241, points out that the two inscriptions referring to him are of the 5th or 6th century; he notes that there was a Campanian Bishop Sabinus who accompanied Pope John I on an embassy to Constantinople in 525. Kehr, p. 127, also states that Sabinus belongs at the end of the 5th century, and warns that he should not be confused with the famous Bishop Sabinus of Canusium. *Timotheus (c. 496‚Äìc. 499)Pope Gelasius I wrote to five bishops of Campania about Beneventan affairs.

He participated in the provincial synods at Naples in 1694 and 1699. He was nominated Bishop of Venosa, but he declined the promotion. He was appointed Bishop of Avellino by Pope Innocent XII, former Archbishop of Naples, in the Consistory of 28 May 1700.

When Bishop Finy resigned on 29 July 1726, the Pope immediately nominated the Auditor of Cardinal Lorenzo Corsini, Msgr. Marcello Passeri, to the bishopric of Avellino, but circumstances unknown prevented the nomination from being finalized. Passeri no doubt preferred his legal career in the Roman Curia to a small south-Italian diocese. Nobilione was nominated instead, on 31 July 1726. He was consecrated in Rome on 18 August 1726 by his fellow Dominican, Pope Benedict XIII. But, on 16 November 1726 he too resigned, without ever having taken possession of either of his dioceses, Avellino or Frigento. Instead he was appointed bishop of the diocese of Andria, which happened to be the birthplace of Marcello Passeri, on 9 December 1726. He died there on 23 October 1757 at the age of 90.

This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D3 subtype inhibits adenylyl cyclase through inhibitory G-proteins. This receptor is expressed in phylogenetically older regions of the brain, suggesting that this receptor plays a role in cognitive and emotional functions. It is a target for drugs which treat schizophrenia, drug addiction, and Parkinson's disease. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants that would encode different isoforms, although some variants may be subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).

This Act is partly still in force in Great Britain (as of 2018).legislation.gov.uk Offences Before the Act was passed, treason in Scotland consisted of \\"theft in landed men, murder under trust, wilful fire-raising, firing coalheughs, and assassination.\\" Section 1 of the Act abolished these offences and replaced them with the English definition of high treason. The Act also applied the English offence of misprision of treason to Scotland. (However it did not extend petty treason to Scotland.) The Act also created new offences of treason. It became treason: *to counterfeit the Great Seal of Scotland and other Scottish seals (anywhere in Great Britain), and *to slay the Lords of Session or Lords of Justiciary \\"sitting in Judgment in the Exercise of their Office within Scotland\\". These new offences were similar to existing treasons in England, as in England it was already treason to kill judges or to forge the English seal. (For treason in English law in 1708 and today, see High treason in the United Kingdom.) Since 1708 treason law in Scotland has generally remained the same as in England. However while the offence of counterfeiting the Seal of Scotland was removed from English treason law in 1861,Sections 2 and 31 of the Forgery Act 1830 (11 Geo. IV & 1 Gul. IV c. 66) repealed and re-enacted the forgery provisions of the 1708 Act in England and Wales, and the Forgery Act 1861 repealed the 1830 Act and re-enacted this offence as a felony in section 1. it is still treason in Scottish law.Forgery Act 1830, section 29; and Treason Act 1708, section 12.

Procedure Section III of the Act required the Scottish courts to try cases of treason and misprision of treason according to English rules of procedure and evidence. This rule was repealed in 1945.Treason Act 1945 (c. 44), section 2(2) and Schedule. Sections still in force The Act originally had eleven sections, which were later renumbered one to fourteen. Of the fourteen sections, four survive: *Section 1 brings Scottish law into line with English law in respect of high treason and misprision of treason. *Section 5 made the penalties for high treason and misprision of treason in Scotland the same as in England (for details see the Treason Act 1814). *Section 11 makes it treason to kill certain Scottish judges. *Section 12 makes it treason to forge \\"Her Majesty's Seals appointed by the Twenty-fourth Article of the Union to be kept, used, and continued in Scotland\\". This list of seals includes the Great Seal of Scotland. (This section was repealed in England and Wales in 1830.Forgery Act 1830, sections 29 and 31.)

A Liberal Party politician, she also served as Member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia for Antioquia from 1992 to 1994. An outspoken critic of the former administration of President √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez, she was twice investigated by the Inspector General of Colombia, which resulted in her being stripped from her seat in Congress in 2005 and again in 2010 and being banned from holding public office for 18 years. In 2016, the Colombian Supreme Court overruled both decisions based on a lack of evidence. During 2007, C√≥rdoba participated as an official government mediator for the humanitarian exchange discussions between the Government of Colombia and the FARC guerrilla group, along with now deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez. After the end of the mediation in November, the FARC announced the release of hostages Clara Rojas and Consuelo Gonz√°lez. She was nominated for the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for her work in promoting peace and human rights in conflict zones but her nomination caused controversy and uproar in her native Colombia.Bhatia, Meera.

As part of the \\"farcpolitics\\" scandal, Colombian authorities have probed her due to accusations linking the Senator with the FARC. In 2010, C√≥rdoba spoke before the European Parliament, asking it to pressure the Colombian government under President Juan Manuel Santos into entering into peace talks with the nation's insurgent groups. However, C√≥rdoba later apologized to Santos for her remarks and stated that she didn't want to put the president against a wall, but serve as an \\"ally for peace.\\" Cordoba apologizes to Santos.

In 2012, C√≥rdoba was named by Foreign Policy magazine as the most influential Ibero-American intellectual, again causing much controversy in her native Colombia. In 2017, C√≥rdoba officially announced her intention to run for president in 2018. Early life C√≥rdoba was born in Medell√≠n, Antioquia of an Afro-Colombian father and a white mother. Her parents are Zabul√≥n C√≥rdoba (brother of political leader of the Department of Choc√≥ Diego Luis C√≥rdoba) and L√≠a Ruiz. She studied at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana in Medell√≠n, graduating as a lawyer. She specialized in Labour Law at the same university, and in Public Opinion and Political Marketing at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, in Bogot√°. Early political career C√≥rdoba began her political career in Medell√≠n working as a community leader in many neighborhoods along with political leader William Jaramillo G√≥mez. Between 1984 and 1986 C√≥rdoba was appointed to her first public office job, working as a municipal sub-controller. In 1986, C√≥rdoba was appointed as private secretary for the Mayor of Medell√≠n. In 1988 C√≥rdoba was elected Councilwoman of Medell√≠n, where she remained until 1990, when she postulated her name as candidate for the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia but did not secure enough votes to be elected. A few months after the congressional elections, C√≥rdoba ran for Deputy to the Antioquia Assembly, this time successfully getting elected. Representative to the Chamber 1992‚Äì1994 After the Constituent Assembly of Colombia adopted the new Constitution of 1991, C√≥rdoba ran for congress once again for the Chamber of Representatives for the period 1992‚Äì1994. In 1994 her political mentor William Jaramillo announced that he was not going to seek a reelection and C√≥rdoba assumed his role. She was elected to the Senate for the 1994‚Äì1998 period receiving most of her votes from the departments of Antioquia and Choc√≥. Due to her public profile C√≥rdoba became one of the most notorious figures of the Latin American feminist movement in Colombia. She became part of a popular inter-parliamentary group that promotes government policies on sexuality. In 1995, C√≥rdoba participated in the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China. Career in the Senate Through Congress, C√≥rdoba became nationally known for taking controversial positions, such as the reactivation of the extradition law in 1997 and other positions that were seen as radical and belligerent. In 1998 C√≥rdoba was nonetheless reelected as senator. She promoted debates focused on minorities and communitarian mothers groups, as well as the resolution of the Colombian armed conflict through peaceful negotiations. During the investigation that then president of Colombia Ernesto Samper underwent for allegedly accepting money in his presidential campaign from the Cali drug trafficking cartel, C√≥rdoba became an outspoken defender of the president during the scandal that was later dubbed Proceso 8000. ;Kidnapping In 1999 Carlos Casta√±o, leader of the paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), kidnapped Senator C√≥rdoba. After several weeks she was freed and exiled with her family in Canada. After one year and 2 months in exile and reports by Colombian authorities that security had improved, C√≥rdoba returned to Colombia, leaving her family behind to resume her political duties. She has been the victim of two assassination attempts. ;Death threats and political ban through coercion In the elections of 2002, the regions where C√≥rdoba had traditionally received strong voting results like Medell√≠n, Choc√≥ were seen as being under control by an AUC paramilitary group. C√≥rdoba was elected once again for Congress this time obtaining strong voting results in the capital, Bogot√°. ;Corruption debates and loss of seat in Congress In 2003, C√≥rdoba was involved in a series of debates regarding corruption by the Minister of the Interior and Justice, Fernando Londo√±o Hoyos. After the debates in May of that year, with her image and profile improved, she was elected President of the National Liberal Directorate (head of the Colombia liberal party). In 2005, the Council of State of Colombia modified the electoral results of 2002 after proving there had been electoral fraud in Valle del Cauca and Atl√°ntico. The new results left C√≥rdoba out of Congress. She then promoted the leftist radical wing of the Colombian Liberal party in order to prevent it from moving towards the political current of President √Ålvaro Uribe. ;Citizens Power 21st Century political movement For this reason, she founded the ' political movement as an internal dissidence of the Liberal party. In the legislative elections of 2006 C√≥rdoba's political movement did not get a high voting turnout; however, she was elected once again to the Senate. In 2006 C√≥rdoba became part of the Seventh Commission of Congress, which is in charge of debating labor topics. She had previously worked on the Third Commission which deals with Financial affairs, the Fifth Commission which deals with Mining and Energy and the Second Commission which debated topics related to Foreign Affairs. C√≥rdoba was also president of the Senate's Human Rights Commission and the Peace Commission. As a congresswoman she has supported projects that focused mainly on \\"communitary mothers\\", women head of households, Afro-Colombian communities, LGBT groups, groups against family violence and corruption. Controversy in Mexico On March 11, 2007, C√≥rdoba attended a symposium in Mexico City called Los Partidos Pol√≠ticos y Una Nueva Ciudad (Political parties and a new city) which was supported by guerrilla groups from Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN), both considered narco-terrorist organizations by the US government and the European Union and the Republic of Colombia. C√≥rdoba generated controversy after declaring that \\"the progressive governments of Latin America should break their diplomatic relations with Colombia\\" and also that √Ålvaro Uribe was a \\"paramilitary\\".√âlber Guti√©rrez Roa, Declaraciones de Piedad C√≥rdoba en M√©xico profundizan diferencias con el Partido Liberal , Revista Semana, March 13, 2007 The head of the Liberal Party, C√©sar Gaviria, rejected C√≥rdoba's opinions.

The outrage was surprising, since the warm relations between Uribe's administration and the right-wing paramilitaries‚Äîalso recognized as \\"narco-terrorists\\" by the US and the EU‚Äîwas a matter of public record: the paramilitaries had endorsed Uribe in the 2002 presidential election, describing him as the 'man closest to our philosophy', and were rewarded with the \\"Justice and Peace Law\\", which gave them an amnesty in return for light sentences, as long as they confess to their crimes. Many were extradited to the U.S. under drug trafficking charges. It was described by a former US ambassador to Bogot√° as \\"a law that couldn't be better designed to give the criminals a way out\\". Uribe's second term in office was marked by the \\"para- politics\\" scandal, which largely vindicated Cordoba's criticisms of his administration. Humanitarian exchange negotiator On August 16, 2007, President √Ålvaro Uribe, in a surprising move, appointed C√≥rdoba as mediator in the humanitarian exchange in an effort to negotiate the freedom of some 50 (number at the time) hostages held by FARC and the possible release of some 500 guerrillas imprisoned by the government.Analitica: Colombia: Uribe nombra senadora cercana a Ch√°vez como facilitadora ante FARC.

Retrieved on 2011-12-03. to which she responded that the photos \\"were taken out of context\\". On November 22, President Uribe ended the mediation after Ch√°vez broke with diplomatic protocol by placing a series of calls directly to the high command of the Colombian military. Uribe had conditioned Ch√°vez against any attempt to talk to the Colombian military high command without going through appropriate diplomatic channels. Ch√°vez initially accepted the decision but afterward reacted by pulling his ambassador from Bogot√°, and he decided to cease diplomatic relations between the two countries and even announced his intent to sharply reduce bilateral commerce. On December 20, 2007, C√≥rdoba accused an unspecified \\"top Colombian government official\\", of orchestrating an assassination attempt towards her on Venezuelan soil. This accusation sparked a confrontation with Juan Manuel Santos, the Minister of Defense, who had previously been the subject of other allegations made by C√≥rdoba. So far no proof or testimony about the alleged conspiracy is known.Santos dice que Piedad lo acusa en voz baja, ella se declara sorprendida. eltiempo.com. 21 December 2007 Following the end of her official role as a mediator, C√≥rdoba accused President √Ålvaro Uribe, the Minister of Defense and the Colombian Armed Forces of engaging in military operations or otherwise obstructing announced hostage releases, in spite of subsequent releases being carried out regardless.

According to the information in the files, C√≥rdoba would reportedly be implicated due to having friendly ties with the guerrillas. Under the codename of \\"Teodora de Bolivar\\", allegedly in reference to the Senator, she would be one of twelve people mentioned as part of a potential transitional government set up by the FARC in the event that they seized power in Colombia. The files are said to indicate C√≥rdoba would have received money from Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez to fund social projects in the department. The Colombian Supreme Court asked for the seized files in order establish if there are valid reasons for a criminal investigation, but the Colombian government wanted the files to be validated by Interpol first. Interpol reported that the Colombian government had not manipulated the seized computer exhibits and validated their authenticity, but did not certify the accuracy of their contents. C√≥rdoba has claimed the revelations are a \\"smokescreen\\" meant to divert attention from the Colombian parapolitics scandal affecting the Uribe administration but Interpol has neither confirmed nor denied the contents. 2009 Nobel Peace Prize Nomination The senator was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, by solicitation of former Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel, causing much controversy and outrage amongst Colombians. 2010 Banned from public office On September 27, 2010, Senator C√≥rdoba's credentials were revoked by the Inspector General of Colombia, Alejandro Ordo√±ez, due to her alleged FARC ties. The Inspector General's investigation concluded that C√≥rdoba was involved in promoting and supporting the guerrilla group.

C√≥rdoba rejected the Inspector General's decision and accused him of \\"criminalizing humanitarian work.\\" She has announced that she will counter the decision and intends to prove her innocence. C√≥rdoba also reiterated her wish to continue working towards peace and freedom.Cordoba: Dismissal will not stop fight for peace. Colombiareports.com (2010-09-28). Retrieved on 2011-12-03. According to the Inspector General, the investigation originated from the electronic media seized during Operation Phoenix, the military operation where FARC spokesperson \\"Ra√∫l Reyes\\" was killed in Ecuador. The Inspector General's decision refers to electronic documents identifying C√≥rdoba with the aliases of \\"Teodora\\", \\"Teodora Bolivar\\" and \\"La Negra\\". The parliamentary, according to the Inspector General's decision, also exceeded the duties specified in the authorization given to her by the Colombian government as an official mediator for the humanitarian exchange. Based on these and other findings, the Inspector General reported he had established that the senator gave advice to FARC, such as sending voice recordings instead of video footage of the insurgent group's hostages as \\"proofs of life\\" in order to improve their strategy.  2016 Restitution  In 2016, the Supreme Court of Colombia overturned the Inspector General's decisions, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to support his findings and restoring C√≥rdoba's full political rights.  2018 Colombian Presidential Election  On June 12, 2017, C√≥rdoba announced herself as a candidate for the 2018 Colombian Presidential Election. Though she has not identified which party she will represent in the election, she confidently declared to the press, \\"I will be the president of Colombia in 2018.\\"She did not get elected.

Notable recordings Boston Baroque has performed and recorded period- instrument performances of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Handel's Messiah, Purcell's Dido and √Üneas, Monteverdi Vespers of 1610, Bach's Mass in B minor, Handel's Concerti Grossi, Op. 6, Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Tauride, Mozart's The Impresario and Mozart's Circle's The Beneficent Dervish, Handel's Music for Royal Fireworks and Water Music, Bach: The Complete Orchestral Suites, Mozart: Flute Concertos and Symphony No. 41 \\"Jupiter\\", Vivaldi's Gloria, Bach's Magnificat, Cherubini's Requiem in C minor (1816) and March fun√®bre (1820), Beethoven's Elegiac Song (Elegischer Gesang), Op. 118. Boston Baroque has received three Grammy Nominations *Handel‚Äôs Messiah, 1992: Best Performance of a Choral Work *Monteverdi‚Äôs Vespers of 1610, 1998: Best Performance of a Choral Work *Bach‚Äôs Mass in B Minor, 2000: Best Performance of a Choral Work Notable premiere recordings by Boston Baroque include: *First period instrument recording of Mozart's Requiem Mass in D minor in the completion by Robert D. Levin, in which Levin addresses the issues of instrumentation, grammar and structure raised by the traditional Sussmayr completion. *Lost Music of Early America, the first and sole professional CD recording of American Moravian Church music‚Äîthe first early American classical music. Martin Pearlman researched the music at the Moravian Music Foundation in Salem, North Carolina, and chose and arranged the hymns into patterns appropriate for the Moravian Lovefeast or Liebesmahl, primarily a song service with hymns, psalms and anthems. Included are Lovefeasts for Christmas, Lent and Thanksgiving. *The Philosopher's Stone, (Der Stein der Weisen), 1790, a collaboratively composed Singspiel with a story based on the same set of fairy-tales from which The Magic Flute was drawn, which attracted renewed attention in 1996, when musicologist David J. Buch discovered a previously unknown copy. Besides numerous correlations with Mozart‚Äôs final operatic work, The Magic Flute, which was written for the same company a year later, this copy of The Philosopher‚Äôs Stone suggested the likelihood of Mozart's participation in the composition of more of the music than had been previously thought. Boston Baroque was chosen by David J. Buch to give the modern-day world premiere of The Philosopher's Stone. The work was presented in concert form in Boston's Jordan Hall (1999) and recorded for Telarc. *First period instrument recording of Luigi Cherubini's long neglected Requiem in C minor, which premiered on January 21, 1817, in a memorial concert below the abbey church of St. Denis to commemorate the anniversary of the executions of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Though held in the highest esteem by Beethoven, Brahms, Berlioz and Wagner, and performed widely in its own day, the piece fell into obscurity along with most of Cherubini's output by the end of the 19th century. *First period instrument recording of Mozart's Der Schauspieldirektor. Collaborations *Boston Baroque performed with Mark Morris and the Mark Morris Dance Group in five performances of Henry Purcell's Dido and √Üneas, in Chicago and Ann Arbor, in 1996. *Boston Baroque performed Boston's first fully staged production of Alceste by Christoph Willibald Gluck in a co-production with Opera Boston at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in 2005 *Boston Baroque performed Handel's Semele, in a fully staged production with Opera Boston at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in February 2008.

Dark City: The Film Noir, film listed as film noir #432 on page 188, 1984. Jefferson, N.C. & London: McFarland Publishing. . Plot Crystal Shackleford (Geraldine Fitzgerald) lures two strangers, solicitor Jerome K. Arbutny (Sydney Greenstreet) and charming and erudite drunkard Johnny West (Peter Lorre) to her London flat on Chinese New Year in 1938 because of her belief that if three strangers make the same wish to an idol of Kwan Yin, Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny, the wish will be granted. Since money will make their dreams come true, the three go in on a sweepstakes ticket for the Grand National horse race together and agree that they will not sell the ticket if it is chosen, but will hold on to it until the race is run. Shackleford would use the money to try to win her estranged husband back, Arbutny to smooth the way for his selection to the prestigious Barrister's Club, and Johnny to buy a bar and live in it. The stories of the three strangers are revealed. Shackleford's husband David (Alan Napier) moved to Canada and fell in love with Janet Elliott (Marjorie Riordan). He returns, just after Johnny and Arbutny take their leave of Crystal, and demands a divorce, but she refuses. She sees to it that he loses a promotion. She also lies to Janet, telling her that David still loves her and that she is pregnant. The trusting woman believes her and returns to Canada. With the help of an adoring Icey Crane (Joan Lorring), Johnny has been hiding out after his drunken participation in a botched robbery that resulted in the death of a policeman. Icey commits perjury in order to provide an alibi for the murderer and ringleader, Bertram Fallon (Robert Shayne). When a second witness is discredited, Fallon confesses to the robbery but blames the murder on West and the third man involved, Timothy Delaney, who is nicknamed Gabby (Peter Whitney). Johnny is caught and sentenced to death, but Gabby finds Fallon on his way to prison and stabs him. As he dies in the railway carriage, Fallon clears Johnny. Arbutny has been speculating in stocks with money from the trust fund of Lady Rhea Belladon (Rosalind Ivan), an eccentric widow who believes she can talk with her dead husband. When the stock falls and his margin is called, a desperate Arbutny proposes to Lady Belladon. After consulting with her dead husband, she turns him down. Worse, she says that Lord Belladon wants to have the books checked. Arbutny is about to shoot himself when he sees in a newspaper that the sweepstakes ticket has drawn the favorite in the Grand National. The three strangers converge on Crystal's flat. Arbutny wants to sell his share of the ticket immediately so he can replace the funds he stole before his crime can be uncovered. Johnny is willing, but Shackleford is adamant that they stick to their original agreement. Arbutny becomes enraged and accidentally kills her with her statue of Kwan Yin. Ironically, they hear on the radio that their horse wins. Johnny points out to Arbutny that the winning ticket has to be destroyed because their agreement and signatures on it would provide a motive for Crystal's murder. They leave the flat, but Arbutny is overcome by guilt, and panics and runs out into the middle of the busy street. He stops traffic and attracts a crowd, including a policeman, to whom Arbutny confesses the murder. Johnny returns to the pub, where Icey finds him. Content with her, he sets the ticket on fire.

Its original title was Three Men and a Girl,TCM Overview and Bette Davis and George Brent were originally to be the leads. At one point, the story was considered for a sequel of sorts to The Maltese Falcon, and Humphrey Bogart, Sydney Greenstreet and Mary Astor were to star. However, according to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, Warner Bros. discovered the rights to the characters had reverted to Dashiell Hammett. Because Warners had owned the rights since 1937, actors considered for the role of \\"Jerome K. Arbutny\\" were Lionel Atwill, Donald Crisp, Ian Hunter and Claude Rains, while Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis were considered to play \\"Crystal Shackelford\\". For the third starring role, that of \\"Johnny West,\\" Errol Flynn, David Niven, Leslie Howard, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Robert Montgomery were considered.TCM Notes Director Jean Negulesco was a fan of Lorre's work and fought hard to give him the role. John Huston was inspired to write the story by a wooden figure he bought in an antique shop while working in London. Later, events at a party in his flat suggested to Huston the story of three strangers sharing a sweepstakes ticket. Alfred Hitchcock was at the gathering, and liked the story when Huston told it to him, but nothing came of it. Huston returned to Hollywood, and Warners bought the treatment in 1937. Huston went on to write the script with his friend Howard Koch. When the film finally went into production, Huston was not available to direct it, because he was a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.Jeff Stafford \\"Three Strangers\\" (TCM article) Two American release dates for Three Strangers can be found: 28 January 1946IMDB Release Dates and 16 February 1946. It's possible that the first date is the premiere, and the later one the actual date of general release. Reception In its 1946 review, Variety wrote: > Greenstreet overplays to some extent as the attorney who has raided a trust > fund, but he still does a good job. Lorre is tops as a drunk who gets > involved in a murder of which he's innocent, while Fitzgerald rates as the > victim.Variety Staff \\"Three Strangers review\\", Variety (1 January 1946) Bosley Crowther in The New York Times wrote that same year: > [T]he action [...] is full-bodied melodrama of a shrewd and sophisticated > sort.

He works within the paradigm of liberation theology and can be considered a \\"next generation\\" theologian-practitioner. He has served as an informal associate of the \\"DEI School,\\" a research institute in Costa Rica where scholars such as Pablo Richard, Elsa T√°mez, and Franz Hinkelammert are currently working. He is particularly concerned with the relation between theology and the economy as well as education theory in view of solidarity. Though he may be viewed as rejecting the idea that some sort of historical subject, whether God, the proletariat, or even a particular set of social institutions, will bring into history the utopian dream of a truly just, peaceful, and harmonious society, he is not passive in the face of injustice. Sung has worked directly with basic ecclesial communities as an advisor, speaking regularly at various ecumenical events that focus on justice and solidarity, and writing scholarly books as well as those aimed directly at those laypersons who are involved in particular struggles for justice. He speaks about justice with the same ferociousness as most liberation theologians, but tempers his evaluations of struggles, projects, and proposals with a sense of what may be temporally attainable. Early life Sung was born in Seoul, South Korea as the eldest son of Sung Nak-cheon (ÏÑ±ÎÇôÏ≤ú; ÊàêÊ¥õÂ§©). He attended the Samcheong Elementary School there before moving to Paran√°, Brazil with his family in 1966. He has remained there ever since. Sung received his undergraduate degree in philosophy in 1984, a doctorate in religious studies in 1993 (from the Methodist University of S√£o Paulo, under the direction of J√∫lio de Santa Ana), and did post-doctoral work in education in 2000 (at the Methodist University of Piracicaba with Hugo Assmann). Employment Sung is currently a professor in the graduate program of religious studies at the prestigious Methodist University of S√£o Paulo, where he has been teaching since 1994. From 1996 to 2006 he was also a professor in the graduate program at the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo. Impact abroad Several of Sung's texts have been translated into Italian, Spanish, Korean, English, and German. He is gradually gaining prominence and exposure in the United States, speaking, for example, twice in the last three years at the annual national meeting of the American Academy of Religion (a large convention with over 11,000 participants). For some basic external references about his work, see \\"Moral Theology in Latin America\\" by Dean Brackey and Thomas Schubeck in Theological Studies (March 2002, vol.63, issue 1). Jung Mo Sung's \\"concept of the inevitability of inequality and social exclusion\\" backgrounding Western socio-economic tradition was drawn on by Ronaldo Sathler-Rosa in his \\"Pastoral Action in the Midst of a Context of Economic Transformation and Cultural Apathy\\" in International Perspectives on Pastoral Counseling, ed. James Reaves Farris (2002). See also Ivan Petrella's The Future of Liberation Theology (SCM Press, 2006) and his edited volume of articles, Latin American Liberation Theology: The Next Generation (Orbis Books, 2005). The latter volume, Petrella states, \\"opens with Jung Mo Sung, the most prolific next-generation voice within mainstream contemporary Latin American liberation theology\\" (p. xvi). Dr. Petrella employed Sung's critique of earlier liberation theologians in his own article \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: The Making Over of Liberation Theology, A Queer Discursive Approach\\" in Liberation Theology and Sexuality, ed. Marcella Althaus-Reid (Ashgate, 2006 [expanded pb. ed., 2009]), pp. 33‚Äì49.

The Hope family was of Scottish descent but had been settled in The Netherlands for many years, where they had a successful mercantile and banking business, but had returned to Britain after French troops occupied the country in 1795. Beresford Hope was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. His father died in 1831 and his mother married as her second husband her first cousin General William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford. In 1854 he inherited his stepfather's estates, including Bedgebury Park, Kent, and Beresford Hall, Staffordshire, and assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Beresford. His brother was Henry Thomas Hope. Parliamentary career Wood- engraving (after an intermediary drawing by Thomas Dewell Scott), after photograph by Henry Hering, 1856 He sat as Member of Parliament for Maidstone from 1841 to 1852 and from 1857 to 1859. He unsuccessfully contested Cambridge University in 1859 and Stoke-upon-Trent in 1862, but was successfully returned for the latter constituency in 1865. From 1868 until his death he was one of two representatives for Cambridge University. From 1865 he sat as an independent Conservative. He vehemently opposed the Reform Act of 1867 proposed by Benjamin Disraeli, nicknaming Disraeli \\"the Asian mystery\\" (referring to Disraeli's Jewish origins). Disraeli retorted by alluding to Beresford Hope's \\"Batavian graces\\" (in reference to his family's Dutch origins). He never held ministerial office but was sworn of the Privy Council in 1880. Philanthropy and writing Vanity Fair, 1870 Henry Hering photo Beresford Hope's most prominent public feature was his ardent support for the Church of England. According to George Wakeling, \\"in Parliament his voice, in his slow, rather harsh, but very impressive way, would be raised on every Church question\\". He was especially steadfast in his opposition to the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill. While at Trinity College in 1839, he was, along with John Mason Neale and Benjamin Webb a founder of the Cambridge Camden Society (later the Ecclesiological Society). He re-established it in 1879 as the St Paul's Ecclesiological Society A very wealthy man, he purchased St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury in 1844, to rebuild it as a college for missionary clergy. He also supervised the commissioning and construction of the church of All Saints, Margaret Street, London, to the designs of William Butterfield on behalf of the Ecclesiological Society. In about 1850 Beresford Hope inherited the Beresford estate in Alstonefield and Sheen in Staffordshire. He wanted to make Sheen \\"the Athens of the Moorlands\\". He rebuilt the church, to the design of William Butterfield, and built a school and a lending library. It was remarked in The Ecclesiologist that \\"the general effect is that of an ecclesiastical colony in the wilds of Australia\\". Not all Hope's plans for Sheen were realized.A P Baggs, M F Cleverdon, D A Johnston and N J Tringham, \\"Sheen\\", in A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 7, Leek and the Moorlands, ed.

He co-founded the Saturday Review in 1855. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1880. In 1873 he was invited to lay the foundation stone of the new Christ Church in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.

She was a member of the House of Wettin by birth and married to Otto von Habsburg, the last heir of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Enache, Nicolas. La Descendance de Marie-Therese de Habsburg. ICC, Paris, 1996. pp. 43, 49, 173, 373. French. Her marital and birth titles were not recognized in the Austrian Republic, however, in Germany, where she was born and resided most of her life, former hereditary titles are legally incorporated in the surname.  Early years The Veste Heldburg, where Regina grew up, overlooks the Heldburger Land in South Thuringia. Regina was born in W√ºrzburg. She was the youngest of four children born to Prince Georg of Saxe-Meiningen and Countess Klara Marie von Korff genannt Schmising-Kerssenbrock. A sister, Marie Elisabeth, died an infant in 1923. The elder brother, Anton Ulrich, was killed in action during the Second World War, while the younger, Friedrich Alfred, became a Carthusian monk. Although the Saxe-Meiningen dynasty was Protestant, Regina was raised in the Roman Catholic faith of her mother. She grew up in the Veste Heldburg which overlooks the Heldburger Land in south Thuringia. Her father, a judge in Meiningen and Hildburghausen, joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and died a captive at the Soviet camp for prisoners of war at Cherepovets in 1946. Her mother had fled with her to West Germany. Regina studied social work at Bamberg and then worked in Munich at a Caritas home for Hungarian refugees. In 1949, she met Otto von Habsburg, the heir of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and the last crown prince of the dissolved Austria-Hungary, when he came to visit his former subjects in the Caritas home. Regina and Otto were engaged in 1950. They were fourth cousins as both were descendants of Karl Ludwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and his wife Countess Amalie Henriette of Solms- Baruth. Marriage Regina and Otto's wedding procession As Otto was prohibited from entering Austria until 1966, his and Regina's wedding had to be celebrated elsewhere. The wedding was held on 10 May 1951 in the Church of Saint-Fran√ßois-des-Cordeliers in Nancy, where several members of the House of Lorraine are buried. Pope Pius XII gave his blessing. Unusually among the heirs to deposed monarchies, Otto did not use royal titles or pursue his claim. Instead, he had a political career in the European Parliament, the success of which he attributed to Regina's support. From 10 May 1954 until her death Regina and Otto lived at Villa Austria, also called the Kaiservilla, in P√∂cking near Lake Starnberg. In her dynastic role as wife of the head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, Regina acted as protectress of the all-female Roman Catholic Order of the Starry Cross, grand mistress of the similar Order of Saint Elizabeth, and an honorary lady grand cross of the Sovereign Order of Malta. Later life Capuchin Church, Vienna, draped with the Habsburg standard. The guards of honour are dressed in Austro-Hungarian uniforms. On 2 December 2005 Regina had a stroke and was taken to a hospital in Nancy. By 22 February 2006 she had recovered sufficiently to participate in the transfer of the remains of her mother and her brother, Anton Ulrich, to the vault of the Veste Heldburg in the churchyard of Heldburg. The transfer of the remains of her father thither from Cherepovets took place in the spring of 2007. Regina died in P√∂cking on 3 February 2010, aged 85, and was entombed at Veste Heldburg on 10 February.Main Post, February 8, 2010 Her remains, except for her heart, were moved to Mariazell and then to the Kaisergruft in Vienna at the time of her husband's funeral on 16 July 2011.

He resigned his post at the Labour Department in early 1908 to become Secretary for the Huddersfield and District Woollen Manufacturers and Spinners Association. In 1917 he became secretary to the Woolen and Worsted Trades Federation, a position he held until his death on 11 July 1945.

Wood was a free thinker and was active in a variety of local radical movements in Huddersfield, including the Fabians. He collected wage statistics over a broad field and published much of his collected material. \\"E.C.R(hodes).\\" said in Wood's obituary that \\"It is impossible, within the limits of a short obituary notice, to do justice to all the varied aspects of Wood's other activities or to his colourful personality. He had a wide range of interests, including the arts, music and (above all) cricket. He had made a close study of the history, and achieved marked success in the art and craft, of wood engraving; making and shaping his own blocks, engraving them, and printing from them with his own press. He had a special enthusiasm for cricket, and had an amazing knowledge of the performances of the more prominent players of this and past generations. Those who were present when he entertained a few Fellows of the Society and leading cricketers after reading his paper on cricket scores in November 1944, will recall with delight the informal discussion which followed, and his exchange of opinions and reminiscences with a distinguished ex-captain of All-England test teams and other first-class cricketers. Wood could be a doughty controversialist, when occasion arose, and his vehement defence of positions to the last ditch was sometimes liable to rouse antagonisms in the minds of those who were only slightly acquainted with him. Those who were privileged to enjoy his friendship, however, will long remember his kindly and generous nature, his staunch loyalty to colleagues and friends, and his invariable readiness to help a lame dog over the stile.\\" His extensive library, first loaned to Huddersfield Technical College in c.1925, includes manuscript wages material, monographs, pamphlets, government reports and periodicals. The subjects covered include economic and social history, education, health, housing and women's history. His work is archived at Heritage Quay at the University of Huddersfield.

Main characters Space Ghost Voiced by George Lowe, Space Ghost, whose real name is Tad Eustace Ghostal, was a superhero in the 60s. Though occasionally conflicted about whether saving the world or hosting a talk show best suits him, Tad genuinely wants to put on the best talk show he can. Unfortunately, his failings tend to get the better of him. He is childish, egotistical, and petty, and he remains generally oblivious to his surroundings. He has little regard for the well- being of others and often demeans his sidekicks and guests. In an interview with Conan O'Brien, Space Ghost announces that he has always been dead and was never a space man. \\"I was dead long before you were born, Conan, and I'll be dead long before you're dead\\". Space Ghost appears in almost every episode, with the exception of \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Hipster\\" (both from season four). Zorak Voiced by C. Martin Croker, Zorak Roberts is the band leader and a mantis-like alien, known for his hatred of Space Ghost. Extremely evil, he once ate his own nephew. He is a virgin, largely due to the fact that he does not wish to be eaten by his mate after intercourse, as is normal for mantises. He has no remorse, feels no pity, and acts only to meet his own ends. He is Brak's best friend, however he gives Brak little respect. His superhero persona is Batmantis. Though Space Ghost's prisoner, Zorak retains his membership in the Council of Doom. He claims he is either a locust or a mantis, but he often changes his mind. In episode 97, \\"Al\\", it is revealed that Mr. Pong (Allan Alcorn) is Zorak's father. He co-hosted Cartoon Planet and its revival with Brak. Moltar Voiced by C. Martin Croker, Moltar is the show's director and producer. His body is made entirely of lava, and he normally wears an orange and gray full-body containment suit which has a breathing receptacle. By far the most competent and level-headed character, Moltar sometimes tends to be smarter than he seems. He tends to be very good friends with Zorak, even though Zorak doesn't have the same feelings for him. He is a big fan of CHiPs and its star, Erik Estrada. Moltar made a brief appearance in Cartoon Planet where he, Zorak and Brak got into a fight until Space Ghost sent him and Zorak to their rooms. Moltar would later become the fictional producer for Cartoon Network's action animation block Toonami in 1997, before being replaced by T.O.M. in 1999. In the original 1966 Space Ghost series, he was voiced by Don Messick, his name was alternately spelled \\"Moltar\\" and \\"Moltor\\", and his clothing was alternately white and yellow. Moltar has made an appearance in the Cartoon Network special \\"The Big Game XXVIII\\". Recurring characters Brak Voiced by Andy Merrill, Brak is a somewhat cat-like teenage alien with large fangs who, although a villain, is the least threatening one on the program. He appeared on SGC2C periodically, often with the Council of Doom, of which he was a member, and was often victimized by Space Ghost or the other villains. Brak hijacked the show once in the episode \\"Jerk\\", wanting the audience to hail him, doing the intro and even the music much to Ghost's embarrassment. He co-hosted Cartoon Planet and its revival with Zorak. Tansit Voiced by Don Kennedy, Tansit (also spelled Tansut) is an overweight and cowardly man in an orange costume and helmet. His outfit makes him appear much more menacing than he actually is, but fails completely at hiding his gut. He replaced Moltar as director of the show twice, and messed it up. His biggest fear is getting zapped by one of Space Ghost's rays. He is a member of the Council of Doom. For about half the episodes of season 4 he announced the show off-screen until he was fired by Space Ghost. Lokar Voiced by Andy Merrill, Lokar is an erudite, giant hominid locust who is prone to violent outbursts and speaks in a British voice. Lokar seems to harbor a grudge towards Space Ghost, and constantly seeks his destruction, perhaps more for his boorishness than anything else. He is also in a long-running feud with Zorak. Lokar is a member of the Council of Doom, though he's not so much evil as a snob. The episode \\"Pilot\\" revealed that he was originally going to be the band leader of the show instead of Zorak, but Zorak was hired instead when Birdman, having been continuously insulted by Lokar, had his hawk Avenger attack him, something that hospitalized him. Chad Ghostal Voiced by Brad Abelle, Chad Ghostal is Space Ghost's evil twin brother, distinguished from Space Ghost in physical appearance only by a crudely drawn Van Dyke beard. He is a beatnik, with a love for jazz music and outdated beatnik slang, and is both extremely cool and evil. He is also quite the ladies' man. Chad is first mentioned in the episode Jerk where he calls in to the show to tell Space Ghost he has escaped from the asylum and will be there shortly. Chad 's first appearance onscreen is in \\"Switcheroo\\", where he uses his resemblance to Space Ghost to switch places with him, and again in \\"Hipster\\", where he takes over the show after incapacitating Space Ghost. Harvey Birdman Voiced by Scott Finnell, Harvey Birdman was the host of the show in the episodes Pilot and Sequel. He also appeared on the side lines during two other episodes. He appears to be washed up, and in a rut, alternately claiming to be unemployed. He then got a job as a lawyer in his own spin-off show Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law. Minor Metallus (Michael Tew) ‚Äì A villain and member of the Council of Doom who can only talk in a reverb-heavy metallic drone, rendering his every word incomprehensible, though other characters seem to understand him. He is a big metal guy with a blue vest and gloves, and he has a helmet with a large, presumably ornamental \\"wings\\". Since he can't talk normally, his personality isn't developed all that much. Black Widow (Judy Tenuta) ‚Äì A villain who has professed love for Space Ghost, much to the chagrin of the other villains. She is known for her scream that irritates Space Ghost. She also appeared in Johnny Bravo as a guest star. Raymond (C. Martin Croker) ‚Äì Zorak's previously unheard-of nephew. Space Ghost immediately took a liking to the cute miniature version of Zorak. Predictably, Raymond was eaten by Zorak before the end of the episode. He made appearances in 2 other episodes. The Original Way Outs ‚Äì The show's band, led by Zorak. The show has never explained their origins; in fact, very little attention is paid to them at all. The Sorcerer ‚Äì A member of The Original Way Outs with a large flesh-toned head and yellow eyes. He speaks on extremely rare occasions, as alluded to by Space Ghost in the episode Mayonnaise (\\"When did you start talking?\\"). His name was revealed on the commentary for the episode Zoltran. Kristy ‚Äì the drummer of The Original Way Outs. He never speaks, although he is frequently directly addressed by Space Ghost and Zorak. Bob (Tom Arcuragi) ‚Äì Featured in the fourth season, he acts as the shows director telling them what they need to do and how to do it, but he was featured in episodes that take place before the series actually took place and started.

It was named for David C. Broderick, a California senator. History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County of the Territory of Kansas (now in the State of Colorado). This discovery precipitating the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. To provide local government for the gold mining region, the Kansas Territorial Legislature split Arapahoe County into six counties on February 7, 1859: a much smaller Arapahoe County, Broderick County, El Paso County, Fremont County, Montana County, and Oro County. None of these six counties were ever organized. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the territorial government, and they formed their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. Following the Republican Party election victories in 1860, the United States Congress admitted Kansas to the Union. The Kansas Act of Admission excluded the portion of the Kansas Territory west of the 25th meridian west from Washington from the new state, and Broderick County and the rest of this region reverted to unorganized territory. On February 28, 1861, the Colorado Territory was organized to govern this unorganized territory and adjacent areas of the New Mexico Territory, the Utah Territory, and the Nebraska Territory. The new Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties on November 1, 1861, including a new Pueblo County for the Colorado Territory.

In 2012 it was included in the Cardinal Newman Society's Top 50 Catholic High Schools list.2012 Catholic High School Honor Roll Top 50 It was placed on the list again in 2014. In 2013 it was chosen by the editors of Virginia Living magazine as a 2013 Top Virginia School. History The school broke ground in September 2006 as the newest high school in the Diocese of Arlington with a construction cost of a state of the art facility at $60 million, funded by bonds, donations, and a capital campaign. The school was built on 40 acres of land, valued at $14.5 million, that was given to the diocese. In October 2007, the Diocese announced it would be named after Pope John Paul II. The school says that it has the only Catholic bioethics curriculum in the US. The school is led and taught by the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia, commonly known as the Nashville Dominicans, an order of Catholic sisters who are much younger on average than other orders, and whose stated mission is teaching. The newly constructed school opened to incoming 9th and 10th graders in August 2008. The school's first graduating class graduated in 2011. Graduates from the Class of 2012 and 2013 were accepted into universities, including Ivy League schools, military appointments, Catholic institutions, and other Virginia schools. Combined, these students earned more than $12 million in academic scholarships to the universities of their choice. In August 2013 the school opened with more than 600 students. The school intends to have an eventual capacity of 1,000 students. In May 2014 it was announced that, following John Paul II's canonization the previous month, the name of the school would be changed to Saint John Paul the Great. The school is the only high school in the U.S. to offer a 4-year Catholic Bioethics Curriculum, and has a House system (Aquino, Castello, Diego, Dominic, Gianna, Martin, More, Ruiz), with eight Houses named after Roman Catholic Saints.

Ortwin was born in Holtwick (now in the District of Coesfeld, Westphalia) and died in Cologne, Germany. He was raised by his uncle, Johannes von Gr√§tz, in Deventer. In 1501 he left to pursue philosophical studies at the University of Cologne. After joining Kyuk Burse, Ortwin became licensed in 1505, attained Masters level in 1506, and became an Art Professor in 1507. He supplemented his salary by proofing documents for the Quentell printing house and wrote introductions and poetic dedications in the volumes of classical authors of the Middle Ages. Ortwin was a follower of Hegius and Peter of Ravenna, a Humanist, and boasted many prominent intellectual friends. Because Ortwin sided with the Cologne University theologians and the Dominicans during the Reuchlin controversy, he found himself the subject of aggressive attacks from Hermann von dem Busche and the younger generation who were not pleased with his translations of the Jewish convert, Johannes Pfefferkorn. Ortwin had at that time just finished a literary tournament with Hermann von dem Busche and had been made the laughing-stock of the literary world by the venomous Epistolae obscurorum virorum, letters that were addressed to him.The Northern Renaissance And The Background Of The Reformation His adversaries succeeded in vilifying him on both moral and scientific grounds, denouncing his Latin and Greek scholarship and portraying him as a drunkard and worse. Ortwin made no response until Pope Leo X excommunicated the author, readers, and distributors of the Epistolary (1517). After his weak and ineffective defense, entitled Lamentationes obscurorum virorum, his damaged reputation remained distorted for centuries. In 1520 he was ordained to the priesthood and thereafter focused entirely on literary work. Works His magnum opus was the Little Collection of Things to Be Sought & Things to Be Avoided (), a collection of 66 more or less weighty letters and treatises by various authors on ecclesiastical and profane history, dogma and canon law, compiled to expose the noxious elements in the Church's organism and to prepare a way for a future council to remedy them. It has been wrongly claimed that this work, put on the Index on account of its anticlerical tendency, was not from the pen of Gratius.

During his tenure, Aguayo retook eastern Texas from New France without firing a shot. He established or reestablished seven missions and three presidios, and quadrupled the number of Spanish soldiers stationed in Texas. Aguayo and his wife were also owners of a very large estate, or latifundio, in Coahuila. His descendants inherited and expanded the landholdings. The Aguayo dynasty continued until 1825. Personal life Aguayo was descended from a noble Spanish family from Aragon. He came to his title through his marriage to Ignacia Xaviera, becoming the second Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo.Chipman (1992), p. 119. In 1712 the couple moved from Spain to Coahuila to manage her inherited land which was one of the largest latifundios in all of the Americas. The couple established their headquarters in San Francisco de los Patos (since 1892 called General Cepeda). Aguayo expanded the family's land holdings and gained control of many of the scarce water sources in the Chihuahua Desert of Coahuila. He obtained ownership of the sources of water near the village of Parras, and sold water to the farmers in the area. Parras was prominent for its irrigated vineyards and large production of wine and brandy.Harris III, Charles H. (1975), A Mexican Family Empire, Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 6-9, 107 The first winery in the Americas was in Parras.Jose Vasconcelos \\"Evaristo Madero: Biografia de un Patricio\\" (Impresiones Modernas, 1954); Rafael Heliodoro Valle, ‚ÄúThe History of Wine in Mexico‚Äù American Journal of Enology and Viticulture Vol. 9, No. 3, (1958); Pablo Lacoste \\"La vid y el vino en Am√©rica del Sur: El desplazamiento de los polos vitivin√≠colas (Siglos XVI Al XX).\\" Revista Universum Vol. 2, no. No. 19 (2004): 62-93. Governorship Spanish routes through Texas. The Aguayo expedition mostly followed the Camino Real. During the War of the Quadruple Alliance, Great Britain and France, who were aligned together against Spain, attempted to take over Spanish interests in North America.Weber (1992), pp. 165‚Äì166. In June 1719, seven Frenchmen from Natchitoches, Louisiana took control of the eastern Texas mission of San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the countries were at war. The French soldiers said that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.Weber (1992), p. 166‚Äì167. That year, Aguayo was named the governor of the provinces of Coahuila and Texas. He had volunteered to use his own money to reconquer Texas and raised an army of 500 soldiers. His departure was delayed a year, however, as he dealt with Indian troubles in Coahuila and a devastating drought that killed more than 80% of the horses he had purchased for the expedition. The drought ended with torrential rains, which made the journey impossible until late 1720.Chipman (1992), p. 120. Just before he departed, the fighting in Europe halted. Felipe V ordered Aguayo not to invade French Louisiana, but to find a way to retake eastern Texas without using force. The expedition took along more than 2800 horses, 6400 sheep, and many goats; this constituted the first large \\"cattle\\" drive in Texas, greatly increased the number of domesticated animals in the region, and marked the beginning of Spanish ranching in Texas.Chipman (1992), p. 121. On March 20, 1721, the Aguayo expedition crossed the Rio Grande into Texas. In July 1721, while approaching the Neches River, Aguayo's expedition met Louis St. Denis, commander of the French forces in the area, who was leading a raid with the objective of taking control of the Spanish mission at San Antonio de Bexar. Realizing that he was badly outnumbered, St. Denis agreed to abandon eastern Texas and return to Louisiana. Aguayo ordered the building of a new Spanish fort, Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de los Adaes, located near present-day Robeline, Louisiana, only 12 mi (19 km) from the French settlement at Natchitoches. The new fort became the first capital of Spanish Texas; it was guarded by 6 cannon and 100 soldiers.Weber (1992), p. 167. The six eastern Tejas missions were reopened, and Presidio Dolores, now known as Presidio de los Tejas, was moved from the Neches River to a site near mission Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n near the Angelina River.Chipman (1992), p. 123. The Spaniards then built another fort, Presidio Nuestra Se√±ora de Loreto de la Bah√≠a, known as La Bah√≠a, on the site of the former French Fort Saint Louis. Nearby they established a mission, Esp√≠ritu Santo de Z√∫√±iga (also known as La Bah√≠a), for the Coco, Karankawa, and Cujane Indians. Ninety men were left to staff the garrison.Chipman (1992), p. 126. On June 13, 1722, having returned to Mexico City from the expedition, Aguayo resigned from the governorship of Coahuila and Texas. At the beginning of his expedition, Texas had consisted only of San Antonio and approximately 60 soldiers; at his resignation the province had grown to consist of 4 presidios, over 250 soldiers, 10 missions, and the small civilian town of San Antonio.Weber (1992), p. 168.

In the 1760s the Aguayo landholdings totaled and their herds of sheep were estimated to number more than 200,000. Their headquarters at Patos had a population of 1,200. The Aguayos themselves were absentee landlords, living in Mexico City as did many large landowners with holdings in the Mexican hinterland.Harris, pp. 6-9 Mismanagement and the hazards of raising livestock in a drought-prone region drove the Aguayo family to sell much of their property to English investors in 1825. The S√°nchez Navarro family acquired the entire Aguayo estate in 1840 and thus became the largest landowners in all of the Americas.Harris, pp. 162-169.DeLay, Brian (2008), War of a Thousand Deserts, New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 52 References Bibliography Governors of Coahuila Governors of Spanish Texas Year of birth unknown 18th-century deaths Spanish colonial governors and administrators 1710s in Mexico 1720s in Mexico 1710s in Texas 1720s in Texas Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Jos√© de Azlor y Virto de Vera"},{"id":"14436982","text":"Lord Amulree in 1949 Basil Mackenzie, 2nd Baron Amulree (25 July 1900 ‚Äì 15 December 1983) was a British physician and leading advocate of geriatric medicine in the United Kingdom.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily, and contains an intracellular death domain. This receptor can be activated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TNFSF10/TRAIL/APO-2L), and transduces apoptosis signal. Mice have a homologous gene, tnfrsf10b, that has been essential in the elucidation of the function of this gene in humans.

History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County of the Territory of Kansas (now in the State of Colorado). This discovery precipitating the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. To provide local government for the gold mining region, the Kansas Territorial Legislature split Arapahoe County into six counties on February 7, 1859: a much smaller Arapahoe County, Broderick County, El Paso County, Fremont County, Montana County, and Oro County. None of these six counties were ever organized. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the territorial government, and they formed their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. Following the Republican Party election victories in 1860, the United States Congress admitted Kansas to the Union. The Kansas Act of Admission excluded the portion of the Kansas Territory west of the 25th meridian west from Washington from the new state, and El Paso County and the rest of this region reverted to unorganized territory. On February 28, 1861, the Colorado Territory was organized to govern this unorganized territory and adjacent areas of the New Mexico Territory, the Utah Territory, and the Nebraska Territory. The new Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties on November 1, 1861, including a new El Paso County for the Colorado Territory.

There are four types of critical systems: safety critical, mission critical, business critical and security critical. General description For such systems, trusted methods and techniques must be used for development. Consequently, critical systems are usually developed using well-tested techniques rather than newer techniques that have not been subject to extensive practical experience. Developers of critical systems are naturally conservative, preferring to use older techniques whose strengths and weaknesses are understood, rather than new techniques which may appear to be better, but whose long-term problems are unknown. Expensive software engineering techniques that are not cost-effective for non-critical systems may sometimes be used for critical systems development. For example, formal mathematical methods of software development have been successfully used for safety and security critical systems. One reason why these formal methods are used is that it helps reduce the amount of testing required. For critical systems, the costs of verification and validation are usually very high‚Äîmore than 50% of the total system development costs. Classification A critical system is distinguished by the consequences associated with system or function failure. Likewise, critical systems are further distinguished between fail-operational and fail safe systems, according to the tolerance they must exhibit to failures: * Fail-operational ‚Äî typically required to operate not only in nominal conditions (expected), but also in degraded situations when some parts are not working properly. For example, airplanes are fail-operational because they must be able to fly even if some components fail. * Fail-safe ‚Äî must safely shut down in case of single or multiple failures. Trains are fail-safe systems because stopping a train is typically sufficient to put into safe state. Safety critical Safety critical systems deal with scenarios that may lead to loss of life, serious personal injury, or damage to the natural environment. Examples of safety-critical systems are a control system for a chemical manufacturing plant, aircraft, the controller of an unmanned train metro system, a controller of a nuclear plant, etc. Mission critical Mission critical systems are made to avoid inability to complete the overall system, project objectives or one of the goals for which the system was designed. Examples of mission-critical systems are a navigational system for a spacecraft, software controlling a baggage handling system of an airport, etc. Business critical Business critical systems are programmed to avoid significant tangible or intangible economic costs; e.g., loss of business or damage to reputation. This is often due to the interruption of service caused by the system being unusable. Examples of a business-critical systems are the customer accounting system in a bank, stock-trading system, ERP system of a company, Internet search engine, etc. Security critical Security critical systems deal with the loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss.

History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County of Kansas Territory (now in Colorado), precipitating the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. To provide local government for the gold mining region, the Territorial Legislature split Arapahoe County into six counties on February 7, 1859: a much smaller Arapahoe County, Broderick County, El Paso County, Fremont County, Montana County, and Oro County. Fremont County was named in honor of soldier, explorer, and politician John Charles Fr√©mont. None of these six counties were ever organized. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the territorial government, and they formed their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. Following the Republican Party election victories in 1860, the United States Congress admitted Kansas to the Union. The Kansas Act of Admission excluded the portion of the Kansas Territory west of the 25th meridian west from Washington from the new state, and Fremont County and the rest of this region reverted to unorganized territory. On February 28, 1861, the Colorado Territory was organized to govern this unorganized territory and adjacent areas of the New Mexico, Utah, and Nebraska Territories. The new Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties on November 1, 1861, including a new Fremont County.

Kratos, also known as the \\"Ghost of Sparta\\", first appeared in the 2005 video game God of War, which led to the development of seven additional games featuring the character as the protagonist. Kratos also appears as the protagonist of the 2010 and 2018 comic series, as well as the franchise's three novels that retell the events of three of the games. The character was voiced by Terrence C. Carson from 2005 to 2013, with Christopher Judge taking over the role in 2018's continuation, also titled God of War. Antony Del Rio voiced the character as a child in God of War: Ghost of Sparta. Throughout the Greek era of the series, Kratos embarks on several adventures in attempts to avert disaster or to change his fate, though primarily to seek revenge on the Greek Gods, towards whom he harbors intense hate, due to their roles in his suffering. He is usually portrayed as being oblivious to all else and is stoic, bloodthirsty and arrogant in nature. He often engages in morally ambiguous activities and performs acts of extreme violence. Once a respected Spartan warrior, he became the \\"Ghost of Sparta\\" after accidentally killing his family due to Ares' trickery. He later avenges the deaths of his family and becomes the God of War after killing Ares. Kratos is eventually revealed to be a demigod and the son of Zeus, who later betrays him. Vengeance is a central theme of the Greek era, and each installment provides additional information about Kratos' origins and his relationships with his family and the Olympian gods. In the Norse era of the series, Kratos takes a turn for the good and finds himself controlling his rage and learning how to truly be a father and mentor to his new son, Atreus. Along their journey, they combat monsters and gods of the Norse realm, of whom they make enemies. The God of War franchise is a flagship title for the PlayStation brand and Kratos is one of its most popular characters. The character has been well received by critics and has become a video game icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as Mario, Link, Sonic the Hedgehog and Master Chief. The character is now associated with other products and has had various cameos in PlayStation games outside of the God of War series. Concept and design In designing Kratos, God of War (2005) creator and game director David Jaffe attempted to create a character that looked brutal, but did not resemble a typical traditional Greek hero. The character would not wear traditional armor as Jaffe wanted him to be individualistic. Although the idea of using a fully masked character was approved, the concept was abandoned as the design seemed soulless and lacked a defined personality. Some models included unconventional elements, such as portraying him carrying an infant on his back, while others had excessive detail, such as hair and other \\"flowing things\\". Early concept art by Kratos' original designer/creator Charlie Wen, depicting unused variations of Kratos (although the variations were later used in God of War III as bonus costumes). Charlie Wen, director of visual development on God of War (2005) and God of War II, was responsible for designing Kratos. Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture, which led him to conceive Kratos on a series of napkins at a restaurant, having forgotten his sketchbook, introducing the idea of the double-chained blades and eventually Kratos' iconic design. Double-chained blades were chosen as Kratos' signature weapon because they emphasized the character's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid. Wen visualized the double-chained blades activating simultaneously as Kratos threw them with a balance of ferocity and accuracy. Jaffe said of the final version of the character, \\"[Kratos] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head.\\"' Wen gave Kratos his most noticeable feature, his ash-white complexion, a story development that earns him the title \\"Ghost of Sparta.\\" Other distinctive features include a scar across his right eye, and a large, red tattoo that threads from his left eye, circles his left torso, and ends at his left shoulder. The tattoo was originally blue, but was changed late in production. In the series lore, the scar is eventually revealed to be the result of a childhood encounter with the Olympian God, Ares, while the tattoo is a tribute to his dead brother Deimos, who had similar birth markings. Other changes that occur during the course of the Greek era of the series include the temporary addition of divine armor when Kratos is the God of War, an abdominal scar, ability-enhancing armor such as an epaulet called the Golden Fleece (all God of War II), and the Boots of Hermes (God of War III). According to an early God of War script, the character is tall. In 2018's God of War, the designers gave Kratos a more Nordic look, including a full beard. They also changed his main weapon to a magical battle axe to make the combat more grounded. Unlike previous games, players can change and upgrade Kratos' three different armor pieces, one of the game's various RPG elements. Kratos' appearance throughout the Greek games can be altered in bonus play; completing the game at certain levels of difficulty and in challenge modes unlock bonus costumes. Several costumes were available exclusively via pre-order and other promotions (e.g. God of War III, which features three costumes based on early sketches of the character) from the PlayStation Store. Although many bonus costumes are consistent with story themes, others are humorous or farcical‚Äîsuch as the female costume \\"Athena\\" and the \\"Spud of War\\". The character was given his name at a late stage in the development of the original game after the character had already been fleshed out. Unaware of the actual mythological god named Kratos appearing in Prometheus Bound, the creators coincidentally chose Kratos, the same Greek word meaning \\"Strength\\", of which the mythological figure is the personification. Stig Asmussen, who worked on the first two games and was game director of God of War III, called the naming coincidence a \\"happy mistake\\", noting that the Kratos in the game and the one in Prometheus Bound are both \\"pawns\\". Zoran Iovanovici of California State University, Long Beach observed with irony that, while the mythological Kratos is best known for chaining Prometheus, in God of War II, the video game character releases him. Classical scholar Sylwia Chmielewski states that the video game character Kratos draws extensively on other figures from Greek mythology, including the heroes Perseus, Theseus, and Achilles, but his strongest influence is the hero Heracles (Roman Hercules), who appears in God of War III with the Romanized name and is the character's half-brother. For 2018's God of War, game director Cory Barlog explained that Kratos had to change his cycle of violence and learn how to control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son is at the heart of the game and Barlog said \\"This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again.\\" Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, \\"We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of Banner now.\\" Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaced T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War. Commenting in response to the change, Carson said, \\"Sony went in a new direction.\\" Role in the God of War series Kratos (left) and Deimos (right) as boys in a flashback scene from God of War: Ghost of Sparta. Backstory and comics (past) Throughout the series, Kratos is portrayed as an antihero, often performing questionable actions. Although backstory is seen in the original God of War, Kratos' childhood is revealed in Ghost of Sparta and the birth of his daughter is explored in the God of War comic series (2010-11). In Ghost of Sparta, it is revealed that the oracle had foretold that the demise of Olympus would not happen by the hands of the Titans‚Äîimprisoned after the Great War‚Äîbut rather by a mortal, a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus, Athena, and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, Kratos' younger brother, who had strange birthmarks. Ares and Athena interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos in Sparta and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but Ares swept him aside and scarred him across his right eye. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured for many years by the god of death, Thanatos. Believing Deimos to be dead, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark, to honor his sibling. Through flashbacks in the comic series (2010‚Äì11) written by Marv Wolfman, Kratos meets his wife Lysandra and they have a daughter named Calliope. Upon birth, Calliope was stricken with the plague. In order to save his daughter, Kratos was granted a quest to find the Ambrosia of Asclepius, an elixir with magical healing properties. Five of the gods entered into a wager with Ares: each chose a champion to search for the Ambrosia with Ares' champion being Kratos. Kratos overcame all obstacles, including, among others, Hades' champion, the Barbarian Prince Alrik who eventually became the Barbarian King, and thus Kratos saved his daughter. Via flashbacks in God of War, it is revealed that Kratos became the youngest captain of Sparta's army (also shown in the 2010-11 comic series), but had a thirst for power. When Kratos was faced with total defeat at the hands of a barbarian horde led by the Barbarian King, the Spartan called to the Olympian god Ares for aid. Kratos was given the Blades of Chaos, destroyed his enemies, and blindly followed Ares, killing hundreds in his name. After Ares tricked Kratos into murdering his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope in a temple dedicated to Athena, the Spartan was shocked out of his bloodlust and renounced service to Ares. As the temple burned, a village oracle cursed Kratos and condemned him to wear the \\"mark of his terrible deed\\"; the ashes of his family, which turn his skin white, earning him the title \\"Ghost of Sparta\\". Ascension, Chains of Olympus, and God of War (2005) In Ascension, it is revealed that because Kratos renounced Ares, it broke his blood oath to the god, and as such, Kratos was imprisoned and tortured by the three Furies. He was helped by the oath keeper Orkos and eventually overcame and killed the Furies. In order to completely be free of Ares' oath, Kratos was forced to kill Orkos, who begged Kratos to do so. Although free of his oath to the god, he was flooded with memories of killing his family. He then vowed to serve the other gods in order to receive forgiveness and relief from the nightmares of his past deeds, but he was openly defiant. In Chains of Olympus, Kratos was reluctant to help the gods when Helios was kidnapped, and openly abandoned them when Persephone offered him a chance to be reunited with his daughter. Kratos, however, was forced to reverse his decision when Persephone used the Titan Atlas in a bid to destroy the world and in turn, the spirit of Calliope. Knowing that while intervention would save Calliope, it would separate him from his family forever, a bitter Kratos killed Persephone, imprisoned Atlas, and freed Helios. By the time of God of War, Kratos had been serving the gods for ten years and had grown tired of his service and nightmares. When he confronted his patron Athena, she advised him that if he killed the rampaging Ares, the gods would forgive his sins. With this selfish motive, he again agreed, and after finding and using Pandora's Box, he was successful. Despite being freed of Ares' influence, including the Blades of Chaos, Kratos was forgiven but was not relieved of his nightmares. A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos tried to commit suicide but was saved by Athena, who guided him to Olympus. Awarded the Blades of Athena, Kratos became the new God of War. Comics (present), Ghost of Sparta, and Betrayal The comic series (2010‚Äì11) also shows Kratos' present search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius. This time, he plans to destroy the Ambrosia to prevent the worshipers of Ares from resurrecting their former master. In this quest, Kratos overcame several enemies, including the Chaos Giant Gyges, before destroying the Ambrosia. Still haunted by the visions of his mortal past in Ghost of Sparta, and against the advice of Athena, Kratos embarked on a quest to find his mother, Callisto, in the city of Atlantis. Callisto attempted to reveal the identity of Kratos' father before being transformed against her will into a beast that Kratos was forced to kill. Before dying, Callisto advised Kratos to search for his brother Deimos in Sparta. Kratos first freed the Titan Thera from imprisonment, which caused the destruction of Atlantis. In Sparta, Kratos learned of Deimos' location: the Domain of Death. He found and freed Deimos, who remained hostile toward his brother. After a skirmish between the siblings, Thanatos attacked Deimos, but after being rescued by Kratos, the pair joined forces to battle their foe. At this point, Thanatos realizes Ares, Athena, and Zeus chose the wrong Spartan; it was Kratos who should have been taken, the \\"mark\\" being his red tattoo. Although Thanatos killed Deimos, the god was in turn killed by Kratos. Kratos then returned to Olympus, enraged at the gods. In Betrayal, Kratos had been shunned by the other gods and decided to lead his Spartan army to overrun Greece. He was falsely accused of murdering Argos, and he killed Ceryx, the son of Hermes, for interfering in his search for the true assassin, who escaped. God of War II Kratos' initial appearance in God of War III, and as he appeared throughout most of God of War II, wielding the Blades of Athena, with the Golden Fleece on his right arm. With the exception of a few details, such as the Golden Fleece and abdominal scar, this is largely Kratos' appearance throughout the Greek era of the series. Kratos then joined the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, weakened Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus used to kill Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, who are capable of returning him to the moment of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless‚Äîin the pursuit of his goal, he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus. God of War III Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was abandoned by Gaia when his first encounter with Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, that he needed to find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown. God of War (2018) Many years after the events of God of War III, Kratos, having survived his apparent death from releasing the power of Hope in Greece, ended up in ancient Scandinavia in the Norse realm of Midgard with a young son named Atreus, who is unaware of his true nature. Kratos has abandoned his double-chained blades and uses a magical battle axe called the Leviathan Axe that originally belonged to his second wife and Atreus' mother Laufey, who recently passed and whom Kratos called Faye. Her last wish was for her ashes to be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. At Midgard's peak, they learn from M√≠mir that the highest peak is actually in J√∂tunheim. Along their journey, they are confronted by the √Üsir god Baldur, the brother of Thor whose sons Modi and Magni assist their uncle, but are killed by Kratos and Atreus. Around this time, Atreus falls ill. To cure him, Kratos must recover his old weapons, the Blades of Chaos, in order to battle the beings of Helheim as the Leviathan Axe is useless there. While retrieving the blades, Athena appears and goads him about his past. Kratos journeys to Hel and retrieves the cure by killing the troll that guards the realm. After curing him, Kratos reveals to Atreus that he is a god. The pair also receive assistance from a witch, later revealed to be the Vanir god Freya, the mother of Baldur who had cast a spell of immortality on Baldur which protects him, but also causes him to no longer feel anything physically, which he resented her for. Kratos and Baldur eventually battle, during which, Baldur's spell is broken. Kratos decides to let Baldur go, but Baldur attempts to kill Freya, forcing Kratos to kill him. Freya swears revenge against Kratos for killing her son and taunts Kratos for not revealing his troubled past to Atreus. Kratos decides to tell Atreus that he had killed his fellow Greek gods, including his father Zeus (whose illusion he and Atreus saw in Helheim alongside an illusion of a younger Kratos from God of War III showing their final confrontation), but he and Atreus should learn from these experiences and not repeat past mistakes. The two then make their way to J√∂tunheim, where it is learned that Faye was actually a giant, also making Atreus part-giant. It is also revealed that Faye originally wanted to name their son Loki, but Kratos preferred Atreus, which was the name of an honorable Spartan comrade. The giants also referred to Kratos as F√°rbauti. In Midgard, Fimbulwinter began, and after sleeping in the family home, Atreus has a vision that Thor will come for them at the end of Fimbulwinter. Other appearances Guest appearances Kratos has been featured as a playable character in several PlayStation games outside of the God of War series. On August 21, 2008, Kratos was released as a downloadable character in Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds along with his Clubs of Chaos. As a pre-order bonus for LittleBigPlanet from GameStop, customers received a Sackboy Kratos costume along with ones for Medusa and a Minotaur, as well as a God of War level sticker kit. These were later released for purchase on January 26, 2009. Kratos was then a guest character in 2009's Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny, which includes his own story mode. As a pre-order bonus for ModNation Racers from GameStop, customers received a Kratos Mod along with his Kart of Chaos. These were later released for purchase on November 2, 2010. Kratos' next guest appearance was in the PlayStation 3 version of 2011's Mortal Kombat (and the PlayStation Vita version released in 2012), which features his own fighting stage and arcade ladder mode. The character then appeared in the 2012 crossover fighting game, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which includes two God of War inspired stages, several God of War items, as well as series antagonist Zeus, who was released as a downloadable character on March 19, 2013. As part of the God of War franchise's tenth anniversary, Kratos appeared as a secret boss battle in the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita versions of Shovel Knight, released April 21, 2015. His next guest appearance brought him back to the world of LittleBigPlanet in LittleBigPlanet 3 as another Sackboy costume, this time in his Fear Kratos form, along with Sackboy costumes of Zeus, Hercules, Poseidon, and Athena, and a costume of Hades for the character Toggle. The costumes' release coincided with that of God of War III Remastered on PlayStation 4 in July 2015. A costume of Kratos as well as God of War custom decorations were included in the \\"Crafted Edition\\" of Tearaway Unfolded, which released on PlayStation 4 on September 8, 2015. TC Carson provided Kratos' voice in all of his guest appearances, except for LittleBigPlanet, ModNation Racers, LittleBigPlanet 3, and Tearaway Unfolded where the character is only a costume, and in Shovel Knight which only has text dialogue. The character has been parodied twice in The Simpsons franchise. He appeared as the \\"God of Wharf\\" on a billboard advertising a chowder restaurant in The Simpsons Game. He later appeared on the Guts of War II: Entrails of Intestinox kiosk at \\"E4\\"‚Äîa parody of the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)‚Äîin The Simpsons television episode, \\"The Food Wife\\". Kratos has also been parodied by Adult Swim's clay-mation television series, Robot Chicken. He was first parodied in season 5, episode 15, \\"The Core, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\\", where it is shown how far Kratos (voiced by Brian Austin Green) will go to collect blood orbs. Sony later teamed up with Robot Chicken to produce a marketing campaign advertisement for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale that parodied Kratos and other characters from the game. Novels and film Kratos is also the main character in novelizations of the game series by Matthew Stover, Robert E. Vardeman, and James M. Barlog. The novels are a retelling of the games and offer deeper insights into their stories. The first novel was written by Stover and Vardeman together, titled God of War, and was published in May 2010. The second was written solely by Vardeman, titled God of War II, and was published in February 2013. The third novel, titled God of War ‚Äì The Official Novelization, was written by Barlog and released in August 2018. A film adaptation of the original God of War was announced in 2005, but has remained in development hell. In 2010, Jaffe stated that the \\"script went out a year and a half ago to Daniel Craig who plays [James] Bond, but he turned it down.\\" He also said that another actor had since been signed to the role of Kratos, and that \\"this new person is pretty good, if that ends up true.\\" The film's new writers, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, were announced in July 2012, and in August 2012; the writers stated that they plan to humanize Kratos and explore his past. Since March 26, 2013, there have been no further updates about this adaptation, but following the release of 2018's God of War, rumors about a potential adaptation of that game began circulating. Pacific Rim: Uprisings (2018) director Steven S. DeKnight stated he would like to direct an adaptation of that game and talked with Sony about making it R-rated. As a big fan of the series, DeKnight said he wants to see the franchise adapted and wants Dave Bautista for the role of Kratos. Cultural impact Kratos cosplay at the 2018 New York Comic Con Merchandise and promotion Kratos statue included in the God of War: Ascension‚ÄîCollector's Edition. Two series of action figures based on God of War II have been produced by the National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA). The first set included two versions of Kratos; one wielding the Blades of Athena, and the second wearing the Golden Fleece and holding a Gorgon's head. The second set included a twelve-inch figure that plays six game quotes. A second two-figure set was also released, with Kratos wearing the God of War armor. In October 2009, United Cutlery created a scaled replica of Kratos' Blades of Chaos, which included a custom display stand with the God of War logo. Kratos was also featured in a line of action figures released by DC Unlimited and based on God of War III, which included the characters Zeus, Hades, and Hercules. Between February 1, 2010 and March 31, 2010, 7-Eleven sold a limited-edition Slurpee drink called \\"Kratos Fury\\", in addition to four exclusive God of War III cups, which featured codes that could be used to access God of War III and Slurpee-themed downloadable content on the Slurpee website. Kratos' visage has appeared on the PlayStation Portable Chains of Olympus exclusive bundle pack, and on the PlayStation 3 God of War III sweepstakes prize video game consoles. A limited-edition figurine of Kratos was the grand prize of a sweepstakes in a promotion for God of War Collection in November 2009. A figure of Kratos was included in the God of War: Ascension‚ÄîCollector's Edition. In June 2014, a Kratos Pop! Vinyl Figure was released. The same year, Sony partnered with Gaming Heads to produce a limited-edition (500 units) life-size bust of Kratos. It is tall and sits upon a Greek-inspired column. A \\"Fear Kratos\\" version of the bust was also produced (100 units) that year, based on the Fear Kratos costume from God of War III. In 2015, Sony again partnered with Gaming Heads to produce a limited-edition (1,250 units) lunging Kratos statue. The statue is tall and features Kratos wielding the Blades of Exile. For the God of War franchise's tenth anniversary (March 2015), Gaming Heads produced two limited-edition \\"Kratos on the Throne\\" statues, depicting the final scene of the original God of War. Both statues are tall and the Regular Edition (1,250 units) features Kratos in his normal attire and the Exclusive Edition (500 units) features Kratos in his God of War armor. In November 2015, Sony announced a new Kratos statue to be released the following month, which was also in celebration of God of Wars ten-year anniversary. The limited edition (500 units) statue made of polystone was designed by Santa Monica and stands over tall with details such as leather, cloth, and metal pieces. Reception Kratos' character has received a positive response from video game publications. GameSpot regarded Kratos as a \\"sympathetic antihero\\" and a \\"badass\\", and described him as endearing due to his unforgiving demeanor, but added that the slowly-developing story offered players \\"no understanding [of him]\\" in the game's early stages. IGN said he was ruthless, merciless and savage, noting the character's main motive is vengeance and \\"all he desires is murder.\\" IGN also stated that in time the player would begin to \\"love and loathe Kratos and hate Ares.\\" GamePro said it was \\"Kratos' tragic fall and brutal ascension to the peaks of Mount Olympus that made the original God of War so memorable.\\" PlayStation Universe said he was \\"certainly a unique character and a warrior to be reckoned with,\\" and that \\"this iconic PlayStation anti-hero will surely not be forgotten.\\" Critics acclaimed Kratos' portrayal in God of War (2018), with many complimenting his more layered and relatable personality compared to previous incarnations. Forbes wrote how \\"Kratos is a character this time\\", calling him \\"fleshed-out\\" and \\"surprisingly engaging\\", while IGN felt that the game \\"transforms him from the previous games' flat embodiment of the bloodthirsty warrior cliche into someone who can stand shoulder to shoulder with some of my favorite protagonists in recent media\\". Similarly, Red Bull stated that \\"This God of War reflects a new, more nuanced Kratos in that it‚Äôs measured, deep and as mentioned earlier, complex.\\" Engadget, though admitting it was an exaggeration, wrote how \\"Kratos is more nuanced and shows more emotion in the game's opening hour than he did in the entire previous trilogy\\". He was ranked as one of the best video game characters of the 2010s by Polygon staff and writer Colin Campbell, particularly his appearance and \\"In 2018‚Äôs God of War, he retains his skills as a warrior, but is now a father whose gruff, tough- love approach to parenting belies a touching capacity for love and tenderness toward his son, and a deep grief for his late wife.\\" WhatCulture ranked Kratos as the 20th sexiest male video game character of all time. Christopher Judge's performance as Kratos in the 2018 God of War was met with acclaim. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, Kratos was nominated for \\"Character of the Year\\" and awarded the \\"Biggest Badass\\" award. He was included in GameSpot's \\"All Time Greatest Video Game Hero\\" contest and reached the \\"Elite Eight\\" round before losing to Mario. The 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition lists Kratos as the ninth most popular video game character. In 2011, Empire ranked him as the 15th-greatest video game character. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked Kratos, \\"one of PlayStation‚Äôs most popular representatives,\\" as the eighteenth-\\"most memorable, influential, and badass\\" protagonist in games: \\"Being insanely violent isn‚Äôt exactly an uncommon trait amongst game characters, but driven by a rage wrought from his guilt (slaughtered thousands, including‚Äîoops‚Äîhis wife and daughter) Kratos kills with such convincing visceral aggression it elevates him way beyond the status of brain-dead murder-bot.\\" In 2010, Game Guru said that \\"practically anyone, even if they hadn't played any of the God of War games, would know about Kratos.\\" Kratos has been included on several top video game character lists: GamesRadar listed him as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that while he appears at first to be a generic character, players eventually learn that he is both an \\"unstoppable force of nature\\" and a \\"broken, tragic man\\". Knowing of the talks regarding a God of War film, both IGN and UGO Networks listed Kratos as a character who deserved his own movie. In 2008, IGN listed him as one of the characters wanted for an \\"ultimate fighting\\" game, featuring characters from all consoles and all eras of gaming. He was included on the list of the best anti-heroes by IGN in 2012. In 2011, Complex listed several of his finishing moves in their fifty \\"craziest fatalities in video games\\" list at 30th, 28th, 24th, 14th, and number-one spots for his finishing moves on Hades, Hercules, Helios, the Hydra, and Poseidon, respectively. The \\"Dairy Bastard\\" alternate costume from the original God of War was included in UGO's list of the \\"most stylin' alternate costumes\\". GameFront listed Kratos in 2011 as one of the top five video game characters with the \\"biggest daddy issues\\". Complex ranked him as having the best fighting game cameos for his guest appearances in Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny and Mortal Kombat in 2012 and as the sixth \\"most badass\\" video game character of all time in 2013. Kratos' Blades of Chaos were included on GameSpot's \\"15 Most Badass Swords in Video Game History\\" list. On the other hand, Kratos' character has also been given criticism. Prince of Persia producer Ben Mattes said in an interview that he considers Kratos \\"a supercool character, but it's black and white; his personality is pure rage, his dialogue is pure rage, his character design is pure rage‚Äîit's kind of easy.\\"As quoted in Gary Steinman's \\"Prince of Persia: Anatomy of a Prince,\\" PlayStation: The Official Magazine 13 (December 2008): 50. Jeremy \\"Norm\\" Scott, creator of the comic strip Hsu and Chan, stated in Electronic Gaming Monthly that Kratos was average and \\"did not exist, except as an avatar for the player.\\" In 2009, IGN listed Kratos as the sixth-most overrated video game character. Cheat Code Central also listed Kratos as the sixth-most overrated video game character in a 2011 top-ten list. The portrayal of Kratos in 2018's God of War was received favorably by the industry, with new voice actor Christopher Judge earning a BAFTA Award for Performer at the 15th British Academy Games Awards. He was also nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards 2018. Nick Plessas of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) said the story's most memorable moments were the interactions between Kratos and Atreus.

It is the 55th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot Wealthy Ajax Bullion (Emory Parnell) is up in arms when his eccentric wife (Lelah Tyler) who's over come with joy informs him that she wants to adopt a refugee, the latest socio-political movement. To top it off, he has a terrible toothache. His wife insists he goes to the dentist so she can prepare the nursery. The Stooges are window washers who work on a scaffold outside of a tall building. Moe and Larry use a rope to pull a Curly back up to the scaffold. Moe then orders Curly to continue the job. He obliges but throws a bucket of water at an open window, and the water splashes all over the dentist's office. At nearly the same time, the dentist (Richard Fiske) arrives to see the mess. He then leaves after threatening to have them fired. It is then that Moe orders Larry and Curly to dry up the floor. Mr. Bullion meets the inept window washers (whom he mistakes for interim dentists) when he enters the office demanding medical attention. They knock him out cold when he asks for anesthetic, then attempt to find the bad tooth. After pulling his bridge-work out completely (\\"you stripped his gears!\\", Larry comments), they try to put it back into his mouth with cement. However, the cement hardens before they have a chance to put the tooth back in, so they decide to blast. The dentist arrives back in his office as the dynamite is lit. He calls out to the Stooges, who notice him and run off. The dynamite goes off and Mr. Bullion wakes up, noticing that the pain in his tooth is gone. He heads back to his car and notices the Stooges hiding inside. He inquires as to what they are up to, and Moe says that they are \\"refugees.\\" Mr. Bullion then has a very nasty idea to disabuse his wife of her philanthropic notion: pass these three nitwits off as refugee children. Mrs. Bullion is naturally thrilled at the sight of the Stooges, who are dressed as toddlers. Moe and Curly are in large sailor suits, while Larry is dressed as a young girl in a dress with a large hair bow. Mr. Bullion calls them Johnny (Moe), Frankie (Curly), and Mabel (Larry). The Stooges then stay with the Bullions until Mrs. Bullion decides to have a party to introduce her wealthy friends to her new refugees. Mrs. Bullion ends up regretting their adoption during the party in their honor ‚Äî and Mr. Bullion is beginning to regret concocting this scheme to begin with. The festivities are interrupted when an angered Mr. Bullion chases after the Stooges with an axe. Production notes All the World's a Stooge was the last short to be filmed in 1940.

After the death of Martin Vahl in 1804, the task of publishing the Flora Danica was given to Hornemann, who subsequently issued fasc. 22-39 (1801‚Äì1840) with a total of 1080 plates. J.W. Hornemann was professor of botany at the University of Copenhagen from 1808 and director of the Botanic Garden (from 1817). In 1815, he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1816, his status was changed to that of foreign member.  Honours  Several plant genera have been named in his honour, however for reasons of taxonomy and nomenclature all names are today synonyms. Hornemannia Willd. (1809), once placed in Scrophulariaceae, contained on two species, both of which are now referred to other genera (one to the genus Mazus Lour. (1790) and the other to Lindernia All. (1766)). This fact prohibits the use of the names Hornemannia Vahl (1810) for the Caribbean genus of Ericaceae (now to be called Symphysia C.B. Presl (1827)) and Hornemannia Benth.

History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County of the Territory of Kansas (now in the State of Colorado). This discovery precipitating the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. To provide local government for the gold mining region, the Kansas Territorial Legislature split Arapahoe County into six counties on 1859-02-07: a much smaller Arapahoe County, Broderick County, El Paso County, Fremont County, Montana County, and Oro County. Montana County was named for the Spanish language name for the Front Range. Montana County included the fledgling gold camps of Denver City, Golden City, and Central City. None of these six counties were ever organized. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the territorial government, and they formed their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. Following the Republican Party election victories in 1860, the United States Congress admitted Kansas to the Union. The Kansas Act of Admission excluded the portion of the Kansas Territory west of the 25th meridian west from Washington from the new state, and Montana County and the rest of this region reverted to unorganized territory. On February 28, 1861, the Territory of Colorado was organized to govern this unorganized territory and adjacent areas of the Territory of New Mexico, the Territory of Utah, and the Territory of Nebraska.

Pelican cases meet standards for waterproofing, stacking, impact, and durability including MIL-STD C4150-J for waterproofing, IEC IP67 rating indicating complete sealing against dust and water immersion to 1 metre, as well as ATA 300 rating indicating compliance with Air Transport Association standards for durability in shipping. Pelican cases feature a lifetime guarantee. In Europe, they are sold as Peli cases. If the case falls into water, generally there will be enough air in the case to keep it afloat. The barometric relief valve permits air to pass through, but not water or other liquids. Under some extreme conditions leakage is technically possible, but such conditions are unlikely to be encountered, except in the case of deliberate vandalism. Pelican Products also manufactures customized rotationally molded cases built for specialized sensitive equipment protection. The cases can be modified with features including internal shock- mount systems, manual pressure relief valves, humidity indicators, custom foam, and fabricated metal framing for electronics. Pelican Products also runs a series of Advanced Case Centers in California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Canada, France, United Kingdom, and Australia that handle customization and design work for their cases.

The purpose of the puncture is to restore a person‚Äôs ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed. This involves creation of a fistula between trachea and oesophagus, puncturing the short segment of tissue or ‚Äúcommon wall‚Äù that typically separates these two structures. A voice prosthesis is inserted into this puncture. The prosthesis keeps food out of the trachea but lets air into the esophagus for oesophageal speech. A laryngectomized person is required to breathe through a permanent breathing hole in the neck, called a tracheostoma. When a laryngectomized person occludes the tracheostoma, completely blocking exhaled air to leave the body through that pathway, exhaled air is directed through the voice prosthesis. This air enters the esophagus and escapes through the mouth. During this process, as the air passes through the upper tissues of the esophagus and lower throat, it allows for vibration of the tissues of the pharyngoesophageal segment (also called PE-segment, neoglottis or pseudoglottis). This vibration creates a sound that serves to replace the sound the vocal cords previously produced. Other methods of alaryngeal speech (speech without vocal cords) are esophageal speech, and artificial larynx speech. Studies show that tracheoesophageal speech is found to be closer to normal speech than esophageal speech and is often reported to be better, both in terms of naturalness as well as how well it is understood, when compared to esophageal speech and electrolarynx speech. The first report on a tracheoesophageal puncture dates back to 1932 when a laryngectomized patient was said to use a hot ice pick to create a tracheoesophageal puncture in himself. This enabled him to speak by forcing air through the puncture when closing off the tracheostoma with a finger. Puncture procedures There are two tracheo-esophageal puncture procedure types: Primary and secondary puncture. Initially, the procedure was described as a secondary procedure and later also as a primary procedure. Primary tracheoesophageal puncture This procedure is performed during the total laryngectomy surgery. After removal of the larynx and creation of the tracheostoma, the puncture is made through the back wall of the trachea into the front wall of the esophagus. The main advantages of a primary puncture are: 1) that a second surgery to create the puncture is avoided (including the related costs and risks) and: 2) that the patient will be able to speak within a few weeks after total laryngectomy. There are cases where a primary procedure cannot be performed. For example, this procedure cannot be used when there is complete separation of the tracheoesophageal wall where the puncture would otherwise be placed (for example, in case a portion of the esophagus is removed requiring an anastomosis, or ‚Äúreconnection‚Äù of structures in the region). In that case, a sufficient period of recovery and wound healing would be required. A secondary puncture could then be placed. Secondary tracheoesophageal puncture This procedure refers to a puncture that is placed anytime after the total laryngectomy surgery. The decision to use a primary or secondary puncture can vary greatly. Secondary puncture can be performed when: 1) primary puncture was not possible, 2) for re-puncture after closure of a previous tracheoesophageal puncture, 3) because of physician or patient preference, and 4) in case failure of esophageal or electrolarynx speech if this was chosen as the initial speech option. Placement of the voice prosthesis There are two different methods that can be used to place the voice prosthesis: Primary placement: A voice prosthesis is placed into the puncture immediately after it is created. During the immediate postoperative period, the patient is fed through a feeding tube, either inserted directly into the stomach or through a more temporary version than extends from the nose into the stomach. This tube is removed when the patient is able to eat enough by mouth to maintain nutritional needs; this can be as early as the second day following surgery. Speech production with the voice prosthesis is initiated when the surgical area has healed, after clearance by the surgeon. The advantages of this method are: 1) the voice prosthesis stabilizes the TE wall, 2) the flanges of the device protect the puncture against leakage of fluids, stomach acids and other stomach contents, 3) there is no irritation or pressure from a stenting catheter, used to maintain the puncture opening until a voice prosthesis can be placed, 4) patients become quickly familiar with their prosthesis care as they receive instructions while hospitalized, 5) the patient will not have to undergo an outpatient procedure during which the voice prosthesis needs to be fitted, 6) many patients can learn to speak before the start of any post- operative radiation therapy (if indicated) 7) the patient can focus on voice production immediately, as wound healing allows. Another advantage is that generally, the voice prosthesis placed at the time of surgery lasts relatively long and requires no early frequent replacements. The only disadvantage is that the patient will need to use a feeding tube for a few days. Delayed placement: Instead of the voice prosthesis, a catheter (red rubber, Silastic Foley catheter, Ryle's tube) is introduced through the puncture into esophagus. The tube is sometimes utilized for feeding the patient during the immediate post operative period, or the patient has a standard feeding tube for feeding. The voice prosthesis is placed after the patient is able to eat sufficiently by mouth and speech production is initiated when healing has completed, after clearance by the surgeon. The advantage of this method is that the patient may be fed through the catheter, not requiring standard tube feeding. The primary disadvantage is that the patient will have to undergo an outpatient procedure to have the voice prosthesis placed. Another disadvantage can be the need for more frequent replacements early after fitting of the voice prosthesis due to changes in the length of the puncture. Indications Indications include voice rehabilitation for patients who are undergoing a total laryngectomy (primary puncture) or patients who have had a total laryngectomy in the past (secondary puncture). Contra-indications are mainly related to the use of the voice prosthesis and not the puncture procedure itself. It is important to have healthy tissue at the puncture site. This will help ensure the voice prosthesis is properly supported. Poor tissue condition at the puncture site can be a contra-indication for TE puncture. It is also important that the patient candidacy be taken into account. Patients must be able to understand and manage proper prosthesis maintenance and monitor for complications or device problems. Bleeding disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, poor vision and poor manual dexterity are all factors that may negatively interfere with successful voice restoration using tracheoesophageal techniques and should be discussed further with an appropriate healthcare provider who is knowledgeable in this topic.

He is considered to be the founding father of theatre studies in Germany.Beitrag der Freunde der Staatsbibliothek Berlin E.V. (in German), retrieved on 26 November 2007 Born in Berlin into a Jewish family, Herrmann, having passed his A-levels, in 1884 began studying Germanic Philology and History at the Universities of Freiburg, G√∂ttingen and Berlin. In 1891 he became Privatdozent for Germanic Philology at the University of Berlin and in 1898 he married Helene Schlesinger. In 1900 he gave his first lectures on theatre studies at the Department of Germanic Studies in Berlin. In his interpretation and analysis of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's play Jahrmarktsfest in Plundersweilern he not only included results based on research of the original sources but also the stage history of the play. After having been appointed professor in 1903 he continued working as a free-lance lecturer and contributed to a number of literary societies, such as the Society for Theatre Studies. In 1914 he published his most renowned work \\"Research on the History of German Theatre in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance\\" (Forschungen zur deutschen Theatergeschichte des Mittelalters und der Renaissance) in which he further specified his approach. In 1916 he founded the \\"Library of German Private and Manuscript Prints\\" (Bibliothek Deutscher Privat- und Manuskriptdrucke) at Berlin State Library. Herrmann advocated vehemently the emancipation of theatre studies from German Studies. In 1919 he was offered a chair at the University of Berlin. When, in 1923, the Institute of Theatre Studies at Berlin University, world-wide the first of its kind, was founded despite much resistance from the more established disciplines, Herrmann was appointed its head, a function he fulfilled alternately with Julius Petersen. When the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed in April 1933, Max Herrmann was deprived of his professorship by being forced to go into retirement. On 8 September 1942 he and his wife were deported to the concentration camp Theresienstadt where Max Herrmann died in November 1942. Until his deportation Herrmann worked on \\"The Development of the Professional Art of Theatre in Antiquity and Modern Times\\" (Die Entstehung der berufsm√§ssigen Schauspielkunst im Altertum und in der Neuzeit) irrespective of institutionlised harassment which meant, for example, that he was only allowed to read books while standing. The manuscript of the book was preserved by a student of Herrmann's, Ruth M√∂vius, and only published in 1962.

History Moreton has been in existence as long as Thame, being mentioned with it in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the past the main occupation of the inhabitants was farming ‚Äî there being at least seven farms and more than 30 cottages, the majority housing the farm labourers. A decline in agriculture greatly reduced the size of the village and eventually led to the closure of the Methodist chapel, the school and the shop. The bottom of the decline came in the 1950s and today there are about 50 houses and cottages, plus two farms and a smallholding, all family-owned and run. The majority of Moreton‚Äôs older buildings cluster at the east end of the hamlet surrounding the green and the two ponds. They then trail thinly up to the war memorial which was erected in 1920. Beyond the war memorial is a small, but mixed, collection of houses. To car users Moreton only has one road in and the same road out (plus two extremely low-grade but passable back roads, one to the nearby village of Tetsworth and another to the Oxfordshire Golf Resort), but its roads were passable once. Until well into the 18th century, the main thoroughfare from Aylesbury to Tetsworth and Wallingford ran through Moreton, via today's Moreton Lane in Thame. The needlemakers of Long Crendon made use of this road twice a year to send their goods by stagecoach for sale in London. Before that, it was used by the Roundheads, who would have passed through carrying the mortally wounded John Hampden from the Battle of Chalgrove Field to Thame in 1643. Like many villages and towns in Oxfordshire, Moreton was pillaged during the English Civil War. This era is the one that appears to have produced the ‚Äòtroubled spirit‚Äô that haunts Brook Cottage. The various happenings were recorded by Mr. Ron Mott, who was born in the cottage. He remembers his parents occasionally referring to hearing the ‚ÄòOld Man‚Äôs‚Äô rat- tat on the door and heavy footsteps on the brick path outside. Until early in the 20th century Moreton had two public houses: the Bell at one end and the Royal Oak at the other. Both have since closed and are now private houses.

In December 2008, the District reported that 428 pupils or 13.5% were receiving special education services. Palmyra Area School District provides a broad spectrum of special education services. Services and programs available within the District include learning support, speech/language support, secondary life skills support, occupational therapy, physical therapy, vision, adaptive physical education, ESL/LEP, job training, and alternative education programs at the secondary level. The District contracts with Intermediate Unit 13 to provide classes at various schools in Lebanon County to meet the educational needs of students requiring: life skills support, emotional support, sensory support, physical/MDS support, autistic support, basic occupational skills and transition/school-to-work support. Developmental delays are screened for beginning as early as age 3 by IU13 Early Intervention services.Parents request an evaluation for services in writing. The district is required to conduct child find activities for children who may be eligible for services via Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Department of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Palmyra Area School District received a $1,282,613 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 131 or 4.04% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts.

Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across regions. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-14 - 13.0110 mills (county reassessment) *2012-13 - 100.000 mills. *2011-12 - 98.7500 mills. *2010-11 - 95.0500 mills *2009-10 - 91.7500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 95.0500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 84.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 77.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 72.2500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The school board is weighing spending $650,000 to add artificial turf to Buck Swank Athletic Field.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

Wellness policy Palmyra Area School Board established a district student wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246.Palmyra Area School Board, Palmyra Area School Board Policy Manual, 2006 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Palmyra Area District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch.

The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch.

The Villa is reachable by car. Next to the Villa is the lower station of the \\"Rietburgbahn\\", a chairlift, by which the Rietburg can be reached. Architectural history In 1843 King Ludwig I decided to build a summer villa. At that time the Palatinate (from which his father Maximilian I came) belonged to Bavaria. It was to be constructed on the edge of the Haardt hills. In 1845 the necessary parcels of land were bought from the municipalities Edenkoben and Rhodt. The laying of the foundation stone took place in 1846. The Villa was built by Joseph Hoffmann (Ludwigshafen/Rhine) according to plans from architect Friedrich Wilhelm von G√§rtner. In 1847 the architect died: hence Leo von Klenze took care of the site management. The building was finished in 1852. Ludwig I resided every two years in the months July and August in the Villa. He also celebrated his birthday there. His last visit at the Villa is dated 1866. Building The main building consists of four rectangular shaped two-storey buildings which are grouped around an atrium. Classicistic styles are realized.

Justus (560), the brother of Clement, who with Ottaviano are the three patrons of the diocese of Volterra, was at first involved in the Schism of the Three Chapters.Ughelli I, p. 1427, places Justus second in his list of bishops, before Elpidius, and therefore before 496. Leoncini, p. 235, gives Justus the date of 530, and connects his flight from Africa with the persecution of orthodox Christians by Arians. Lanzoni, pp. 559-562. See J. Stilting's critical comments on the chronology, in: See also: In the Carolingian period it belonged to the Marquisate of Tuscany; with the approval of Henry, son of Frederick Barbarossa, the government of it afterwards passed into the hands of the bishop, until his temporal authority was suspended by the commune. In the wars or factions of the 13th century, Volterra, being Ghibelline, was continually embroiled with the Florentines, who captured it in 1254, but obtained definitive possession of it only in 1361. The diocese of Volterra was immediately subject to the Holy See until 1856, when it became a suffragan of Pisa. Diocesan synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.

Telemark Museum is located within walking distance of downtown Skien. Ulefos Manor Porsgrunn City Museum History Telemark Museum is a consolidated museum which included a number of museums within the Telemark area. It was founded in 1909 from a base at the S√∏ndre Brekke farm. The farm is surrounded by Brekkeparken, a park. The main attraction, aside from seasonal exhibits in the main halls of the farm house, is the outdoor museum. Several older houses and farms from the former county of Telemark have been moved from their original location and rebuilt on site in the park. Telemark Museum, the current name since 1998, was previously organized under the name of the County Museum of Telemark and Grenland. It includes the Porcelain Museum (Porselensmuseet), Theodor Kittelsen‚Äôs childhood home (Kittelsenhuset), Henrik Ibsen Museum including his childhood home (Venst√∏p), the Porsgrunn City Museum (Porsgrunn Bymuseum), Porsgrunn Maritime Museum (Sj√∏fartsmuseet Porsgrunn), J√∏nnevald Bus Factory Museum (J√∏nnevald Rutebilanlegg), Ulefos Manor (Ulefos Hovedgaard), plus Bamble Coastal Museum, B√∏ Museum and Brevik City Museum. S√∏ndre Brekke Manor S√∏ndre Brekke Manor is the principal attraction, with the main building from the 18th century located within the park. The building received its final form from the owner cabinet minister, Nils Aall (1769‚Äì1854). The English style landscape park was established 1815. The spacious wings contain a number of special collections. In 1911, three peasant huts were moved to Brekkeparken. It has since developed into a large open-air museum with buildings from the Middle Ages until the 19th century, some with rose-painted interiors. Additional building were added in 1934 and 1958. The latter has fine examples of folk art from Telemark. The indoor museum has a special permanent collection of folk art from all over Telemark. Recently, the museum hosted an exhibit on the life of Vidkun Quisling, generating a lot of publicity. The park also has a restaurant and outdoor cafe with a view of the river and downtown Skien.Quisling exhibit stirs controversy, Aftenposten Venst√∏p main building Henrik Ibsen Museum Henrik Ibsen Museum is on the site of the Venst√∏p farm in Gjerpen, 5 km from the center of Skien. In 1835 the Ibsen family moved out to Venst√∏p and stayed there for 7 years. This is where playwright Henrik Ibsen lived starting when he was 7 until he was 15 years old. The museum mainly focuses on the themes of childhood, adolescence and schooling, and shows how much this period of life actually meant to Ibsen's life and later work. Berg-Krager√∏ Museum Telemark Museum also includes Berg-Krager√∏ Museum, the city museum in Krager√∏. Berg-Krager√∏ Museum was founded in 1928, and received considerable collections. These were stored around town until Henriette Homan (1866‚Äì1943) by testament bestowed her farm Berg to the museum. The farm is situated approximately 4 km from the center of Krager√∏ and has a main building from 1803, surrounded by parks, forests and beach areas, besides residential leaseholder and operations building. The bequest also included contents dating from 1650. The museum was opened to the public during 1955. The new museum building was completed in 1979. The museum also owns the childhood home of artist, Theodor Kittelsen. Ulefos Manor Ulefos Manor was built by Norwegian businessman and minister, Nils Aall, brother of statesman, Jacob Aall. It was the summer residence for the family. The manor house was completed in 1807 after a construction period of approx. 5 years. In addition to the elegant main building, the museum also has a carriage museum with more vehicles and travel gear from the Manor, a restored earth cellar, game room and greenhouse. The main building is surrounded by a large park in English style. Ulefoss Art Society Gallery is located in the outbuilding of the main garden.

It empties into the tidal portion of the Petaluma River. History Two permanent Coast Miwok villages were located on San Antonio Creek: Meleya (southwest of Petaluma, California) and Amayelle. San Antonio Creek is one of many California places named by the early Spanish colonists after Saint Anthony of Padua, a patron of the Franciscan Order. The creek traverses the Rancho Laguna de San Antonio land grant, dated May 6, 1839 and November 25, 1845, given by Governor P√≠o Pico to Bartolom√© Bojorquez in 1845. Course San Antonio Creek springs from the southwest flank of Antonio Mountain in Marin County. Historically, a natural laguna or shallow lake existed at the headwaters of San Antonio Creek, different from the Laguna de San Antonio, which exists to the west at the headwaters of Chileno Creek. The San Antonio Creek headwaters laguna was drained for agricultural purposes sometime between 1860 and 1885. From the headwaters the creek runs north into Chileno Valley. Turning east-southeast, it begins to define the county line. It passes under Chileno Valley Road and Point Reyes-Petaluma Road, then parallels San Antonio Road eastward to U.S. 101. It crosses under U.S. 101 where it was diverted around 1930 to the Schultz Slough and the Petaluma River. This diversion is upstream from its historical connection to the San Antonio Slough just west of Hog Island in the wetlands south of Petaluma, California. The diversion upstream lowered the creek's gradient, contributing to aggradation of sediments in the lower reaches. Ecology San Antonio Creek was historically perennial in its lower reaches and perhaps for most of its length. Up until the mid-1900s, steelhead trout were fairly common in the watershed. Although steelhead were seen in 2000, they appear to be extinct from the watershed. California roach and threespine stickleback, which commonly co-exist with steelhead, are still found. The largest striped bass ((Morone saxatilis)) ever landed with tackle and line was caught in 1912 by Charles R. Bond in San Antonio Creek, weighing and long, according to a photograph in the Marin Rod and Gun Club. A newspaper article in 1909 mentions Charles Bond as catching a striper in the \\"San Antone Slough\\". Bridges The U.S. 101 bridges are each two lanes wide and long. The northbound bridge was built in 1929 and reconstructed in 1979. The southbound bridge was built in 1947. There is also a bridge at San Antonio Road north of U.S. 101; built in 1917, it is a concrete tee beam long. Marshall Petaluma Road crosses the creek on a concrete tee beam built in 1929.

History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County of the Territory of Kansas (now in the State of Colorado). This discovery precipitating the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. To provide local government for the gold mining region, the Kansas Territorial Legislature split Arapahoe County into six counties on February 7, 1859: a much smaller Arapahoe County, Broderick County, El Paso County, Fremont County, Montana County, and Oro County. Oro County was named for the Spanish language name for gold, despite the fact that the county lay to the east of the gold mining region. None of these six counties were ever organized. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the territorial government, and they formed their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. Following the Republican Party election victories in 1860, the United States Congress admitted Kansas to the Union. The Kansas Act of Admission excluded the portion of the Kansas Territory west of the 25th meridian west from Washington from the new state, and Oro County and the rest of this region reverted to unorganized territory. On February 28, 1861, the Territory of Colorado was organized to govern this unorganized territory and adjacent areas of the Territory of New Mexico, the Territory of Utah, and the Territory of Nebraska. The new Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties on November 1, 1861.

The Commandment reads: :Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican. History While popularized by Reagan, \\"The Eleventh Commandment\\" was created by California Republican Party Chairman Gaylord Parkinson. In his 1990 autobiography An American Life, Reagan attributed the rule to Parkinson, explained its origin, and claimed to have followed it:Reagan, Ronald Wilson. An American Life, Simon and Schuster, 1990, p. 150. The goal was to prevent a repetition of the liberal Republican assault on Barry Goldwater, attacks which contributed to Goldwater's defeat in the 1964 presidential election. East Coast Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller labeled Goldwater an \\"extremist\\" for his conservative positions and declared him unfit to hold office. Fellow Republican candidate for Governor George Christopher and California's liberal Republicans were leveling similar attacks on Reagan. Hoping to prevent a split in the Republican Party, Parkinson used the phrase as common ground. Party liberals eventually followed Parkinson's advice. Christopher would lose to Reagan in the Republican primary, and Reagan would go on to defeat incumbent Governor Pat Brown, the father of future California Governor Jerry Brown. Reagan followed this \\"commandment\\" during the first five primaries during the 1976 Republican primary against incumbent Gerald Ford, all of which he lost. He abandoned this approach in the North Carolina Primary and beat Ford 52‚Äì46, regaining momentum and winning a majority of delegates chosen after that date. Former Texas governor John Connally speculated that Reagan's attacks weakened Ford in the general election against his opponent and eventual successor, Jimmy Carter.

Saginaw is classified as a home rule city under the Michigan Home Rule Cities Act which permits cities to exercise \\"home rule\\" powers, among which is the power to frame and adopt its own city charter which serves as the fundamental law of the city, in a manner similar to a constitution for a national or state government. The present charter was adopted in 1935 and took effect on January 6, 1936. Saginaw's City Hall, completed in 1936 built of limestone and Indiana Rock  History  On June 28, 1889, the Michigan Legislature passed Act 455 to consolidate the City of Saginaw and the City of East Saginaw into a new city that also was named the City of Saginaw. The early government was fraught with geographic rivalries due to the forced merger of the two cities. Distrust between both sides led to 21 wards to be created each electing two aldermen to the city council and a mayor to be elected at large for a city with a population of approximately 42,323 at the time. After years of dysfunctional government, the citizens of the city changed the government to have five wards with a single member of the council elected from each ward. Each council person ran a specific department of the city: public works; finance; parks and cemeteries; health and safety; and water and sewer.  Current government  The current government was formed in 1936 in response to allegations of corruption of the heads of each department. In order to resemble a more business like structure, voters in 1935 approved a change to a council-manager form of government in which council members are elected by the people and a mayor is elected by the council from its ranks.  City Council  Pursuant to the city charter, Saginaw is governed by a nine-member elected at-large Council. The term of office for a member of the city council is four years commencing with the first meeting following a regular municipal election. The terms of council members are staggered so that the entire council is not subject to re-election at the same time; alternatively either four or five members are elected in each even-numbered year.  Mayor and mayor pro-tempore  The members of the council select one of its own members to serve as mayor for a two-year term. The mayor is chosen at the first meeting following a regular municipal election and a mayor pro-tempore (usually simply called \\"mayor pro-tem\\") at the same time. The mayor's principal function is to preside at meetings of the city council. The mayor has the prerogative to make some appointments to various boards and commissions, and otherwise serves in a ceremonial role. .  City manager  Actual executive power is vested in a city manager, who is a city employee appointed by the city council. The present city manager is Tim Morales, appointed in October 2013. He had previously served as deputy city manager and CFO under previous manager Darnell Earley, who vacated the position to become emergency financial manager for Flint, Michigan. Earley was selected by the City Council at its June 5, 2006 meeting after serving as interim city manager since September 2005 after the previous officeholder, Cecil Collins, was removed from office by the city council.  Politics   City charter revision  In August 2007, Saginaw voters rejected a proposed Saginaw city charter revision by a 5,761 to 1,082 margin. = Election = Under the provisions of the Home Rule Cities Act, the voters of the city elected a nine- member Charter Revision Commission on November 2, 2004. The commissioners begun their three-year term of office on November 16, 2004. If the body fails to complete its task during this time it will automatically dissolve. This commission has the power to frame a new city charter and submit it for adoption or rejection by the voters. During the campaign for electing the commission, the major issues included the stability of the city manager form of government for the city. Earlier in the same year, city manager Deborah Kimble had been removed from office by the city council under contentious circumstances after having only served for 18 months. Ethnic and Racial division on the city council that led to the office of mayor having been held for eight years by Gary L. Loster, an African-American, followed by Wilmer Jones Ham, also an African-American, for four years fueled a push by the main proponents for charter revision for having the mayor of Saginaw directly elected by the voters rather than the city council. Other prominent issues were a desire to have the council elected by wards rather than from the city at-large and increased efficiency and accountability in city government. Much of the latter issue was prompted by well-publicized reports of mismanagement of money by certain city officials. The leading proponents of charter revision in the election were the father and son duo of Allen C. Schmid and Gregory C. Schmid, both attorneys. = Process = The commission's chairwoman was Susan Carter who previously had served as a member of the city council and mayor pro tempore. A majority of the commission consisted of members who strongly favored a revision of a charter rather than a more conservative process of amending the current charter.Local Saginaw Area News - The Saginaw News - MLive.com At its January 9, 2007 meeting the commission formally adopted a proposed charter. The proposed revision provided for a Mayor elected directly by the voters who would assume a full-time administrative role in city government. The office of city manager would have been retained under the proposed charter but assume a bit of a diminished role. The city council would have been elected from four wards, two from each ward, for four-year terms staggered so that half of the council will be elected at each city election. In addition, a ninth member of the council would have been elected by the city at-large; that member would have served as President of the city council. The compensation to be paid to council members and the mayor would have been substantially increased over the current levels. The proposed charter was submitted to the attorney general of the state of Michigan whose staff reviewed it and found 99 questionable issues with the document including some outright violations of law and released a report on March 2, 2007.Microsoft Word - AG Comments-section changes.doc = Current status = Michigan's governor Jennifer M. Granholm reviewed the proposed charter upon having received a report from the attorney general and returned it to the charter commission with her approval for being submitted to a vote of the city's electors. The proposal to be submitted to the voters is the second version presented for review by the attorney general, the first version was reviewed by the attorney general's staff and given a recommendation to reject.

Under this plan, by the year 2020 all police officers will become fully trained and certified fire fighters and all fire fighters will become fully trained and certified police officers. All police and fire stations in the city will function as dual-purpose public safety stations. The proposal also limits the ability for disciplined or terminated city employees to sue the city. The districts for the election of city council members each stretch across the city from the west to the east city limits containing territory of both the west side and east side. Because of the historical trend of lower voter turnout on the east side, it is argued by some that the districts could limit the representation for east side by ensuring the election of a council consisting of nearly all west side residents. The revised charter proposal would pay the Mayor a full-time salary and the council members would be paid more. The plan has been criticized because of the City's present financial distress. The plan would consolidate the city's operations into seven departments. A controversial provision of the proposed charter is the creation of an office of ombudsman. According to the document, the ombudsman would have broad investigative powers. The review by the attorney general found some powers of the office to be illegal. One such example is the power to compel affidavits from those who aren't city employees. The ombudsman's office was especially criticized by the Police Officers Association of Michigan whose affiliate represents the police officers of the city of Saginaw.Snapper, J: \\"Charter Revise Stumbles\\", page 1A. Saginaw News, March 3, 2007  Budget and finance  A \\"cap\\" on property taxes was imposed in 1978 by means of an amendment to the city charter adopted by the voters, on both the method of imposing the tax and on the total amount that can be collected. Seven electoral attempts to lift the cap have failed, and the cap has forced the city to make its income tax the major source of general fund revenue. The cap, as well as stagnating and declining income tax revenue and cuts by the Michigan legislature to its shared revenue for municipalities, has left Saginaw, like many of Michigan's core cities, in a difficult financial position to provide services and pay for legacy costs such as pensions and retiree health benefits.

Board of Education, that segregation in schools went against constitutional law. Desegregation of U.S. schools was part of the civil rights movement. The events that followed desegregation in Baltimore, were important to the civil rights movement across America. Recent scholarship has identified Baltimore's desegregation as an important precursor to the Greensboro sit-ins. Desegregation efforts Most Baltimore City public schools were not integrated until after the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. However, in 1952, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute was forced to open its advanced college preparatory curriculum to African American students. This course was prestigious and was unusual for a high school at that time. The Institute's \\"A\\" course included calculus, analytical chemistry, electricity, mechanics and surveying; subjects not offered at the black schools in the City at that time. The Institute was a whites-only school, but supported by both white and black tax dollars. Consequently, a group of 16 African American students, along with help and support from their parents, the Baltimore Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), applied for the engineering \\"A\\" course at the Institute. The applications were denied and the students sued. The subsequent trial began on June 16, 1952. The NAACP‚Äôs intentions were to end segregation at the 50-year-old public high school. They argued that the Institute's offerings of specialized engineering courses violated the \\"separate but equal\\" clause because these courses was not offered in high schools for black students. To avoid integration, an out-of-court proposal was made to the Baltimore City school board to start an equivalent \\"A\\" course at the colored Frederick Douglass High School. The hearing on the \\"Douglass\\" plan lasted for hours with Dehuff and others arguing that separate but equal \\"A\\" courses would satisfy constitutional requirements, and NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall arguing that the plan was a gamble and a cost the City should not take. By a vote of 5-3, the board decided that a separate \\"A\\" course would not provide the same educational opportunities for African American students and that starting that fall, African American students could attend the Institute. The vote vindicated the NAACP national strategy of raising the cost of 'separate but equal' schools beyond what taxpayers were willing to pay.Olson, Sherry H. Baltimore: The Building of an American City (1997) p. 368-69. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland. Desegregation after Brown v Board of Education The African American community in Baltimore grew rapidly after desegregation and, as a result, the schools became over-crowded. Because of this, Baltimore decided to district the schools.Crain 1968, p. 74 This meant that if someone did not live in the district of a certain school, they could not attend that school. This was a way for the school system to remain segregated. African Americans and whites still lived in different areas of Baltimore, therefore, African American and white children went to different schools. The Maryland State Department of Education put out a book on the progress of desegregation in 1961. The book has an overall feeling that all is fixed, and that nothing more needs to be done to further the cause of desegregation. This was obviously inaccurate, and displays the hardships that the civil rights movement encountered. The Baltimore school system was accused of intentionally segregating schools through districting. (Crain 1968, 74) Many civil rights leaders protested this, and asked for reform in the system. The reform was slow, and is still being sought after today. By 1968, the tensions between the African American and white citizens in Baltimore were high, and came to a head when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in April 1968. Riots broke out in Baltimore during the weekend of Palm Sunday. African American citizens were frustrated and angry. The 1968 riots were not exclusive to Baltimore. Many American cities had riots after Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. The educational achievement of African American students in Baltimore would continue to lag behind that of their white counterparts, with a report in 1968 showing that the ethnic mix of areas, the influence of private education and the divide between urban and suburban areas affected outcomes.

COUSPP was centred on the Ecumenical Society of Saint Augustine of Canterbury, the Arch-Confraternity of Our Lady of Victories and the Old Holy Catholic Church. It was formally disbanded in October 2010. Reasons for the formation of COUSPP Traditional Catholic Ministry in the United Kingdom is very small in scale compared to the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church. Traditional Catholicism in England has sometimes been associated with disputes between like-minded denominations who often share doctrinal points in common and share a common apostolic succession. Disputes between English-speaking Traditional Catholics have split the movement, been divisive and prevented partnership working. In July 2007 a mutually agreed move towards coordination was initiated between three Traditional Catholic denominations which see themselves as traditional and Orthodoxy to form a coordinating council that would coordinate development and be a forum for joint discussion and debate. The London Agreement The foundation of COUSPP was agreed and formed by Metropolitan bishops Robert McBride and Anthony Earl- Williams. COUSPP's governing document is the London Agreement, compiled by Thomas Bodkin and signed by participants on 31 March 2007. Bishop Robert McBride resigned as Metropolitan of the Ecumenical Society of St. Augustine and his successor is Bishop Martyn Douglas who has taken that Society in a more central Catholic direction with use of the new translation of the Mass. At that point COUSPP was formally dissolved by the desire of the Chapter of the ArchConfraternity of Our Lady of Victories and its Metropolitan, Anthony Earl-Williams. The ArchConfraternity had never regarded itself as \\"Old\\" Catholic, but a part of the worldwide family of traditional Roman Catholics, using only the Tridentine Rite of Mass in both Latin and English.

One of its most distinguished members was General Earle G. Wheeler, who began his military career as a Private in C Company in 1926, and later rose to General (4-star) serving as Chief of Staff of the Army and later as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The 121st was mobilized into Federal service in 1940 as part of the 29th Infantry Division, made up of units from Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The 121st staged at Fort Meade, Maryland for movement to England. At the same time, the 37th Infantry Division from the Ohio National Guard, was staging at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania. The 37th has also been alerted for movement to England, and had sent its 112th Engineer Combat Battalion ahead as part of the advance party. Orders were changed and the 37th was diverted for service in the Pacific Theater. There was no time to recall the 112th, or to create and train a new engineer battalion. The War Department ordered all personnel and equipment of the 121st Engineers moved from Fort Meade to Fort Indiantown Gap, and the unit was redesignated the 117th Engineer Combat Battalion. One officer and six enlisted personnel, symbolically representing the 121st Headquarters, each line Company, and the Medical Detachment, remained behind with the organization's colors. The new 117th Engineers shipped out to the Fiji Islands, and saw extensive combat in the Philippines. The men from the DC Guard worked under enemy fire building and repairing 64 bridges, destroying enemy held buildings and tank obstacles, and participating in river crossings with \\"consummate skill and courage.\\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/engineer- battalions-of-the-united-states-army-source- wikipedia/1118104312?ean=9781155740812 When the 29th Division reached England the 112th Engineer Battalion from the 37th Division was redesignated and reconstituted as the 121st Engineers. By the time the 121st saw its first combat, on D-Day at Omaha Beach during the invasion of Normandy, its ranks consisted of the soldiers from Ohio as well as new soldiers from throughout the United States. None of the seven original DC National Guardsmen were with the unit at the time of the invasion. The battalion remained active until May 1945 in operations throughout Europe. The history, lineage and honors of the original 121st continue today in the lineage of the 372d MP Battalion of the District of Columbia Army National Guard. In 1948, a \\"new\\" 121st Engineer Battalion was established in the Maryland Army National Guard. Although the Maryland National Guard unit carries the same name as the World War II unit, the new MDNG unit has no previous history. D-Day landing On 6 June 1944, the 121st Engineer Combat Battalion landed on Omaha beach in Normandy with the first American forces. The company endured much damage to equipment and casualties among the soldiers, but after some recovery it continued to assist in the invasion. For its action during the invasion the 121st was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. After World War II At the end of World War II the 121st Engineer Battalion was deactivated. It was reactivated as part of its original organization, the District of Columbia Army National Guard, as the 163rd Military Police Battalion. Its history, lineage and honors continue today in the DCARNG's 372nd Military Police Battalion. In 1948, a new 121st Engineer Battalion was activated in the Maryland National Guard. This unit carries the designation of the old 121st Engineers, but has no historical link to that organization.http://www.military.com/HomePage/UnitPageHistory/1,13506,104146%7C962198,00.html The new battalion played a pivotal role in the crowd control efforts after being called in to assist the local authorities during the race riots that took place in Baltimore and Cambridge in the 1960s.

A total of 59 units, numbered 1101‚Äì1159, were delivered to the Danish State Railways. Powered by GM-EMD engines, the locomotives represented a significant change in rolling stock policy ‚Äî motive power had largely been sourced from within Denmark for several decades. History In the early 50s the DSB was starting to look for a new type of motive power that could replace steam locomotives in Denmark. MY 1101 was built by NOHAB alone, but all subsequent units had bodies, underbodies and bogies built at Danish manufacturer Frichs in order to limit foreign currency spending. For the same reason, and because of pressure from Danish industry, the electrical systems of MY 1105 and later were sub-supplied by Danish companies Thrige and Titan. The DSB ordered the first four units which arrived at Helsing√∏r in 1954. The locomotives quickly became very popular among both passengers and crew. 44 of them were built between 1954 and 1958 and a further batch of 15 engines was delivered in 1964 and 1965. To replace steam on branch lines, a similar but lighter locomotive, the class MX, was developed, incorporating a 12-cylinder 567 engine. In their early years the locomotives hauled express trains (later known as InterCity) and heavy freight services, but in their later years they were transferred to smaller regional and light freight services. In the 1980s and 90s the DSB began to have less and less need for them, and the last ordinary MY-hauled train ran in 2001. One unit however, 1135, is now a special service locomotive which runs special trains, so DSB still has MY locos in service. The others have either been scrapped or sold to diverse private operators in Norway, Germany and Sweden, who now use them on light freight duties. They are called TMY in Sweden (as diesel locomotives have names beginning with T in Sweden). Many locomotives similar to the MY survive in other countries. They include: * Norwegian State Railways Class Di 3 * Hungarian State Railways Class M61 * Chemins de fer luxembourgeois Class 1600 * National Railway Company of Belgium Class 52‚Äì54 Technical details The first four units, 1101‚Äì1104, were delivered with 1,700-hp EMD 567B engines along with a spare engine. Having a spare engine was later deemed unnecessary and the fifth 567B engine was thus built into MY 1105. 1106‚Äì1144 were delivered with 1,950-hp EMD 567C engines. MY 1145‚Äì1159 were delivered with 1,950-hp EMD 567D1 engines. However, their powerplants were frequently swapped around among the locomotives during maintenance. MY 1149 received a spare 645E engine (as used in class MZ, though with the turbocharger removed) after sustaining severe frost damage in the harsh winter of 1978‚Äì79. DSB Class MV Starting in 1968 weaker MYs with 567B engines (1101, 1102, 1104, 1109, 1134) were reclassified as class MV keeping the same numbers. In 1973, MV 1104 became a MY again while MY 1144 became a MV when their powerplants were swapped. Further two MV locomotives (1101, 1134) were subsequently reclassified as class MY in 1981 and 1984 and the remainder three were taken out of service between 1985 and 1987. Livery The locomotives were delivered in DSB's then-standard maroon colour, with horizontal white stripes along the mid and bottom of the sides and a yellow winged wheel at each front. Starting in 1965, the DIN 1451 typeface was slowly introduced for the lettering, and a few locomotives were given an \\"economy\\" maroon livery without stripes during the 1970s. A new design with black sides and red cabs was introduced by DSB in 1972. The first class MY unit to receive the new livery was MY 1147 in 1972, with the remaining locomotives repainted between 1975 and 1985.

Born and raised in Southern California, his designs are found in locations including Malibu and the Getty Museum. Following service in the US Army during World War II, Gesner is a self-taught architect. His Wave House (1957) was an inspiration for the Sydney Opera House by Danish architect J√∏rn Utzon.Vanity Fair  Military service  Harry Gesner served in three separate branches of the army during World War II. First the 10th light division ski- troop and mountain climbing company. He then transferred to the army air corps and flew the B-26 aircraft bomber. Due to his climbing experience the army moved him to the 1st army 1st division company. He served as a ground troop that stormed Normandy Beach, Omaha. An experienced California surfer harry used duck diving to dodge enemy fire which helped him survive the invasion. His company was the first to group break through Siegfried line. They captured the town of Aachen. Then moved north to Churchmen Forest to fight the initial Battle of the Bulge. Harry was sent out to scout the location. He was injured at the outskirts of Cologne when he was blown though a stone wall from an 88 mm shell shot from a Tiger Tank. He was injured and left alone unconscious in the freezing winter overnight. His company found him the next day. Harry was transported to Paris where medics were prepared to cut off his frozen legs due to gangrene and frostbite. Due to an over flow of injured troops they could not scheduled his surgery. They shipped him to an English hospital. Harry used his knowledge from his time in the ski-troops and requested the nurses bring him ample amounts of olive oil. Harry saved his own legs over many days by using the olive oil as a lubricant. Using his hands, Harry forced blood down to his lower legs where many days later doctors cut the bottom of his feet to find ample blood flow. Then the newly discovered penicillin was used on him to stop the infection.  Architectural career  Following service in the US Army during World War II, Gesner became a self-taught architect. He studied under Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West. Harry Gesner felt his style was too constricting and left the school.  New architectural designs  Gesner's most recent innovative design is the Cocoon House. This revolutionary aerodynamic design was derived from his observations of nature. The designs come from out of the box thinking.

She invented chaff, a radar countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked on the development of the proximity fuse and the electromagnetic isotope separation process for the atomic bomb. In later life she became a founding member of the Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children. Early life Joan Elizabeth Strothers was born on 26 February 1916 in Swansea, Wales, the daughter of an optician, Charles William Strothers, and his wife, Margaret Beatrice, n√©e Millington. She was educated at Swansea Girls' High School, and in 1934 won an open scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge. In 1935, she rowed for the ladies' university eight,NCBC Captain's log book (1935). Newnham College archives. in the first real Women's boat race against Oxford. She gained an honours degree in physics, which was not awarded because it was before women were allowed Cambridge degrees. In her seventies, in 1987, she was honoured with the degree of Doctor of Laws honoris causa by the University of Strathclyde. Strothers, who \\"had the scientific equivalent of gardening green fingers\\", was awarded a government grant to study for a higher degree, and elected to go to the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, where she joined Sam Curran in a team under the direction of Philip Dee. She soon established a reputation for \\"extreme dexterity and being outstandingly neat and skilful in the deployment of equipment.\\" In 1939, Dee proposed that the team spend a month at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airfield. They arrived on 1 September 1939. Two days later, Britain declared war on Germany, and Britain entered the Second World War. Second World War Instead of returning to the Cavendish, the team moved to Exeter, where Dee and three others worked on developing rockets as anti-aircraft weapons, while Strothers and Curran joined a group under John Coles working on the development of the proximity fuse. Strothers was based at Leeson House and Durnford School. She and Curran developed a workable fuse, which was codenamed VT, an acronym of \\"Variable Time fuze\\". The system was a small, short-range, Doppler radar that used a clever circuit. However, Britain lacked the capacity to mass-produce the fuze, so the design was shown to the United States by the Tizard Mission in late 1940. The Americans perfected and mass-produced the fuse. In due course, these proximity fuses arrived in the United Kingdom, where they played an important part in the defence of the kingdom against the V-1 flying bomb. Lancaster dropping chaff (the crescent-shaped white cloud on the left of the picture) over Essen during a thousand-bomber raid Strothers married Curran on 7 November 1940. Soon afterwards they were transferred to the Telecommunications Research Establishment near Swanage, where Sam worked on centimetric radar, while Joan joined the Counter Measures Group in an adjoining lab. It was with this group, at Swanage, and later at Malvern, that Joan devised the technique that was codenamed Window, which is also known as chaff. She tried various types of radar reflectors, including wires and sheets, before settling on strips of tin foil wide and long that could be scattered from bombers, thus disrupting the enemy's radar. Window was first employed in Operation Gomorrah, a series of raids on Hamburg, and resulted in a much lower loss rate than usual. As part of Operation Taxable on 5‚Äì6 June 1944, Window was dropped by Avro Lancasters of 617 Squadron to synthesise a phantom invasion force of ships in the Straits of Dover and keep the Germans unsure as to whether the brunt of the Allied assault would fall on Normandy or in the Pas de Calais area. R. V. Jones later declared: \\"In my opinion, Joan Curran made an even greater contribution to victory, in 1945, than Sam.\\" In early 1944 the Currans were part of a group of British scientists invited to go to the US to take part in the Manhattan Project ‚Äì the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. The mission of the laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic isotope separation process to create enriched uranium for use in atomic bombs. While at Berkeley, Joan gave birth to her first child, a daughter, Sheena, who was born severely mentally handicapped. They later had three sons, all of whom went on to complete a PhD. Later life After the war ended, Sam took up an offer from Dee to become Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University. In Glasgow, the Currans, together with a few friends, set up the Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children (Enable), which eventually grew to 100 branches and more than 5000 members. Later, when Joan was a member of the Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Special Housing Association, the needs of the disabled were always at the forefront of her mind, and she did much to promote their welfare. She took a close interest in the work of the Council for Access for the Disabled and helped improve the range of facilities, especially for disabled university students. Sam worked at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston on the development of the British hydrogen bomb from 1955 to 1959. He returned to Glasgow in 1959 as principal of the Royal College of Science and Technology. When it became the University of Strathclyde in 1964, the first new university in Scotland in 384 years, he became its first Principal and Vice Chancellor. While her husband was Principal, Joan founded the Strathclyde Women's Group and became its president. During the war the Polish 1st Armoured Division had been based in Scotland, establishing ties between the community and Poland. Joan promoted a special relationship with the Technical University of Lodz, and also devoted care and attention to the children's hospital of that city. Later she established the Lady Curran Endowment fund for overseas, particularly Polish, students. Sam died on 25 February 1998. While gravely ill with cancer in 1998, Joan unveiled a memorial plaque in Barony Hall, Glasgow, to commemorate her husband, and it was announced that the walled garden at Ross Priory, on Loch Lomondside, was to be named in her honour, and the Joan Curran Summer House would be built there. Joan died on 10 February 1999, and was cremated at the Daldowie Crematorium. Her daughter, Sheena, three sons and three grandsons survived her.

(25 May 1920 ‚Äì 22 November 2010) was a Spanish Roman Catholic Cardinal, professor of Canon Law and former rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was made Cardinal in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI, though he was over the age of 80 and thus could not vote in a papal conclave. His appointment followed the precedent set by previous Popes for rewarding priests who have made significant contributions to the life and work of the Church. Biography Cardinal Navarrete Cort√©s was born in Camarena de la Sierra, Teruel; his father was Jos√© Navarrete Esteban. He entered the Society of Jesus on 20 June 1937; after his licentiate in philosophy and in theology he obtained a doctorate in canon law. Cardinal Navarrete was ordained to the priesthood on 31 May 1952, during the International Eucharistic Congress. A world-renowned canonist, he then served as Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome until 1980, when he was appointed rector. Cardinal Navarrete was granted an honorary doctorate by the Pontifical University of Salamanca, in his native Spain, in 1994, and was a consultor to the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the Roman Curia. On 17 October 2007, Pope Benedict XVI announced that he would elevate Navarrete and twenty-two other prelates to the College of Cardinals. The Pope honored Navarrete's request to be dispensed from the requirement of episcopal consecration, and, at the consistory in St. Peter's Basilica on 24 November 2007, Navarrete was created Cardinal Deacon of S. Ponziano. Cardinal Navarrete's coat of arms were designed by American ecclesiastical heraldic artist George N. Cannizzaro. Cardinal Navarrete Cort√©s died on 22 November 2010. Pope Benedict XVI sent a telegram of condolence to the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Father Adolfo Nicolas, S.J., lauding the Cardinal for his distinguished contributions to canon law, theology, and philosophy, as well as the academic formation of clergy and laity while serving as Rector of the Gregorian. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals and the former Cardinal Secretary of State, served as the principal celebrant of the funeral Mass, while Pope Benedict delivered the homily and presided at the rites of Final Commendation and Valediction.

Minnesota is part of the largest American Viticultural Area (AVA), the Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA, which includes southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and northwest Illinois. The state also has a smaller designated American Viticultural Areas, the Alexandria Lakes AVA. Minnesota is a very cold climate for viticulture and many grape varieties require protection from the winter weather by being buried under soil for the season. Minnesota is home to extensive research on cold-hardy French hybrid and other grape varieties. The Minnesota Grape Growers Association (MGGA) is a statewide organization that promotes grape growing and wine making in the state and also in cold-hardy climates. Minnesota is home to the International Cold Climate Wine Competition (ICCWC) hosted annually in partnership between MGGA and University of Minnesota. This is the only wine competition solely dedicated to the promotion of quality wines made mainly from cold-hardy grape varieties. In 2014, the 6th annual competition saw 284 wines entered from 59 commercial wineries in 11 states. Awards were based on blind tastings by 21 expert judges, who include enologists, wine writers, restaurateurs, retailers, and wine educators. History The first modern winery in Minnesota, Northern Vineyards Winery, opened in 1977. In 1973, the first recorded vineyard in Minnesota was planted by David Bailly at Alexis Bailly Vineyard in Hastings, MN. In 1978, Minnesota and Alexis Bailly Vineyard celebrated the production of the first wine commercially produced of 100% Minnesota grapes. In 1997, only 3 wineries existed in Minnesota. Today over 40 wineries have commercial operations in Minnesota. Influence of Elmer Swenson Horticulturalist Elmer Swenson created commercially successful, cold-climate varieties in Minnesota including the Edelweiss and St. Croix grapes. Oenology programs at the University of Minnesota developed the Frontenac grape variety in 1995, and continue to research new hybrids and techniques for grape growing in the state and other cold climate regions.

Parts of Ophir and Echus chasmata are visible at lower right and upper left, respectively. Just left of center, a side canyon can be seen following a graben towards the left. Perrotin Crater is just left of lower center. Hebes Chasma by Mars Express Hebes Chasma is an isolated chasma just north of the Valles Marineris canyon system of Mars. It is centered at 1 degree southern latitude and 76 degrees western longitude, just between the Martian equator and the Valles Marineris system, just east of the Tharsis region. Geography Hebes Chasma is a completely closed depression in the surface of Mars, with no outflows to the nearby Echus Chasma to the west, Perrotin Crater to the southwest, or Valles Marineris to the south. Its maximum extents are approximately 320 km east to west, 130 km north to south, and 5 to 6 km in depth. At the center of the depression is Hebes Mensa, a large mesa rising some 5 km off the valley floor, nearly as high as the surrounding terrain. This central plateau makes Hebes Chasma a unique valley in Martian geography. In high resolution pictures of Mars Express ( http://spaceinimages.esa.int/Images/2013/10/Hebes_Chasma ) blue areas at the deepest section of the depression show characteristics of a lake: Sharp borders between the yellow and blue area and light blue near the yellow area, becoming darker away from the border. History of name The word Hebes comes from Hebe, the goddess of youth, who was the daughter of Zeus and Hera. Hebe was the wife of Hercules.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y.  Origin of mesa  The walls of Hebes Chasma weather differently than the slopes on the mesa on its floor. Also, studies of the thermal inertia suggest that the mesa and the walls of the canyon are made of different substances. Thermal inertia is how long the surface holds heat. For example, rocky areas will stay warmer than dust at night. One popular idea that explains the difference between the depression's walls and the mesa slopes is that the mesa was formed from material that accumulated in a lake.http://themis.asu.edu/features/hebes Image:Hebes Chasma.JPGHebes Chasma, as seen by THEMIS.

The park is at the corner of Gwynn Oak and Gwyndale avenues, about a quarter mile off of Liberty Heights Avenue. The amusement park, which existed from 1893 until 1973, was the site of protests against racial segregation due to a whites-only admissions policy. History In its heyday, the amusement park featured three roller coasters: The Big Dipper, The Little Dipper, and The Wild Mouse. The park also featured common amusement rides such as the Ferris Wheel and The Whip (see photograph at right). It also had a trolley, a carousel, and the dance hall known as the \\"Dixie Ballroom\\". WFBR, a Baltimore AM radio station, did live broadcasts from the ballroom on weekends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s Gwynn Oak Park was the subject of picketing for integration, as it remained segregated until August 28, 1963, when Sharon Langley (accompanied by her father Charles Langley) became the first African American child to ride the park's merry-go-round. In 1955, Baltimore City clergy, along with local chapters of the civil rights group Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), with assistance from the NAACP, demonstrated for integration at Gwynn Oak Park. These protests were held at various times over the years, but two major demonstrations occurred at Gwynn Oak Park in July 1963. For the first, on Thursday, July 4, 1963, demonstrators initially gathered at Metropolitan Methodist Church in West Baltimore before boarding buses to the park. Over the course of the protest, 283 people were arrested and charged with trespassing outside the park. The demonstration remained peaceful, as many arrested were clerics from all over the East Coast. Two members of the Episcopal Church's National Council staff, Bishop Daniel Corrigan and Father Daisuke Kitagawa, Executive Secretary of the Division of Domestic Missions, were also among the group arrested. The second demonstration took place on Sunday, July 7, 1963. Counter-protestors had turned out in number and the police feared for a time that violence might erupt. One demonstrator was injured by a thrown stone. More than 90 demonstrators and four counter- protestors were arrested in the July 7 demonstration. The park closed in 1973 after suffering severe damage from flooding when Hurricane Agnes caused the Gwynns Falls creek to overflow. In 1974 its rides were auctioned off. The carousel was moved and is still in operation on the National Mall in Washington D.C.Nathan, Amy. Round and Round Together: Taking a Merry-Go-Round Ride into the Civil Rights Movement, pages 3-13, 220-224 The land is currently owned by the Baltimore County Government and utilized as open space picnic ground. The Gwynns Falls creek runs through the former amusement park and supplies a lake which is also still present today and still commonly used by ice skaters when it freezes in the winter.

Training and career Adam went to Carlisle Grammar School and the University of Leeds, from which he obtained a Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. After becoming a Member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1953, he joined the National Coal Board as a mining engineer in 1959. Adam later became a Charted Engineer member of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.\\"Debrett's People of Today\\", Debrett. Labour Party activity He joined the Labour Party and in 1963 became Chairman of Berwick-upon-Tweed Constituency Labour Party, and he was co-opted as a member of Northumberland County Council Education Committee in 1964. At the 1966 general election, Adam was the Labour Party candidate for the Tynemouth constituency. He succeeded in cutting the Conservative majority from 7,448 to 3,396.\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons, 1966\\", p. 206-207. In 1971 Adam was elected to Whitley Bay Borough Council; when that council was succeeded by North Tyneside Borough Council in 1973, Adam was elected to the new body and became its first Chairman and Mayor for the year 1974‚Äì1975. Berwick byelection In August 1973, he was chosen to fight the byelection in Berwick-upon-Tweed caused by the resignation of Lord Lambton, and decided to focus on the issues of housing and prices.\\"Berwick Liberals' confident attack on Tory stronghold\\", The Times, 18 August 1973, p. 2. The Times Diary noted that Labour had drafted 13 professionals in to lead their campaign but described Adam as \\"a charm-free technocrat\\".\\"The Times Diary\\", The Times, 6 November 1973, p. 20. Adam saw Labour overtaken by the Liberal Party who narrowly won the seat; he took comfort that the Labour vote had held firm.Ronald Faux, \\"Berwick result shows Liberal revival goes on, new MP says\\", The Times, 10 November 1973, p. 2. North Tyneside Councillor Adam fought the same constituency again in the February 1974 general election, but saw the Labour vote fall to 4,326 which was about half what it had been in 1970.\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons, 1974\\", p. 54. From 1975 he became Deputy Leader of North Tyneside Borough Council, and he was named to the Northern Economic Planning Council from 1974. As Deputy Leader of North Tyneside he indicated that the council would aim to comply with the demands of Peter Shore, Secretary of State for the Environment, to restrain spending.\\"Mr Shore's warning on council cuts meets mixed response\\", The Times, 14 June 1976, p. 2. He served on the Northern Arts General Council from 1975 to 1977, and was appointed to the Whitley Bay Playhouse Theatre Trust in 1975; he was Chairman of the Trust from 1975 to 1980. European Parliament At the 1979 election to the European Parliament, Adam stood as Labour Party candidate in Northumbria. This was one of the safest seats for Labour and Adam was easily elected. In June 1980 he lauded events in Zimbabwe which had shown how real democracy had triumphed in the end, and urged the government of South Africa to take the same course.\\"S Africa urged to make reforms\\", The Times, 21 June 1980, p. 5. In June 1981 he presented a report on behalf of the Committee on Energy and Research which called for the development of a computer translation system.\\"Developments in computer translation\\", The Times, 16 June 1981, p. 4. Attitude to the EEC In 1983 he was chosen to head an inquiry into how the United Kingdom proposed to spend its budget rebate on energy projects.Ian Murray, \\"EEC energy inquiry\\", The Times, 24 March 1983, p. 2. Adam was prepared to support the Labour Party policy of withdrawal from the EEC in public but felt that party policy failed to take account of practicalities: he was quoted in early 1982 as saying that his constituents were more interested in learning what would happen to the sheepmeat regime.George Clark, \\"Labour leaders begin to change tack on EEC\\", The Times, 1 February 1982, p. 3. However, in the 1984 election, the Conservatives claimed that a reading of Adam's election literature identified him as a supporter of British membership.Anthony Bevins, \\"Minister tells of partners' sneers\\", The Times, 30 May 1984, p. 4. After successful re- election Adam became vice-chairman of the Energy, Research and Technology Committee of the European Parliament. He kept up his local connections with the arts, being a member of the Board of Newcastle Free Festival from 1989 to 1999 (and Chairman from 1992). He was also a member of the Board of the Northern Stage Company from 1989 to 2001. At the 1992 general election, he again fought Berwick-upon-Tweed; this time he succeeded in increasing the Labour vote by 5.4% compared with the previous election.\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons, 1992\\", p. 47. Pit closures Adam managed to persuade the European Parliament to commission an independent investigation of the British government's decision to close 31 coal mines after the closure was announced in 1992. The investigation was significant because the European Commission needed to give approval for part of the closure programme.John Carvel, \\"EC challenge on pits axe for Heseltine\\", The Guardian, 14 January 1993. Early in 1995 Adam signed a joint letter in defence of Clause IV and opposing Tony Blair's attempt to get rid of it.John Carvel, Patrick Wintour, \\"Angry Blair slaps down rebel MEPs\\", The Guardian, 12 January 1995, p. 1. 1999 election In the selections for the 1999 European election, Adam was placed as fourth on the Labour Party's list for the North East region, a position which made it almost impossible for him to be elected.Andrew Grice, \\"Labour NEC de-selects 11 of its MEPs\\", The Independent, 23 September 1998, p. 4. As expected he lost his seat when the Labour Party won only three seats in the region. He wrote to the local newspaper after the election to thank those who had worked with him.\\"European Affairs\\" (letter), Northern Echo, 21 July 1999, p. 10. He retired to give more time to his work as Chairman of the Northern Energy Initiative, a post he had occupied since 1995. Return However, in December 1999 it was surprisingly announced that Alan Donnelly was resigning his seat in the European Parliament. Donnelly was the Leader of the Labour group and only 42 at the time; the Labour Party denied that there was an impending scandal. Under the European Parliament electoral system, Adam became first in line to replace him.Brendan Carlin, \\"Mystery as Labour's top Euro-MP resigns\\", Northern Echo, 16 December 1999, p. 1. Adam duly returned to the European Parliament after a gap of six months. Foot and Mouth disease In December 2001 Adam caused a stir when he criticised the calls from Ireland for the Sellafield nuclear recycling plant to be closed. He pointed to figures from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland which found that Sellafield was responsible for only one per cent. of radioactivity in Ireland, and went on to \\"award the star prize for political humbuggery to the Irish, to the inhabitants of the Emerald Isle\\".Niall Moonan, \\"Brit MEP: Shut down Ireland, not Sellafield\\", Daily Mirror, 24 December 2001, p. 11. He became the Labour group agriculture spokesman and was critical of the group of Welsh farmers who had given evidence during an inquiry into the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, saying they \\"might be a bit biased\\".Robert Uhlig, \\"MEPs question foot and mouth victims' politics\\", Daily Telegraph, 3 July 2002, p. 6. When the eventual report was highly critical of the British government, Adam abstained rather than support it, describing the report as inaccurate.\\"Report slams foot and mouth policy\\", Western Morning News, 21 November 2002. Mayoral candidate When the directly-elected Mayor of North Tyneside resigned in 2003, forcing a byelection for the Mayoralty, Adam was chosen as the Labour candidate.\\"Anger at Labour's mayor poll choice\\", The Journal, 8 May 2003, p. 13. He was defeated by Linda Arkley who secured a majority of 4,861.\\"Tory nurse beats Labour MEP\\", The Guardian, 13 June 2003, p. 14. Allowances In April 2004 Austrian MEP Hans-Peter Martin was attempting to expose questionable practices in European Parliament allowances. Martin filmed Adam signing the attendance book for a Friday session of the European Parliament, thereby claiming a daily allowance, before immediately leaving. Martin claimed that Adam tried to grab his video camera, knocking Martin off his feet and on to the floor.Nick Speed, \\"A quick hit gives MEPs a fast buck\\", Sunday Times, 25 April 2004, p. 5. Adam denied the claim and attacked Martin's methods.Ross Smith, \\"Euro MP silent on payment bust-up\\", The Journal, 26 April 2004, p. 1. Retirement Adam retired from the European Parliament at the 2004 election. He supported the move for an elected regional authority in the devolution referendum later that year, recalling his first election in 1964 when he called for investment in the region's roads; Adam believed a regional authority would unlock investment held back by Whitehall.Letters, The Journal, 9 October 2004, p. 10. In 2006 he criticised the group of Labour MPs who had called for Tony Blair to resign the Labour Party leadership, warning that the electorate would not re-elect \\"a squabbling, divided party\\".\\"Voters will not re-elect a divided Labour Party\\" (Letters), The Journal, 12 September 2006, p. 10.

It is the 50th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are caught sleeping in a closed awning situated over a store. A brief argument among the trio results in Curly casually tossing a pot over his shoulder, breaking several dishes. The shopkeeper (Max Davidson), irate at the Stooges for vandalizing his store, calls the police and chases the Stooges, who quickly dash into a building‚Äôs revolving door. Upon exiting the building, the Stooges have clipboards in tow, having inadvertently landed jobs as census takers. The boys work their way into the home of a socialite (Symona Boniface) who is concerned with a lack of participants in her weekly Bridge game. The Stooges happily comply, and join the game. In the interim, Curly begins to flirt with the socialite's maid, who is in the process of preparing a large bowl of punch. Curly finds that the drink is ‚Äúnot sweet enough‚Äù so, and ends up adding Alum salt to the mix, mistaking it for powdered sugar. Within minutes, everyone is mumbling their words as their lips become puckered. Afterwards, the Stooges are still searching for people to interview for the census. They eventually come upon a nearby football game, and become thrilled as the prospect of speaking with everyone in the stadium. The trio don football players‚Äô uniforms and bypass the guard in the guises of differing players and storm the field. They try asking questions to the players, who end up ignoring them, and Curly finds an ice cream vendor and takes off after him, somehow hijacking his wagon. The Stooges get pulled into the game and, after a few bouts of hardship, get an idea‚Ä¶if they would get the ball away from the players they would have no choice but to answer their questions. With that, Larry and Moe attach chains to the pants of two players and pull them off, distracting the players enough for Curly to grab the ball and run away. But the players notice him and give chase. Curly continues running like mad as Larry pulls the ice cream wagon, carrying Moe behind him. Moe throws fistfuls of ice cream at the players and the referee who are chasing them, and the Stooges run out of the stadium followed by the irate football team. Production notes No Census, No Feeling was filmed on May 25‚Äì29, 1940. The film title is a parody on the expression \\"No sense, no feeling\\". Curly confuses \\"census\\" for \\"the censor\\", thinking he is working for Will H. Hays. In one scene, Curly believes that it is Independence Day in October, claiming that \\"you never can tell; look what they did to Thanksgiving!\\". This is a reference to an event in 1939 when Franklin Roosevelt moved Thanksgiving to an earlier Thursday in November to lengthen the Christmas shopping season. This act angered many Republicans and, after some time, the holiday ended up moving to the fourth Thursday of November which just happens to be on the last Thursday of November most years. In 1940 and 1941, the holiday was on the third Thursday of November.

Following the Byzantine Civil War, the Ottoman capture of Gallipoli, and the decisive Battle of Kosovo, the Ottoman Empire was poised to conquer the entirety of the Balkans and also sought and expressed desire to expand further north into Central Europe beginning with the Hungarian lands. Initial Hungarian success culminated in the Crusade of Varna, though without significant outside support the Hungarians were defeated. Nonetheless the Ottomans suffered more defeats at Belgrade, even after the conquest of Constantinople. In particular, the notorious Vlad the Impaler, with limited Hungarian help, resisted Ottoman rule until the Ottomans placed his brother, a man less feared and less hated by the populace, on the throne of Wallachia. Ottoman success was once again halted at Moldavia due to Hungarian intervention, but the Turks finally succeeded when Moldavia and then Belgrade fell to Bayezid II and Suleiman the Magnificent, respectively. In 1526 the Ottomans crushed the Hungarian army at Moh√°cs with King Louis II of Hungary perishing along with 50,000 of his armored knights.Turner & Corvisier & Childs, A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War, pp. 365‚Äì366 \\"In 1526, at the battle of Moh√°cs, the Hungarian army was destroyed by the Turks. King Louis II died, along with 7 bishops, 28 barons and most of his army (4,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry).\\" Minahan, One Europe, many nations: a historical dictionary of European national groups, p. 311 \\"A peasant uprising, crushed in 1514, was followed by defeat by the Ottoman Turks at the decisive battle of Mohacs in 1526. King Louis II and more than 20,000 of his men perished in battle, which marked the end of Hungarian power in Central Europe.\\" Following this defeat, the eastern region of the Kingdom of Hungary (mainly Transylvania) became an Ottoman tributary state, constantly engaged in civil war with Royal Hungary. The war continued with the Habsburgs now asserting primacy in the conflict with Suleiman and his successors. The northern and most of the central parts of Hungary managed to remain free from Ottoman rule, but the Kingdom of Hungary, the most powerful state east of Vienna under Matthias I, was now divided and constantly threatened by Ottoman ambitions in the region. Background In the century after the death of Osman I in 1326, Ottoman rule began to extend over the eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans, slowly at first and later in earnest. Gallipoli was captured in 1354, severing the Byzantine Empire from its continental territories Vasiliev, Alexander. History of the Byzantine Empire, 324‚Äì1453, 2nd ed, p. 622. (Madison), 1952.; the important city of Thessaloniki making it larger than London at the time. (with a greater population than London at the time) was captured from the Venetians in 1387, and the Turkish victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into the rest of Europe. Balkans and Turkish wars of Louis I of Hungary In 1344, Louis I of Hungary, who would rule from 1342‚Äì1382 and earn the epithet \\"the Great\\", invaded Wallachia and Moldavia and established a system of vassalage.Ion Grumeza: The Roots of Balkanization: Eastern Europe C.E. 500-1500, University Press of America, 2010 Louis and his 80,000 strong army repelled the Serbian Du≈°an's armies in the duchies of Maƒçva and principality of Travunia in 1349. When Emperor Du≈°an broke into Bosnian territory he was defeated by Bosnian Stjepan II with the assistance of Louis' troops, and when Du≈°an made a second attempt he defeated Louis in 1354 , capturing Maƒçva and Belgrade. The two monarchs signed a peace agreement in 1355. The Battle of Nicopolis, as depicted by Turkish miniaturist His latter campaigns in the Balkans were aimed not so much at conquest and subjugation as at drawing the Serbs, Bosnians, Wallachians and Bulgarians into the fold of the Roman Catholic faith and at forming a united front against the Turks. It was relatively easy to subdue the Balkan Orthodox countries by arms, but to convert them was a different matter. Despite Louis' efforts, the peoples of the Balkans remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox Church and their attitude toward Hungary remained ambiguous. Louis annexed Moldavia in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365. The rulers of Serbia, Walachia, Moldavia, and Bulgaria became his vassals. They regarded powerful Hungary as a potential menace to their national identity. For this reason, Hungary could never regard the Serbs and Wallachians as reliable allies in subsequent wars against the Turks. In the spring of 1365, Louis headed a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir. He seized the city of Vidin on 2 May 1365; the region was under Hungarian rule until 1369. In 1366 Byzantine Emperor John V visited Hungary to beg for help against the Ottoman Turks, who were in increasing conflict with the Balkan vassal states. The Battle of Nicopolis (25 September 1396) is thought to be the first encounter between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, where a broad alliance of Christian monarchs and the Knights Hospitaller were crushed by a numerically superior Turkish army under their 4th Sultan Bayazid I. Timur and the Ottoman Interregnum Despite these successes the Ottomans were dealt a major setback when at Ankara in 1402 Timur the Great of the Timurid Empire defeated and captured the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid the Thunderbolt (so named for the speed of his crushing victories against his Christian opponents, most notably at Nicopolis). After a decade of internecine battles, Mehmed I emerged victorious and reestablished the Ottoman Empire and Byzantine Emperor accepted its vassalship and agreed to pay tribute. Campaigns of Murad II, 1421‚Äì1451 Murad II, the successor to Mehmed I, proved to be a man of far greater military skills than his peaceful predecessor. In 1422, no longer professing suzerainty to the Byzantines, he laid siege to Constantinople, which narrowly avoided becoming an Ottoman conquest. However he had managed to capture lands surrounding Constantinople. With Byzantium no longer a threat, Murad II began his war against his Christian opponents, attacking Macedonia and capturing Thessalonika from the Venetians in 1430. Between 1435 and 1436 the Ottomans made a show of strength in Albania, but the country survived due to intervention from the Kingdom of Hungary, whose borders now neared those of the Ottoman Empire. Campaigns of John Hunyadi In the 1440s and 1450s, the Hungarian military leader John Hunyadi became the key architect of campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. In 1441 he scored a pitched battle victory at Semendria over Ishak Bey. The following year, he annihilated an Ottoman force invading Transylvania at Sibiu. Following this victory, Wallachia again accepted the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Hungary. With the help of knights from western Europe, Hunyadi succeeded in capturing Nis on November 3, 1443, defeating another Turkish army as they crossed the Balkan Mountains and then taking another victory on Christmas Day. Because supplies for the Crusader army were low, Hunyadi concluded a ten-year peace treaty with Murad II, presumably on Hunyadi's terms, for it was the triumphant Hungarian that entered Buda in February 1444. Ten years was the maximum time permitted by Islamic law for a treaty with an \\"infidel\\". The peace was short lived, as Cardinal Julian Cesarini incited the Hungarians to break the treaty and attack the Turks once more. However, much of the Crusader armies' strength had been reduced due to the loss (by defection) of Serbia, Albania and the Byzantine Empire. Battle of Varna The Crusader army attacked across the Danube. Murad, upon hearing of the Christian breach of the treaty, is said to have mounted the broken treaty on his standard and said the words, \\"Christ, if you are God as your followers claim, punish them for their perfidy\\". The two armies met on November 10, 1444 near Varna in eastern Bulgaria. Accounts vary as to how many troops were present but the Crusaders may have been 30,000 strong whilst the Ottoman forces were two to three times larger. Nonetheless, Hunyadi's successful defense wagons held the line until King Ladislas led a charge to his death against the Turkish lines. His head was mounted on a spear where all the defeated Crusaders could see it. Few Crusaders survived the battle, although Hunyadi did escape with his life. Battle of Varna After Varna The Hungarians recovered their strength after Varna and Hunyadi was able to lead another expedition down the Danube. Turkish counter-attacks saw this \\"crusade\\" driven back. After Murad dealt with the Greeks at the Peloponesse and others who had fought him at Varna, he turned his attention to Albania, whose leader, once an Ottoman hostage, was now a popular resistance leader. Hunyadi could not refuse an offer to fight the Turks and in 1448 an army of some 24,000 Hungarians marched south into Serbia. At the Second Battle of Kosovo Murad scored another victory against the Hungarians. This time, Hunyadi had had enough and was unable to campaign against the Ottoman Sultan. Murad II passed on his powers to his successor, Mehmed II. Thanks to such victories, the Ottoman forces were able to capture Constantinople in 1453 with only the Italians offering minimal support to the Byzantines. Battle of Belgrade (1456) Meanwhile, the Ottoman issue had again become acute, and, after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II was rallying his resources to subjugate Hungary. His immediate objective was N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r (today Belgrade). N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r was a major castle-fortress, and a gatekeeper of south Hungary. The fall of this stronghold would have opened a clear way to the heart of Central Europe. Hunyadi arrived at the Siege of Belgrade at the end of 1455, after settling differences with his domestic enemies. At his own expense, he restocked the supplies and arms of the fortress, leaving a strong garrison there under the command of his brother-in-law Mih√°ly Szil√°gyi and his own eldest son L√°szl√≥ Hunyadi. He proceeded to form a relief army, and assembled a fleet of two hundred ships. His main ally was the Franciscan friar, Giovanni da Capistrano, whose fiery oratory drew a large crusade made up mostly of peasants. Although relatively ill-armed (most were armed with farm equipment, such as scythes and pitchforks) they flocked to Hunyadi and his small corps of seasoned mercenaries and cavalry. Kapisztr√°n J√°nos with the cross in his hand. On July 14, 1456 the flotilla assembled by Hunyadi destroyed the Ottoman fleet. On July 21, Szil√°gyi's forces in the fortress repulsed a fierce assault by the Rumelian army, and Hunyadi pursued the retreating forces into their camp, taking advantage of the Turkish army's confused flight from the city. After fierce but brief fighting, the camp was captured, and Mehmet raised the siege and returned to Constantinople. With his flight began a 70-year period of relative peace on Hungary's southeastern border. However, plague broke out in Hunyadi's camp three weeks after the lifting of the siege, and he died on August 11. He was buried inside the (Roman Catholic) Cathedral of Alba Iulia (Gyulafeh√©rv√°r), next to his younger brother John. Sultan Mehmet II paid him tribute: \\"Although he was my enemy I feel grief over his death, because the world has never seen such a man.\\" During the battle, Pope Callixtus III had ordered the bells of every European church to be rung every day at noon, as a call for believers to pray for the defenders of Belgrade. However, in many countries (like England and the Spanish kingdoms), news of the victory arrived before the order, and the ringing of the church bells at noon thus transformed into a commemoration of the victory. The pope never withdrew the order, and many Catholic and older Protestant churches still ring the noon bell to this day. Turkish wars of Matthias Corvinus (1458‚Äì1490) alt=Hunyadi's son Matthias Corvinus was crowned king in Buda in 1458 at the age of 15. In 1471 Matthias renewed the Serbian Despotate in south Hungary under Vuk Grgureviƒá for the protection of the borders against the Ottomans. In 1479 an Ottoman army, on its return home from ravaging Transylvania, was annihilated at Sz√°szv√°ros (modern OrƒÉ≈ütie, 13 October 1479) in the Battle of Breadfield. The following year Matthias recaptured Jajce, drove the Ottomans from northern Serbia and instituted two new military banats, Jajce and Srebernik, from reconquered Bosnian territory.Black Army In 1480 an Ottoman fleet seized Otranto in the Kingdom of Naples. At the earnest solicitation of the pope Matthias sent the Hungarian general, Bal√°zs Magyar, to recover the fortress, which surrendered on 10 May 1481. Again in 1488, Matthias took Ancona under his protection for a while, occupying it with a Hungarian garrison. Wallachian and Moldavian wars Vlad the Impaler and war with Wallachia, 1456‚Äì1475 Mehmed II's post- Constantinople troubles escalated further when the Balkan principality of Wallachia under Count Vlad III Dracul rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and declared the King of Hungary as his suzerain. The main drive for these actions was Vlad's return to his homeland after being in exile as a hostage of the Ottoman sultan. In 1461, five years after his return, Vlad initiated war with the Turks when he impaled the Turkish ambassadors demanding tribute from him and took the fortress of Giurgiu. Vlad then began a bloody assault across the Danube to the Black Sea, destroying as many of the ports as he could to prevent Ottoman naval attacks. Ottoman attempts to subdue Vlad militarily proved a failure, but his cruelty, which had terrorized his enemies, proved to be his undoing. When Mehmed offered the populace the choice of Vlad or his brother Radu, the populace chose Radu and soon Vlad was again an exile on the run. An attempt to return a few years afterwards ended in his death in battle. Stephen the Great and war against Moldavia, 1475‚Äì1476 Mehmed's army seems to have spent itself in Wallachia for the campaign against the Moldavians was shorter and yielded poorer results. In 1475 Mehmed ordered an invasion of Moldavia. Again, the Ottomans often took possession of the field but Moldavian hit-and-run tactics proved effective against the Turks. Poor roads further slowed the Ottomans until Stephen the Great was able to concentrate his forces at Vaslui. An Ottoman offensive was held in check and then finally driven from the field on 10 January 1475. The Ottomans returned in 1476, this time assisted by their allies from Crimea, the Tartars and their newly conquered Vassal of Wallachia. Stephen knew that he did not have the resources to defend his people and evacuated them to the mountains. After a failed attack on the Ottoman vanguard Stephen seemed on the brink of defeat when King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary offered assistance. The Ottomans withdrew when the Hungarians began moving in and fighting did not resume until 1484. Bayezid II, 1481‚Äì1512 The early reign of Bayezid II included a small civil war against his brother Jem, who escaped to the west. There European leaders entertained ideas of installing a pro-Western sultan while sending a crusade to the Balkans. Consequently, Bayezid did not incite any serious wars with his Christian opponents until his brother's death in 1495. In the meantime Bayezid signed a ten-year peace with Hungary in 1484, although this did not prevent a defeat of an Ottoman army at Villach in 1493. Between 1484 and 1486 Bayezid campaigned annually against Moldavia in an attempt to subdue it and link up with Crimea, his Muslim vassal and ally. Despite two defeats in 1485 and 1486 Moldavia was subjugated. As Bayezid's reign drew to a close he was entangled in a civil war between his sons Ahmed and Selim. Eventually Selim took the throne in 1512 and for the next eight years continued minor conquests in the west, although his main achievement was the conquest of the Mamluke Sultanate. It would be Selim's successor, Suleiman who would continue the war against Hungary. Campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent, 1520‚Äì1566 Suleiman the Magnificent resumed the war against Hungary by attacking the city of Belgrade, the same settlement that had defied Mehmed II over half a century earlier. Despite strong resistance, the city fell to Suleiman. In 1522 Suleiman took his army to a strategically successful siege of Rhodes, allowing the Knights Hospital to evacuate for the fort. Battle of Moh√°cs Discovery of the Corpse of King Louis II When Suleiman launched an invasion in 1526 the Grand Vizier constructed a great bridge ahead of the Sultan allowing his army to march into Hungary. Despite eighty days of marching and taking five days to cross the Danube River, the Ottomans met no resistance from the Hungarians. The original plan of Hungarian King Louis II had been to send a vanguard to hold the Danube where the Ottomans were expected to cross, yet the nobles of the Kingdom refused to follow the King's deputy in battle, claiming that they did so out of zealous allegiance to the King (and would therefore only follow him). Consequently, when King Louis II took the field his army of 36,000 men seemed to be doomed to fail against the Ottomans' 80,000.Sources such as this support this number, other suggest a smaller number of 60,000 At Moh√°cs the plains of Hungary allowed the heavier Christian knights to launch an effective charge. As the Hungarian knights brushed aside first the Akinjis and then the Sipahis, the Ottoman cavalry regrouped and flanked the Knights inflicting a moderate amount of casualties. The Sultan then placed his Janissaries and cannon into position chained up as an effective line . The Hungarian cavalry took serious casualties from the skilfully handled Turkish artillery. With the cavalry annihilated, the infantry suffered immense casualties as the weight of numbers of the Ottomans and their skill in battle took their toll. When Suleiman the Magnificent found the body of Louis II he is said to have been saddened by his untimely death. Aftermath of Moh√°cs John Z√°polya, who had been instructed by Louis II to raid the enemy's supply lines, arrived at the battle too late and fled the scene. Suleiman, however, was not ready to annex the Kingdom completely into the Ottoman realm and in that power gap, Zapolya was chosen by Hungarian electorate as their ruler. Meanwhile, at the Diet of Bratislava Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was declared King of Hungary. The surviving nobles of Hungary now had to choose between pledging allegiance to a native vassal of Suleiman and a Christian \\"foreigner\\". Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski's Charge from the Fortress of Szigetv√°r After Zapolya's death Z√°polya would rule Hungary until his death in 1540. Following his demise, Hungary was split into three parts. The north-west (present-day Slovakia, western Transdanubia and Burgenland, western Croatia and parts of north-eastern present-day Hungary) remained under Habsburg rule; although initially independent, later it became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy under the informal name Royal Hungary. The Habsburg Emperors would from then on be also crowned as Kings of Hungary. Eger The eastern part of the kingdom (Partium and Transylvania) became at first an independent principality, but gradually was brought under Turkish rule as a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The remaining central area (most of present-day Hungary), including the capital of Buda, became a province of the Ottoman Empire.

It originally formed part of the 7th Guards Airborne Division of the Soviet Airborne Forces at Gai≈æi≈´nai. The regiment fought in Operation Whirlwind, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, and landed in Budapest on 4 November 1956. In 1959, it transferred to the 104th Guards Airborne Division and was based in Baku. On 22 February 1968, for its achievements in training, the Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Star. Division headquarters was at Kirovabad (now Gyandzha) in the Azerbaijan SSR. Carey Schofield writes that the 104th Guards Airborne Division \\"had only two regiments from 1975 to 1980 after the disbandment of the 80th Guards Airborne Regiment in Baku\\". In August 1968, the regiment participated in Operation Danube, the crushing of the Prague Spring.  39th Separate Air Assault Brigade  On 3 August 1979, the regiment was disbanded. The 39th Separate Air Assault Brigade was formed from elements of the regiment at Khyriv in Lviv Oblast on 19 December. The 40th Separate Air Assault Brigade was formed in Nikolayev from other parts of the regiment. In January 1980, the 1st Battalion of the 39th Separate Air Assault Brigade was deployed to Termez for fighting in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War and became the 48th Separate Air Assault Battalion. The battalion was absorbed by the 66th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade in May. In 1986, the 39th Brigade participated in the Chernobyl cleanup. Between January and April 1990, the 39th Separate Air Assault Brigade was deployed to restore order in during the Nagorno-Karabakh War.  1990s  In June 1990 the 39th Separate Air Assault Brigade became the 224th Training Center of the Soviet Airborne Forces. The brigade included the 1st and 2nd Airborne Training Battalions, as well as an artillery training battalion. In May 1992 the training center became part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In September 1993, the 224th Training Center was renamed the 39th Separate Airborne Brigade. It became the 6th Separate Airmobile Brigade on 1 November 1995.

In the spring of 2014, after the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the brigade covered the Ukraine‚ÄìRussia border in Poltava and Sumy Oblasts. Between 7‚Äì8 April 2014, the brigade relocated to defend the Luhansk Airport. The brigade the airport until September, when a Russian attack forced them to retreat. The brigade fought in the battle for Shchastya in June 2014. During a night battle on 17‚Äì18 June, 11 personnel from the brigade and the 128th Mountain Brigade were killed. On 1 August, the brigade ambushed a separatist column moving from Sukhodolska to Luhansk, destroying seven tanks, five armored vehicles, 3 BM-21 Grad MLRS, seven cars with ammunition and killing 120‚Äì150 separatists. On 5 September, personnel from the brigade and the Aidar Battalion were between Luhansk and Metalist at Vesela Hora. 40 bodies of men from both units were returned by the separatists after negotiations. 28 unidentified bodies were buried at Starobilsk on 2 October.

On 28 October, seven brigade personnel were released from captivity by the separatists. The brigade's 3rd Battalion fought in the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport in January 2015. The unit became known as the \\"Cyborgs\\" along with other Ukrainian units defending Donetsk Airport. Along with the 90th Separate Airborne Battalion of the 81st Airmobile Brigade, the unit was forced to retreat from the new airport terminal, reportedly under heavy artillery fire and chemical attack. Over 50 soldiers from both units died in the fighting between 19 and 21 January. After the Ukrainian withdrawal from the airport on 21 January, at least 15 soldiers from the brigade were captured by the separatists. Several of the soldiers were subjected to frequent beatings. A Humvee of the brigade during the 2016 Kiev Ukrainian Independence Day Parade Since at least May 2015, the brigade has been equipped with 28 M1114 Up- Armored Humvees. On 24 August 2015, President Petro Poroshenko presented the brigade a battle flag for bravery and courage during a review in Kiev on the 24th anniversary of Ukrainian independence; by this time, it had been redesignated as the 80th Separate Air Assault Brigade. Brigade Junior sergeant and medic Igor Zinych was posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine on 14 October for his actions in caring for the wounded at Donetsk Airport. On 18 November 2015, the brigade's Order of the Red Star award was removed as part of a general removal of Soviet awards and decorations from Ukrainian military units. In June 2016, a platoon of the brigade participated in the multinational Anakonda 16 exercise at Nowa Dƒôba training ground, attached to a Polish battalion. In August 2016, the brigade's mortar platoon and some of its staff officers participated in the multinational Flaming Thunder exercises near Pabradƒó in Lithuania. On 23 August, former brigade commander Andrey Kovalchuk was awarded the titile Hero of Ukraine for his leadership. As of June 2017, elements of the brigade, equipped with Humvees, defended positions at Pisky, near Donetsk Airport.

Opened in 1910, it is one of the few preserved variety venues of the pre-World War II era in the city. As a place of amusement the Admiralspalast originally included a skating rink, a public bath, bowling alleys, a caf√© and a cinema open day and night. After World War I it changed to a revue theatre, starting with the show Drunter und dr√ºber by Walter Kollo, later continued by the performance of operettas. As the building suffered little damage from World War II bombing, it was home to the Berlin State Opera until the reconstruction of the Berlin State Opera house in 1955. On April 21‚Äì22 1946, the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Germany in the Soviet occupation zone held a convention at the Admiralspalast where they merged to become the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The performance of revues and operettas were continued under the name of Metropol-Theater until its disestablishment in 1997. The GDR Union of Journalists had its offices inside the Admiralspalast.Wilke, J√ºrgen, Julia Martin, Denis Fengler, and Marc Levasier.

The title refers to a Ready Steady Go! TV special the band had recently appeared in, but the EP contains different recordings from those performed on the TV show.  EP profile  The record consists of two original songs by Pete Townshend, as well as covers of the theme from the Batman TV series and Jan and Dean's \\"Bucket T\\". Also included is a cover of The Regents' \\"Barbara Ann\\", a song whose famous arrangement by the Beach Boys the Who follows more closely. Despite what the title implies, the EP was not recorded on Ready Steady Go!; it is a studio recording and is unaffiliated with the television show. All of the songs are available as bonus tracks on the 1995 reissue CD of A Quick One, except for \\"Circles\\", which differs from the version on the 2002 deluxe version of the My Generation LP, and can be found on Two's Missing. The original EP credits the song \\"Batman\\" to Jan Berry, Don Altfeld (misspelled as \\"Altfield\\") and Fred Weider. The song was actually written by Neal Hefti, and is not a cover of the Jan and Dean-embellished version. The credit was corrected in the liner notes to the 1995 CD release of A Quick One. An abridged version of My Generation was recorded for the EP, but was not included. This version was later included as a bonus track on the 1995 remaster of A Quick One. The main difference between this version and the original is that it is heavily abridged and that the hail of feedback that ends the original serves as a transition into a chaotic rendition of Edward Elgar's \\"Land of Hope and Glory.\\" In the album's liner notes the song is credited to both Townshend and Elgar.  Release and reception  The EP was released on 11 November 1966 exclusively in the United Kingdom in mono only. It reached number one on the British EP chart, a position it would hold for four non-consecutive weeks on 17 December 1966, and once again on 7 January 1967. As the EP was not issued in the United States at the time, the tracks were long considered rare collectibles. Although the tracks \\"Disguises\\" and \\"Bucket 'T'\\" saw a release on the 1968 compilation album Magic Bus: The Who on Tour, the remainder of the tracks would not see official US releases until the deluxe edition of A Quick One and Two's Missing. \\"Bucket 'T'\\" was released as a single in several European countries. It fared well especially in Sweden, where it stayed on the charts for seven weeks, and peaked at number one for a week in February 1967. Upon its release, it garnered mixed to positive reviews. In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger states that \\"it seemed undecided as to whether it was a joke cover record, or a home for leftovers\\" and thought that \\"it ended up a little bit of both\\" Track listing References External links *The Who Official Band Website - Ready Steady Who (EP) *List of The Who singles 1966 debut EPs Albums produced by Kit Lambert The Who EPs Reaction Records EPs ","title":"Ready Steady Who"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",R]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/66.md","filePath":"quotesmag/66.md"}'),D={name:"quotesmag/66.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,F as default};
