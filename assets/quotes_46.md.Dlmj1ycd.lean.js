History  A. A. Bakikhanov noted that Nadir Shah issued an order for resettlement of the inhabitants of Shamakhi to new laid down city on the bank of Agsu River, in 1735. At present, the name of Agsu city (which is the centre of Agsu district) is shown as New Shamakhi in some sources. It is related with resettlement of the inhabitants of Shamakhi to Agsu city. Since that time, historic Shamakhi has been called Old Shamakhi, Agsu ‚Äì New Shamakhi. The name of the city existing in the 18th century was frequently shown as Agsu deriving from \\"Agsuchay\\". \\"Ruined city\\" ‚Äì ruins of the Agsu city of the memory of the 18th century is located in the north of Agsu city. Road sign at the entrance to Aghsu city S. Bronevski noted that the city was fenced with fortress walls. Castle had quadrangle and round towers. There was dug a trench in front of fortress walls. Lower part of dwelling building consisted of basements. Upper part of dwelling building tumbled down onto the basements. These holes are the remainders of the basements. Dwelling buildings were erected very close to each others. Streets were narrow, transport with wagons were not possible. Undoubtedly, central streets comparatively were wide. Earthenware of the Middle Ages and a coin minted named after Surkhay Khan were found in Agsu city. The coin had been minted before Nadir Shah's order about laying out the city. But it raises the probability of creation of Agsu city on base of Agsu village. At the same time, materials and ceramic goods belonging to 100‚Äì150 years before occupation of Shamakhi by Nadir Shah were found during initial researches in \\"Ruined city\\". Perhaps, Nadir Shah had issued an order for realization of additional works after resettlement of the inhabitants in the village. Agsu city had durable fortress walls, defensive towers in the 18th century. The city had gradually developed and it had become one of the largest cities of Azerbaijan in the end of the 18th century. V. Leviatov noted that when population of New Shamakhi (Agsu) had reached nearly 10 thousand, population of Gandja, Ardabil, Shusha, Nukha, Baku and other cities had not been over 3-8 thousand. Agsu city is the one of the important cities leading in social-political and military life of Azerbaijan in the end of Middle Ages. In 1734, Nadir Shah attacked Shamakhi with his troop. The inhabitants of Shamakhi resisted against the attack, notwithstanding Surkhay khan had left the city. In August 1734, Nadir Shah's troop overcame the resistance and the city was burnt. In 1735, Nadir Shah issued an order about laying out the new city on the bank of Agsuchay River. After construction of the new city, the inhabitants of Shamakhi were resettled here; residences of rulers of Shamakhi also were removed here. In 1743, inhabitants rebelled against the Nadir Shah's yoke. Liar princes of Safaviler ‚Äì I, II, III Sam Mirzas came out. Two of them operated in Shirvan. I Sam Mirza occupied New Shamakhi (Agsu) to the accompaniment of Surkhay Khan's troop of fifty thousand. He revoked taxes imposed by Nadir Shah. But, I Sam Mirza was killed in the war by the son of Nadir Shah Nasrullah Mirza. II Sam Mirza made a great rebellion in Shirvan together with Mohammad (the son of Surkhay), in 1743. People of Agsu banished Iranian officials from the city. But, despite of three defeats, Nasrullah occupied Agsu castle. Based on source, Persians encircled the city. The city was occupied after some days later and people were killed. Nadir Shah had called this day \\"Allah dad\\" (God, help me). There were organized independent khanates after the death of Nadir Shah (1747). The one of the khanates was Shirvan (1747‚Äì1763) which its supremacy was diarchy. At this time, feudal lords struggled against each other in Azerbaijan, in 1755, Khan of Shaki Hazhi Chalabi Khan encircled Agsu city under existing conditions. Hazhi Chalabi Khan retreated after grievous loss in the war around Agsu. Hussein Ali Khan went back to his khanate, notwithstanding Hazhi Mohammad Ali Khan had given the key of the city to him. In 1762, Transcaucasia was shrouded in plague. In 1763, Agsu and Shamakhi were amalgamated. Mohammad Said Khan and Agasi Khan occupied Agsu, and then killed Hazhi Mohammad Ali Khan. The capital was moved from Agsu to Shamakhi. In 1767, Fatali Khan (Khan of khanate Guba) and Hussein Khan (Khan of khanate Shaki) joined and encircled together to Shamakhi from two sides. But Mohammad Said Khan and Agasi Khan were not able to resist. Consequently, the capital was removed to Agsu. Sardar and Hassan estates of Shirvan were amalgamated to khanate Shaki, remained estates were amalgamated to khanate Guba. In 1769, Agsu city was ruined by the troop of Fatali khan (khan of khanate Guba), the inhabitants were removed to Shamakhi. Based on sources, all inhabitants were settled down in Shamakhi in a brief time. S. Gmelin noted that when he was in Agsu he could not find anything except destroyed buildings. Based on written information of travelers M. Biberstein, S. Bronevski and others, some streets remained deserted when Fatali Khan forced the inhabitants to deportation. Agsu city was exposed to attacks the next years. Especially, when Aga Mohammad Shah Gajar's marched to Azerbaijan, the survived inhabitants immigrated to Guba and other regions, non-survived were annihilated. So, Agsu city which was founded by Nadir Shah, was decayed by Aga Mohammad Shah Gajar. Agsu city was repeatedly exposed to feudal attacks in the 18th century. Frequent deportation, destructions made the inhabitants disappointed in living in the city. Therefore, the inhabitants did not prepare to construct glamorous buildings, tombs, mosques, bathrooms, social and official buildings. In 1967, Agsu was entitled with city-type settlement status, in the same year it was entitled with city status. Agsu has been operated as administrative-territorial district since October 8, 1943.

Its aim is to create full employment and price stability, by having the state promise to hire unemployed workers as an employer of last resort (ELR). The economic policy stance currently dominant around the world uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when inflation rises, the government pursues contractionary fiscal or monetary policy, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, reducing wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, expansionary policy aims to produce the opposite effect. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of employed people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation without the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.  Conception  The job guarantee proposal is particularly associated with certain post-Keynesian economists, particularly at the Centre of Full Employment and Equity (University of Newcastle, Australia), at the Levy Economics Institute (Bard College), and at University of Missouri ‚Äì Kansas City including the affiliated Center for Full Employment and Price Stability.Center for Full Employment and Price Stability JG draws from a social justice tradition of right to work, such as the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the US Employment Act of 1946, and an early form was proposed by Hyman Minsky. The JG proposal was conceived independently by Bill Mitchell (1998),W.F. Mitchell (1998) \\"The Buffer Stock Employment Model - Full Employment without a NAIRU\\" Journal of Economic Issues 32(2), 547-55 and Warren Mosler (1997‚Äì98).W.B. Mosler (1997-98) \\"Full Employment and Price Stability\\" Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, 20(2), 167-182 It has since been developed further by authors, including L. Randall Wray (1998),L. Randall Wray (1998) Understanding Modern Money: The Key to Full Employment and Price Stability, Edward Elgar: Northampton, MA. and a comprehensive treatment of it appears in Mitchell and Muysken (2008).W.F. Mitchell and J. Muysken (2008). Full Employment Abandoned: Shifting Sands and Policy failures ,. Edward Elgar: Cheltenham. Revised: January 2009  Overview  The JG is based on a buffer stock principle whereby the public sector offers a fixed wage job to anyone willing and able to work thereby establishing and maintaining a buffer stock of employed workers. This buffer stock expands when private sector activity declines, and declines when private sector activity expands, much like today's unemployed buffer stocks. The JG thus fulfills an absorption function to minimize the real costs associated with the flux of the private sector. When private sector employment declines, public sector employment will automatically react and increase its payrolls. So in a recession, the increase in public employment will increase net government spending, and stimulate aggregate demand and the economy. Conversely, in a boom, the decline of public sector employment and spending caused by workers leaving their JG jobs for higher paid private sector employment will lessen stimulation, so the JG functions as an automatic stabilizer controlling inflation. The nation always remains fully employed, with a changing mix between private and public sector employment. Since the JG wage is open to everyone, it will functionally become the national minimum wage. Under the JG, people of working age who are not in full-time education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage. The aim is to replace unemployment and underemployment with paid employment (up to the hours desired by workers), so that those who are at any point in time surplus to the requirements of the private sector (and mainstream public sector) can earn a wage rather than be underemployed or suffer poverty and social exclusion.  Income support  A range of income support arrangements, including a generic work-tested benefit payment, could also be available to unemployed people, depending on their circumstances, as an initial subsistence income while arrangements are made to employ them. This would rarely be necessary once the system was well established, because in most circumstances JG jobs would be immediately available and offered instead of income support.  Inflation control  The fixed JG wage provides an in- built inflation control mechanism. Mitchell (1998) called the ratio of JG employment to total employment the buffer employment ratio (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government's announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent on a range of factors including the path of the economy. There is an issue about the validity of an unchanging nominal anchor in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a nominal anchor relies on the fiscal authorities reining in any private wage-price pressures.  No relative wage effects  The JG introduces no relative wage effects and the rising demand per se does not necessarily invoke inflationary pressures because by definition it is satisfying the net savings desire of the private sector (see Mitchell and Muysken, 2008 for more details). Additionally, in today's demand constrained economies, firms are likely to increase capacity utilisation to meet the higher sales volumes. Given that the demand impulse is less than required in the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) economy, it is clear that if there were any demand-pull inflation it would be lower under the JG. There are no new problems faced by employers who wish to hire labour to meet the higher sales levels. Any initial rise in demand will stimulate private sector employment growth while reducing JG employment and spending. However, these demand pressures are unlikely to lead to accelerating inflation while the JG pool contains workers employable by the private sector.  Wage bargaining  While the JG policy frees wage bargaining from the general threat of unemployment, several factors offset this: * In professional occupational markets, while any wait unemployment will discipline wage demands, demand pressures may eventually exhaust this stock and wage-price pressures may develop. With a strong and responsive tertiary education sector, skill bottlenecks can be avoided more readily than with an unemployed buffer stock; * Private firms would still be required to train new workers in job- specific skills in the same way they would in a non-JG economy. However, JG workers are far more likely to have retained higher levels of skill than those who are forced to succumb to lengthy spells of unemployment. This changes the bargaining environment rather significantly because firms now have reduced hiring costs. Previously, the same firms would have lowered their hiring standards and provided on-the-job training and vestibule training in tight labour markets. The JG policy thus reduces the \\"hysteretic inertia\\" embodied in the long-term unemployed and allows for a smoother private sector expansion; * With high long-term unemployment, the excess supply of labour poses a very weak threat to wage bargaining, compared to a JG environment (Mitchell, 1998).  Comparison with other policies   Keynesianism  A crucial point is that the JG does not rely on the government spending at market prices and then exploiting multipliers to achieve full employment which characterizes traditional Keynesian aggregate demand management. The JG program differs in that it \\"would be targeted directly to households. It is a genuine bottom-up approach to economic recovery. It is a program that stabilizes the incomes and purchasing power of individuals at the bottom of the income distribution that trickles up and stabilizes the rest of economic activity. Strong and stable demand means strong and stable profit expectations. A program that stabilizes employment and purchasing power is a program that stabilizes cash flows and earnings. Stable incomes through employment also mean stable repayments of debts and greater overall balance sheet stability\\".Tcherneva, Pavlina R. \\"Fiscal Policy Effectiveness: Lessons from the Great Recession\\", 2011 Full employment vs full employability The JG seeks to reorient labour market policy away from the current OECD emphasis on full employability - whereby governments engage in programs to prepare the unemployed for work without guaranteeing that work will be available - towards a focus on creating enough work. The full employability agenda has come under fire from a number of sources in recent years (see, for example ILO, 2004).International Labour Organization (ILO) (2004) \\"Macroeconomic policy for growth and employment\\" Committee on Employment and Social Policy, Governing Body, 291st Session. Geneva: International Labour Office  Workfare  Workfare is a scheme where participation in activities is a requirement for obtaining social benefits. Workfare schemes may not cover all of the unemployed, and may not offer the same income as a full-time minimum wage job.  Implementation  Several modern countries have implemented direct job creation schemes to combat persistent unemployment. The first was in France, with the French government doing so in Paris from February to June 1848, through the National Workshops. The Soviet Union guaranteed a job for nearly everyone from about 1928 (as part of the Great Break) through to its end in 1991. A job guarantee was included in its 1936 constitution, and was given further prominence in the 1977 revision. Later communist states followed this lead. In the United States from 1935 to 1943, the Works Progress Administration aimed to ensure all families in the country had one paid job, though there was never a job guarantee. Full employment was achieved by 1942 due to World War II, which led to the ending of the organisation the following year. The original drafters of the Employment Act of 1946 intended for it to mandate full employment, however Congress ultimately gave it a broader pro-employment nature. The Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978 authorized the government to create a \\"reservoir of public employment\\" in case private enterprise does not provide sufficient jobs. These jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay so as to not draw the workforce away from the private sector. However, the act did not establish such a reservoir (it only authorized it), and no such program has been implemented in the United States, even though the unemployment rate has generally been above the rate (3%) targeted by the act. In the People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1997, the \\"iron rice bowl\\" practiced guaranteed employment for its citizens. From 1945, the Australian government was committed to full employment through the position established by the White Paper on Full Employment in Australia, however this never included a formal job guarantee. The Reserve Bank Act 1959 charges the Reserve Bank of Australia with ensuring full employment, amongst other duties. The Australian government has since had a \\"mutual obligation\\" regime for most unemployed people wishing to receive welfare payments nationwide from 1997 (and in remote indigenous communities from 1977). Part of this is a near-universal offer of at least 16 hours of low-paid work each week, for periods of time. For much of this regime, the work options were for employment with not-for-profit charity organisations, a government body or their own young children. These options have included Work for the Dole (from 1997), Community Development Employment Projects (1977-2015), Community Development Program (from 2015) and the Green Army Program (2014‚Äì18). More recently there have been options to do low-paid work for commercial businesses as well (Drought Force from 2003 and Youth Jobs PaTH from 2017). There is also often an option to instead undertake approved education, or to volunteer. The Victorian state government has offered the similar Drought Employment Program since 2016. The United Kingdom's New Deal was similar to Australia's program, though more focused on young people. It was in place from 1998 to 2010. The Argentine government introduced the Jefes de Hogar (Heads of Households) program in 2001 to combat the social malaise that followed the financial crisis in that year. Similarly, the government of India in 2005 introduced a five-year plan called the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) to bridge the vast rural‚Äìurban income disparities that have emerged as India's information technology sector has boomed. The program successfully empowered women and raised rural wages, but also attracted the ire of landowners who have to pay farm labourers more due to a higher prevailing wage. NREGA projects tend to be highly labour-intensive and low skill, like dam and road construction, and soil conservation, with modest but positive long-term benefits and mediocre management. The South African government introduced the Expanded Public Works Program (EPWP) in 2012 to overcome the extremely high unemployment and accompanying poverty in that country. EPWP projects employ workers with government, contractors, or other non-governmental organisations under the Ministerial Conditions of Employment for the EPWP or learnership employment conditions. Youth specific The European Youth Guarantee is a commitment by European Union member states to \\"guarantee that all young people under the age of 25 receive, within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education, a good quality work offer to match their skills and experience; or the chance to continue their studies or undertake an apprenticeship or professional traineeship.\\" The committed countries agreed to start implementing this in 2014. Since 2014, each year more than 3.5 million young people registered in the program accepted an offer of employment, continued education, a traineeship or an apprenticeship. Correspondingly, youth unemployment in the EU has decreased from a peak of 24% in 2013 to 14% in 2019. Sweden first implemented a similar guarantee in 1984, with fellow Nordic countries Norway (1993), Denmark (1996) and Finland (1996) following. Later, some additional European countries also offered this as well, prior to the EU wide adoption. Germany and many Nordic countries have long had civil and military conscription programs for young people, which requires or gives them the option to do low-paid work for a government body for up to 12 months. This was also the case in the Netherlands until 1997. It was also the case in France, and that country is reintroducing a similar program from 2021.  In popular culture  In the third season of the American political drama House of Cards, a job guarantee program, called \\"America Works,\\" is a key policy proposal of protagonist Frank Underwood (portrayed by Kevin Spacey) after he becomes President of the United States. Details of the program are sparse, but it is portrayed as involving both public sector employment (in the form of public works programs) and private sector employment (with subsidies for employers who take on new workers), and is intended to be financed with cuts to Social Security and Medicare. America Works is not fully implemented, but a pilot program centered in Washington, D.C. is portrayed as having employed tens of thousands of people before funds are rescinded.  Advocacy  The Labour Party under Ed Miliband went into the 2015 UK general election with a promise to implement a limited job guarantee (specifically, part-time jobs with guaranteed training included for long-term unemployed youth) if elected; however, they lost the election. Bernie Sanders supports a federal jobs guarantee for the United States and Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez included a jobs-guarantee program as one of her campaign pledges when she ran for, and won, her seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018.

As its name implies, it was intended for jongleurs (not just trouv√®res) and the bourgeoisie, not just the knightly class. It also did not hold poetic contests. In these ways it was distinct from the Puy d'Arras. Description The foundation of the Confr√©rie is enshrined in legend, according to which two debating jongleurs, unable to settle their differences, were approached by the Virgin Mary, who sent them to Arras, which was under the curse of the plague. There they were to adjudicate their dispute before the bishop in the cathedral of Notre-Dame. Once there, the Virgin again appeared and handed them a candle, the sainte chandelle of tradition, the melted wax from which, mingled with water, was found to heal the wounds of those afflicted with the plague, 144 that first night. In gratitude and out of praise, the jongleurs founded a confr√©rie to safeguard the candle and celebrate the religious feasts. Shortly thereafter, and quite historically, a tower was built to house the candle, which generated a sizeable profit from pilgrims. The Confr√©rie was, at the beginning, a lay religious institute. Its statutes provided for last rites, funeral services for deceased members, and a common supply of food for poorer members. Open to both men and women, it functioned through membership fees and annual dues. Members had also to swear an oath, after which they could participate in the election of the head confr√©re and his officers, who monitored members' activities to ensure compliance with the statutes. The most important document for the history of the Confr√©rie is the necrology that records the deaths of members from 1194 to 1361. Adam de la Halle and Jehan Erart were members.

The story is set during World War II and tells the story of two teenagers, one American, the other German, who join their respective armies and fight at the Battle of the Bulge. Main characters Spencer Morgan, 17 years old, drops out of his Utah high school to begin training as a paratrooper. He's seen how boys who weren't much in high school can come home heroes, and Spence wants to prove to his friends and family that he really can be something. Fifteen-year-old Dieter Hedrick's blind devotion sees him promoted from the Hitler Youth into the German Army. Dieter is determined to prove his bravery and patriotism at all costs. Setting This book takes place during World War II in Western Germany and Brigham City, Utah, USA. A small portion of the book also takes place in other parts of America and discusses various locations in Utah and the United States as training camps. Plot Dieter Hedrick, once a small and timid person, over time becomes a member of an anti-aircraft gun battery that scores at least one kill during Allied bombing raids. Moving steadily higher in rank in the Hitler Youth (in German Hitlerjugend, abbreviated HJ), Dieter is promoted to lead a group of 180 boys, who are part of the enormous project to build the Westwall (Siegfried Line) before the Allies arrive. Two fellow HJ's are less fortunate: Ernst Gessel is killed when a British Spitfire fighter strafes the site, and Willi Hoffmann is shot for attempting to desert. Dieter proves himself to be a capable leader, and he, along with a few other HJ leaders meet Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer and are decorated for their contributions to the German war effort. Dieter is anxious to fight and, following other senior HJ's, goes into the Wehrmacht. Assigned to a unit that is demoralized and badly understrength, Dieter meets Schaefer, a weary soldier whose cynical attitude contrasts sharply with Dieter's blind, fiery patriotism. Schaefer had a son, an HJ, who was killed while manning an AA gun in an Allied bombing raid and has seen far more of the war than Dieter, being a veteran of Stalingrad. He constantly criticizes Dieter's blind devotion to Hitler, truthfully saying that the war is lost for Germany and that simply living to see the end of it is the best thing any German soldier can hope for. Despite their constant arguing, Dieter gradually begins to form a father-son relationship with Schaefer. In December 1944, Spence and Dieter are both sent into the snow- covered forests of the Ardennes as Germany mounts a major offensive. When both boys kill their first enemy, they react differently. Dieter is proud to have killed an enemy of Germany, while Spence is far less enthusiastic. As fighting continues, both sides suffer losses. Ted Draney and half of Spence's company are killed after being ambushed by two Tiger I tanks and German infantry. Later, Dieter boasts of having shot several of the American infantry, while Schaefer reveals having deliberately aimed beneath them. Overnight, the Americans bring up reinforcements, with the result that when the Germans attack them again the next day, they are going up against a force much stronger than they expected. When the Germans advance on the Americans' positions, Dieter charges up the hill, making it further than anyone else, but is shot several times and is left by the surviving men of his unit as they retreat. Schaefer is killed but Dieter, unaware of this, begins to call for him with increasing desperation as the night goes on. A group of German medics attempt to retrieve Dieter, but retreat after one of their number is shot by a careless young GI. Spence, against orders from Sergeant Pappas, his squad leader, decides to crawl out onto the open ground where the Germans lost in the charge had fallen. Dieter, realizing an American has reached him, initially tries to push Spence away and cannot understand Spence asking him where he is wounded, or telling Dieter he is there to help. Spence persists, however, and uses equipment carried by the dead German medic to bandage Dieter's wounds. Dieter gradually calms down, his pain and fatigue having made him delusional. He alternately believes that Spence is actually a German soldier, there to aid a wounded comrade, or that Spence is Schaefer, who has finally come to save him. In the moments where he realizes Spence is American, Dieter is confused; his leaders had always told him that Americans were cruel and inhuman criminals, incapable of such a compassionate act. As Spence tries to get Dieter back to his own lines so he can reach medics, he is shot by German soldiers, who have decided to come get him, saying later that they could no longer stand to hear his cries for help. They assumed Spence was trying to take Dieter prisoner and thus acted to stop him. Fatally wounded, Spence soon dies on the hill. Taken to a field hospital, Dieter learns what happened to him, the American who helped him, and Schaefer. As Dieter and a sergeant from his unit await transfer from the front lines to undergo surgery, Dieter's blind patriotism begins to fade. Unable to ignore the significance of what Spence, an enemy, did for him, Dieter realizes he will think about Spence for the rest of his life. Back in the United States, a funeral is held for Spence, and a letter arrives for his parents from Sergeant Pappas. Learning that their son gave up his life to save a German, the Morgans decide against revealing this to friends and relatives, since hatred for Germans is running high and the significance of the act would not be properly understood. But they remember how Spence said that in going to war, he would not compromise any of his principles- a promise he ultimately kept.

Like other social spiders, the unique qualities of M. gregalis' web help make their social lifestyle possible. Their web preferentially transmits the vibrations of flies caught in the web while dampening out the vibrations caused by other spiders, thus allowing the M. gregalis spiders to distinguish between the prey and each other.

He stood tall and weighed . He attended the University of Maryland. A knuckleball specialist, Sleater was signed as an amateur free agent by the Boston Braves in 1946. Before the 1947 season, the Braves released him and he was signed by the Chicago Cubs. Before the 1949 season, the New York Giants purchased him from the Cubs. On April 1, 1950, the Browns selected him off waivers from the Giants. Even before reaching the big leagues, Sleater was a well-traveled player. Sleater made his big league debut with the Browns on April 25, 1950, at the age of 23. In his first game, he pitched one inning, striking out a batter and allowing no hits, no walks, and no runs. That would be his only major league game in 1950. Pitching for the 52‚Äì102 Browns in 1951, Sleater went 1‚Äì9 with a 5.11 ERA. In 81 innings, he walked 53 batters and struck out only 33, while allowing 88 hits. His five hit batsmen were ninth most in the league. On July 31 of that year, he was either purchased by the New York Yankees or traded to them. One source lists him as being purchased, while another source says he was traded with Bobby Hogue, Kermit Wahl and Tom Upton for Cliff Mapes. Either way, he never pitched for the Yankees, as he was returned to the Browns on September 16. Sleater began the 1952 season with the Browns, but lasted only four games, going 0‚Äì1 with a 7.27 ERA. On May 12, he was traded with Fred Marsh to the Senators for Cass Michaels. He finished the season with the Senators, going 4‚Äì2 with a 3.63 ERA in 57 innings. Overall, Sleater went 4‚Äì3 with a 4.11 ERA in 1952. 1952 is notable for Sleater because he halted Walt Dropo's big league record streak of reaching base via hit in 12 straight at-bats that season (he had allowed his 12th hit earlier in the game). Sleater did not play in the big leagues from 1953 to 1954. In May 1954, he was purchased by the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. He was purchased by the Yankees from Toronto on October 16, 1954. Once again, he would be in the Yankees organization, but would not play for the major league team, because he was purchased by the Athletics from the Yankees on April 28, 1955. He found his way back to the major leagues in 1955, going 1‚Äì1 with a 7.71 ERA in 16 games (one start). In 25 innings, he walked 21 batters and struck out only 11. On November 27, 1955, Sleater was drafted by the Braves from the Athletics in the Rule 5 draft. He played 25 games for the Braves in 1956, 2‚Äì2 with a 3.15 ERA in 45 innings of work. He was released by the Braves on April 11, 1957. Later that month, he was signed by the Tigers. He made 41 relief appearances for the Tigers in 1957, going 3‚Äì3 with a 3.76 ERA. On May 30 of that year, he hit a game ending home run, to become one of ten pitchers to accomplish that feat since the 1957 season. Sleater played his final season in 1958. He started the year with the Tigers, but after posting a 6.75 ERA in four games with them he was purchased by the Orioles on June 2. He appeared in six games with the Orioles, going 1‚Äì0 with a 12.86 ERA. Overall, Sleater went 1‚Äì0 with a 10.22 ERA in 10 relief appearances. He played his final major league game on September 28, and was released by the Orioles on October 16, 1959. Sleater played for a total of six major league teams in his seven-year career. Overall, Sleater went 12‚Äì18 with a 4.70 ERA. Of the 131 games he pitched, he started 21 of them. In 300 innings, he allowed 306 hits, 172 walks and he struck out only 152 batters. He was a solid batter, hitting .204 in 103 career at-bats. He hit four career home runs ‚Äì including three in 1957 ‚Äì and he struck out only 11 times.

In 1925 Fanjunkare was given relative rank above F√§nrik (Second Lieutenant) and below L√∂jtnant (Lieutenant) but remained in the NCO Corps. In 1960 Fanjunkare began to be appointed company commanders in the war-time organization and the rank became a Warrant Officer rank. Hence in 1972, professional Fanjunkare were given the rank of Captain, while Rustm√§stare and √ñverfurirer were given the rank of Fanjunkare, corresponding to their duties as First Sergeants. With the creation of a one-tier professional officer structure in 1983, promotion to Fanjunkare only took place in the reserves or among National Servicemen. In 2009, the rank was reintroduced as a professional rank with the creation of the Special Officer Corps. Before 1972 the equivalent of Fanjunkare in the artillery was Styckjunkare; a rank that goes back to the 17th century. The word comes from German St√ºckjunker, and denotes a gentleman of ordnance, hence a \\"Master Gunner\\".

It is a hunt game, and since it uses a standard Alquerque board from the game Alquerque de Doze, it is specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game). In some variants, some or all of the diagonal lines are missing which makes it difficult to classify as a tiger game in general. One hare is going up against ten to twelve opponents(hunters or hounds). The hare is the \\"tiger\\" in this hunt game which is prey and predator at the same time. The hare can capture the opponents by leaping over them (short leap method). The opponents attempt to surround and trap the hare. The game is the earliest recorded hunt game in Europe, and perhaps even the first hunt game from Europe (other than Bear games and Hare games). The earliest record of the game is in Alfonso X's \\"Libro de los juegos\\" or \\"Book of Games\\" in 1283. The record shows a game called cercar la liebre, a game played in Spain from the 13th. century until today. Cercar la liebre means \\"corner the rabbit\\", but it was the game historian H.J.R. Murray who (perhaps mistakenly) called it \\"Catch the Hare\\". The Moors may have brought the game to Spain since it uses an Alquerque board, however, there is no record of the game or any similar game in Arabic literature. Cercar la liebre evolved into many variants around the world including the games of Fox and Geese. The game has spread to Central and North America thanks to the Spanish who brought it with them during their conquest. The game was transformed in name and structure by the American natives. The new names given were pon chochotl or coyote and chickens according to game historians Stewart Culin and David Parlett, and \\"they were played by the Papago Indians of Arizona and the Tew Tribe of New Mexico who play on the same board as Alfonso‚Äôs cercar la liebre\\", and Indian and jackrabbits which are things found in the Americas. Mexicans play on one version with only two main diagonals, and this is described by Stewart Culin in his book Chess and Playing Cards: Catalogue of Games and Implements for Divination Exhibited by the United States National Museum in Connection with the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology of the University of Pennsylvania at the Cotton States and International Exposition (1895), and calls it coyote, a game from Mexico, with only the main diagonal lines present. In some cases the diagonal lines were completely removed making it difficult to classify with the other tiger games such as Bagh-Chal, Rimau- rimau, and Buga-shadara. But other hunt games such as Sua Ghin Gnua and Tiger and Buffaloes also do not have diagonal lines but may still be classified as tiger games. Today, cercar la liebre is still popular in Spain under the name juego de la liebre. Setup algebraic notation facilitates move annotation and game play discussion. A game board similar to an Alquerque board is used. In one variant, the small diagonals are removed, but the long diagonals that cross the span of the Alquerque board remain. In yet another variant, all the diagonals are removed. In all cases, there is one hare which can be represented as a black piece, and ten to twelve hunters or hounds (as agreed upon by the players) represented as white pieces. One player plays the hare, and the other plays the hunters. Here-in-forth, the white pieces will simply be called the hunters. Rules *Players alternate their turns throughout the game. *Pieces are situated on the intersection points (here-in-forth called \\"points\\") of the board, and move and capture along the lines. *In the beginning, the hare is placed at the central point of the board (at position c3). Ten hunters are place on the first two ranks of one side of the board (row 1 and 2). If twelve hunters are used, the remaining two hunters are placed on the third rank's outermost points (at positions a3 and e3). If eleven hunters are used, it is unknown where the remaining one hunter is placed on the third rank. *The hunters move first. In the English Translation of ‚ÄúThe Book of Mill‚Äù, the hare (or rabbit as written) moves first instead. The Book of Mill is the English translation of \\"Libro del alquerque\\" which is the sixth treatise of Alfonso X's \\"Libro de los juegos\\" or \\"Book of Games\\" (1283), the very book that Catch the Hare (cercar la liebre) is first documented. *Hare and hunters move alike. They move onto a vacant adjacent point along a line. Only one hunter may be moved in a turn. *A hare may capture a hunter(s), but a hare must either move or capture exclusively in a turn. *The hare can capture an adjacent hunter by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The hare leaps over an adjacent hunter, and lands on a vacant adjacent point behind. The leap must be completed in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. The hare can continue to leap over more hunters if it is able to. The hare can stop leaping anytime during the turn even when there are more hunters that could be leaped over. Captures are not compulsory. Captured pieces are removed from the board, but in some versions, the captured pieces are not removed immediately (upon being leaped over, and are instead removed at the end of the turn) allowing for the hare to leap over a previously leaped hunter which may allow the hare to capture more hunters or achieve a possibly better position for itself. * The hunters can not capture. *The hunters win if they block the hare (i.e. the hare cannot perform a legal move or capture). The hare wins if it captures enough of the hunters such that they can not effectively immobilize the hare (usually when the hunters are reduced to 9 pieces).  Variants  As stated earlier, Mexicans play on a variant of Catch the Hare with only two main diagonals which is called coyote, and it is described by Stewart Culin. A variant of that Mexican game is found in El Paso, Texas, called el coyote by Ediciones Bob, S.A. [n.d.]. In this variant, the board uses a standard Alquerque board, but it is elongated on one side by two ranks (the standard Alquerque board is not elongated by one rank on each side, but specifically elongated by two ranks on one side to maintain a specific pattern). Instead of the standard 5 √ó 5 Alquerque board, it is a 5 √ó 7 board with 35 intersection points. The match is between one coyote and twelve chickens, as opposed to one hare and twelve hunters or hounds in Catch the Hare. Furthermore, the chickens can only move straight forward, diagonally forward, and sideways, whereas the hunters or hounds can move in any direction. The twelve chickens are initially placed on the outermost intersection points of the fifth rank from the top, and occupying all the intersection points of the sixth and seventh rank. In yet another American variant, there was no piece to represent the hare on the board, and the hare's position on the board was merely pointed at with a stick which is a playing technique found in a few other games.

His hanging, along with that of two other Irgun members, triggered the Irgun's retaliatory hangings of two British sergeants. Childhood and adolescence Avshalom Haviv was born on June 18, 1926 (Tammuz 6, 5686, according to the Jewish calendar), in Haifa. His father, Eliezer Haviv, was a well-known leather merchant. His mother was Rivkah Haviv. Haviv grew up and received his education in Jerusalem, residing with his family on Straus Street. In his youth he studied at the , and as a high school student in Beit Hakerem he was drawn towards Zionist ideas. His school essays expressed opinions on the achievements of the Zionist party and the policy of the British government, which then ruled Palestine. In an essay entitled \\"The Aspirations of an Enslaved Youth\\" he included the passage: > My aspiration is: one language will take hold in the land, not German, not > Yiddish will be spoken in the land of Israel, but rather the language of the > Tanakh, the ancient language of Hebrew. My ambition is the aliyah of all of > the nation of Israel into the land of Israel and those that will dwell here > on the two sides of the Jordan river, and the land that was promised to us > by the English will be only ours. In this hoped-for time there will be here > a Hebrew state like all states. Amen, ken yihyeh ratson! [\\"Amen, may it be > your will!\\", a phrase used in the Jewish liturgy] The underground At age 15, Haviv joined the Irgun Zionist underground movement and received the nickname \\"Efraim.\\" He was initially part of Hatam - the Irgun's propaganda unit. On finishing high school, Haviv joined the Palmach, the elite fighting force of the Haganah as a condition for being allowed to study at university, as the Jewish Agency obliged all Jewish high school graduates to spend a year either working on a kibbutz or serving in the Palmach. He underwent military training at Ein Harod. On October 10, 1945, he participated in a Palmach raid on the Atlit detainee camp to free Holocaust survivors being held by the British authorities as illegal immigrants. The raid freed 208 inmates, among them Yaakov Weiss, who would go on to join the Irgun and eventually be hanged alongside Haviv. About a month after his release from the Palmach, he returned to Jerusalem and began to study Hebrew literature, philosophy, and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and at the same time returned to the Irgun. Gradually, he spent more and more time on operations with the Combat Corps of the Irgun (the HaK, hayil kravi), and as a result ended his university studies. In many operations, Haviv took on the job of machine gunner, mainly participating in attacks on the British police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Jerusalem and on the government income tax offices, as well as in mining operations in the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area against British security traffic. On January 19, 1946, Haviv participated in a joint Irgun-Lehi attack on the Central Prison in Jerusalem's Russian Compound in a failed attempt to free Jewish underground prisoners, in which two of the raiders and a British soldier and policeman were killed. On March 1, 1947, Haviv took part in an Irgun attack on a British officer's club in Goldschmidt House, which was in Jerusalem's Russian Compound. The attack took place on Shabbat, and Haviv, who was traditionally religious, left the synagogue during prayer. Haviv provided covering fire with a Bren gun for an Irgun sapper team which tossed explosive charges into the Goldschmidt House, leveling the building. During the operation, Haviv burned his hand on the gun barrel, but stayed at his post until the end of the mission. Haviv took part in the Acre Prison break on May 4, 1947, in which Irgun fighters raided Acre Prison to free Jewish underground prisoners. Haviv was the leader of a blocking squad that laid mines to delay British pursuers, allowing the getaway trucks carrying escaped prisoners and retreating raiders to escape. Dov Salomon, a senior commander participating in the operation who was responsible for calling away the blocking squads, forgot to tell Haviv that the operation was over. As a result, his squad was left behind during the withdrawal. During the retreat from Acre Prison, other Irgun members shouted at him that the operation was over, but Haviv felt he had to wait for a formal order from Salomon before withdrawing. Thus, his team did not withdraw from their post. Haviv and four other men; Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss, Amnon Michaelov, and Nahman Zitterbaum, were left behind. Haviv and his men were still at their post when the British arrived. Accounts as to what happened next vary. According to some sources, they managed to hold the British at bay until their ammunition ran out, while the prosecutor allegedly stated that Haviv claimed to be a Haganah observer when he was arrested.Cornfield, Giveon and Seligman, Max: Zion Liberated, p. 193Bell, Bowyer J.: Terror out of Zion (1976) Trial and verdict The trial began on Wednesday, May 28, 1947, after a delay of two days due to Yaakov Weiss' illness. The judges were Colonel M.E. Fell (the President of the Court), Major D. Lee Hunter, and Captain I. Stewart. The accused sang the Zionist anthem Hatikvah to the members of the court, whereupon the judges stood up to be later rebuked by the presiding judge for shaming the court. Haviv asked to read a declaration in response to the judge's question, but was told by the President of the Court that he was there to answer questions, not to recite declarations. When Haviv insisted, two policemen were ordered to bring him forward by force. Meanwhile, the accused disrupted the trial by not answering the judge's questions, asking their friends to answer for them, or alternatively got up from their places or pretended to doze off. When witnesses were called to testify, the defendants chatted among themselves and exchanged jokes. In isolated incidents the defendants referred to the events preceding their trial. Avshalom got up and asked one of the witnesses, a British soldier who was present during his detention: \\"Can you explain to me precisely what you meant when you said to me 'gas chambers are a game compared to what is expected for you in Israel'?\\" When they weren't answering questions, the defendants continued to talk amongst themselves and to draw caricatures of members of the court. The trial lasted 14 days and 35 witnesses were called before the time came for the defense to present its case. The defendants, who originally opposed the authority of the court to judge them, also opposed defense proceedings. Despite this each defendant prepared a long affidavit with statements opposing tyrannical British rule, which were delivered on June 10, 1947. In his affidavit, Haviv equated the Irish War of Independence and American Revolution to the Jewish underground struggle: He finished his speech with these words: On June 16 the court convened at 11:10. Lieutenant Colonel Norman, vice commander of the British forces in Palestine also attended the proceedings. The lawyers entered 15 minutes late and complained to the presiding judge about being subjected to a security check. This was part of the enormous ring of protection surrounding the court. The check even extended to cigarette cases, matches, and fountain pens. In unison, the indicted parties sat bound and sang songs from the Betar Revisionist Zionist youth movement, which were translated for the many foreign journalists in attendance. The defendants entered the hall under heavy guard with chains on their hands and legs. It was reported that Haviv refused to raise his legs for the manacles to be put on and in a loud voice answered the British jailer \\"If the British mandate wants to put handcuffs on me, may it submit!\\" The shackles were only removed shortly before the assembly of the panel of the court. The accused reassured their families \\"We will yet laugh at them, and if not us, others will laugh.\\" The presiding judge declared that all accused had been found guilty. At the request of the judges, lawyers brought forward documents concerning the ages of Michaelov and Nachman Zitterbaum. Consultation over the verdict lasted for nearly two hours during which time observers and journalists were transferred by the police to a grated porch under the sun. The resentment of the journalists over this \\"confinement\\" didn't help. After two hours, the presiding judge entered the hall wearing a red hat, a sign that the verdict was death. He informed the condemned that they were sentenced to \\"hanging until their spirit departs\\". Amnon Michaelov and Nachman Zitterbaum were sentenced to imprisonment \\"until the commissioner chooses to free them\\" due to their youth. When they heard the verdict the accused burst into song with the crowd in the hall joining them in a rendition of \\"Hatikvah\\". Immediately afterwards the entire crowd was put onto the barred porch for three quarters of an hour until the jury left. It was reported that the crowd were told anyone trying to leave would \\"be shot where they stood\\". The condemned parties were loaded into an armored vehicle that then made its way to the Acre Prison. Haviv's mother exercised self-control when the verdict was declared and remained silent throughout. According to the newspaper Davar, which carried out investigations in Haviv's household, his family had held on to the hope that he would be saved through a visit by the UN council. Haviv sent a message to his family: \\"We are ready to sabotage, the question is how ready are you for it?\\" On the 29th of Tammuz, anniversary of the release of Irgun leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Haviv and the two other condemned men were promoted from group leader (rosh kvutza) to sergeant (samal). The Irgun approached the UN council and asked them to annul the death sentence. This was in light of the UN calling on all sides to refrain from violence during the investigation, and also based on a similar event that had occurred in Greece along with the fact that no one from the security forces lost their life in the attack on the Acre Prison - the only victims were underground fighters. During the UN council investigation, support developed for intervention in the affair, but after the matter was brought to the chairman of the council and after stormy deliberations behind closed doors, it was decided on June 23 not to adopt a position contrary to the decision of the British mandate. A hostile government request for a conference concerning the three convicts worsened relations between the parties, and shortened the duration of the UN Council's stay. David Ben-Gurion, Chaim Weizmann, and the chief rabbis, all pleaded with the chief commissioner for amnesty. Many other bodies joined in the call for amnesty, including the council of the Sephardic union, the council of Ramat Gan, American students, and even the New York Post and Czech newspapers. The convicted men passed their time in the chamber studying and reciting Psalms. When the prisoners' rabbi Aryeh Levin visited them they received him happily and asked him to report that they were in strong condition. On July 8 at 01:00 the army commander confirmed the verdicts. In due course the Irgun would capture two British sergeants and guarantee that if the death sentence went ahead, they would hang the sergeants as \\"an eye for an eye\\".  Ascending the gallows  Monument on the grave of Avshalom Haviv On the night of Monday, July 28, the prisoners heard the sound of the Hatikvah coming from the condemned men's cells. Suddenly the rumor spread that they would be hanged that night. Throughout the whole night the three condemned men sang songs of the underground and the rebellion. At 02:00, the chief Sephardic Rabbi of Haifa, Nissim Ohana, came to see them. He spent fifteen minutes encouraging them, although the Rabbi ended up being heartened by the prisoners. Amnon Michaelov, who was judged with them and was in Acre Prison at the same time testified: Michaelov says that later that night the doors of the corridor opened and the hangman approached the convicts' cell together with some policemen, a military doctor and the manager of the prison in Nablus. Some time afterwards, prisoners once more heard the \\"Hatikvah\\" breaking from the area of the oubliette. All Jewish prisoners then joined in the singing, which rang throughout the building. After twenty minutes, at 04:00 on Tuesday, the prisoners heard Haviv singing Hatikvah as he was led to the gallows. His voice then stopped when he was hanged at 4:03. Haviv died on July 29 at the age of 21. Meir followed and like Haviv, sang until his last moments. Twenty minutes later his body was brought out, and at 04:25 Yaakov Weiss ascended the gallows, where he too sang the \\"Hatikvah\\" with other prisoners joining in.  Aftermath  Two British soldiers hanged by the Irgun in retaliation On the following day, July 30, at 10:00, the funeral cortege of the three fighters proceeded towards the graveyard in Safed in a convoy led by a military vehicle followed by a family car and the \\"chevra kadisha\\". Nakar was first to be buried followed by Weiss and Haviv. The shock in Israel was deep at the time, coming as it did on top of the SS Exodus incident. Charlton resigned as manager of the Acre Prison on the same day. It is known that he refused to execute the men personally and a replacement had to be brought in. On July 30, the Irgun carried out it's threat to kill the two British sergeants it had kidnapped earlier. The soldiers were hanged and their bodies booby-trapped and left in a grove near Netanya. This operation shocked Britain, despite the explicit threat beforehand, and brought to an end hanging of Jews in the British Mandate of Palestine. Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss and Avshalom Haviv were the last to ascend the British gallows. Today, Haviv, along with the other Olei Hagardom, is revered as a national hero in Israel. Streets have been named for him, and postage stamps bearing his image have been issued. The letters he wrote to his family and girlfriend Gila have since been compiled into a book titled Four Steps to the Gallows.

History  Mardakan is one of the oldest villages of the Absheron peninsula. It is named after a tribe called the Mards (the Azerbaijani word for \\"Braves\\") who lived in the area during the 1st century AD. Several traces of ancient settlements have been discovered close to the village. Some rocks in the area have paintings typical to the Bronze Age.  Places of interest  Mardakan castle The main points of interest of Mardakan are its castles with watchtowers, technically being keeps. There are two keeps - one being with a round tower, the other with a quadrangular tower. These towers are parts of the general chain of towers and other fortresses over the Absheron peninsula. When enemies attacked, the tops of these towers were lit up with oil to warn the population of the approaching danger. The round tower was built in the 13th century and is 15.5 meters in diameter with three stories. The quadrangular tower dates from 14th century and is about 25 meters tall with five stories. Mardakan is the favorite places for building dacha summer cottages for Baku residents. The tradition to build cottages in Mardakan dates back to the 19th century when business magnates from the emerging oil industry began to build extravagant summer houses. Nowadays, the construction boom in Mardakan continues with a wave of newly made generation of businessmen, who keep the tradition of transforming old Absheron style architecture dachas with architecture from Europe, such as French and Mediterranean house building manner. As in old days, French architecture stands out among all other architecture styles followed in the construction of summer cottages, with a whole new White City project in down town of the capital of Azerbaijan, which is purely French architecture. Mardakan has a favourable microclimate for growing fruits and vegetables. This has attracted several plantations, one of them being the Mardakan Arboretum.

It has a population of 42,196.[] According to the popular historical manuscripts, the inhabitants of the village are the descendants of an ancient nomadic Turkish tribe which defeated and brought down Cyrus the Great and settled down in Baku during the V-VI centuries. History Mashtagha Village (later transformed into a settlement) with an area of up to 6,000 hectares, which is considered to be one of the largest settlements in Baku, has an ancient history. Here are preserved ancient customs and traditions of Azerbaijan, beliefs and beliefs, mythological imaginations, oral literature. More precisely, the population of the village transmits all these generations to one another and lives today as the most beautiful spirits. The village of Mashtaga also confirms its history with its architectural monuments, which have been erected in the history of stone. Unfortunately, the extensive archaeological excavations in the village are not satisfactory, and historical facts are not satisfactory for science. Since the Middle Ages, 27 baths, 21 houses, defense towers, 20 mosques have been built in the Middle Ages, and its historic territory is rich in large-scale public buildings, leaving it second after Baku. The presence of 5 mosques, 7 baths and 5 pogroms in one neighborhood was an exception in Absheron. The word \\"Mashtaga\\" appeared before this village itself. The prominent Azerbaijani historian, Abbasqulu Agha Bakikhanov, suggested the idea of the Mashtaga toponym \\"massaget\\" in the \\"Gulustan Ilam\\". Another meaning of this place was also given to Abbasgulu Agha Bakikhanov as \\"Mashadi Agha\\" in \\"Gulistani-Iram\\". Baku khanate Mirza Muhammad khan once built a magnificent castle here. There was a mosque next to the tower. It was destroyed in the 20s of the last century. Copper coins were discovered during excavations around the village. Researchers say the village has an ancient history. Unfortunately, Mashtaga, which was exposed to the occupation of the invaders, has been repeatedly destroyed. Population According to the historical period, this village is likely to be the provincial city in the Middle Ages. Although the first information about the population of Mashtaga originates in the early 19th century, the population of this village was many times higher in the Middle Ages. The number of houses in Mashtag were 854 in 1849, 1137 in 1886 and 1260 in 1921. The population was 3619 in 1842 and was the number one among the Baku villages in the years to come, but in the years to come, the number was 6179, in 1884 it was 7784, in 1913 it was 8730, in 1926 it was 8220 and In 1939 there were 11642 people. If we did not count the villages belonging to the territory of the mining-factory region in 1913 among the Baku villages, it was still in the first place according to the population. Soviet-era construction work accelerated settlement in the village, where the fastest growing. The population was 16.9 thousand in 1959, 22.2 thousand in 1970, 31.9 thousand in 1979, 40.2 thousand in 1989, 38.9 thousand in 1999, 43.7 thousand per year and 45.1 thousand people in 2016.State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan  Notable natives  * Mammed Mammadyarov ‚Äî revolutionary, People's Commissar of Social Security of the Azerbaijan SSR (1922‚Äì1927). * Yashar Nuri ‚Äî People's Artist of Azerbaijan, Laureate of the State Prize of the Republic of Azerbaijan. * Alibaba Mammadov ‚Äî People's Artist of Azerbaijan, singer, professor. * Salam Kadirzadeh ‚Äî Azerbaijani writer, journalist, writer. * Boyukaga Gasimzadeh ‚Äî poet, translator, member of Azerbaijan Writers' Union since 1939.

The conflict started in the town of Sampit, Central Kalimantan Province, and spread throughout the province, including the capital, Palangkaraya. The conflict was between the indigenous Dayak people and the migrant Madurese from the island of Madura off Java. The conflict broke out on February 18, 2001 when two Madurese were attacked by a number of Dayaks. The conflict resulted in more than 500 deaths, with over 100,000 Madurese displaced from their homes. Hundreds of Madurese were also found to be decapitated by the Dayaks. Background The Sampit conflict in 2001 was not an isolated incident, as there had been previous incidents of violence between the Dayaks and the Madurese. The last major conflict occurred between December 1996 and January 1997, and resulted in more than 600 deaths. The Madurese first arrived in Borneo in 1930 under the transmigration program initiated by the Dutch colonial administration, and continued by the Indonesian government. In 1999, Malays and Dayaks joined together in Kalimantan in Indonesia to persecute and massacre Madurese during the Sambas conflict. Madurese were mutilated, raped, and killed by the Malays and Dayaks and 3,000 of them died in the massacres, with the Indonesian government doing little to stop the violence.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia-pacific/1186401.stm http://www.culturalsurvival.org/ourpublications/csq/article/violence- indonesian-borneo-spurs-relocation-ethnic-madurese http://indahnesia.com/indonesia/SAMPEO/people.php https://books.google.com/books?id=OrdM8X7CBTAC&pg;=PA299&lpg;=PA299&dq;=dayaks+malay+madurese&source;=bl&ots;=uZeyxBWjTh&sig;=HJgReO2XzQEeybz5g8k2mMqTKXk&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=e8_vUpXQJqvJsQTvt4GYDA&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q;=dayaks%20malay%20madurese&f;=false https://books.google.com/books?id=EUDii8kvQYAC&pg;=PA73#v=onepage&q;&f;=false In 2000, transmigrants made up 21% of the population in Central Kalimantan. The Dayaks came into competition with the highly visible and industrious Madurese and in places like Sampit the Madurese quickly dominated low-level sectors of the economy, which negatively affected the Dayaks' employment prospects. Additionally, new laws had allowed the Madurese to assume control of many commercial industries in the province, such as logging, mining, and plantations. There are a number of stories purportedly describing the incident that sparked the violence in 2001. One version claims that it was caused by an arson attack on a Dayak house. Rumours spread that the fire was caused by Madurese, and later a group of Dayaks began burning houses in a Madurese neighborhood. Professor Usop of the Dayak People's Association claims that the massacres by the Dayaks were in self-defense, after Dayaks were attacked. It was claimed that a Dayak was tortured and killed by a gang of Madurese following a gambling dispute in the nearby village of Kerengpangi on December 17, 2000. Another version claims that the conflict started in a brawl between students of different races at the same school. Decapitations of Madurese At least 300 Madurese were decapitated by the Dayaks during the conflict. The Dayaks have a long history in the ritual practice of headhunting, though the practice was thought to have gradually died out in the early 20th century as it was discouraged by the Dutch colonial rulers. Response by authorities The scale of the massacre and intensity of the aggression made it difficult for the military and the police to control the situation in Central Kalimantan. Reinforcements were sent in to help existing military personnel in the province. By February 18, the Dayaks assumed control over Sampit. Police arrested a local official believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the attacks. The masterminds are suspected of paying six men to provoke the riot in Sampit. The police also arrested a number of Dayak rioters following the initial murder spree. A few days later, on February 21, thousands of Dayaks surrounded a police station in Palangkaraya demanding the release of Dayak detainees. The Indonesian police succumbed to this demand given that they were vastly outnumbered by the aggressive Dayaks. By February 28, the Indonesian military had managed to clear the Dayaks off the streets and restore order, but sporadic violence continued throughout the year.

It is formed by a small amount of cervical mucus. The mucus plug acts as a protective barrier by deterring the passage of bacteria into the uterus, and contains a variety of antimicrobial agents, including immunoglobulins, and similar antimicrobial peptides to those found in nasal mucus. Normally during human pregnancy, the mucus is cloudy, clear, thick, and sticky. Toward the end of the pregnancy, when the cervix thins, some blood is released into the cervix which causes the mucus to become bloody. As the woman gets closer to labor, the mucus plug discharges as the cervix begins to dilate. The plug may come out as a plug, a lump, or simply as increased vaginal discharge over several days. The mucus may be tinged with brown, pink, or red blood, which is why the event is sometimes referred to as \\"bloody show\\". Loss of the mucus plug does not necessarily mean that delivery or labor is imminent. Having intercourse or a vaginal examination can also disturb the mucus plug and cause a woman to see some blood-tinged discharge, even when labor does not begin over the next few days.Signs of labor - BabyCenter References Obstetrics Midwifery ","title":"Cervical mucus plug"},{"id":"18839584","title":"Lewis Young"},{"id":"18839585","text":"Qaradƒ±rnaq (also, Karadyrnak and Karadyrnakh) is a village and municipality in the Barda Rayon of Azerbaijan.

He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. Life The second but eldest surviving son of Sir Thomas Miller, 5th Baronet, Miller became a Church of England priest and Vicar of Froyle, Hampshire, in 1811. He was largely responsible for the rebuilding of the nave of the parish church in 1812. He had an elder brother, John Miller, who died in 1804, so in 1816 he inherited the family seat, Froyle Place, becoming both Vicar and Lord of the manor of Froyle. For many years he had a curate named Aubutin who took care of the stained glass in the church.Hist.

The purpose of a test strategy is to provide a rational deduction from organizational, high-level objectives to actual test activities to meet those objectives from a quality assurance perspective. The creation and documentation of a test strategy should be done in a systematic way to ensure that all objectives are fully covered and understood by all stakeholders. It should also frequently be reviewed, challenged and updated as the organization and the product evolve over time. Furthermore, a test strategy should also aim to align different stakeholders of quality assurance in terms of terminology, test and integration levels, roles and responsibilities, traceability, planning of resources, etc. Test strategies describe how the product risks of the stakeholders are mitigated at the test-level, which types of testing are to be performed, and which entry and exit criteria apply. They are created based on development design documents. System design documents are primarily used, and occasionally conceptual design documents may be referred to. Design documents describe the functionality of the software to be enabled in the upcoming release. For every stage of development design, a corresponding test strategy should be created to test the new feature sets.  Test levels  The test strategy describes the test level to be performed. There are primarily three levels of testing: unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. In most software development organizations, the developers are responsible for unit testing. Individual testers or test teams are responsible for integration and system testing.  Roles and responsibilities  The roles and responsibilities of the test leader, individual testers, and project manager are to be clearly defined at a project level in this section. This may not have names associated, but the role must be very clearly defined. Testing strategies should be reviewed by the developers. They should also be reviewed by test leads for all levels of testing to make sure the coverage is complete, yet not overlapping. Both the testing manager and the development managers should approve the test strategy before testing can begin.  Environment requirements  Environment requirements are an important part of the test strategy. It describes what operating systems are used for testing. It also clearly informs the necessary OS patch levels and security updates required. For example, a certain test plan may require Windows 8.1 to be installed as a prerequisite for testing.  Testing tools  There are two methods used in executing test cases: manual and automated. Depending on the nature of the testing, it is usually the case that a combination of manual and automated testing is the best testing method.  Risks and mitigation  Any risks that will affect the testing process must be listed along with the mitigation. By documenting a risk, its occurrence can be anticipated well ahead of time. Proactive action may be taken to prevent it from occurring, or to mitigate its damage. Sample risks are dependency of completion of coding done by sub- contractors, or capability of testing tools.  Test schedule  A test plan should make an estimation of how long it will take to complete the testing phase. There are many requirements to complete testing phases. First, testers have to execute all test cases at least once. Furthermore, if a defect was found, the developers will need to fix the problem. The testers should then re-test the failed test case until it is functioning correctly. Last but not the least, the tester need to conduct regression testing towards the end of the cycle to make sure the developers did not accidentally break parts of the software while fixing another part. This can occur on test cases that were previously functioning properly. The test schedule should also document the number of testers available for testing. If possible, assign test cases to each tester. It is often difficult to make an accurate estimate of the test schedule since the testing phase involves many uncertainties. Planners should take into account the extra time needed to accommodate contingent issues. One way to make this approximation is to look at the time needed by the previous releases of the software. If the software is new, multiplying the initial testing schedule approximation by two is a good way to start.  Regression test approach  When a particular problem is identified, the programs are debugged and the fix is applied to the program. To make sure that the fix works, the program will be tested again for that criterion. Regression tests will make sure that one fix does not create some other problems in that program or in any other interface. So, a set of related test cases may have to be repeated again, to make sure that nothing else is affected by a particular fix. How this is going to be carried out must be elaborated in this section. Consider different testing levels when selecting regression test cases. Unit-, integration- and system test cases are good candidates. Select cases that have direct relationship with the fix and also include few business critical cases that prove basic business scenarios still work. Remember also that non- functional testing (security, performance, usability) plays an important role in proving business continuation. In some companies, whenever there is a fix in one unit, all unit test cases for that unit will be repeated, to achieve a higher level of quality.  Test groups  From the list of requirements, we can identify related areas, whose functionality is similar. These areas are the test groups. For example, in a railway reservation system, anything related to ticket booking is a functional group; anything related with report generation is a functional group. In the same way, we have to identify the test groups based on the functionality aspect.  Test priorities  Among test cases, we need to establish priorities. While testing software projects, certain test cases will be treated as the most important ones, and if they fail the product cannot be released. Some other test cases may be treated as cosmetic and if they fail, we can release the product without much compromise on the functionality. These priority levels must be clearly stated. These may be mapped to the test groups also.  Test status collections and reporting  When test cases are executed, the test leader and the project manager must know, where exactly the project stands in terms of testing activities. To know where the project stands, the inputs from the individual testers must come to the test leader. This will include, what test cases are executed, how long it took, how many test cases passed, how many failed, and how many are not executable. Also, how often the project collects the status is to be clearly stated. Some projects will have a practice of collecting the status on a daily basis or weekly basis.  Test records maintenance  When the test cases are executed, it is important to keep track of the execution details such as when it is executed, who did it, how long it took, what is the result etc. This data must be available to the test leader and the project manager, along with all the team members, in a central location. This may be stored in a specific directory in a central server and the document must say clearly about the locations and the directories. The naming convention for the documents and files must also be mentioned.  Requirements traceability matrix  Ideally, the software must completely satisfy the set of requirements. From design, each requirement must be addressed in every single document in the software process. The documents include the HLD, LLD, source codes, unit test cases, integration test cases and the system test cases. In a requirements traceability matrix, the rows will have the requirements. The columns represent each document. Intersecting cells are marked when a document addresses a particular requirement with information related to the requirement ID in the document. Ideally, if every requirement is addressed in every single document, all the individual cells have valid section ids or names filled in, then we know that every requirement is addressed. If any cells are empty, it represents that a requirement has not been correctly addressed.  Test summary  The senior management may like to have test summary on a weekly or monthly basis. If the project is very critical, they may need it even on daily basis. This section must address what kind of test summary reports will be produced for the senior management along with the frequency. The test strategy must give a clear vision of what the testing team will do for the whole project for the entire duration. This document can be presented to the client, if needed. The person who prepares this document must be functionally strong in the product domain, with very good experience, as this is the document that is going to drive the entire team for the testing activities. Test strategy must be clearly explained to the testing team members right at the beginning of the project.

Biography   1921‚Äì1936: Early years in England  A. Graham Maxwell was born in Watford, England on July 18, 1921. His father was \\"Uncle Arthur\\" Maxwell, who was known for his children's books. His mother was Rachel Elizabeth Maxwell (n√©e Joyce). In the Maxwell home were six children, four boys and two girls. First Maureen, then Graham, Mervyn, Lawrence, Malcolm, and Deirdre. All the children in their younger days attended non-Adventist schools. They all grew up devoted Seventh-day Adventists. Most of them became influential leaders within the church.British Advent Messenger, August 15, 1969, p. 14 Music played an important part in young Maxwell's life. At fifteen years of age he sang for the 1936 British Union's quadrennial session held at Stanborough Park. The British Advent Messenger reported that \\"Master Graham Maxwell, the boy singer of the Stanborough Park church, pleasingly rendered the solo, 'How lovely are Thy dwellings'\\".BAM, August 11, 1936, p. 15 A week earlier, at a youth rally, he is reported to have sung what some might view as a prayer later answered in his own life, \\"God Make Me Kind.\\" BAM, August 4, 1936, p. 12 Early influences apart from immediate family include R. A. Anderson who was an associate of his father. (Anderson received a call to California the same time his father did.);BAM, August 11, 1936, p. 32 F. C. Gilbert;BAM, August 4, 1936, p. 1 W.G.C.

Spencer's influence was one of respected service and the occasional visit, such as the 1936 meetings, also attended by the 15-year-old Maxwell.BAM, August 4, 1936, p. 11  1938‚Äì1943: Student years at Pacific Union College  He came to America in 1936, and lived in Los Altos, California where his father was editor for the Signs of the Times.British Advent Messenger (BAM), August 11, 1936, p. 32 In 1938, he began studies at Pacific Union College. He was the spokesperson for the new students at the reception and handshake services.Pacific Union Recorder (PUR), September 28, 1938, p.12 By 1940, he held was one of the student leaders.PUR, February 28, 1940, p. 5 He helped earn his way through college by selling Christian books as a colporteur.PUR, May 28, 1941, p. 15 Maxwell began teaching Greek as a student in 1942. Maxwell graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Pacific Union College with a double major in Ministerial and Biblical Languages. He met Rosalyn Helen Gildersleeve at Pacific Union College, and they married in 1943. They had three girls, Lorna, Audrey and Alice. By his death in 2010, he had 7 grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren.  1943‚Äì1961: Teaching years at Pacific Union College  =Professional development= Maxwell taught at Pacific Union College full-time from 1944 until 1961. In 1944, Pacific Union College awarded him a Master of Arts degree along with Raymond F. Cottrell and James Paul Stauffer.PUR June 14, 1944, p. 2 In 1945, as instructor of Greek and English, he gave the April Rine lecture before an audience of teachers and students of the English and language departments. His subject was the Romantic movement in English literature.PUR, May 2, 1945, p. 8. In 1946 Maxwell met W. G. C. Murdoch, the principal of the England's SDA college. Murdoch reported: > \\"It was a pleasant surprise to meet young Graham Maxwell in Chicago. Graham > has grown to be very like his father and is giving such promise as a teacher > that the college board of Pacific Union College has voted him time off to > study for his doctor's degree at the University of Chicago...\\" BAM, June 28, > 1946, p. 8.

Maxwell remained division chair until moving to Loma Linda in 1961. =Leadership experience= In 1948, Maxwell was elected president of the PUC Alumni Association (for a two-year term.) PUR, April 12, 1948, p. 8 In July, 1950, some 500 P.U.C. alumni gathered in San Francisco's Whitcomb Hotel for a Luncheon timed to coincide with the influx of denominational workers from all over the world for the General Conference meetings. Maxwell was toastmaster for the occasion.PUR, July 17, 1950, p. 8. Back on campus, he organized and led out in faculty and staff social events.As an example, see: PUR, December 18, 1950, p. 8. In 1950, both he and his brother Mervyn were ordained to the Gospel ministry.Ministry, January, 1951, p. 44  1961‚Äì1988: Teaching years at Loma Linda University  Maxwell taught at Loma Linda University for the next 27 years, and for 15 of those years he was the Director of the Division of Religion. In 1983, at a ministerial retreat in Michigan, Maxwell was honored for forty years of service to the Seventh-day Adventist church.Lake Union Herald, October 11, 1983, p. 3 In 1988 he retired from Loma Linda University as an Emeritus Professor of New Testament. He was a grammarian in German, Spanish, English, Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic, yet was noted for his willingness to learn from those he taught. Maxwell influenced many people within his denomination. For most of his adult career he taught a Sabbath School class which had a profound impact on many of those attending. He used the Socratic method of teaching. He insisted that his students think things out.Tom Z, Spectrum Magazine blog, Remembering Graham Maxwell, posted December 3 and 8, 2010 To encourage such thinking, he began a class in what he called Biblical Philosophy. Central to this philosophy were these questions: \\"Is God arbitrary, vengeful, stern, and severe; as His enemies have made Him out to be? Or, is He very patient, and kind, and forgiveness personified?\\" Keith J, Spectrum Magazine blog, Remembering Graham Maxwell, posted December 27, 2010 His sense of humor was appreciated by many. One associate describes a visit by Maxwell to their house. It was middle August in Southern California. The father of the house \\"came to the door wearing a plaid work shirt, open at the neck to reveal heavy underwear, heavy wool pants, wearing lined gloves.\\" Maxwell asked him if he could come up to his house which was under construction, and give him some building advice. The father agreed and went to get his cap and jacket. The son said to Maxwell that his father seems to have the same problem that King David had in old age. Maxwell paused for a second and then said, \\"Yes, but it seems he has found a different solution.\\"  1988‚Äì2010: Retirement years  In 2005, A special event celebrating the founding of Loma Linda University took place November 11 to 13, at Loma Linda University's Drayson Center. On Sabbath morning, November 12, worship services were led by longtime faculty members Maxwell and Louis Venden.LLU's TODAY news for Thursday, November 10, 2005 In 2006, at the Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center (LLUAHSC) Centennial Gala, ‚ÄúLooking Back to the Future,‚Äù held on April 9, Maxwell was honored with the Vanguard Award for Mission of Wholeness, \\"to make man whole‚Äù, along with eleven others. Recipients for the Vanguard Award for Mission of Wholeness were: Wil Alexander, Leonard Brand, Beverly Buckles, Harrison Evans, Kiti Freier, Gordon Hadley, George Hardinge IV, Lucille Lewis, Maxwell, William Murdoch Jr., Jack Provonsha, and Gerald Winslow.TODAY news for Thursday, April 20, 2006  Theology   God  = Can God Be Trusted? = In December, 1976, Neal C. Wilson, President of the North American Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church visited Maxwell at Loma Linda University. Subsequently in the Review and Herald, he announced: > \\"Early in December I was at Loma Linda University and visited with A. Graham > Maxwell about the progress he is making in writing two books. The first > deals with the question \\"Can God be trusted?\\" and the second develops the > theme \\"The picture of God and what we are told about His character in all 66 > books of the Bible.\\"... > \\"Dr. Maxwell, a respected and much-appreciated professor of religion at Loma > Linda University, has been granted a leave of absence for three quarters to > concentrate on writing these much-needed books. One of the critical issues > currently being discussed in theological circles and religious journals has > to do with misconceptions about God's character. This should come as no > surprise to Seventh-day Adventists, because Ellen G. White has warned us > that in the final struggle of the great controversy between Christ and Satan > everything possible will be done to distort and malign God's character. > Creating doubt and destroying faith in the integrity of God's character has > been one of the most effective tools employed by Satan. Each of us is a > target for the deceptive efforts of evil forces seeking to discredit God's > love and weaken faith in His word...\\" Review and Herald, January 13, 1977, > p. 32 Maxwell's book Can God Be Trusted? became the Seventh-day Adventist Church's Missionary Book of the Year for 1978.Review and Herald, November 10, 1977, p.32 This book was published by sections in the twelve issues of the Signs of the Times in that same year. =Belief in a personal God= Maxwell held to a theistic worldview. In his book Can God Be Trusted he begins by describing a conflict that arose between God and Lucifer who later became known as Satan. Adventists consider this the beginning of what they refer to as the Great Controversy. Maxwell focused on Lucifer's lies about God: > \\"To set himself up as God he first must undermine confidence in the One he > wished to supplant, and he sought to do this by destroying God's reputation. > Since he could find no fault in God, he must resort to lying and deceit. So > began that long struggle for the loyalty of God's free, intelligent > creatures. Who was right? God or the brilliant Light Bearer? Could it be > true that God was arbitrary and severe, unworthy of the love and trust of > the beings He had made? What kind of god would allow his character to be so > challenged? Was it strength or weakness that led our God to permit such long > debate, to allow this controversy to spread throughout His universe? Finally > Satan and his followers ventured into open revolt. Then God, in His > farsighted plan for the best good of all concerned, expelled the rebels from > His presence, and the great controversy was extended to the planet on which > we live.\\" Can God Be Trusted, Part One, Signs of the Times, January 1, 1978, > p 17 God, according to Maxwell, was the creator of all things who took actions motivated by love for all.  The Bible as God's special revelation  =Bible translations and the word of God= In 1952, at thirty-one years of age, Elder Maxwell expressed confidence and good will toward Biblical scholars and translators. He stated that their work in translating the Bible may be of varied quality, but any version sincerely prepared by a qualified scholar(s) may rightfully claim to be the word of God: > \\"A recent sensational article in Look magazine has suggested that modern > research among the ancient manuscripts of the Bible is revealing that > actually we are quite uncertain about the authenticity of a large share of > the Biblical text. The writer was particularly referring to an enormous > research project now in progress on both sides of the Atlantic with > headquarters at Oxford and Chicago Universities. The purpose of this vast > endeavor is to completely recheck the sources of the New Testament text in > the thousands of Greek manuscripts, the early versions, the lectionaries, > and the writings of the early fathers of the church. I have watched friends > of mine at work on this project‚Äîand very tedious but thorough work it is. > The results will hardly be those so shockingly presented in the Look > article, but rather will provide further evidence of the remarkable > preservation of the Scriptural text. There is still only one Bible, but more > and still more versions. Not all are of equal quality, but any version > sincerely prepared by an adequately qualified scholar or committee of > scholars‚Äîand this would include all of the better known versions‚Äîmay > rightfully claim to be the word of God.\\" Signs of the Times, October 7, > 1952, pp. 5-6  Salvation  = Sin = Maxwell defined sin as a \\"breakdown of trust in God\\" Conversations about God #1, Conflict in God's family. He wrote: > \\"The fact that God‚Äôs friends are not so preoccupied with their legal > standing does not mean that they take sin lightly. Precisely the opposite is > true! Whereas servants are concerned about breaking the rules, friends are > concerned about anything that would undermine trust and damage their > relationship with God. Most of all, they are concerned about anything that > would in any way misrepresent God‚Äîwhether or not the details have been > spelled out in any law. Friends understand salvation as the healing of the > damage sin has done. And sin‚Äôs damage, if not healed, is nothing less than > fatal. Disorderly, irresponsible behavior, if persisted in, can totally > destroy the capacity for trust and trustworthiness. To the servant, what > makes sin most dangerous is that it angers God. To the friend, what makes > sin most dangerous is what it does to the sinner. To persist in sin is to > destroy oneself.\\" Servants or Friends, Chapter 8, p. 113 =The Gospel as the good news about God= > \\"The good news is that God is not the kind of person Satan has made Him out > to be... Since the great controversy began, it has been Satan's studied > purpose to persuade angels and men that God is not worthy of their faith and > love. He has pictured the Creator as a harsh, demanding tyrant who lays > arbitrary requirements upon His people just to show His authority and test > their willingness to obey... (But) instead of destroying or resorting to > force, God simply took His case into court. In order to prove the rightness > of His cause, to demonstrate that His way of governing the universe was the > best for all concerned, God humbly submitted His own character to the > investigation and judgment of His creatures... The good news is that God has > won His case. Though all of us should let Him down, God cannot lose His > case. He has already won! The universe has conceded that the evidence is on > His side, that the devil has lied in his charges against God.\\"Signs of the > Times, March, 1978, p. 19 Maxwell asserted that Jesus showed the truth about the Father: > \\"It is finished,\\" Jesus cried. John 19:30. By the life that He lived and the > unique and awful way He died, Jesus has demonstrated the righteousness of > His Father and has answered any question about God's character and > government. See Romans 3:25, 26.\\" =Controversy about salvation= Many charges have been made that Maxwell taught the moral influence theory of the atonement although Maxwell denied it.Seeking a Sanctuary, p81. See also pages 389 and 485 Alden Thompson has compared various different Adventist theologians to either Peter, Paul or Apollos. He compares Maxwell to Apollos, because of their shared emphasis on God's love.Alden Thompson, \\"The Adventist Church at Corinth\\", sermon at Walla Walla College Church on December 9, 1989. (Perhaps also \\"The Adventists at Corinth and Their Favorite Preachers\\" September 30, 1991).  Christian life  =Prayer and Bible application= In 1941, at twenty years of age, student colporteur Maxwell expressed his belief in prayer and in persistence. He used a biblical story to help him meet a difficult situation while selling Christian books: > \\"The desert has taught me many lessons that I shall never forget. It has > taught me that the best substitute for 'high pressure' is prayerful > persistence. Six times I called on one desert family, and six times I came > away without an order. There was always some reason why they could not take > time to see me. Then I recalled how Joshua conquered the city of Jericho, > and back I went the seventh time! And just as the walls of Jericho fell flat > as the Israelites encompassed the city the seventh time, so the walls of > resistance crumbled around this desert family, and I left them with the > largest order I have yet received! To my fellow wingmen I would suggest: > 'Remember Jericho! Pray often, and never give up until you have called the > seventh time!' \\" Pacific Union Recorder, July 23, 1941, p. 5 =Sanctification and perfection= During the 1950s, those who reported on Maxwell's talks for church periodicals commented on his strong emphasis on perfection: > 1951\\\\. \\"Youth Rally Speaker. The featured speaker of the Sabbath afternoon > regional youth rally, February 17, was Elder Graham Maxwell, of Pacific > Union College. He appealed for everyone to strive more earnestly to become > like Christ in character‚ÄîNOW.\\" PUR, March 5, 1951, p. 12. > 1952\\\\. \\"Newbury Park Academy News Notes: ... Each student is striving more > diligently for the goal of perfection, especially after Elder Graham Maxwell > from Pacific Union College gave the spring Week of Prayer studies, pointing > out that perfection should be our goal if we are to attain eternal life.\\" > PUR, May 19, 1952, p. 9. > 1954\\\\. Maxwell writes: \\"Recently I had the privilege of helping with the > spring week of devotion on the Loma Linda campus of the College of Medical > Evangelists, April 11‚Äì17... The discussions during the week were based on > the question \\"When will Jesus return?\\" and on the answer found in that > memorable sentence in Christ's Object Lessons, page 69, 'When the character > of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come.' > \\"Review and Herald, July 1, 1954, p. 13 > 1958\\\\. \\" 'Be Ye Therefore Perfect' was the sermon delivered by Elder Graham > Maxwell, teaching us that we can and we must be perfect to meet Jesus when > He comes again soon.\\" PUR. December 1, 1958, p. 9 This emphasis on \\"Perfection\\" could be the same as emphasis on \\"wholesome Christian living\\". Maxwell conducted a Spring Week of Prayer in 1953 at La Sierra College. He was invited back to conduct another Spring Week of Prayer in 1956: > \\"The speaker for the annual spring Week of Prayer being conducted at La > Sierra College March 16‚Äì24 is A. Graham Maxwell, professor of Biblical > languages at Pacific Union College. This is a return appointment for > Professor Maxwell, as he conducted a similar week here three years ago. His > fine understanding of our young people and their church and his contagious > enthusiasm for wholesome Christian living make him especially effective in > working with Adventist youth. The students and faculty here genuinely > appreciate his work.\\" PUR. March 19, 1956, p. 16  Last things  =The final conflict= =The destruction of the wicked= Isaiah 33:14-17 asks who can live in the eternal fire and the answer is the righteous people. Graham Maxwell taught that hell fire is not the same substance as say in lighting a match or in a volcano, but that it is the glory, beauty and love of God seeing God in all God's brightness and glory. God treats everyone the same. Everyone is welcomed into heaven, however some will find it heaven to be there with God and their loved ones. But just as when Jesus was on earth some loved to be with him others wanted to be away from him even to the point of wanting to put him to death. So at the end as we see God visible in person those who are used to yielding to the Holy Spirit's prompting will find it heaven to live in the eternal fire, living forever with God. But others will choose to separate themselves from God. Since God is the only source of life, if you separate yourself from the only source of life the only other option is death, with God crying \\"Why oh why will you die? How can I give you up? How can I let you go?\\" but God will not force the will to force them to be citizens of heaven and thus allow them to have the natural result of their choice. =The Earth made new=  Criticisms of Maxwell's theology   Adventist publications avoid opposing Maxwell by name  The Adventist Church has not published any specific criticism against Maxwell by name. It has addressed concerns for those within the church who promote what has been called the moral influence theory of atonement. Maxwell and those who support his teachings have denied that their views are the same as the Moral Influence Theory. In 1990, Dr. Alden Thompson, of Walla Walla College's Department of Theology, noted this practice of avoiding the direct naming of individuals and expressed the wish that the church could be more open and still respect those who differ: > \\"...George Knight has given me permission to use his recent book on the > atonement, My Gripe With God (Review and Herald,1990) to illustrate my > point. Knight and I agree that naming names would be good. But we probably > don't see eye to eye on the atonement ‚Äî a topic on which two people could > likely never agree! Knight argues that the (objective) substitutionary view > of the atonement is the foundation for all other views. In the process, he > critiques the subjective view of the atonement as articulated among > Adventists by Maxwell and Jack Provonsha. But Knight does not mention > Maxwell and Provonsha by name. I wish he had. I wish it were safe to do so ‚Äî > without jeopardizing the status of Knight, Maxwell, or Provonsha as faithful > and committed Adventists. Knight looks to Paul for support (especially > Romans and Galatians); Maxwell and Provonsha appeal to John (especially John > 14-17). The perspectives are different; both are biblical; we should expect > both in the church. But a tug-of-war view of truth tempts us to homogenize > John and Paul, making them say the same thing, namely, what we want or need > to hear. Then we can't hear our brothers and sisters, or listen to their > needs, letting them hear Paul or John as needed, so that they, too, can > worship God with all their hearts and love their neighbors as themselves...\\" > The North Pacific Union Gleaner, May 18, 1992, p. 6  Concerns raised by Adventist scholars  Maxwell was well known for his book, Can God Be Trusted? It was a denominational book of the year. David McMahon says it \\"is conspicuous for what it omits in discussing the atonement.\\"David P. McMahon. Ellet Joseph Waggoner: The Myth and the Man (Fallbrook, California: Verdict Publications, 1979). Chapter 10, \\"Waggoner in Retrospect\\" ‚Äì SDANet version, Present Truth magazine version He compares the chapter, \\"Why Did Jesus Have to Die?\\" to a similarly titled much earlier article by E. J. Waggoner, \\"Why Did Christ Die?\\" (British) Present Truth 21 September 1893, p385‚Äì88.

The total path length for the entire program could be deemed a measure of the algorithm's performance on a particular computer hardware. The path length of a simple conditional instruction would normally be considered as equal to 2, one instruction to perform the comparison and another to take a branch if the particular condition is satisfied. The length of time to execute each instruction is not normally considered in determining path length and so path length is merely an indication of relative performance rather than in any sense absolute. When executing a benchmark program, most of the instruction path length is typically inside the program's inner loop. Before the introduction of caches, the path length was an approximation of running time, but in modern CPUs with caches, it can be a much worse approximation, with some load instructions taking hundreds of cycles when the data is not in cache, or orders of magnitude faster when in cache (even the same instruction in another round in a loop). Assembly programs Since there is, typically, a one-to-one relationship between assembly instructions and machine instructions, the instruction path length is frequently taken as the number of assembly instructions required to perform a function or particular section of code. Performing a simple table lookup on an unsorted list of 1,000 entries might require perhaps 2,000 machine instructions (on average, assuming uniform distribution of input values), while performing the same lookup on a sorted list using a binary search algorithm might require only about 40 machine instructions, a very considerable saving. Expressed in terms of instruction path length, this metric would be reduced in this instance by a massive factor of 50 a reason why actual instruction timings might be a secondary consideration compared to a good choice of algorithm requiring a shorter path length. The instruction path length of an assembly language program is generally vastly different than the number of source lines of code for that program, because the instruction path length includes only code in the executed control flow for the given input and does not include code that is not relevant for the particular input, or unreachable code. High-level language (HLL) programs Since one statement written in a high-level language can produce multiple machine instructions of variable number, it is not always possible to determine instruction path length without, for example, an instruction set simulator that can count the number of 'executed' instructions during simulation. If the high-level language supports and optionally produces an 'assembly list', it is sometimes possible to estimate the instruction path length by examining this list. Factors determining instruction path length * in-line code versus the overheads of calling and returning from a function, procedure, or method containing the same statements * order of items in unsorted lookup list most frequently occurring items should be placed first to avoid long searches * choice of algorithm indexed, binary or linear (item-by- item) search * calculate afresh versus retain earlier calculated (memoization) may reduce multiple complex iterations * read some tables into memory once versus external read afresh each time avoiding high path length through multiple I/O function calls Use of instruction path lengths From the above, it can be realized that knowledge of instruction path lengths can be used: * to choose an appropriate algorithm to minimize overall path lengths for programs in any language * to monitor how well a program has been optimized in any language * to determine how efficient particular HLL statements are for any HLL language * as an approximate measure of overall computer performance External links * Computer Architecture By John L.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Opatowiec. It lies in Lesser Poland, on the left bank of the Vistula (opposite the confluence of the Dunajec), approximately east of Kazimierza Wielka and south of the regional capital Kielce. In 2006 the village had a population of 410. Opatowiec has a rich and long history. It was granted town charter as early as 1271, and stripped of it by Russian authorities in 1869. The village is located on National Road Nr. 79 (Warsaw - Bytom). Local points of interest include a 15th-century Dominican church, and a monument to J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski next to the Vistula river. The village of Opatowiec was first mentioned in 1085, when Judyta, the wife of Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman, presented it to the Benedictine Abbey from Tyniec. In 1271, Prince Boleslaw V the Chaste granted Opatowiec Magdeburg rights town charter, upon request of abbot Modlibob. The town became a local trade center, due to its location along the Vistula waterway, and on a merchant road from Silesia to Kievan Rus. In 1283, abbot Tomasz from Tyniec founded here a Dominican Order abbey, and in 1341, King Kazimierz Wielki granted Opatowiec the right to organize fairs. In the mid-14th century, Opatowiec had almost 1,500 inhabitants. Here, in 1474, a congress of Lesser Poland‚Äôs szlachta took place, during which war with Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus was discussed. In the same year, King Kazimierz Jagiello≈Ñczyk hosted at Opatowiec envoys from the Republic of Venice, to discuss war with the Ottoman Empire. By 1500, Opatowiec had a parish church, bath houses, hospital and several guilds. In 1579, it had 55 different workshops, and four mills. For centuries, the town belonged to Wi≈õlica County of Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship. Like almost all municipal centers of Lesser Poland, the town was completely destroyed by Swedish soldiers in the Deluge (1655 - 1660). In 1772, when after the first partition of Poland, the Tyniec abbey became part of Austrian Galicia, Opatowiec changed hands and became the property of the government. Soon afterwards, it was purchased by the Walewski family. In 1815, the town was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and began to lose its importance. By 1862, it had only 459 residents and 67 houses. In 1869, as a punishment for January Uprising, it was stripped of its town charter and became a village. Opatowiec was destroyed in World War I, further destruction was brought by World War II. In September 1939, the village was burned by the Wehrmacht, on Sept. 8, 1939, German soldiers shot here 45 Polish prisoners of war. On July 28, 1944, a skirmish took place here between a local Home Army unit and the Russian Liberation Army. As a result, the village was completely burned, and 31 persons were murdered, including children. It regained its urban status on 1 January 2019, becoming the smallest town in Poland, with only 338 inhabitants. { Landscape Opatowiec surroundings River Wis≈Ça in Opatowiec } References Villages in Kazimierza County Sandomierz Voivodeship Kielce Governorate Kielce Voivodeship (1919‚Äì1939) ","title":"Opatowiec"},{"id":"18839951","text":"Mollalƒ± (also, Mollaly and Mollavellilar) is a village and municipality in the Barda Rayon of Azerbaijan.

The 45 guns plus another dozen in enfilading position broke the Confederate attack and relieved the threat to the federal left.Cozzens, No Better Place to Die, pp. 191-92. Mendenhall was promoted to the rank of major and continued on Crittenden's staff. At the Battle of Chickamauga he pulled together another grand battery to resist the Confederate breakthrough on the second day of the battle, but he lost many of these guns.Cozzens, This Terrible Sound, pp. 401-402. Mendenhall received brevet rank of lieutenant colonel for his role in that battle. On November 19, 1863 Mendenhall was appointed judge advocate of the Fourth Army Corps. However, he often served as an artillery officer and performed little judicial duties.Joshua E.

It is an industry-led Statutory Body that is based in Singapore. It is a step-up from its precursor, the Workplace Safety and Health Advisory Committee (WSHAC) formed in September 2005. The WSHC is endowed with statutory powers. The WSHC comprises 17 leaders from the major industry sectors (including construction, manufacturing, marine industries, petrochemicals and logistics), the Government, unions and professionals from the legal, insurance and academic fields. Under the WSHC, seven industry committees, three taskforces and two workgroups have been formed to address the specific WSH challenges in their respective sectors: # Construction and Landscape Committee # Chemical Industries Committee # Healthcare Committee # Hospitality & Entertainment Industries Committee # Logistics and Transport Committee # Marine Industries Committee # Metalworking and Manufacturing Committee # Chemical Management & GHS Hazard Communication Taskforce # Crane Safety Taskforce # Work at Height Safety Taskforce # Insurance Workgroup # Facilities Management Workgroup Three functional committees were formed to identify, champion, and implement initiatives in the following areas: # Engagement and Outreach; # Industry Capability Building; and # Workplace Health The Partners The WSHC works closely with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and other government agencies, various industry sectors, unions and professional associations in development of strategies and programmes to raise WSH standards in Singapore. Main Functions and Key Programmes WSH 2018: A National Strategy for WSH for Singapore The WSH 2018 National Strategy spells out the national vision, strategies and strategic outcomes to lower Singapore's workplace fatality rate to less than 1.8 per 100,000 workers by 2018. Co-drafted by the WSH Council and MOM, the WSH 2018 National Strategy aims to synergise the efforts and resources of all stakeholders to realise the vision of \\"A safe and healthy workplace for everyone; and a country renowned for best practices in workplace safety and health\\". To achieve the desired WSH 2018 vision, four strategic outcomes were identified: * Strategic Outcome 1: Reduction in WSH Incident Rates * Strategic Outcome 2: Safety and Health is an Integral Part of Business * Strategic Outcome 3: Singapore is Renowned as a Centre of Excellence for WSH * Strategic Outcome 4: A Progressive and Pervasive Safety and Health Culture A multi-pronged approach is needed to achieve these strategic outcomes. Therefore, four strategies were identified to guide the efforts of all stakeholders in strengthening WSH improvements and drive the process towards safer and healthier workplaces. The four strategies are: * Strategy 1: Build Strong Capabilities to Better Manage WSH * Strategy 2: Implement an Effective Regulatory Framework * Strategy 3: Promote the Benefits of WSH and Recognise Best Practices * Strategy 4: Develop Strong Partnerships Locally and Internationally Build Capability of the Industry to Better Manage WSH The WSHC collaborates with other government agencies including the Workforce Development Agency (WDA). Utilising the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) framework developed by WDA, the WSH Professional WSQ framework was established for the competency training of WSH Professionals. Complementing the training development aspects, the WSHC conducts regular reviews and audits of Accredited Training Providers so as to ensure a pool of highly credible and competent WSH training providers. Promote WSH And Recognise Companies With Good WSH Performance To build and promote WSH culture in the community, the WSHC actively organises events and programmes, engaging various stakeholders, to promote the importance of WSH and its benefits and provide the necessary guidance for its implementation. Some of these activities include the National WSH Campaign, the WSH Awards and the ‚ÄúSafety Starts With Me‚Äù campaign and various WSH seminars, conferences and workshops targeting different categories of workforce. Among the staple of WSHC publications are the WSH statistical reports, case studies, guidelines, technical advisories, approved codes of practice, posters, flyers and videos, and iWSH (newsletter specially designed for workers). The WSHC also has an up-to-date website, and the WSH Bulletin, an electronic bulletin that highlights the latest in WSH issues. Setting Acceptable WSH Practices The WSHC drives the adoption of good WSH practices with various stakeholders in the WSH industry. The WSHC also works in collaboration with the other standard-setting bodies to develop national WSH standards, as well as lead the development of industry guidelines, and establish approved codes of practices for the industry. WSHC Programmes These programmes include: bizSAFE bizSAFE is a capability building programme that is tailored to assist the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) in building up their WSH capabilities.

Criticism and controversy In 2005, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority issued an order regarding the ban of several non-private channels because they were airing programmes in Hindi that were dubbed in India. Later, Cartoon Network switched to English versions on the Pemra's instructions but the mixed so-called Hindustani feed of the channel was back after a few months. In early 2010, PEMRA again issued a notice against the non-private channels, which resulted in a complete ban of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network's Pakistan feed. Once again, the issue was the Hindi dubbed shows on its schedule line up and the Government's demand for a private kids' channel affiliated with PTV instead. The ban stayed and was not lifted till the end of July 2011. On 1 August, an announcement was made by the Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Firdous Ashiq Awan. She said \\"Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, have been granted permission to air programmes in Pakistan.\\" But at the closure, she expressed her interest in a private TV channel once again and said, \\"The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority will accommodate private TV channel if someone wished to launch channel for children.\\" See also * List of Kids channels in South Asia * Cartoon Network * Deepto TV * Cartoon Network (India) * Pogo References Cartoon Network Children's television channels in Pakistan Television channels and stations established in 2004 Pakistani subsidiaries of foreign companies English-language television stations in Pakistan Television stations in Karachi Controversies in Pakistan ","title":"Cartoon Network (Pakistani TV channel)"},{"id":"18840745","text":"Dress for Success may refer to: *Dress for Success (book), a best-selling 1975 book by John T.

Route description View from the east end of SR 427 looking westbound SR 427 begins at a cattleguard on Cantlon Drive just south of the Wadsworth/Pyramid Lake interchange (Exit 43) on Interstate 80 (I-80) in Washoe County. The highway proceeds northeast from there to meet State Route 447 in the middle of Wadsworth. The route curves southeast through the town and immediately enters Lyon County. Passing south under I-80 once again, as well as the Union Pacific railroad tracks, SR 427 curves east to follow Main Street/Truckee Lane into Fernley. The highway ends at the intersection with Alt US 50 and Alt US 95 in downtown Fernley. History Originally, US 40 followed the routing of SR 427 through Wadsworth and Fernley. Completion of I-80 around both cities (and many other northern Nevada cities) made the US highway designation irrelevant, and US 40 was later removed from the highway system.

Studies indicate that cue reactivity‚Äîa response to the presentation of various visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile cues‚Äîincreases physiological excitement in addicts.Bordnick, Patrick S., et al. \\"Assessing Reactivity to Virtual Reality Alcohol Based Cues.\\" Addictive Behaviors, 33.6 (2008): 743-56. VRCR utilizes virtual reality (VR) technology to stimulate cue reactivity in the most efficient and realistic environments possible; the intention being that coping skills can be taught in a contextual scenario that reflect a real world situation. While still in the early stages of development, studies have shown that VRCR is an effective means of generating a craving-inspiring environment that is tempting to a patient suffering from addiction. Use in addiction Studies have indicated that cue exposure in patients is closely related to increases in physiological responses. In addition, situational cues are also a leading cause in triggering relapse. People suffering from addiction have a tendency to attribute their addiction to specific scenarios or events.Bordnick, Patrick S., et al. \\"Virtual Reality Cue Reactivity Assessment in Cigarette Smokers.\\" CyberPsychology & Behavior 8.5 (2005): 487-92. For example, a smoker might have a habit of only smoking on his porch. Consequently, whenever he is near or around his porch, he connects it to smoking, and a craving is initiated by the mere proximity. This is an example of the classical conditioning theory, which describes how a specific cue can trigger an entirely separate reaction. One of the most effective ways to avoid patient relapse is to instruct them on coping skills‚Äîideally in the most detrimental cue exposure settings possible. The idea being that if patients can learn to deny their cravings in a controlled environment, denial in a real world environment will be easier.Lee, Jang Han, et al. \\"Experimental Application of Virtual Reality for Nicotine Craving through Cue Exposure.\\" CyberPsychology & Behavior 6.3 (2003): 275-80. Virtual reality helps to emulate a near lifelike situation, complete with sights, sounds, smells, and movement. How it works In order to create a lifelike environment, actors are filmed on a green screen doing many various activities such as smoking cigarettes, dancing, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, and other provocative actions. The actors are then integrated into a three-dimensional background, giving the impression that they are in a real environment. Virtual reality (VR) technology allows a user to be immersed in a computer-simulated environment by engaging the senses of a human body. As of now, visual and auditory are the two most common senses appealed to when creating a VR environment‚Äîmainly because they use simpler technologies that are much cheaper to develop. However, advances in technology are allowing for a much more efficient way to appeal to the olfactory senses as well. Visual senses 300px Arguably the most important facet in making a virtual environment seem real is an appeal to sight. A virtual reality headset, incorporating a head- mounted display (HMD) is placed in front of the eyes of a patient like a pair of sunglasses, enabling for complete visual attention. A virtual environment is then displayed. A system of motion sensors tracks movement of the patient's head. If the patient tilts, or turns his head to view another part of the room, the environment adjusts accordingly. This allows for a more realistic experience by limiting restrictions of the head. Auditory senses A headset is placed around the ears of a patient that allows for sound to be heard. Generally, full surround-sound is desirable as it gives the patient a sense of space. For example, if a virtual person standing in front of the patient was speaking, the voice would be clear and audible. However, if a virtual person was standing to the left or right of the patient, the sound would be much quieter and muffled. Surround sound aids in giving a lifelike feeling to the VR environment. Olfactory senses Olfactory cues are presented by a computer-controlled device that releases scents in accordance with a patient's virtual environment. The device has multiple chambers with different scents in each, and uses an air compressor to blow specific scents into a patient's testing area. For example, if the patient were to approach a table with marijuana on it, he would also smell marijuana in real life. Other important scents used in VRCR include vanilla, pizza, coffee, whiskey, cigarette smoke, beer, and pine trees. The use of olfactory stimulation allows for a much more realistic virtual environment. Clinical use VR technology has been slowly gaining acceptance in a clinical environment. It is used for treating specific phobias, pain management, eating disorders, and post- traumatic stress disorder. Studies have indicated that, \\"patients reported emotional and physiological arousal when immersed in VR, thus providing a tool for exposure in the treatment of psychological disorders\\". VR technology also allows for a standardized testing environment that could greatly increase patient recovery rates. Evolution In the past, cue reactivity has been used in labs to instruct patients in beneficial coping skills that help them to avoid relapse. Virtual reality technology allows for a more effective approach to trigger physiological arousal than the standard cue reactivity methods used previously‚Äîprimarily, presentation of paraphernalia or actor- based simulation. Cue reactivity Presentation of paraphernalia works by presenting a patient with physical items relative to their respective addiction. For example, an alcohol abuser might have a bottle of liquor placed in front of him, and a marijuana addict, a pipe. However, despite the fact that the objects are real, the environment in which they are presented is far from realistic. Learning how to turn down substances in a lab setting is much different than turning them down at an actual party‚Äîthus, the instructional process is limited. Bordnick, Patrick S., et al. \\"Utilizing Virtual Reality to Standardize Nicotine Craving Research: A Pilot Study.\\" Addictive Behaviors, 29.9 (2004): 1889-94. Actor-based simulation Another means of establishing a realistic situation is through actor-based simulation. Actors are hired, and stages are built to simulate what an actual situation might be like. Patients are able to interact with the actors in a realistic manner. While extremely lifelike and effective, efficiency is a major disadvantage. The actors are subject to availability, and must be paid for their services. Furthermore, stages are limited to constructed scenes that are not easy to change. Though more effective than standard presentation cue response, actor- based simulation is still limited. Virtual reality technology Virtual reality cue reactivity, though still in an early stage of development, is aimed at becoming a much more efficient version of an actor-based simulation. Carter, Brian L., et al. \\"Location and Longing: The Nicotine Craving Experience in Virtual Reality.\\" Drug & Alcohol Dependence 95.1 (2008): 73-80. The goal is to produce a system that will virtually simulate a given scenario while still allowing a patient to interact with the surroundings. The advantages include increased flexibility‚Äîan operator has the ability to produce virtually any scenario needed‚Äîas well as cheaper running costs because actors are no longer needed. The procedure is also much more accessible as actor availability is irrelevant.

The episode is the 87th episode of the show overall, and was written by executive producers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by co-executive producer Stephen Williams. It first aired on January 21, 2009, on ABC in the United States and was simulcast on A in Canada. It aired immediately after a clip- show that recaps the first four seasons and aired back-to-back with the next episode, \\"The Lie\\". In 2007, Jack Shephard and Benjamin Linus start their quest to reunite the \\"Oceanic 6\\". Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes and Sayid Jarrah are ambushed at their safehouse. Sun-Hwa Kwon is confronted by Charles Widmore. Kate Austen and Aaron Littleton flee from their home after being ordered to submit a maternity test. At the island, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford, Daniel Faraday, Juliet Burke, Charlotte Lewis, Miles Straume, John Locke, and the other survivors of Oceanic 815 left on the island erratically travel through time upon the island's move. \\"Because You Left\\" averaged 11.347 million viewers in the United States, and received good reviews, praising the writing and the unraveling of new elements. Plot In the late 1970s, when the Dharma Initiative has begun to build stations on the island. Dr. Pierre Chang (Fran√ßois Chau) begins to film the orientation film for the Arrow Station when he is informed of an incident at the construction site of the Orchid Station. Upon arriving there, he realizes that the workers have found the \\"unlimited\\" energy source that the Dharma Initiative has been looking for, which will enable them to manipulate time. As he leaves the station, he bumps into Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), who is dressed as a Dharma construction worker. On December 30, 2004, following the island being moved in \\"There's No Place Like Home\\", the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time ‚Äì something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record ‚Äì while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them to the day when the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet, and the freighter team head to the Swan Station in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains that the only way to stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name. In 2007, back in Los Angeles, two lawyers deliver a court order to Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), demanding a maternity test for her and Aaron, Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son, whom Kate is raising as her own, but refuse to reveal their client's identity. In London while en route to Los Angeles, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) is confronted by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) at the airport. She tells him that she wants to kill Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), a desire they seem to have in common. Ben and Jack learn from the TV that Hurley has broken out, hindering Ben's plan to reunite the Oceanic Six. Following Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes's (Jorge Garcia) breakout of a mental institution, he and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) go to a safehouse, which has been infiltrated by two armed men. Sayid kills the men, but not before one of them shoots him with two potent drugged darts, knocking him unconscious. Meanwhile, Ben and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) have left the funeral parlor with Locke's body. On a boat in an unknown location, Desmond wakes up, having remembered what Daniel told him, and sets off for Oxford. Production alt=Two men seated in front of a table with microphones.

In the 1972 general election Dietl won 20.8% of the vote in the single-seat constituency of Brixen, the largest defection from SVP so far. After the election, Dietl launched the Social Democratic Party of South Tyrol, while others formed the PdU. The PdU won 1.3% of the vote in the 1978 provincial election and 2.4% in 1983, electing Hans Lunger and Gerold Meraner respectively to the Provincial Council.

During the 1931‚Äì32 season Ellaby set the St Helens club's record for most tries in a match with six on 5 March 1932, a record that has since been matched, but never broken. He played in St. Helens' victory that season in the Lancashire County League. Due to being on the 1932 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, Ellaby and Albert Fildes did not play in St. Helens' 9‚Äì5 victory over Huddersfield in the Championship Final during the 1931‚Äì32 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 7 May 1932.

A member of the Saints' Past Players' Hall of Fame, he lived in Garforth until his death at the age of 90 in 1993. There was to be a last twist, however, quite befitting to one of the great sporting heroes of St.Helens. His ashes were taken home on the Saints 'A' Team coach after a match at Castleford, and were later scattered on the pitch at his beloved Knowsley Road. Ellaby was inducted into the Saints Greatest 17 in the Autumn of 2010 and was joined by Les Fairclough, his who had done so much to keep the three-quarter line moving to provide Alf with so many of his scoring opportunities.

He was convicted and executed for the crime of patricide. Sentences of death would be continually issued, the last in 1992, on the Isle of Man, but Kewish's sentence was the last to be carried out. Background Prior to his arrest John Kewish Jr. lived on a farm with his elderly parents. He was the oldest of seven siblings and was unmarried. Kewish's father, John Kewish Sr., was found dead in his home on 28 March 1872. Kewish Jr., who had a history of crime including sheep stealing, was arrested and charged with patricide. He was described as mentally disabled. Depositions According to depositions, the body was found on the evening of 28 March by the victim's wife, Mary Kewish, and a neighbour. The following day the family moved the body, washed it, and prepared it for burial. It was not until 30 March that someone decided to contact the police. On 31 March a police doctor examined the body and noted six wounds (four on the back and two on the chest) which he felt were caused by three thrusts from a small pitchfork. Thomas Kewish, John Jr.'s brother, also admitted there was an ongoing argument between John and his father. The police felt this was strong enough evidence to arrest John Jr. Trials Kewish was tried twice before a jury. At his first trial his only defence was that he had not committed the crime. After 14 hours of deliberation the jury was unable to reach a verdict. A new trial was ordered when the jury foreman became ill and deliberations could not continue. There is evidence that a majority of this first jury believed Kewish to be either innocent of the crime, or so simple-minded that he was not responsible for the act. (According to one of the jurors, seven of the twelve believed he was not guilty.) At Kewish's second trial his advocates added the further plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, submitting that either he had not committed the crime or if he had, his mental disability freed him of responsibility. Insanity was later supported by an examining physician's statement that Kewish's mind was unable to comprehend the moral turpitude of such a criminal act. After an hour's deliberation the jury convicted him of patricide. The presiding deemster, William Drinkwater, sentenced Kewish to the mandatory punishment of death by hanging. Post- trial Although convicted, Kewish hoped to receive leniency from the British Government. The Lieutenant-Governor received several sworn statements intended to encourage leniency, including from the jurors of the first trial, his examining physician, and others. Kewish's post-trial statements were inconsistent. At one point Kewish's gaoler stated that Kewish admitted he had accidentally shot his father and hid the weapon in the thatch of an outhouse (where a bird gun was later found). At other times Kewish repeated his claims of innocence and requested a free pardon. The pitchfork had not been clearly identified; however, the Home Secretary advised the Queen that he could not recommend mercy. He felt the crime was premeditated, and committed from greed, and added that neither the deemster nor the jury had recommended mercy at the trial. Manx law at the time required the British Crown to order the execution by positive act. Queen Victoria was displeased with this, and she indicated this in a letter to the Home Secretary. He apologised and promised to bring Manx law into compliance with that of England, which did not require such an order. Although expressing personal doubts about the case, she took his advice and indicated that the execution was to proceed. Execution Locally there was reluctance to become involved in the execution. Craftsmen initially refused to build the gallows, and an executioner, William Calcraft, had to be brought over from England to carry out the sentence. Kewish was hanged in Castle Rushen at Castletown on 1 August 1872 and he is buried there. It was the only non-public execution to take place under Manx law. Aftermath After the execution, Queen Victoria was petitioned to put an end to the death penalty. She declined, and it was not until 1993 that Tynwald abolished capital punishment in the Isle of Man. Five people were sentenced to death (for murder) on the island between 1973 and 1992, but all death sentences after Kewish's were commuted to life imprisonment by the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom using the Crown's Prerogative of Mercy.

It originated from excavation by an old coal mine and flooded former villages, Hrbovice, Tuchomy≈°l and Vyklice. The lake's surface area stretches 250 ha, which makes it slightly smaller than nearby Lake M√°cha. Its average depth is 15.5 meters and its maximum depth is 22 m. The capacity is approximately 35 mil. m3.  Water mode  In 1998, the mining of brown coal in Chaba≈ôovice ceased and the quarry was closed. Recultivation work started subsequently. The former Chaba≈ôovice quarry was the first of large surface mines within the Czech Republic in which redevelopment and reclamation works, after termination of mining, came to the stage when the remnant den was filled with water. It became a model for other localities. The watering has been in progress since 15 June 2001. The reservoir is the second largest reclaimed lake within northern Czech Republic. The recultivation is based on the hydric system, concretely the watering. The maximum watering speed is 700 l/s and is processed by a water relief from the Kate≈ôina reservoir. At the present time some land is being prepared for investment and the area is being opened to the public. Mild local climate change is expected in the direct surroundings following the creation of the lake, such as an increase in fogs, less dustiness and temperature stabilization. The water quality is one of the key criteria, which is monitored and will be helpful for projection of the hydric recultivation in another region.  Utilization  The lake will be partly used for recreational purposes. In 2006 originated the Association of five communes called Jezero Milada (Lake Milada). These five communes are √öst√≠ nad Labem, Chaba≈ôovice, Trmice, ≈òehlovice and Modlany. The financial resources of the Association and the municipality √öst√≠ nad Labem were used on setting out the Cycling path 3009. Cycling path with marking 3009 was opened in 2006 and it goes through the territory of outside dump of the mine with line up to Hab≈ô√≠ and ≈òehlovice. In Chaba≈ôovice it connects the already built cycling path KƒåT (Club of Czech Tourists) with the same marking, then it goes around lake, diverges across paths in the area and finally it leads to Stadice.

Post considered the process to be a witch hunt and is credited with preventing many deportations and freeing many innocent people.  Early life  Post was born in Hackettstown, New Jersey. His father was a \\"New York merchant.\\" His mother was a member of the prominent Freeland family. He quit school at fourteen, opting for four years in a newspaper office and then entered law school. By the age of 25, he had a lucrative law practice in New York City in an office on Broadway across from City Hall. He fell back into the newspaper business, becoming associate and then editor of the \\"New York Truth.\\" From there he followed his interest in social reform and first ran for office in 1882. Career Post opposed immigration restrictions and forcefully supported free speech and Henry George's single-tax movement. He once called George's political philosophy \\"my kind of radicalism...which regards the social values of natural resources as in their nature public property.\\"Louis F. Post, The Deportations Delirium of Nineteen-twenty: A Personal Narrative of an Historic Official Experience (NY, 1923), 236 He became an Assistant Secretary of Labor in 1913, a position he held until the end of the Wilson administration in March, 1921.Post,148-9 Early in March 1920, the temporary absence of Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson and the recent resignation of the Department's Solicitor General made Post the Department's Acting Secretary and the key person responsible for the Bureau of Immigration for two critical months. He directed the review of all deportation cases and often opposed the activities of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer and J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the Justice Department's \\"Radical Division,\\" soon renamed the General Intelligence Division.Stanley Coben, A. Mitchell Palmer: Politician (NY: Columbia University Press, 1963), , pp. 225-6 In 1919, in response to anarchist terror bombings, Hoover's agents penetrated many violent revolutionary groups and identified their members. In January 1920, Palmer and Hoover oversaw the Palmer Raids designed to arrest those members who were not U.S. citizens and deport them. The Anarchist Exclusion Act of 1918 set the standard for such deportations. It specified that \\"aliens who are members of or affiliated with any organization that entertains a belief in, teaches, or advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States or of all forms of law\\" were subject to deportation. Post, often with the support of Secretary Wilson, distinguished carefully among those arrested, for example, determining that membership in the Communist Labor Party was not grounds for deportation because it did not meet the legal standard that other organizations with similar names did meet, like the Communist Party of America.Post, 154-7 By April 10, Post had reviewed a backlog of 1600 cases and dismissed 71% of them. Some had been held for as long as two months for having attended a meeting of a radical group.Coben, 232 Post also determined that aliens were entitled to a fair hearing, which was contrary to the position of the Bureau of Immigration, which held that immigrants were not subject to constitutional safeguards. Overall, Post is credited with preventing many deportations and freeing many innocent people. He also declined to take action against those he called \\"harmless but technically culpable.\\" Some had in good faith resigned from a proscribed organization. Others only became \\"members\\" of such an organization when organizations merged, as often happened.Post, 176ff. On the other hand, he authorized the deportation of anarchists even \\"of the extreme pacifist type,\\" because he thought the law required that.Post, 200-2 As early as January 1920, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began compiling a file on Post and his political leanings, but failed to find substantive evidence of radical connections on his part. Nevertheless, the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization compiled a sensational report of Post's deportation decisions. When it leaked, the press made much of the affair, what Post later called \\"a newspaper cyclone of misrepresentation,\\" though some coverage supported him.Post, 226ff. Some Congressmen traded speeches on his culpability, Committee Chairman Albert Johnson of Washington state attacking Post, and Congressman George Huddleston of Alabama defending him.Post, 226, 230-2 On April 15, 1920, Kansas Congressman Homer Hoch accused Post of having abused his power and called for his impeachment. The House Committee on Rules planned to ask the President to remove Post instead of impeaching him, so Post requested and was granted a chance to testify.Coben, 233-4; Post, 243-4, He successfully defended his actions on May 7‚Äì8, attacking Attorney General Palmer and others. In a dramatic exchange, Congressman Edward W. Pou, a Democratic supporter of the anti-radical campaign, praised Post's actions-\\"I believe you have followed your sense of duty absolutely\\"-and left the room in stunned silence. The Rules Committee took no further action.Post, 238ff. After the Attorney General had spent 2 days reading a statement in his defense, the New York Evening Post gave Post the victory:Post, 271 :The simple truth is that Louis F. Post deserves the gratitude of every American for his courageous and determined stand in behalf of our fundamental rights. It is too bad that in making this stand he found himself at cross-purposes with the Attorney General, but Mr. Palmer's complaint lies against the Constitution and not against Mr. Post. The American Legion later sought Post's dismissal in a letter to President Wilson on December 31, 1920. The White House responded with a letter quoting Labor Secretary Wilson who endorsed Post's actions, detailed the Constitutional principles that guided him, and praised his adherence to Department policies: \\"We will not deport anyone simply because he has been accused or because he is suspected of being a Red. We have no authority to do so under the law....Mr. Post...I am satisfied ranks among the ablest and best administrative officers in the Government service.\\"Post, 275-7 In retirement in 1923, he published The Deportations Delirium of Nineteen- Twenty: A Personal Narrative of an Historic Official Experience, a detailed account of the raids, arrests, and deportations of 1919-20. He called the entire effort \\"a stupendous and cruel fake\\".Post, 158 He asserted that his actions had been vindicated with the passage of time, that \\"no substantially erroneous decision of mine has yet been specified. Most certainly and without qualification may this be said of my cancellation decisions, and it was for these alone that my official fidelity was clamorously questioned.... Every attempt to show even one erroneous cancellation decision has utterly failed.\\"Post, 169-70 Post died on January 11, 1928 at Homeopathic Hospital in Washington, DC after a brief illness. The New York Times reported that he had been a lawyer and editor, noted his early advocacy of a single tax.

The traditional preparation of gu poison involved sealing several venomous creatures (e.g., centipede, snake, scorpion) inside a closed container, where they devoured one another and allegedly concentrated their toxins into a single survivor, whose body would be fed upon by larvae until consumed. The last surviving larva held the complex poison. Gu was used in black magic practices such as manipulating sexual partners, creating malignant diseases, and causing death. According to Chinese folklore, a gu spirit could transform into various animals, typically a worm, caterpillar, snake, frog, dog, or pig. Names Circa 14th-century BCE Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions recorded the name gu, while 7th-century CE Tang Dynasty texts first used jincan \\"gold silkworm\\". Gu The term gu , says , \\"can be traced from the oracle bones until modern times, and has acquired a large number of meanings or connotations\\". Before discussing gu, it is necessary to introduce the related word chong \\"wug\\". Chong or (originally a \\"snake; worm\\" pictogram) \\"insect; bug; pest; worm; spider; amphibian; reptile; dragon; etc.\\" denotes a Chinese folk taxonomy lacking an adequate English translation equivalent. proposes translating chong as \\"wug\\" ‚Äì 's portmanteau word (from worm + bug) bridging the lexical gap for the linguistically widespread \\"class of miscellaneous animals including insects, spiders, and small reptiles and amphibians\\". Contrast the Wug test for investigating language acquisition of plurals in English morphology. Note that \\"wug\\" will translate chong below. Oracle script for gu \\"poison; bewitch\\" Seal script for gu \\"poison; bewitch\\" The Traditional Chinese character and the Simplified for gu \\"demonic poison\\" are \\"wugs inside in a container\\" ideograms that combine chong or \\"wug\\" and min \\"jar; cup; dish; utensil\\". Early written forms of gu range from (ca. 14th-11th centuries BCE) Oracle bone script to (ca. 3rd century BCE) Seal script characters. The Oracle characters had two or one \\"wug\\" elements inside a container, while the Seal characters had three. 's concordance of oracle bone inscriptions lists 23 occurrences of gu written with two wugs and 4 with one; many contexts are divinations about sickness. concludes, \\"The oracle-bone character of gu is used to refer to the evil power of the ancestors to cause illness in the living.\\" Jincan Jincan \\"gold silkworm/caterpillar\\" is a gu synonym first recorded in the Tang Dynasty. Li Xian's (7th century) commentary to the Hou Han Shu uses jincan as the name of a funerary decoration cast from gold, and the (9th century) author Su E describes it as a legendary golden-color caterpillar from Kashmir. (cf. 153) connects gu, jincan, and other love charms with the Duanwu Festival that occurs on the fifth day of the fifth month in the Chinese calendar, which is \\"the theoretical apogee of summer heat\\" . > Among the Miao on the fifth of the fifth month poisonous animals were put > into a pot and allowed to devour each other, and they were called 'gold- > silkworms'. The more people were killed by the ku, the richer the kus owner > became. In our time the normal term for ku has been 'gold-silkworm'. These > animals can make gold. It was typical for the gold-silkworm that people > continued to feed this animal in the pot, that humans had to be sacrificed > to it, that the animal kept the house clean and worked for its master like a > brownie, but that it caused harm to its master if he did not provide proper > sacrifices. \\"For centuries, the Miao, particularly Miao women\\", writes , \\"have been feared for their mastery of the so-called gu poison, which is said to inflict death from a distance with excruciating slowness.\\" quotes a Song Dynasty description. > a gold caterpillar is a caterpillar with a gold colour, which is fed with > silk from Shuh (Szƒï-ch‚Äòwen). Its ordure, put in food or drink, poisons those > who take it, causing certain death. It can draw towards a man the > possessions of such victims, and thus make him enormously rich. It is > extremely difficult to get rid of it, for even water, fire, weapons or > swords can do it no harm. Usually the owner for this purpose puts some gold > or silver into a basket, places the caterpillar also therein, and throws the > basket away in a corner of the street, where someone may pick it up and take > it with him. He is then said to have given his gold caterpillar in marriage. The Bencao Gangmu quotes Cai Dao 's (12th century) Tieweishan congtan that \\"gold caterpillars first existed\\" in the Shu region (present-day Sichuan), and \\"only in recent times did they find their way into\\" Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guanxi. It also quotes the Tang Dynasty pharmacologist Chen Cangqi (713-741 CE) that: > ashes of old flowered silk are a cure for poison of ku of insects or > reptiles which eat such silk. His commentator adds, that those insects are > coiled up like a finger-ring, and eat old red silk and flowered silk, just > as caterpillars eat leaves; hence, considered in the light of the present > day, those insects are gold caterpillars.

It records four gu meanings ‚Äì 2.5 \\"grain which (molders and) flies away\\", 2.6 \\"insanity\\", 2.7 \\"delusion and disorder\\", and 2.9 \\"same [hexagram] name\\" ‚Äì in a 541 BCE story (, ) about a physician named He \\"Harmony\\" from Qin explaining gu to the ruler of Jin. > The marquis of [Jin] asked the help of a physician from [Qin], and the earl > sent one [He] to see him, who said, \\"The disease cannot be cured, according > to the saying that when women are approached, the chamber disease becomes > like insanity.

Abdominal wug poisoning The \\"poisoning from abdominal wugs\\" or \\"abdominal parasites\\" meaning 2.1 first appears in the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary, cf. 2.3 below. It defines gu as , literally \\"stomach middle wug\\", \\"insects within the stomach\\". However, Duan Yucai's (1815 CE) commentary construes this definition as \\"afflicted by abdominal wugs\\"; and explains that instead of the usual readings zh≈çng \\"middle; center; interior\\" and ch√≥ng \\"wug\\", both terms should be read in entering tone, namely zh√≤ng ‰∏≠ \\"hit (a target); be hit by\\" and zh√≤ng \\"wug bites\\". Cultivated poisonous wug The second gu meaning \\"anciently recorded type of artificially cultured poisonous wug\\" names the survivor of several venomous creatures enclosed in a container, and transformed into a type of demon or spirit. The Zhouli ritual text (, ) describes a Shushi official who, \\"was charged with the duty of exterminating poisonous ku, attacking this with spells and thus exorcising it, as also with the duty of attacking it with efficacious herbs; all persons able to fight ku he was to employ according to their capacities.\\" Zheng Xuan's commentary explains dugu \\"poisonous gu\\" as \\"wugs that cause sickness in people\\". Dismembered sorcerer's ghost Gu meaning 2.3 \\"ghost of a person whose severed head was impaled on a stake\\" refers to the severe Han Dynasty \\"dismemberment (as tortuous capital punishment)\\" for criminals convicted of practicing gu-sorcery (see 2.6). \\"Plate VI, Punishment of Cutting Asunder\\" provides a gruesome illustration. The Zhouli commentary of Zheng Xuan (cf. 2.2, ) notes, \\"Those who dare to poison people with ku or teach others to do it will be publicly executed\\". says gu, \\"was also the soul of a dead person whose head had been pitted on a pole. This, too, fits later reports, in so far as the souls of ku victims often are mentioned as servants of the master of ku, if not ku itself served the master.\\" The Shuowen Jiezi (cf. 2.1 above ) also defines gu as \\"the spirits of convicted criminals whose heads had been exposed on stakes.\\" This specialized torture term niejie combines nie \\"target\\" (which pictures a person's \\"nose\\" on a \\"tree; wooden stand\\") and jie \\"dismemberment\\". Compare the character for xian \\"county; district\\" that originated as a \\"place where dismembered criminals were publicly displayed\\" pictograph of an upside-down \\"head\\" hanging on a \\"rope\\" tied to a \\"tree\\". suggests this meaning of gu, \\"seems to reveal to us a belief that such a soul, roaming restlessly about because of its corpse being mutilated, must be avenging itself on the living by settling in their intestines in the shape of the same maggots and grubs which gnaw away its decaying head.\\" provides historical perspective. > As the legal measures of individual dynasties demonstrate, administrative > officials viewed ku as a reality, as late as the nineteenth century. The > primary host was considered a criminal; a person guilty of the despicable > act of preparing and administering ku poison was executed, occasionally with > his entire family, in a gruesome manner. In addition to the obvious desire > to punish severely criminal practices that could result in the death of the > victim, it is possible that Confucian distaste for the accumulation of > material goods, and above all for the resulting social mobility, contributed > to this attitude. Indeed, the penalties of the use of ku poison appear to > have been more severe than those for other forms of murder. Heat miasma The fourth meaning of \\"evil heat and noxious qi that harms humans\\" refers to allegedly sickness-causing emanations of tropical miasma. \\"There was also an ancient belief that ku diseases were induced by some sort of noxious mist or exhalation\\", writes , \\"just as it was also believed that certain airs and winds could generate worms\\". The Shiji (, ) records that in 675 BCE, Duke De of Qin \\"suppressed ku at the commencement of the hottest summer-period by means of dogs. According to commentators, these animals were for the purpose butchered and affixed to the four gates of the capital.\\" The Tang Dynasty commentary of Zhang Shoujie explains gu as \\"hot, poisonous, evil, noxious qi that harms people\\". Displaying gu dogs at city gates reflects meaning 2.3 above. Besides shapeshifting gu spirits usually appearing as wugs, classical texts record other animal forms. The (ca. 350 CE) Soushenji \\"In Search of the Supernatural\\" says, > In P‚Äòo-yang (in the north of the present Kiangsi pr.) one Chao Shen kept > canine ku. Once, when he was called on by Ch‚Äòen Ch‚Äòen, six or seven big > yellow dogs rushed out at this man, all at once barking at him. And when my > paternal uncle, on coming home, had a meal with Chao Sheu‚Äôs wife, he spit > blood, and was saved from death in the nick of time by a drink prepared from > minced stalks of an orange-tree. Ku contains spectral beings or spectres, > which change their spectral shapes into those of beings of various kinds, > such as dogs or swine, insects or snakes, their victims thus never being > able to know what are their real forms. When they are put into operation > against people, those whom they hit or touch all perish. Tsiang Shi, the > husband of my wife‚Äôs sister, had a hired work-man in employ, who fell sick > and passed blood. The physician opined that he was stricken by ku, and > secretly, without informing him of it, strewed some jang-ho root under his > sleeping-mat. The patient then madly exclaimed: \\"The ku which devours me is > ceasing to spread\\"; and then he cried: \\"It vanishes little by little.\\" The > present generations often make use of jang-ho root to conquer ku, and now > and then it has a good effect. Some think it is ‚Äòthe efficacious herb‚Äô, > mentioned in the Cheu li This ranghe \\"myoga ginger\\" is a renowned antidote to gu poisoning, see below. The Shanhaijing ( ) says the meat of a mythical creature on Mount Greenmound prevents miasmic gu poisoning, \\"There is an animal on this mountain that looks like a fox, but has nine tails. It makes a noise like a baby. It can devour humans. Whoever eats it will not be affected by malign forces.\\" The commentary of Guo Pu notes this creature's meat will make a person immune to the effects of supernatural qi. A Tang Dynasty account of Nanyue people describes gu miasma: > The majority are diseased, and ku forms in their bloated bellies. There is a > vulgar tradition of making ku from a concentration of the hundred kinds of > crawling creatures, for the purpose of poisoning men. But probably it is the > poisonous crawlers of that hot and humid land which produce it ‚Äì not just > the cruel and baleful nature of the householders beyond the mountain passes. Wug pest The \\"wug pest that eats grain\\" or \\"grain that transforms into wugs\\" meaning 2.5 is seen above in the Zuozhuan explanation of gu as \\"grain which (molders and) flies away\\". The (ca. 3rd century BCE) Erya dictionary (6/21) defines gu as pests in kang \\"chaff\\", written with the phonetic loan character kang \\"healthy\\". The (ca. 543 CE) Yupian dictionary defines gu as \\"longstanding grain that transforms into flying insects\\". connects this gu \\"grain pest\\" meaning with 2.1 \\"internal parasites\\" and 2.7 \\"debauchery\\". > Thus the term ku also included the use of philtre-maggots by women desirous > of exciting the lusts of men and attracting them into debauchery. And, > evidently, ku was also used to destroy crops or food-stores, or, as the > learned physician expressed it, to make the corn fly away, perhaps in the > form of winged insects born therein; indeed, the character for ku is > regularly used in literature to denote devastating grubs and insects, > including internal parasites of the human body, which exercise a destructive > influence like poison. Sorcery Gu meaning 2.6 \\"sorcery that harms humans\\" or \\"cast damaging spells\\" is exemplified in the Modern Standard Chinese words wugu (with \\"shaman\\") \\"sorcery; art of casting spells\\" and gudu (with \\"poison\\") \\"a venomous poison (used in Traditional Chinese medicine); enchant and injure; cast a harmful spell over\\". Gu-sorcery allegedly resulted in a debilitating psychological condition, often involving hallucinations. The Zuozhuan (, ) records that in 601 BCE, Xu Ke of Jin was discharged from office because he had gu, \\"an illness which unsettled his mind\\". The Qing Dynasty philologist Yu Yue etymologically connects this meaning of gu with gu \\"chronic, protracted (illness)\\". Guji \\"insanity; derangement; condition caused by excessive sexual activities\\" is a comparable word. The Hanshu provides details of wugu-sorcery scandals and dynastic rivalries in the court of Emperor Wu (r. 141-87 BCE), which calls \\"notorious dramas of love and death\\". This early Chinese history records that in 130 BCE, a daughter of Empress Chen Jiao (who was unable to bear a son) was accused of practicing wugu and maigu \\"bury a witchcraft charm [under a victim's path or dwelling]\\" (cf. voodoo doll). The \\"empress was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed\\"; specifically \\"their heads were all exposed on stakes\\" (cf. 2.3). This history claims wu \\"shamans\\" from Yue conducted the gu magic, which notes, \\"seems to have consisted, at least in part, of magic human figures buried under the road which the emperor, the intended victim, was supposed to take\\". Accusations of practicing wugu-magic were central to the 91 BCE (Wugu zhi huo ) attempted coup against crown prince Liu Ju by Jiang Chong and Su Wen . The Hanshu claims that, \\"no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!\\" Traditional Chinese law strictly prohibited practicing gu-sorcery. For instance, during the reign of Tang Empress Wu Zetian, says, > the possession of ku poison, like the casting of horoscopes, was cause for > official suspicion and action: At that time many tyrannical office holders > would orders robbers to bury ku or to leave prophecies in a man's household > by night. Then, after the passage of a month, they would secretly confiscate > it. Seduce This gu meaning 2.7 of \\"seduce; bewitch; attract; confuse; mislead; bewilder\\" is evident in the Standard Chinese words yaogu \\"bewitch by seductive charms\\", gumei \\"bewitch/charm by sensual appeal\\", and guhuo \\"confuse by magic; enchant; seduce into wrongdoing\\". \\"Ku-poisoning was also associated with demoniac sexual appetite ‚Äì an idea traceable back to Chou times\\", says , \\"This notion evidently had its origins in stories of ambiguous love potions prepared by the aboriginal women of the south. The Zuozhuan (, ) uses gu in a story that in the 7th century BCE, Ziyuan , the chief minister of Chu, \\"wished to seduce the widow\\" of his brother King Wen of Zhou. The Mozi (, ) uses gu to criticize Confucius, who \\"dresses elaborately and puts on adornments to mislead the people.\\" The Erya (1B/49, cf. 2.5 above) defines gu , chan \\"doubt; flatter\\", and er \\"double-hearted; doubtful\\" as yi \\"doubt; suspect; fear; hesitate\\". Guo Pu's commentary suggests this refers to gu meaning \\"deceive; seduce\\". Many later accounts specify women as gu-magic practitioners. explains, > We know that among many aborigines of the south women know how to prepare > love charms which were effective even at a distance. In these reports it was > almost invariably stated that the love charm had a fatal effect if the man, > to whom the charm was directed, did not return to the woman at a specified > time. Affair The least-attested gu meaning 2.8 of \\"affair; event\\" first appears in the (3rd century CE) Guangya dictionary, which defines gu as shi \\"assignment; affair; event; thing; matter; trouble\\". The Yijing Gu hexagram (see 2.9) \\"Line Variations\\" repeatedly refer to parental gu with the enigmatic phrases \\"gan-father's gu\\" and \\"gan-mother's gu\\". Wang Niansun quotes an Yijing commentary that gu means shi, and proposes gu is a phonetic loan character for gu \\"reason; cause; event; incident\\". Commentarial tradition takes gan \\"trunk; framework; do; work\\" to mean chi \\"put in order\\", and Richard Wilhelm translates \\"Setting right what has been spoiled by the father\\" and \\"Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother\\" . Arthur Waley follows an ancient interpretation that gan is a variant Chinese character for gan \\"stem; Celestial stem; day of the (10-day) week; involve\\", translating \\"stem-father's maggots\\" and \\"stem-mother's maggots\\", explaining > it is surely obvious that the maggots referred to are those which appeared > in the flesh of animals sacrificed to the spirits of dead parents, who after > their death were, for reasons of taboo, only known by the name of the day > upon which they were born, being merely a fuller way of writing 'stem', 'day > of the week'. Hexagram 18 Hexagram 18 Gu names the Y√¨-Jƒ´ng Hexagram 18, which is translated as \\"Destruction\\" (Z.D. Sung 1935), \\"Work on What Has Been Spoiled [Decay]\\" (Richard Wilhelm 1967), \\"Decay\\" (John Blofeld 1965), \\"Degeneration\\" (Thomas Cleary 1986), \\"Poison, Destruction\\" (Wu Jing-Nuan 1991), and \\"Ills to Be Cured\\" (Richard John Lynn 1994). explains translating \\"decay\\" for . > The Chinese character ku represents a bowl in whose contents worms are > breeding. This means decay. It has come about because the gentle > indifference in the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia > of the upper, and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the > conditions embody a demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of > the hexagram is not simply \\"what has been spoiled\\" but \\"work on what has > been spoiled.\\" \\"The Judgment\\" : \\"WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED Has supreme success. It furthers one to cross the great water. Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days.\\" \\"The Image\\" () reads: \\"The wind blows low on the mountain: The image of DECAY. Thus the superior man stirs up the people, And strengthens their spirit.\\" In the Zuozhuan (, ), divination of this Gu hexagram foretells Qin conquering Jin, \\"A lucky response; cross the Ho; the prince's chariots are defeated.\\" Gu techniques According to ancient gu traditions, explain Joseph Needham and Wang Ling, \\"the poison was prepared by placing many toxic insects in a closed vessel and allowing them to remain there until one had eaten all the rest ‚Äì the toxin was then extracted from the survivor.\\" They note, \\"It is strange to think that this same method has been successfully employed in our own times for the isolation of strains of soil bacteria capable of attacking the tuberculosis bacillus\\". describe contemporary practices of gu. > At present, ku is used primarily as a means of acquiring wealth; secondarily > as a means of revenge. The method is to place poisonous snakes and insects > together in a vessel until there is but one survivor, which is called the > ku. The poison secured from this ku is administered to the victim, who > becomes sick and dies. The ideas associated with ku vary, but the ku is > generally regarded as a spirit, which secures the wealth of the victim for > the sorcerer. summarizes gu practices. > The essence of ku, then, was the magic charm that could be prepared out of > the surviving animal in the pot. It could be used as a love charm with the > object of forcing the loved male to come back to the woman. The ku could be > used also as an evil magic with the object of obtaining subservient spirits. > This was done by feeding it to unrelated persons who would either spit blood > or whose stomachs would swell because of the food they had taken would > become alive in their insides, and who would die as a result; similar to the > gold-silkworms, their souls had to be servants of the owner of the ku. The 4th-century Soushenji (cf. 2.4 ) records that gu breeding was a profitable but dangerous profession in the Henan region. > In the province of Yung-yang, there was a family by the name of Liao. For > several generations they manufactured ku, becoming rich from it. Later one > of the family married, but they kept the secret from the bride. On one > occasion, everyone went out except the bride, who was left in charge of the > house. Suddenly she noticed a large cauldron in the house, and on opening > it, perceived a big snake inside. She poured boiling water into the cauldron > and killed the snake. When the rest of the family returned she told them > what she had done, to their great alarm. Not long after, the entire family > died of the plague. describe how 20th-century Zhuang women in Guangxi elaborately produced gu during the Duanwu Festival (see jincan above). > Ku poison is not found generally among the people (i.e., the Chinese), but > is used by the T'ung women. It is said that on the fifth day of the fifth > month, they go to a mountain stream and spread new clothes and headgear on > the ground, with a bowl of water beside them. The women dance and sing > naked, inviting a visit from the King of Medicine (a tutelary spirit). They > wait until snakes, lizards, and poisonous insects come to bathe in the bowl. > They pour the water out in a shadowy, dark place. Then they gather the > fungus which grows there, which they make into a paste. They put this into > goose-feather tubes and hide them in their hair. The heat of their bodies > causes worms to generate, which resemble newly-hatched silk-worms. Thus ku > is produced. It is often concealed in a warm, dark place in the kitchen. The > newly made ku is not yet poisonous. It is used as a love potion, > administered in food and drink and called \\"love-medicine.\\" Gradually the ku > becomes poisonous. As the poison develops, the woman's body itches until she > has poisoned someone. If there is no other opportunity, she will poison even > her husband or her sons. But she possesses antidotes. It is believed that > those who produce ku themselves become ku after death. The ghosts of those > who have died from the poison become their servants. Gu remedies and detail numerous Chinese antidotes and cures for gu poison- magic. For instance (see 2.4), the Shanhaijing claimed eating a legendary creature's meat would prevent gu and the Soushenji prescribed ranghe \\"myoga ginger\\". says > Prescription literature was filled with antidotes. All known Chinese > conceptual systems of healing dealt with the ku phenomenon and developed > therapeutic strategies that were in accord with their basic principles. The > Buddhists recommended prayers and conjurations, thus utilizing the same > methods as practitioners of demonic medicine. In pharmaceutical literature, > drugs of a plant, animal, or mineral origin were described as effective > against ku poisoning. Adherents of homeopathic magic recommended the taking > of centipedes, since it was known that centipedes consume worms. The Zhou houbei jifang , which is attributed to Ge Hong, describes gu diagnosis and cure with ranghe: > A patient hurt by ku gets cutting pains at his heart and belly as if some > living thing is gnawing there; sometimes he has a discharge of blood through > the mouth or the anus. If he is not forthwith medically treated, it devours > his five viscera, which entails his death. To discover whether it is ku or > not, let the patient spit into water; if the spittle sinks, it is ku; if it > floats, it is not. The recipe for discovering the name of the owner of the > ku poison is as follows: take the skin of a drum, burn it, a small piece at > a time, pulverize the ashes, and let the patient drink them with water; he > will then forthwith mention the name; then bid this owner forthwith to > remove the ku, and the patient will recover immediately. Again place some > jang-ho leaves secretly under the mattress of the patient; he will then of > his own accord immediately mention the name of the owner of the ku Many gu-poison antidotes are homeopathic, in Western terms. The 8th-century pharmacologist Chen Cangqi explains using venomous creatures both to produce and cure gu-poison. > In general reptiles and insects, which are used to make ku, are cures for > ku; therefore, if we know what ku is at work, we may remedy its effects. > Against ku of snakes that of centipedes should be used, against ku of > centipedes that of frogs, against ku of frogs that of snakes, and so on. > Those varieties of ku, having the power of subduing each other, may also > have a curative effect . say prescribing gu poison as a cure or preventive suggests \\"that someone had stumbled on an immunisation process\\", and suggest scorpion-venom and centipede-venom as possible toxins. Chen (, cf. ) further describes catching and preparing medicine from the shapeshifting gu creature that, > ‚Ä¶ can conceal its form, and seem to be a ghost or spirit, and make > misfortune for men. But after all it is only a reptile ghost. If one of them > has bitten a person to death, it will sometimes emerge from one of that > man's apertures. Watch and wait to catch it and dry it in the warmth of the > sun; then, when someone is afflicted by the ku, burn it to ashes and give > him a dose of it. Being akin, to it, the one quite naturally subdues the > other. Besides such homeopathic remedies, says one could, > give ku derived from particularly venomous creatures to overcome that taken > from less lethal creatures. Thus centipede ku could be overcome by frog ku; > serpent ku would prevail over frog ku, and so on. There were also soberer, > though almost as powerful remedies: asafetida, python bile, civet, and a > white substance taken from cock's dung were all used. It is not certain what > real maladies these repellent drugs, cured, or seemed to cure. Probably they > ranged from the psychosomatic to the virus-born. Many oedematous conditions > were called ku, and it has been plausibly suggested that some cases were > caused by intestinal parasites (hence the constant worm motif). Others are > attributable to fish poisons and arrow poisons concocted by the forest > dwellers. Chinese folklore claims the definitive cure for gu-magic is passing it on to a greedy person. says, > The most common way to get rid of the ku (just as of brownies and the > golden-silkworm) was to give it away as a present. The actions of a man in > Chang-chou (Fukien) are rather uncommon. He found on the ground a package > containing three large silver bars wrapped in silk and in addition a ku > which looked like a frog (ha-ma); in spite of the danger he took it; at > night two large frogs appeared which he cooked and ate; on the next night > more than ten smaller frogs appeared which he also ate up; and he continued > consuming all frogs that kept appearing until the magic was cast off; in > this fashion the man suffered no ill effects from the ku poison. From descriptions of gu poisoning such involving \\"swollen abdomen, emaciation, and the presence of worms in the body orifices of the dead or living\\", reasons, \\"Such symptoms allow a great number of possible explanations and interpretations\\". He suggests attitudes toward gu were based upon fear of others, envy, and greed. \\"But the concept of ku is unknown outside of China.

He lives in St. Paul, Alberta. He won the Grand North American Old Tyme Fiddle Championship in 1985. In more recent years, he has judged the Canadian Grand Masters fiddle competition, and was awarded a Life Time Achievement Award from them in 2005. He participates in Emma Lake Fiddle Camp. He has played with various other musicians including John Arcand. Some of his music is jazz-like, some from the M√©tis tradition. He is an inspiration and a mentor to many Canadian fiddlers, including April Verch, Patti Kusturok, and Samantha Robichaud. Jerry Holland has composed a tune in Calvin's honour, named \\"Calvin, Fiddler's Idol\\". Calvin has represented Canadian music internationally, such as at the World Music Expo in Berlin in 2000. He became the first fiddler to play at an NHL hockey game when the Edmonton Oilers invited him to play during the Stanley Cup Finals in 1988. He has made recordings with musicians such as Ian Tyson, George Fox, Colleen Peterson, and Laura Vinson. CBC's documentary show hosted by Adrienne Clarkson aired a show about M√©tis fiddling that featured Calvin Vollrath and John Arcand. He composed and performed a piece for the 2010 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.  Life  Calvin's love for music began at an early age. He used to mimic his father Art \\"Lefty\\" Vollrath with two butter knives. His father developed his own reputation as a great fiddler and passed on the family tradition. Calvin was raised on the Don Messer's Jubilee and at the age of 8, received his first fiddle. It was soon apparent Calvin was a natural. At 13, he entered his first fiddle contest.  Career  Vollrath has composed nearly 600 tunes and released more than 65 albums. He wrote the theme for the international fiddle convention 'Fiddles of the World', held in Halifax in July 1999. Vollrath was commissioned to compose 5 fiddle tunes for the Vancouver Winter Olympics Opening Ceremonies in 2010. The tunes were meant to represent the various styles of fiddling our country has to offer.  Awards  He won two Grand North American Fiddle Championships and was inducted into the North American Fiddlers' Hall of Fame on 31 July 2011.

Overview  The key characteristic of a business suite is the delivery of end-to-end business processes which span organizational boundaries such as business departments and locations. In the last years the focus of the business processes supported by business suites has expanded to integrate business partners such as customers, suppliers and service providers . Business Suites are generally rooted in the traditional ERP systems that are based on a common data model used to storing the data to be shared between departments and their business processes. Most corporate ERP systems have been enhanced and complemented by additional applications over the years. As a result, the total cost of ownership (TCO) grows, process integrity across applications is at stake, and the flexibility to consistently change and optimize business processes suffers. The vendors of business suites claim to address these issues.  Topics  The issues with business process visibility, flexibility, efficiency, and integrity in heterogeneous business application environments have recently created 2 basic types of business suites: * The \\"cumulative\\" business suite consists of a set of previously separate applications that are connected at the middleware or database level. The absence of a unified data and process model complicates the implementation of end-to-end processes with ensured process integrity for customers. System integrators are addressing this issue at the expense of a business suite owner. * The \\"organic\\" business suite delivers end-to-end business processes designed to run in one offering. Modern organic business suites provide additional openness to integrate with other applications or extend processes to business partners through SOA technologies.  Business Process Scope  A business suite usually encompasses all core business and business support processes of an organization, unlike business applications such as treasury management or CRM that have been designed to serve a single line of business. Since no vendor today offers applications covering all business process requirements of larger organizations, vendors complement their application portfolio through acquisitions or through cooperation with specialized partners. Two strategies A \\"coverage through acquisition\\" strategy is confined to the processes that are entirely under the control of a single organization, while the \\"coverage through cooperation\\" approach can also enable and support processes that span the boundaries of multiple organizations like suppliers, customers, banks. Foundational processes The foundational set of business processes supported by a business suite includes business support processes to manage financials, build, develop and administer the workforce, run facilities, support the procurement of generic goods and services. Those foundational processes are required to sustain a functional enterprise that complies with all regulatory requirements. Value drivers The next layer of business processes is sometimes grouped by the main value drivers or differentiators of a company: * Development, production, sales, and distribution of products * Acquisition, operations, and compliance of production assets * Management of the production, logistics, and distribution network * Marketing, sales, production, and service for customers * Cost/performance optimized procurement, production, and operations Processes in support of value drivers Key processes supporting those value drivers invariably span organizational boundaries and are relevant for multiple lines of business. A typical business process that connects organizational entities is \\"order to cash\\" which can span sales, production, finance, logistics, billing and dispute management and influences important key performance indicators of the involved areas like \\"free cash-flow\\", \\"customer satisfaction\\", \\"customer profitability\\", \\"fulfillment cost\\". Some business suites offer a layer of deep industry processes - either through industry extensions of the core business suite or through a network of frequently certified 3rd party software providers which adopt compatible or identical process and data models. Current status Today, no commercial business suite can cover all business process requirements of a large organization. Modern business suites offer an environment in which an organization can develop or modify business processes reusing the supplied standard processes. Some advanced business suites allow the fast composition of new business processes from process fragments or process steps.

In 1913 Clark joined with Harry Fenn, a surveyor, founding a company at Loughborough Junction to specialise in ornamental fibrous plasterwork and Plaster of Paris work. The business was a rapid success with commissions from the new cinemas and major theatres who competed against each other through the splendour of their interior decoration. For designs, Clark & Fenn worked closely with G. Jackson & Sons, founded in 1780 with Robert Adam as a designer. The company soon moved to larger premises at Clapham Old Town where they were able to prefabricate much of their work off-site. This allowed them to take the mouldings ready-prepared for installation to a theatre or cinema, minimising the disruption to performances and rehearsals.

Arcand has been writing and performing since childhood, having learned the traditional Red River M√©tis tunes from his father Victor and his grandfather Jean-Baptiste. He has said \\"I knew from childhood I would be a fiddler,\\" he said. \\"I love the constant challenge because you cannot ever master the fiddle.\\" He is known for the impeccable sense of timing in his music, a skill that is necessary when guiding dancers. Arcand has been recognized by the M√©tis community for ensuring that this important tradition survives. Along with a busy performing schedule, John is active as a guest artist and judge at fiddle contests, is in demand as an instructor at many fiddle camps and with private students, and also makes and repairs fiddles.  Life  Jean Baptiste Arcand was born to a long line of musicians, which can be traced back nine generations. His family roots come from M√©tis communities of Red River and Batoche. John was one of 14 children born to parents Victor Arcand and Emma Loyie. He grew up in an environment with dancing and fiddle music. While neither John's father or grandfather composed music, they played tradition M√©tis Red River tunes such as jigs and reels for dancing. By the age of 12, John was playing for dances in people's homes or at school. Much of childhood was spent working on his family‚Äôs farm, chopping wood and milking cows. He began working in logging camps at 16, which helped to pay for his first fiddle.  Career  Arcand worked as a project coordinator at the Gabriel Dumont Institute in Saskatoon, SK. During that time, he planned and facilitated a collaboration of well-known and respected fiddle players from across Westerns Canada to gather and preserve their traditional tunes. This led to the CDs and book called Drops of Brandy and other Traditional M√©tis Tunes. This is a four CD set, containing over 150 fiddle tunes performed by 12 master Metis fiddlers including Gilbert Anderson, Trent Bruner, Richard Callihoo, Henry Gardipy, Emile Lavallee, Albert 'Hap' Boyer, Garry Lapine, John Arcand, Mel Bedard, Richard Lafferty, Homer Poitras and Ed Lafferty. An accompanying book was also released, with sheet music for every song in the compilation, as well as biographies of the performers, and a detailed look at the history and cultural importance of Metis fiddling. John has been a mentor to many Canadian fiddlers over a long career. On March 28, 2003, The National Aboriginal Achievement Award for Arts and Culture was presented to Arcand at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. He was recognized for his contributions and his commitment to the preservation of M√©tis fiddling. The Canadian Grand Masters Fiddling Championship awarded him a lifetime achievement award in 2003. He performed at the launch of Canada's first web-based M√©tis radio station. On May 3, 2007, Arcand became a member of the Order of Canada. He was invested as a member to the order on April 11, 2008.  Festivals  Arcand has recorded many albums including an album of M√©tis fiddle tunes with Calvin Vollrath. With Vollrath, he established the Emma Lake Fiddle Camp, run by the Saskatchewan Cultural Exchange Society. Famous fiddlers Richard Wood and Patti Kusturok Lamoreux were also teachers at Emma Lake. The John Arcand Fiddle Fest, held each August on his acreage south of Saskatoon, is attended by fans of fiddle music from around the globe. In 2017 it had its 20th anniversary.  Influences  Arcand‚Äôs compositions and musical style have been influenced by Andy DeJarlis. The influence on his compositions can be seen in his recording of several DeJarlis‚Äôs tunes over the years, as well as his inclusion of a DeJarlis fiddle tune contest at his Fiddle Fest in 2005. Many of Arcand‚Äôs compositions have a similar sound to DeJarlis‚Äôs tunes in their use of minors and related rhythmic patterns.  Compositions  Arcand has composed close to 400 tunes. Many of these are written for individuals or to honour places he has been.

Biblical archaeology, occasionally known as Palestinologyhttp://www.custodia.org/SBF-In-Memoriam-Father- Michele.html?lang=it is the school of archaeology which concerns itself with the biblical world. 18th/early 20th centuries Adriaan Reland, professor of philosophy at the University of Harderwijk, was one of the early Orientalists, teaching Hebrew antiquities from 1713.Power And Religion in Baroque Rome: Barberini Cultural Policies, P. J. A. N. Rietbergen, p.321Adriaan Reland (1676-1718) Although he never ventured beyond the borders of the Netherlands, he was also acclaimed as a cartographerMaps by Reland and published the first modern work of biblical archaeology, Palaestina ex monumentis veteribus illustrata, a detailed geographical survey of Palestine in 1696 written in Latin and published by Willem Broedelet, Utrecht, in 1714. The foundations of biblical archaeology were laid in the 19th century with the work of antiquarians such as Johann Jahn, whose manual of biblical antiquities, Biblische Arch√§ologie, (1802, translated into English 1839) was immensely influential in the middle years of the 19th century. Shortly thereafter, Edward Robinson, known as the founder of modern Palestinology published the bestselling Biblical Researches in Palestine, the Sinai, Petrae and Adjacent Regions (1841), which prompted a group of English clergymen and scholars to found the Palestine Exploration Fund \\"to promote research into the archaeology and history, manners and customs and culture, topography, geology and natural sciences of biblical Palestine and the Levant\\" in 1865. This was followed by the Deutscher Pal√§stina-Verein (1877) and the √âcole Biblique (1890). The American School of Oriental Research was founded in 1900, and the British School of Archaeology in 1919. The research these institutions sponsored, at least in these early days, was primarily geographic, and it was not until the 1890s that Sir Flinders Petrie introduced the basic principles of scientific excavation, including stratigraphy and ceramic typology to Palestinian archaeology. William F. Albright and the biblical archaeology school The dominant figure in 20th-century biblical archaeology, defining its scope and shaping the mid-century consensus on the relationship between archaeology, the Bible, and the history of ancient Israel, was William F. Albright (1891-1971). An American with roots in the American Evangelical tradition (his parents served as Methodist missionaries in Chile), Director of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), (now the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research) through the 1920s and 1930s, editor of ASOR's Bulletin until 1968, and author of over a thousand books and articles, Albright drew biblical archaeology into the contemporary debates over the origins and reliability of the Bible. In the early decades of the 20th century much debate centered on the documentary hypothesis. This explained the Old Testament as the composite product of authors working between the 10th and 5th centuries BC, and raised the question of whether one could regard the books of the bible as a reliable source of information for Solomon's period or earlier.\\" European scholars such as Hermann Gunkel (1862-1932), Albrecht Alt (1883-1956) and Martin Noth (1902-1968) suggested that the books of the Old Testament rested on a body of oral tradition that reflected historical events, but could not themselves be regarded as historically accurate. Albright saw archaeology as a practical means to test these ideas. Biblical archaeology, for him, therefore embraced all lands and any finds that could \\"throw some light, directly or indirectly, on the Bible\\". Peter Moorey, \\"A Century of Biblical Archaeology\\", p.54ff Albright and his followers believed that archaeology could and should be used to shed light on the biblical narrative, particularly the Old Testament. The influential academic positions held by Albright and his followers, and their immense output ‚Äî Albright alone authored over a thousand books and articles ‚Äî made their work highly influential, especially in America, and especially among ordinary Christians who wished to believe that archaeology had \\"proved the Bible true\\". In fact the members of the school were not biblical literalists, and their main concern was to discriminate between those parts of the biblical story that were true and those that were embellishments. By the middle of the 20th century the work of Albright and his students, notably Nelson Glueck (1900-1971), E. A. Speiser (1902-1965), G. Ernest Wright (1909-1974) and Cyrus Gordon (1908-2001), had produced a consensus that biblical archaeology had provided physical evidence for the originating historical events behind the Old Testament narratives: in the words of Albright: \\"Discovery after discovery has established the accuracy of innumerable details of the Bible as a source of history.\\"W.F.Albright, The Archaeology of Palestine, 1954 edition, p. 128, quoted in Walter F. Kaiser, \\"What Good is Biblical Archaeology to Bible Readers?\\", Contact magazine, Winter 05/06, at gctuedu.com The consensus allowed the writing of authoritative textbooks such as John Bright's History of Israel (1959).John Bright, A History of Israel, 4th edition Bright did not believe that the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph could be regarded as reliable history, or that it was possible to reconstruct the origins of Israel from the biblical text alone, but he did believe that the stories in Genesis reflected the physical reality of the 20th to 17th centuries BC, and that it was therefore possible to write a history of the origins of Israel by comparing the biblical accounts with what was known of the time from other sources. G. W. Ahlstrom, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 95, No. 2 (Apr. ‚Äì Jun., 1975), review of John Bright's History of Israel (4th edition). Biblical archaeology today Albrightian theories were largely overturned in the second half of the 20th century, especially in regards to suppositions that Albrightians made regarding the pre-monarchic era. Improved archaeological methods, notably Kathleen Kenyon's excavations at Jericho, did not support the conclusions the biblical archaeologists had drawn, with the result that central theories squaring the biblical narrative with archaeological finds, such as Albright's reconstruction of Abraham as an Amorite donkey caravaneer, were rejected by the archaeological community. The challenge reached its climax with the publication of two important studies: In 1974 Thomas L. Thompson's The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives re- examined the record of biblical archaeology in relation to the Patriarchal narratives in Genesis and concluded that \\"not only has archaeology not proven a single event of the Patriarchal narratives to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely.\\" Thomas L. Thompson, \\"The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham\\", 1974, p.328, quoted in a review by Dennis Pardee, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 1977 and in 1975 John Van Seters' 'Abraham in History and Tradition' reached a similar conclusion about the usefulness of tradition history: \\"A vague presupposition about the antiquity of the tradition based upon a consensus approval of such arguments should no longer be used as a warrant for proposing a history of the tradition related to early premonarchic times.\\" At the same time a new generation of archaeologists, notably William G. Dever, criticized biblical archaeology for failing to take note of the revolution in archaeology known as processualism, which saw the discipline as a scientific one allied to anthropology, rather than as a part of the corpus of the humanities linked to history and theology. Biblical archaeology, Dever said, remained \\"altogether too narrowly within a theological angle of vision,\\"Joel Ng, \\"Introduction to Biblical Archaeology\\", 2003 (revised 2004), at Edwardtbabinski.com and should be abandoned and replaced with a regional Syro-Palestinian archaeology operating within a processual framework. Dever was broadly successful: most archaeologists working in the world of the Bible today do so within a processual or post-processual framework: yet few describe themselves in these terms. The reasons for this attachment to the old nomenclature are complex, but are connected with the link between excavators (especially American ones) and the denominational institutions and benefactors who employ and support them, and with the unwillingness of biblical scholars, both conservative and liberal, to reject the link between the Bible and archaeology.Ziony Zevit, \\"Three Debates About Bible and Archaeology: The 'Biblical Archaeology' Debate\\", Biblica 83 (2002) pp.2‚Äì9 The result has been a blurring of the distinction between the theologically-based archaeology that interprets the archaeological record as \\"substantiating in general the theological message of a God who acts in history,\\"Specifically this was the view of Albright's student, G. E. Wright, and his \\"Biblical Theology\\" school, which became popular in America in the 1950s. See Andrew G. Vaughn, review of William G. Dever, \\"What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archaeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel\\" (2001), RBL 2003 and Dever's vision of Syro-Palestinian archaeology as an \\"independent, secular discipline ... pursued by cultural historians for its own sake.\\"William G.

He was the elder brother of James Fenn, the Catholic martyr, and Robert Fenn. Life After being a chorister at Wells Cathedral, he went to Winchester School in 1547, and in 1550 to New College, Oxford, of which he was elected Fellow in 1552. Next year he became head master of the Bury St Edmunds Grammar School, but was deprived of this office and also of his fellowship for refusing to take the oath of supremacy under Elizabeth. He went to Rome where after four years' study he was ordained priest about 1566. Having for a time been chaplain to Sir William Stanley's regiment in Flanders, he settled at Leuven, where he lived for forty years. In 1609, when the English Augustinian Canonnesses founded St. Monica's Priory in Leuven, he became their first chaplain, until in 1611 when his sight failed. He continued to live in the priory, until his death. Works He contributed to the publication, in 1583, by John Gibbons, S.J., of various accounts of persecution of English Catholics, under the title \\"Concertatio Ecclesiae Catholicae in Angli√¢\\". This was the groundwork of the larger collection published by Bridgewater under the same name in 1588. Besides his \\"Vitae quorundam Martyrum in Angli√¢\\", included in the \\"Concertatio\\", he translated into Latin John Fisher's \\"Treatise on the penitential Psalms\\" (1597) and two of his sermons; he also published English versions of the Catechism of the Council of Trent, Jerome Osorio de Fonseca's reply to Walter Haddon's attack on his letter to Queen Elizabeth (1568), Guerra's \\"Treatise of Tribulation\\", an Italian life of Catherine of Sienna (1609; 1867), and Gaspar Loarte's \\"Instructions How to Meditate the Misteries of the Rosarie\\".

The story was published in July 1905 by Pall Mall Magazine in London.Rowland, page 282 The story was also included as the seventh story in the collection A Thief in the Night, published by Chatto & Windus in London, and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York, both in 1905.Rowland, page 280. Plot Very early morning, Bunny receives a vague and distressing telephone call from Raffles, telling Bunny that he has fallen into Maguire's trap. Barney Maguire, the heavyweight champion of the United States who is in England to fight a leading British contender, had met Raffles and Bunny at the Imperial Sporting Club a week ago and invited them to his home. Raffles had admired Maguire's many jewels and valuable trophies, and, being further encouraged by Maguire's boast that he had devised a perfect trap to catch any cracksman, had decided to steal Maguire's trophies on the night after Maguire was to fight the British champion, correctly assuming that Maguire would win and go out drinking to celebrate. However, Raffles faints before he can tell Bunny over the phone the nature of the trap was that has indeed caught him. Horrified, Bunny rushes to Maguire's house in Half-moon Street, and rings repeatedly, but to no answer. Then, Maguire, his secretary, and his lady friend arrive in a carriage. Bunny appeases Maguire's suspicions by identifying himself as Raffles's friend, come to visit. They enter the house, and discover a disguised Raffles unconscious on the floor. Maguire, pleased to have caught a thief, reveals the nature of the trap was that caught the burglar: a silver-labelled bottle of whisky, drugged and left out for thieves. The secretary finds Raffles's bag of loot under a table, which holds Maguire's statues, infuriating Maguire. The secretary also notes that the telephone has been used, and suggests that they make inquiries as to who was called. Bunny says that it was he whom the thief called, and that the thief had pretended to be Raffles inviting him to Maguire's house. The other three drink from a safe whisky bottle and, before Bunny can drink, fall unconscious. Amazed, Bunny wakes Raffles, who is glad to see him, and also delighted that his scheme worked: before fainting, Raffles had moved the silver label from the drugged whisky bottle to the safe one. Though there is still the question of explaining the telephone call, Bunny agrees to maintain his innocence by pretending to be unconscious, and then calling the police, while Raffles escapes with the loot. After fulfilling his grim task, Bunny returns to his own flat, only to find it has been burgled in his absence. Suspecting Raffles, he goes to the Albany for an explanation. Raffles cheerfully tells him that the police will now blame the telephone call on the unknown burglar's scheme of drawing Bunny from his rooms, in order to burgle them. Adaptations Television The story was adapted as the seventh episode of the Raffles television series, with Anthony Valentine as A. J. Raffles and Christopher Strauli as Bunny Manders. The episode, titled \\"A Trap to Catch a Cracksman\\", first aired on 8 April 1977. Radio BBC Radio adapted the story into the tenth episode of its Raffles radio drama, \\"A Trap to Catch a Cracksman\\", which first aired on 29 June 1988. The drama features Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny. The episode largely follows the plot of the original story, with minor changes: * In the drama, Maguire's astute secretary is replaced by two simple-minded lackeys named Cruncher and Hambone, and the unnamed lady friend acquires the name Ruby. * In the original story, Bunny only pretends to have been drugged, whereas in the drama Raffles surreptitiously drugs Bunny's drink. * In the drama only, Inspector Mackenzie is among the police that come to Maguire's house.

K. Rowling. He is introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as a half-giant and half-human who is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts, the primary setting for the first six novels. In the third novel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid is promoted to Care of Magical Creatures professor, and is later revealed to be a member of the Order of the Phoenix. Character development Hagrid was among the characters that Rowling says she created on \\"the very first day\\". She has explained the source of his name as \\"another old English word, meaning ‚Äì if you were hagrid ‚Äì it‚Äôs a dialect word ‚Äì you‚Äôd had a bad night. Hagrid is a big drinker ‚Äì he has a lot of bad nights.\\" His first name, Rubeus, was named after red in Latin to reflect alchemy and his paternal contrast to Albus Dumbledore: his \\"passion\\" to Dumbledore's \\"asceticism\\". In her article \\"Harry‚Äôs Fame\\", Rosemary Goring notes the Forest of Dean is an influence on Rowling‚Äôs work, and Hagrid is the only character that is \\"directly drawn from the Forest of Dean\\". According to Goring, Hagrid‚Äôs \\"dropped word-endings are a Chepstow speciality.\\" She also claims that Hagrid is physically \\"modeled on the Welsh chapter of Hells Angels who‚Äôd swoop down on the town and hog the bar, 'huge mountains of leather and hair\\". The character of Hagrid and conversations between him, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in his hut are expository through the series, due to the fact that the trio frequently discover things about Albus Dumbledore and Hogwarts by talking with Hagrid, as he has a habit of letting slip bits of information that were specifically confided to him. He was also one of the first characters to imply that the idea of thinking of wizards as \\"pure-bloods\\" and \\"half-bloods\\" is a dated concept. Rowling has stated in an interview that Hagrid was in Gryffindor house during his time as a student. When he comes into possession of an acromantula, he is expelled from Hogwarts as his pet is believed to be the \\"monster of Slytherin\\". However, persuaded by Dumbledore (who at the time was Transfiguration teacher), Headmaster Armando Dippet agrees to train Hagrid as gamekeeper, allowing the boy to remain at Hogwarts. By the time Harry attends Hogwarts, Hagrid is also the Keeper of Keys and Grounds: the former, according to Rowling, means \\"that he will let you in and out of Hogwarts.\\" Part of his job includes leading the first years across the lake in boats, upon their initial arrival at Hogwarts. When discussing the killing off of characters in her books, Rowling said that she always knew she was \\"working towards the point where Hagrid carried Harry out alive ‚Äì but supposedly dead ‚Äì out of the forest\\". She said she had planned from very early on that Harry would walk to his death accompanied by the 'ghosts', and that \\"he would emerge in Hagrid's arms\\". In her own words, \\"that's what always kept Hagrid safe\\". She said \\"Hagrid would have been a natural to kill in some ways\\", but that the mental image of this moment ‚Äì a big fatherly Hagrid carrying the limp Harry in his arms ‚Äì was so strong it decided his fate. She also liked the circular notion of Hagrid both bringing Harry into the world, and then bringing him back from the dead. Appearances Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Mary GrandPr√©‚Äôs illustration of Hagrid from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in the chapter \\"Keeper of the Keys\\". Hagrid is introduced in the opening chapter of the first novel. Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house after they have been murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about the fact that it was Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the way to get past Fluffy is to play music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron‚Äôs older brother, Charlie Weasley, works. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Readers first discover why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in the second novel. It is revealed that Hagrid was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as Tom Marvolo Riddle, the wizard who later became Lord Voldemort. Hagrid was expelled during his third year, after being caught in the company of Aragog, a dangerous Acromantula: this already serious crime seemed worse than it was, due to the belief that the acromantula was \\"The Monster of Slytherin\\", and that Hagrid had released it from the Chamber of Secrets and allowed it to attack students. Aragog escapes into the dark forest and starts a colony of spiders. The belief of Hagrid's guilt was encouraged by Tom Riddle, the actual criminal, who had been using the true monster (a basilisk) to attack students, and who had framed Hagrid to prevent the school from being closed, because he didn't want to return to the orphanage whence he had come. During the events of the second book, the Basilisk is unleashed once again and Hagrid is sent to the prison of Azkaban, as he is believed again to be responsible for the attacks. However, before being arrested, Hagrid tells Harry and Ron to \\"follow the spiders\\", so that they can meet Aragog and discover the identity of the true monster. After Harry defeats the Basilisk and uncovers the truth, Hagrid is freed from prison. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Following the resignation of Silvanus Kettleburn, who, according to Dumbledore, wanted to spend time with his remaining limbs, Hagrid is assigned to teach the subject of Care of Magical Creatures in the third novel. He is also allowed to perform magic again since his name has been cleared after the events of the previous book. During his first class, in which he introduces the hippogriffs to third-years, one of the beasts, Buckbeak, attacks Draco Malfoy after the boy insults it. Although Dumbledore manages to prove that Hagrid is innocent, the Ministry of Magic sentences Buckbeak to death. Thus, Hagrid's classes become extremely boring, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend some time looking for information that would help Hagrid in Buckbeak‚Äôs defence. Near the end of the book Hermione and Harry use a time-turner to save Buckbeak from death and Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire In the fourth novel it is revealed that Hagrid is of mixed wizard and giant parentage, his mother having been the giantess Fridwulfa, who left his wizard father when Hagrid was a baby. Since giants have a reputation for being brutal, and were once allies of Voldemort, Hagrid keeps his parentage a secret and allows people to imagine other reasons for his great size (such as drinking a bottle of Skele-Gro when he did not need it). Hagrid‚Äôs parentage is exposed in the Daily Prophet by Rita Skeeter, who portrays him as dangerous (because of his fascination for aggressive creatures) and incompetent. Hagrid is gravely affected by this and attempts to resign from his post as teacher, though Dumbledore does not accept his resignation. During the novel, Hagrid develops a romantic interest with Olympe Maxime ‚Äì another half-giant witch and Headmistress of the French magic school Beauxbatons. Hagrid is also one of the very few people who, since the beginning, believes Harry‚Äôs word that he did not apply to enter the Triwizard Tournament. Later in the book, Alastor Moody (impersonated by Barty Crouch Jr) suggests Hagrid should show Harry that the first task of the Tournament would involve dragons. Hagrid also provides Blast-Ended Skrewts for the third task. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hagrid is absent during the first part of the fifth novel. The character later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also found the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort‚Äôs side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime‚Äôs exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid‚Äôs half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore and part giant, Umbridge being highly prejudiced against non-humans. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore‚Äôs post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince In the sixth novel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer students of Care of Magical Creatures, and Hagrid is both angry and disappointed with them during the first part of the book, but he soon realises that it is not because they do not like him. Later in the novel, Aragog dies, and Hagrid risks his life to recover the Acromantula's body to give it a proper funeral. After the funeral, he and Horace Slughorn drink excessive amounts of Firewhisky, and Harry takes advantage of this situation (under the influence of Felix Felicis potion, otherwise known as \\"liquid luck\\") to retrieve a certain memory from Slughorn. Towards the end of the book, Death Eaters attack Hogwarts and Hagrid's hut is set on fire as he tries to fight them. During Dumbledore‚Äôs funeral, Hagrid is seen carrying the Headmaster‚Äôs body. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows In the seventh novel, Hagrid is part of the Order of the Phoenix delegation assigned to remove Harry from the Dursleys' home to the magic-protected Burrow. Hagrid takes Harry on the flying motorcycle he inherited from Sirius but the plan goes awry when the Order delegation is ambushed by Death Eaters. The pair narrowly make it to the Burrow after being attacked by Voldemort himself. After attending Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour‚Äôs wedding reception, Hagrid does not appear again until near the end of the book when it is revealed he has been driven into hiding in the mountains by the new Death Eater regime at Hogwarts. During the climactic battle, Hagrid attempts to come to the defence of Aragog's carnivorous children, who have been driven out of the Forbidden Forest by the Death Eaters and are now attacking both Hogwarts defenders and Death Eaters indiscriminately, but he is carried off by a swarm of them. He later turns up, captive in the Death Eaters' camp, when Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort. Hagrid is forced to carry Harry back to the school, not realising that Harry has survived again, and en route accuses the watching Centaurs of not doing enough to help. The Centaurs soon afterward join the fray and Hagrid takes part in the second half of the battle, felling his main nemesis among the Death Eaters, the magical-creature executioner Walden Macnair. According to Rowling, the scene in the final book in which Hagrid is seen carrying Harry‚Äôs apparently dead body is very significant as \\"Hagrid brings Harry from the Dursleys. He takes him into the wizarding world ... He was sort of his guardian and his guide ... And now I wanted Hagrid to be the one to lead Harry out of the forest.\\" Rowling also commented that Hagrid was never in danger of dying, as she \\"always had that picture in my head of the huge gigantic Hagrid walking through the forest crying with Harry in his arms\\". =Epilogue= Nineteen years after Voldemort‚Äôs defeat, Hagrid is still at Hogwarts and invites Harry and Ginny Weasley's second son Albus Severus Potter to his hut for tea, just as he had once done for Harry himself, implying that he and Harry are still close. During an interview in 2007, when asked if Hagrid did marry, Rowling answered that Hagrid developed a relationship with a giantess but it did not work out. Film portrayal Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane has portrayed Hagrid in all of the film adaptations of the Harry Potter novels. Robin Williams was interested for the role and approached Chris Columbus, the director of the first two films, about participating in the project but Columbus rejected him due to the \\"all-British and Irish cast\\" policy. Rowling had wanted Coltrane for the role from the start, responding \\"RobbieColtraneforHagrid\\" all in one quick breath when asked who was the top of her list of casting choices. Coltrane was already a fan of the books and has commented that being part of the Harry Potter franchise was \\"a fantastic thing.\\" Rowling discussed Hagrid's past and future with Coltrane, assisting him in preparing for the role. She also stated that \\"Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic [...] but he had to have ‚Äì you really do have to sense ‚Äì a certain toughness underneath [...] and I think Robbie does that perfectly.\\" Former English rugby union player Martin Bayfield portrayed Hagrid as a stunt performer in longer shots due to his large size to emphasise Hagrid‚Äôs height. Bayfield also appeared as a young Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. English actor Greg Draven portrayed Hagrid as an acting double in Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure. Draven's performance was required due to Robbie's poor health at the time of filming.Michelle Marshall, \\"Robbie Coltrane: Harry Potter star ‚Äòconfined to wheelchair‚Äô amid osteoarthritis battle\\", The Express Characterisation Outward appearance In Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, Hagrid is mentioned as being twice as tall as the average man and nearly five times as wide but in the film, he is portrayed as being and in later books he is said to be three times as wide. Hagrid is known for his thick West Country accent. Being a half-giant, he is less vulnerable to jinxes and spells than full-humans. In Order of the Phoenix, when Umbridge and some other wizards come to remove him from Hogwarts he fights back. They try to jinx and stun him, but the spells just bounce off him because of giant-inherited resistance to magic. Hagrid also shows this resilience at the end of Half-Blood Prince, during the chapter Flight of the Prince, withstanding a Death Eater‚Äôs powerful curses. Some potions are also ineffective with him, such as Polyjuice Potion, which is designed for human- only use., chapter 5 Personality He has a friendly, softhearted personality and is easily driven to tears, as seen in his very first scene, when he drops Harry off at the Dursleys' in Philosopher‚Äôs Stone. He is very loyal to his peers, especially Dumbledore, to whom he refers as the greatest wizard in the world multiple times. As first seen in Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, he becomes extremely angry whenever anyone insults Dumbledore around him (a mistake made by Vernon Dursley, who called Dumbledore a \\"crackpot old fool\\"). He is also very loyal to Harry, suffered several times during the series because of this loyalty, and had to go into hiding twice to avoid prison. Rowling says of Hagrid, \\"Hagrid was always supposed to be this almost elemental force. He‚Äôs like the king of the forest, or the Green Man. He‚Äôs this semi-wild person who lives on the edge of the forest\\". Magical abilities and skills Following his expulsion from Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic broke Hagrid‚Äôs oak wand and forbade him to perform magic. Hagrid keeps the pieces of his wand in a pink umbrella, and performs small spells from time to time; however, he was technically forbidden to do magic until the third book, and since he is not a fully qualified wizard, he \\"will always be a bit inept\\" as compared to other adult wizards, but \\"occasionally surprises everyone, himself included, by bringing off more impressive bits of magic\\". However, he is unable to produce a Patronus. He also has magical abilities that stem from his giant blood. For example, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, many of the stunning spells thrown at him by Ministry officials simply bounce off him. Also, being half-giant gives Hagrid some level of superhuman strength, which allowed him to bend the barrel of a shotgun with one hand. Family Grawp Grawp is the giant half-brother of Hagrid. Grawp and Hagrid were born of the same mother, the giantess Fridwulfa. Grawp is about tall, which Hagrid claims is small for a giant. His knuckles are the size of cricket balls (~ in circumference). The other giants were bullying Grawp because of his diminutive size, and this is a factor in Hagrid‚Äôs decision to bring him to the Forbidden Forest. Big and dim, he only knows a few words in English and his manners are wild and unpredictable, but he is also a child in giant years. In the film, this is elaborated on more as he is visibly portrayed as a big, excitable child who simply doesn't know his own strength or developed proper social cues yet. He responds to Hermione, who approaches him like a strict but caring mother figure, scolding him when doing something wrong, but giving him praise and playing with him when he does something good. At first, Grawp seems indifferent to his brother‚Äôs attempts to civilise him, preferring to spend his time tearing down trees. After Hagrid leaves Hogwarts to avoid being imprisoned, he leaves Grawp in the care of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Much to their surprise, when they find themselves trapped in the forest during a confrontation with the local centaur population, Grawp inadvertently manages to divert the centaurs' attention from Harry and Hermione while looking for Hagrid, whom he calls 'Hagger'. In the Half-Blood Prince, Grawp is moved to the mountains, where he is apparently progressing much better. He also attends Dumbledore‚Äôs funeral with Hagrid, much more civil and calm than before, and dressed formally. He also appears to understand emotions, at least to some extent, as he pats Hagrid‚Äôs head to comfort him. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Grawp, Hagrid, and Fang go into hiding after Hagrid throws a \\"Support Harry Potter\\" party and it is implied that Grawp helped them all escape. He is the only giant fighting against the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, probably in an attempt to protect Hagrid, as he frequently calls his name while fighting the Death Eaters. Grawp participates in the victory celebration over Voldemort‚Äôs defeat (albeit from a window, since he is too big to fit into the hall), and the Hogwarts students show their appreciation by tossing food into his laughing mouth. In the film adaptation of the fifth book Grawp is computer-generated using a new \\"soul capturing\\" process from Image Metrics. Andrew Whitehead spent 18 months working on the giant Grawp for the film. The voice of Grawp is performed by Tony Maudsley. Parents In the Goblet of Fire, the truth about Hagrid‚Äôs parents is revealed: his father, who is never named in the stories, married a giantess, Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left Rubeus to his father‚Äôs care after his birth; according to Hagrid, she was not very maternal. Later she gave birth to Grawp. She died long before Hagrid returned to the giants in the Order of the Phoenix. Hagrid describes his father as \\"a tiny little man\\" whom he could pick up with one hand and place on the dresser at the age of six. Hagrid clearly felt great affection for him; in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, he says that his father‚Äôs death when Hagrid was in third year at Hogwarts was one of his saddest memories. Hagrid's pets Hagrid keeps and has kept a variety of pets, including some which the Wizarding community considers impossible to domesticate. They are not always wrong. Rowling has said that Hagrid has little interest in tamer magical creatures because of the lack of a challenge, although he has a large but cowardly boarhound named Fang. Hagrid‚Äôs love of dangerous magical creatures is central to the plot of several books of the series. Aragog thumb Aragog was an Acromantula, an enormous, sentient spider capable of speech, who made a unique clicking noise as he moved in search of prey. Hagrid raised Aragog from an egg as a Hogwarts student, keeping him inside a cupboard. In his third year at Hogwarts, Hagrid was caught talking to Aragog in the dungeons by Tom Riddle, who alleged that Aragog was the \\"Monster of Slytherin\\", and that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, it was Riddle who had opened the Chamber, and the monster was actually a basilisk. After Hagrid's expulsion and assignment as gamekeeper, Aragog lived in the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid found him a mate, Mosag, with whom Aragog bore an entire colony of giant spiders. He remained grateful to Hagrid for his entire life, and kept his carnivorous children from attacking him when he came to visit (to bring him and his family food). This courtesy was not extended to other creatures and people, even when they were friends of Hagrid's; he allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang when they encountered him in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Hagrid led Harry and Ron to Aragog by giving them the cryptic advice, \\"follow the spiders\\". An aging Aragog reveals to Harry and Ron Hagrid's innocence and the discovery of a girl's corpse in the bathroom, before giving them a clue of the Chamber's resident monster; it was born in the castle, and his species never speak of the creature nor give its name, despite Hagrid's numerous inquiries, as they fear it above all others. Though Aragog allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang, they were saved at the last minute by Ron's father Arthur Weasley‚Äôs flying car, which had been lost in the forest months before. Aragog remained in the Forbidden Forest for the rest of his life, but eventually died of old age in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Hagrid retrieved Aragog‚Äôs body from the forest so that he could give him a proper burial, fearing that his children would devour his body. From that point on, the spider colony was the only part of the Forbidden Forest that Hagrid could not enter safely. Aragog‚Äôs children returned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows during the Battle at Hogwarts; having been driven from the forest, they began attacking Death Eaters and Hogwarts' inhabitants indiscriminately. Hagrid‚Äôs love of the spiders endangered him and others because he tried to protect them; the spiders thanked Hagrid by capturing him and taking him to Voldemort. It is unknown what happens to them afterwards. Aragog was voiced by Julian Glover in the film adaptation of the Chamber of Secrets. In 2017, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise, arachnologists Anton A. Nadolny and Alireza Zamani named a new species of Iranian wolf spiders (Lycosidae) after Aragog, as Lycosa aragogi. The single specimen was collected on 26 April 2016, almost 19 years to the day after Aragog died (20 April 1997 in the world of the book). Buckbeak thumb Buckbeak, along with eleven other hippogriffs, is introduced during one of Hagrid‚Äôs Care of Magical Creatures classes. Hagrid explains that hippogriffs are very calm, powerful, proud creatures, but are sensitive and demand respect. Harry successfully approaches Buckbeak, who allows him to ride him around the paddock. Draco, in an arrogant attempt to show up his school nemesis, endeavours to approach Buckbeak as well. It becomes obvious that Draco neither listens to nor cares about Hagrid's warnings about the hippogriffs' sensitivity, as he makes contemptuous remarks about Buckbeak. Quickly angered, Buckbeak slashes Draco‚Äôs arm with his claws. Pretending to be injured much more severely than he truly is, Draco persuades his father, Lucius Malfoy, to use his political power to sentence Buckbeak to death. Hagrid‚Äôs numerous appeals fail, and members of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures come to Hogwarts to execute Buckbeak. With the use of a Time-Turner, Hermione and Harry free Buckbeak (they believed him earlier to have been executed, but it was revealed the executioner only swung his axe into the fence in anger; in the film he does this to a pumpkin) and rescue Sirius from the tower in which he is being held before being handed over to the Dementors. Sirius escapes with Buckbeak and flies to safety. During most of Harry‚Äôs fourth year, Sirius and Buckbeak hide in a cave in the mountains above Hogsmeade. After this, they move to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, whereupon Buckbeak stays in Sirius' mother‚Äôs former room. When Kreacher wants to lure Sirius away briefly, he wounds Buckbeak. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry inherits Buckbeak, and allows Hagrid to look after him again. To avoid suspicion from the Ministry of Magic, he is given the alias \\"Witherwings\\". A fiercely loyal creature, Buckbeak chases Severus Snape away from Harry by slashing his claws at the end of the book. Buckbeak also features in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of the Deathly Hallows leading the Hogwarts Thestrals against Voldemort‚Äôs giants. Fang Fang is a large boarhound (portrayed in the films by a Neapolitan Mastiff) that, aside from his enormous size, appears to be an entirely ordinary dog. While Fang's appearance is intimidating, he is, in Hagrid's words, \\"a bloody coward.\\" Boisterous and loving with people he knows, he seems to enjoy licking Harry, Ron, or Hermione around the face or ears. In the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone he accompanies Harry, Hagrid, Draco, and Hermione into the Forbidden Forest to look for an injured unicorn. In the following book, the Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron take Fang into the forest where he is scared stiff of both the gigantic acromantula and Mr Weasley‚Äôs flying car. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, an escaping Death Eater sets fire to Hagrid‚Äôs hut while Fang is inside; Hagrid enters the flaming hut, slings Fang over his shoulder, and carries him to safety. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Fang and Hagrid participate in the Battle of Hogwarts; though Fang's exact involvement is not clear. He is last seen running away after a shattered vase frightens him. It's implied that Fang survives, as Hagrid is not seen mourning him at any time. It's unknown if Fang is still alive when Harry's children come to Hogwarts. Fluffy thumb Fluffy is a giant three-headed dog provided by Hagrid to guard the trapdoor leading to the underground chamber where the Philosopher's Stone was hidden until the end of Philosopher's Stone. The only known way to get past Fluffy is to lull him to sleep by playing music. Fluffy is based on Cerberus, the three- headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld. As with Fluffy, Cerberus was lulled to sleep with music by Orpheus. In Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville accidentally run into Fluffy whilst hiding from Peeves, who was attempting to give them away to caretaker Argus Filch, who was searching for them. On Halloween, Harry and Ron witness Snape entering the door to Fluffy‚Äôs chamber, and for the next few days having a pronounced limp. Harry also overhears him saying \\"How are you meant to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\\" to Filch. However, it is later revealed that he followed then Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Quirinus Quirrell into the chamber. While Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, Professor Quirrell penetrates Fluffy‚Äôs defences by playing a harp, in order to access the trapdoor, while Harry uses a flute that Hagrid had given to him. J. K. Rowling later revealed that Dumbledore had repatriated Fluffy to Greece. Norbert thumb Norbert is a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon that Hagrid had acquired as an egg from a mysterious, hooded stranger in the Hog's Head, who turned out to be Professor Quirrell. Hagrid helps the dragon hatch from the egg. Norbert becomes very dangerous and much bigger in the weeks following. Norbert bit Ron‚Äôs hand, causing him to require medical treatment due to the venom in her fangs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally persuade Hagrid to send the dragon to Ron‚Äôs older brother Charlie, who is studying dragons in Romania. In the Deathly Hallows, Charlie reveals to Hagrid that \\"Norbert\\" is actually female and had been renamed Norberta. Charlie adds that female Norwegian Ridgeback dragons \\"are more vicious...\\" which explained Norbert's biting and dangerous behaviour as a baby. Reception IGN listed Hagrid as their thirteenth top Harry Potter character, saying that Hagrid had become a surrogate for the audience and that the short scene in the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire film where he recollects memorable moments with Harry, Hermione and Ron gave them a \\"cherished memory\\". IGN‚Äôs Joe Utichi also listed Hagrid as his 7th favourite Harry Potter character. In popular culture Hagrid has appeared in various animated and non-animated parodies of Harry Potter. He was featured in US skit comedy Saturday Night Live, portrayed by Horatio Sanz, in the same episode in which Lindsay Lohan played Hermione; Bobby Moynihan later portrayed Hagrid in 2012, when Daniel Radcliffe hosted the show. In Alistair McGowan's Big Impression show, Hagrid appeared in a sketch called \\"Louis Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Scone\\", in which he was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane himself. Hagrid is also parodied in Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, a story released by Comic Relief in 2003, and he was played by Ronnie Corbett. In the Potter Puppet Pals parodies by Neil Cicierega, Hagrid appeared in the episode \\"Ron's Disease\\", and later in the episode \\"Neville's Birthday\\". Hagrid also appears in the parody stage production Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice, interacting with Draco Malfoy and a dementor. In one episode of the second series of Tracey Ullman's State of the Union, Tracey Ullman parodies Rowling as bossy and very keen on keeping her creations copyrighted, believing a hobo is impersonating Hagrid. Hagrid makes an appearance in the theme park attraction Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, Japan and Hollywood. A new rollercoaster, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, will open at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure theme park on 13 June 2019, replacing the Dragon Challenge dual roller coasters. It will be themed around Hagrid and his love for magical creatures.

Kenney took command) until 1876, when she was sold through foreclosure of a mortgage held by the firm of John Black, of Liverpool, England. The liquidation of the affairs of Thomas Coffin & Co., for whom he had sailed continuously for 20 years, brought his service with this widely respected firm to close. After the liquidation, Captain McGray made but a few ocean voyages, taking charge of the barque ‚ÄúAneroid,‚Äù owned by Dennis & Doane, of Yarmouth. He previously attained some financial success through eighth ownership in the barque, ‚ÄúVillage Queen.‚Äù During much of his service as Master, his family sailed with him.  Business and political life  When his father, Asa Turner McGray, died in 1877, Nehemiah came home, and, together with his older brother, Martin Doane McGray, bought out their father's business. For ten years they conducted a considerable general business under the firm name of McGray Brothers. With others, they built fishing vessels to provide employment for young men. Every civic interest was energetically promoted, and the neighborhood prospered greatly. Captain McGray was elected to represent Barrington Township in the Provincial Parliament from 1878 to 1882. During this period he accorded financial assistance to the establishment of a steam ferry service between the Island and Barrington. He became interested in a large sheep farm undertaking on the Upper Clyde River. He helped finance Barrington Woolen Mill. He obtained a Federal grant for providing a telegraph cable from the Mainland, with a view to the establishment of a Maritime Signal Station at Cape Sable's light. He supported all Church efforts and was uncompromising in the war against the sale of intoxicating drinks.  Personal life  October 1887, Arthur Nehemiah McGray (1862-1949), was called home due to the illness of his father. Within days of his arrival, Nehemiah and Arthur's uncle, Martin Doane McGray (the father's brother and business partner) passed away. Nehemiah succumbed on 14 October 1887 to a severe stomach ailment when he was 49 years of age. With his passing much of the prosperity of the section of the Island on which he was born and died was blotted out for many years to come. On behalf of the executors of both estates, Arthur disposed of their considerable stock and closed up the business. His father's firm had operated as managing owners of four vessels in the bank fishing and coastwise trades. Upon his passing his co-owners appointed Arthur N. McGray as manager of their little fleet.

The seat fell vacant when the previous MP, John MacDougall (Labour), died of pleural mesothelioma on 13 August 2008, aged 60. Pleural Mesothelioma is a rare form of lung cancer caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. The by-election was won by Lindsay Roy of the Labour Party. Result Background Fife is traditionally a stronghold for the Labour Party. MacDougall had held Glenrothes and its forerunner, Central Fife, since 2001, when he succeeded Henry McLeish. Willie Hamilton had previously represented the area, which has elected Labour MPs since Hamilton won West Fife from the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1950. The poll followed a run of poor by-election results for the Labour Party, which included a loss to the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Glasgow East, formerly the party's twenty-fifth safest seat in Britain. Glenrothes has a considerably smaller Labour majority than Glasgow East had.Gerri Peev, \\"New Scots vote gives Brown three months to save political skin\\", The Scotsman, 14 August 2008 According to the Financial Times, Labour privately admitted that they expected to lose Glenrothes to the SNP.George Parker and Jim Pickard, \\"Brown faces new by-election battle\\", Financial Times, 13 August 2008 The Guardian described the constituency's main town, Glenrothes, as a \\"core area\\" for the SNP.Severin Carrell, \\"From working class loyalty to new town aspiration\\", The Guardian, 14 August 2008 The SNP were in second place in the seat in the 2005 general electionNigel Morris, \\"Brown loses a friend ‚Äì and faces another daunting Scottish by-election\\", The Independent, 14 August 2008 and won the nearest equivalent seat in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. The SNP also ran Fife Council, which covers the constituency, in coalition with the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The Scottish Liberal Democrats won the last by-election to be held in Fife from Labour on a swing of 16%. Polling date By tradition, the polling date was decided by Labour, as MacDougall's party, and set for Thursday, 6 November 2008. Had the writ been moved immediately the by-election could have been held as early as mid-September, although this coincided with the Trades Union Congress annual conference and the following weeks were filled with various party conferences. A Labour loss during this period could have provided a particular boost for their opponents, or for dissident elements within the party.Iain Watson, \\"Don't expect an early by-election\\", BBC News, 13 August 2008 The SNP may have favoured a quick by- election, noting that Labour called the Glasgow East by-election rapidly, when commentators believed it was to Labour's advantage.

The UKIP candidate was Dr. Kris Seunarine a specialist in the science of biophotonics at Dundee university, and chairman of the Fife branch of UKIP. Two of the minor party candidates had disabilities: Balfour was a wheelchair user and McLeary was visually impaired. 2005 Election Result Marked register Some months after the election, the marked register (on which the electors who had cast their vote were marked) was discovered to be missing. In law the register ought to have been preserved for a year and a day; the Returning Officer from Fife Council had transmitted the marked register to the Sheriff Court as required by law and obtained a receipt. The SNP Constituency Organiser, Cllr John Beare, had asked for a copy of the marked register on 19 November 2008; after ten weeks, the Scottish Court Service admitted the marked register was lost. An inquiry by the Scottish Court Service identified significant failings in its handling of election documents, which had been placed in a room at the court office in Kirkcaldy to which outside contractors had access. In October 2009, the Scotland Office agreed a protocol to create a substitute marked register for the election.Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons, 19 October 2009.

In some societies, partial nudity is defined as not covering other parts of the body that are deemed to be sexual. Nakedness, or the loss of body fur, was one of the physical characteristics that marked the evolution of modern humans from their hominini ancestors. For many thousands of years, humans wore no clothing. Worldwide, current social norms vary from banning nudity except in complete privacy to the acceptance of public nudity as a natural human state. It is generally accepted that the widespread adoption of clothing occurred as people migrated to other climates which required protection from the elements. In addition, as societies developed from being hunter-gatherers to being agrarian, clothing became part of cultural evolution as individuals and groups became differentiated by status and class. In early civilizations such as Egypt; slaves, children, and others with lower status often continued to be naked. Through much of history until the modern era, people were nude by necessity or convenience when exercising for work or sport; or when bathing or swimming; often but not always in groups separated by gender. The modern understanding of nudity is culturally complex due to different meanings given various states of undress in differing social situations. In any particular society, nudity is defined in relation to being properly dressed, not in relation to the specific body parts being exposed. For humans, nakedness and clothing are connected to many cultural categories such as identity, privacy, social status and moral behavior. Synonyms and euphemisms for nudity abound, including \\"birthday suit\\", \\"in the altogether\\" and \\"in the buff\\". \\"In a state of nature\\" is also used by philosophers to refer to the state of humans before the existence of organized societies. In Western societies, there are two cultural traditions relating to nudity in various contexts. The first tradition comes from the ancient Greeks, who saw the naked body as the natural state and as essentially positive. The second is based upon the Abrahamic religions‚ÄîJudaism, Christianity, and Islam‚Äîwhich have viewed being naked as shameful and essentially negative. The interaction between these traditions has resulted in Western ambivalence toward nudity. While public nudity remains limited in most situations, in America nudity is more likely to be seen sexually, while in much of Europe, there is more openness to non-sexual nudity in recreation and daily life. In Africa, there is a sharp contrast between the attitude toward nudity in Islamic countries and the attitude toward nudity in certain sub-Saharan countries that never abandoned, or are reasserting, precolonial norms. In Asia, the norms regarding public nudity are in keeping with the cultural values of social propriety and human dignity. Rather than being perceived as immoral or shameful, nakedness is perceived as a breach of etiquette. Societies use clothing (or the lack thereof) as a marker of social status. Generally, social norms regarding nudity are different for men than they are for women. It was not until the 17th century in Europe that the female breast became a part of the body that must be covered in public. It is only in the modern era that the nudity of children represented anything but innocence. Individuals may intentionally violate norms regarding nudity; those without power may use nudity as a form of protest, and those with power may impose nakedness on others as a form of punishment. History The history of nudity involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing is one of the changes that mark the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of civilization. Prehistory =Evolution of hairlessness= The dissipation of body heat remains the most widely accepted evolutionary explanation for the loss of body hair in early members of the genus homo, the surviving member of which is modern humans. Less hair, and an increase in sweat glands, made it easier for their bodies to cool when they moved from shady forest to open savanna. This change in environment also resulted in a change in diet, from largely vegetarian to hunting. Pursuing game on the savanna also increased the need for regulation of body heat. Anthropologist and palaeobiologist Nina Jablonski posits that the ability to dissipate excess body heat through eccrine sweating helped make possible the dramatic enlargement of the brain, the most temperature-sensitive human organ. Thus the loss of fur was also a factor in further adaptations, both physical and behavioral, that differentiated humans from other primates. Some of these changes are thought to be the result of sexual selection, which was first proposed by Darwin in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. By selecting more hairless mates, humans accelerated changes initiated by natural selection. Sexual selection may also account for the remaining human hair in the pubic area and armpits, which are sites for pheromones, while hair on the head continued to provide protection from the sun. A divergent explanation of humans' relative hairlessness holds that ecroparasites (such as ticks) residing in fur became problematic as humans became hunters living in larger groups with a \\"home base\\". Nakedness would also make the lack of parasites apparent to prospective mates. However, this theory is inconsistent with the abundance of parasites that continue to exist in the remaining patches of human hair. The last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was only partially bipedal, often using their front legs for locomotion. Other primate mothers do not need to carry their young because there is fur for them to cling to, but the loss of fur encouraged full bipedalism, allowing the mothers to carry their babies with one or both hands.The combination of hairlessness and upright posture may also explain the enlargement of the female breasts as a sexual signal. Another theory is that the loss of fur also promoted mother-child attachment based upon the pleasure of skin-to-skin contact. This may explain the more extensive hairlessness of female humans compared to males. Nakedness also effects sexual relationships as well, the duration of human intercourse being many times the duration of any other primates. With the loss of fur, darker, high-melanin skin evolved as a protection from ultraviolet radiation damage. As humans migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB- induced synthesis of previtamin D3. The Venus of Willendorf (Austria) made between 24,000 and 22,000 BCE. An 11,000 year old sculpture believed to depict a couple having sex, from Ain Sakhri, Judea =Origin of clothing= The wearing of clothing is most likely a behavioral adaptation arising from the need for protection from the elements, including the sun (for depigmented human populations) and cold temperatures as humans migrated to colder regions. According to a 2010 study published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, estimates of the origins of clothing are based upon a genetic analysis indicating that clothing lice diverged from head louse ancestors at some point in time between 83,000 years ago and 170,000 years ago. This information suggests that the use of clothing likely originated with anatomically modern humans in Africa prior to their migration to colder climates. A 2017 study published in Science estimated that anatomically modern humans evolved 260,000 to 350,000 years ago. The complex garments needed for survival in extreme cold would have required invention of the tools for turning animal skins into clothes: scrapers for cleaning and smoothing, fine stone knives for cutting and bone needles for stitching. What is now called clothing may have originated along with other types of adornment, including jewelry, body paint, tattoos, and other body modifications, \\"dressing\\" the naked body without concealing it. According to Leary and Buttermore, body adornment is one of the changes that occurred in the late Paleolithic (40,000 to 60,000 years ago) in which humans became not only anatomically modern, but also culturally and psychologically modern and capable of self-reflection and symbolic interaction. Ancient history Fifth Dynasty (approx. 2500‚Äì2300 BCE), Abusir necropolis, Egypt In ancient Mesopotamia, most people owned a single item of clothing, and being naked meant being at the bottom of the social scale, lacking in dignity and status. For the average person, clothing changed little in ancient Egypt from the Early Dynastic Period, (3150‚Äì2686 BCE) until the Middle Kingdom (2055‚Äì1650 BCE). Although the genitals of adults were generally covered, nakedness in ancient Egypt was not a violation of any social norm, but more often a convention indicating lack of wealth; those that could afford to do so covered more. Both men and women wore skirts called schenti‚Äîwhich evolved from loincloths and resembled modern kilts. Slaves and laborers were nude or wore loincloths. Only women of the upper classes wore kalasiris, a dress of loose draped or translucent linen which came from just above or below the breasts to the ankles. Women entertainers performed naked. Children went without clothing until puberty, at about age 12. It was not until the later periods, in particular the New Kingdom (1550‚Äì1069 BCE), that functionaries in the households of the wealthy also began wearing more refined dress, and upper class women wore elaborate dresses and ornamentation which covered their breasts. These later styles are often shown in film and TV as representing ancient Egypt in all periods. Male nudity was celebrated in ancient Greece to a greater degree than any culture before or since. They considered embarrassment at having to disrobe for sports a sign of barbarism. The status of freedom, maleness, privilege, and physical virtues were asserted by discarding everyday costumes for athletic nudity. The female nude emerged as a subject for art in the 5th century BCE, illustrating stories of women bathing both indoors and outdoors. While depictions of nude women were erotic in nature, there was no attribution of impropriety as would be the case for such images in later Western culture. However, the passive images reflected the unequal status of women in society compared to the athletic and heroic images of naked men. The toga was essential to announce the status and rank of male citizens of the Roman Republic. The poet Ennius (c. 239‚Äì169 BCE) declared, \\"exposing naked bodies among citizens is the beginning of public disgrace\\". Cicero endorsed Ennius' words. An exception was the Roman baths (thermae), which had many social functions. In the Roman Empire, the status of the upper classes was such that public nudity was of no concern for men, and also for women if only seen by their social inferiors. Attic red-figure stamnos, 440‚Äì430 BCE. Clothing used in the Middle East, which loosely envelopes the entire body, changed little for centuries. In part, this consistency arises from the fact that such clothing is well-suited for the climate (protecting the body from dust storms while also allowing cooling by evaporation). The meaning of the naked body in the societies based upon the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) was defined by a creation narrative in which Adam and Eve, the first man and woman, were naked and unashamed until they ate the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The philosophical meaning of this myth in terms of stating the source of shame is unclear. The \\"original sin\\" did not involve nakedness, but disobedience, yet the first response was to cover their bodies with fig leaves. In all three religions, modesty generally prevails in public, with clothing covering all parts of the body of a sexual nature. The Torah set forth laws regarding clothing and modesty (tzniut) which also separated Jews from other people in the societies they lived within. Early Christians generally inherited the norms of dress from Jewish traditions. However, the Adamites were an obscure Christian sect in North Africa originating in the second century who worshiped in the nude, professing to have regained the innocence of Adam. Islamic clothing for both men and women is in accordance with the rules of hajib. For men, clothing covers the area from the waist to the knees. For women, clothing covers the area from the neck to the ankles and also covers the hair. The practice known as veiling of women in public predates Islam in Persia, Syria, and Anatolia. The Qur æƒÅn provides guidance on the dress of women, but not strict rulings; such rulings may be found in the Hadith. Originally, veiling applied only to the wives of Muhammad; however, veiling was adopted by all upper-class women after his death and became a symbol of Muslim identity. In stories written in China as early as the fourth century BCE, nudity is presented as an affront to human dignity, reflecting the belief that \\"humanness\\" in Chinese society is not innate, but is earned by correct behavior. However, nakedness could also be used by an individual to express contempt for others in their presence. In other stories, the nudity of women, emanating the power of yin, could nullify the yang of aggressive forces. Nudity in mixed-gender public baths was common in Japan before the effects of Western influence, which began in the 19th century and became extensive during the American occupation after World War II. The practice continues at a dwindling number of hot springs (konyoku) outside of urban areas. Another Japanese tradition was the women free-divers (ama) who for 2,000 years until the 1960s collected seaweed and shellfish wearing only loincloths. Their nakedness was not shocking, since women farmers often worked bare-breasted during the summer. The late fourth century CE was a period of both of Christian conversion and standardization of church teachings, in particular on matters of sex. A man having sex outside marriage with a respectable woman injured third parties; her husband, father, and male relatives. His fornication with an unattached woman, likely a prostitute, courtesan or slave, was a lesser sin since it had no male victims, which in a patriarchal society might mean no victim at all. The dress or nakedness of women that were not deemed respectable was also of lesser importance. Post- classical history The period between the ancient and modern world‚Äîapproximately 500 to 1450 CE‚Äîsaw an increasingly stratified society in Europe. At the beginning of the period, everyone other that the upper classes lived in close quarters and did not have the modern sensitivity to private nudity, but slept and bathed together naked with innocence rather than shame. The Roman baths in Bath, Somerset, were rebuilt, and used by both sexes without garments until the 15th century. Sects with beliefs similar to the Adamites, who worshiped naked, reemerged in the early 15th century. Later in the period, with the emergence of a middle class, clothing in the form of fashion was a significant indicator of class, and thus its lack became a greater source of embarrassment. Virgin and Child (c. 1530) by Jan Gossaert Until the beginning of the eighth century, Christians were baptized naked to represent that they emerged from baptism without sin. The disappearance of nude baptism in the Carolingian era marked the beginning of the sexualization of the body by Christians that had previously been associated with paganism. Although there is a common misconception that Europeans did not bathe in the Middle Ages, public bath houses‚Äîusually segregated by sex‚Äîwere popular until the 16th century, when concern for the spread of disease closed many of them. In Christian Europe, the parts of the body that were required to be covered in public did not always include the female breasts. In 1350, breasts were associated with nourishment and loving care, but by 1750, artistic representations of the breast were either erotic or medical. This eroticization of the breast coincided with the persecution of women as witches. In the medieval period, Islamic norms became more patriarchal, and very concerned with the chastity of women before marriage and fidelity afterward. Women were not only veiled, but segregated from society, with no contact with men not of close kinship, the presence of whom defined the difference between public and private spaces. Of particular concern for both Islam and early Christians, as they extended their control over countries that had previously been part of the Byzantine or Roman empires, was the local custom of public bathing. While Christians were mainly concerned about mixed- gender bathing, which was not uncommon, Islam prohibited nudity for women in the company of non-Muslim women. In general, the Roman bathing facilities were adapted for separation of the genders, with the bathers retaining a loin-cloth rather than being nude; as in the Turkish bath of today. Modern history =Early modern= The association of nakedness with shame and anxiety became ambivalent during the Renaissance. The rediscovered art and writings of ancient Greece offered an alternative tradition of nudity as symbolic of innocence and purity which could be understood in terms of the state of man \\"before the fall\\". Subsequently, norms and behaviors surrounding nudity in life and in works of art diverged during the modern history of individual societies. Due to concerns about the spread of disease, many European public bath houses closed in the 16th century. Opinions regarding the health benefits of bathing varied in the following centuries, but was generally favorable by the 19th century. This lead to the establishment of public bath houses for those who had no bathing facilities in their homes. In a number of European cites where this included the middle class, some bath houses became social establishments. With the adoption of showers rather than tubs, bathing facilities were added to schools and factories. In the United States, where the middle class more often had private baths in their homes, public bath houses were built for the poor, in particular for urban immigrant populations. Portrait of Poedooa, daughter of Orea, King of Ulaitea, Society Islands (c1782-85) by John Webber By 1750, European artistic representations of the female breast were either erotic or medical. In his diaries, Columbus writes that the natives were entirely naked, both men and women; and gentle. This also meant that they were less than fully human, and exploitable. The age of colonialism was marked by frequent encounters between Christian and Muslim cultures and indigenous peoples of the tropics (see below), leading to the stereotypes of the \\"naked savage\\" and the \\"Noble savage\\". Islam exerted little influence beyond large towns, outside of which paganism continued. In travels in Mali in the 1350s, Muslim scholar Ibn Battuta was shocked by the casual relationships between men and women even at the court of Sultans, and the public nudity of female slaves and servants. In England during the 17th to 19th centuries, the clothing of the poor by Christian charity did not extend to those confined to \\"madhouses\\" such as Bethlem Royal Hospital, where the inmates were often kept naked and treated harshly. The Victorian Era is often considered to be entirely restrictive of nudity. However, throughout the United Kingdom in the 19th century, workers in coal mines were naked due to the heat and the narrow tunnels that would catch on clothing. Men and boys worked fully naked, while women and girls (usually employed as \\"hurriers\\") would generally only strip to the waist (in some locations, they were fully naked as well). Testimony before a Parliamentary labour commission revealed that working naked in confined spaces made \\"sexual vices\\" a \\"common occurrence\\". =Late modern= In tropical regions worldwide complete or near nudity was common for both men and women before contact with Western cultures or Islam. Medal for 1920 Olympic Games references the nudity of athletes in the first Olympics Nudism originated in opposition to the industrialization of Europe in the late 19th century. Nudism spawned a proselytizing literature in the 1920s and 1930s. Nudism's other common name, naturism, signals its core contention that the naked body is natural and that modesty and shame are cultural impositions with deleterious effects on psychological, sexual, and social well-being. Early nudism was in dialogue with sexology and feminism in a critique of society and its future. While Christian moralists tended to condemn nudism, other Christians argued for the purity of the nude body compared to the corruption of the scanty clothing of the era. Its proponents believed that nudism could combat social inequality, including sexual inequality. As a socially marginal practice based on the naturalness of nakedness, nudism has had a complicated relationship with sexuality and pro‚Äêsex discourses. Nudist colony near Berlin, 1930s In the early 20th century, the attitudes of the general public toward the human body reflect rising consumerism, concerns regarding health and fitness, and changes in clothing fashions that sexualized the body. However members of English families report that in the 1920s to 1940s, they never saw other family members undressed, including those of the same gender. Modesty continued to prevail between married couples, even during sex. Bodily modesty is not part of the Finnish identity due to the universal use of the sauna, a historical tradition that has been maintained, which teaches from an early age that nakedness need not have anything to do with sex. In Germany between 1910 and 1935 nudist attitudes toward the body were expressed in sports and in the arts. In the 1910s a number of solo female dancers performed in the nude. Ador√©e Villany performed the Dance of the Seven Veils, and other stories based upon middle eastern themes, for appreciative upper class audiences. However, after a 1911 performance in Munich, Villany was arrested along with the theater manager for indecency. Eventually acquitted, she was forced to leave Bavaria. Olga Desmond's performances combined dance and \\"tableau\\" posing nude in imitation of classical statues. There were advocates of the health benefits of sun and fresh air that instituted programs of exercise in the nude for children of both sexes; Adolf Koch founding thirteen Freik√∂rperkultur (FKK) schools. With the rise of Nazism in the 1930s, the nudism movement split ideologically between three groups, the bourgeoisie, the socialists, and the fascists. The bourgeoisie were not ideological, while the socialists adopted the views of Adolf Koch, seeing education and health programs including nudity as part of improving the lives of the working class. While not unanimous in their support, some Nazis used nudity to extol the Aryan race as the standard of beauty, as reflected in the Nazi propaganda film Olympia directed by Leni Riefenstahl. Public swimming pools in the U.S. were the product of municipal reform movements beginning in the mid-19th century. Civic leaders had not intended pools to be used for recreation, but for health and sporting activities, which were male only. Initially, working class men and boys swam in the nude, as had previously been customary in lakes and rivers. Communal male nudity in the United States and other Western countries was not a taboo for much of the 20th century. Males have been more likely than females to be expected to swim nude in swimming pools or to share communal showers in school locker rooms with other members of the same sex. These expectations were based on cultural beliefs that females need more privacy than males do. In 1909 the New York Times reported that at the elementary school swim competition the 80 lb. division, finding that their suits slowed them down, competed in the nude. In the 1926 edition of the guidelines on swimming pools by the American Public Health Association, which cited the problem of properly cleaning suits, it was recommended that for pools used only by men that they swim in the nude. =Early contemporary= A 1963 article on a swim program in Troy, New York stated that boys swam nude, but that girls were expected to wear bathing suits; the writer of the article found nothing remarkable about these requirements. The era of nude swimming by boys in indoor pools declined as mixed-gender bathing was allowed, and ended when gender equality in facilities was mandated by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. In 1974, an article in The New York Times noted an increase in American tolerance for nudity, both at home and in public, approaching that of Europe. However, some traditional nudists at the time decried the trend as encouraging sexual exhibitionism and voyeurism and threatening the viability of private nudist clubs. In 1998, attitudes toward sexuality had continued to become more liberal than in prior decades, but the reaction to total nudity in public was generally negative. General issues Child development The National Child Traumatic Stress Network issued a report in 2009 on child sexual development in the United States. The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report: *Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked; *Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \\"play doctor\\"; *Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers. The report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development). The general advice for caregivers is to find ways of setting boundaries without giving the child a sense of shame. In childcare settings outside the home there is difficulty in determining what behavior is normal and what may be indicative of child sexual abuse (CSA). In an extensive study of Danish childcare institutions, which had in the prior century been tolerant of child nudity and playing doctor, contemporary policy had become restrictive as the result of childcare workers being charged with CSA. However, while CSA does occur, the response may be due to \\"moral panic\\" that is out of proportion and have unintended consequences. Strict policies are being implemented not to protect children from a rare threat, but to protect workers from the accusation of CSA. The policies have created a split between childcare workers who continue to believe that behaviors involving nudity are a normal part of child development and those that advocate that children be closely supervised to prohibit such behavior. The naturist/nudist point of view is that children are \\"nudists at heart\\" and that naturism provides the ideal environment for healthy development. It is noted that modern psychology generally agrees that children can benefit from an open environment where the bodies of others their own age of both sexes are not a mystery. However, there is less agreement regarding children and adults being nude. While some doctors have taken the view that some exposure of children to adult nudity (particularly parental nudity) may be healthy, others‚Äînotably Benjamin Spock‚Äîdisagreed. Spock's view was later attributed to the lingering effect of Freudianism on the medical profession. In their 1986 study on the effects of social nudity on children, Smith and Sparks concluded that \\"the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved. As recently as 1996 the YMCA maintained a policy of allowing young children to accompany their parents into the locker room of the opposite gender, which some health care professionals questioned. A contemporary solution has been to provide separate family changing rooms. =Nudity in the home= In 1995, Gordon and Schroeder contended that \\"there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them\\", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They noted that by ages five to six, children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommended to parents who desire to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they respect a child's modesty from that age onwards. In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect. Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys. In 1999, psychologist Barbara Bonner recommended against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic. In 2019, psychiatrist Lea Lis recommended that parents allow nudity as a natural part of family life when children are very young, but to respect the modesty that is likely to emerge with puberty. Cultural differences Historically in Western societies, there are two cultural traditions relating to nudity in various contexts. The first tradition comes from the ancient Greeks, who saw the naked body as the natural state and as essentially positive. The second is based upon the Abrahamic religions‚ÄîJudaism, Christianity, and Islam‚Äîwhich have viewed being naked as shameful and essentially negative. The fundamental teachings of these religions prohibit public and sometimes also private nudity. The interaction between the Greek classical and later Abrahamic traditions has resulted in Western ambivalence, with nudity acquiring both positive and negative meanings in individual psychology, in social life, and in depictions such as art. While public modesty prevails in more recent times, organized groups of nudists or naturists emerged with the stated purpose of regaining a natural connection to the human body and nature, sometimes in private spaces but also in public. Naturism in the United States, meanwhile, remains largely confined to private facilities, with few \\"clothing optional\\" public spaces compared to Europe. In spite of the liberalization of attitudes toward sex, Americans remain uncomfortable with complete nudity. In Africa, there is a sharp contrast between the attitude toward nudity in Islamic countries and the attitude toward nudity in certain sub-Saharan countries that never abandoned, or are reasserting, precolonial norms. In Asia, the norms regarding public nudity are in keeping with the cultural values of social propriety and human dignity. Rather than being perceived as immoral or shameful, nakedness is perceived as a breach of etiquette and perhaps as an embarrassment. In China, saving face is a powerful social force. In Japan, proper behavior included a tradition of mixed gender public baths before Western contact began in the 19th century, and proper attire for farmers and other workers might be a loincloth for both men and women. In India, the conventions regarding proper dress do not apply to monks in some Hindu and Jain sects who reject clothing as worldly. The encounter between the indigenous cultures of Africa and the Americas with Europeans had a significant effect on both cultures. Western ambivalence could be expressed by responding to the nakedness of natives as either a sign of rampant sexuality or of the innocence that preceded the Fall. =Openness to nudity and sexuality= In a 2001 survey of attitudes toward sex education in Greece, those asked what effect seeing nudity in the home had on children, 32% said positive, 30% negative, 36% said no effect or don't know. However, there was a clear opinion (86%) that seeing sexual display outside the home had a negative effect. France, Norway, the Netherlands and the United States show a broad range of openness toward nudity and sexuality as indicated by childhood experiences and sex education practices. Tous √† Poil! (Everybody Gets Naked!), a French picture book for children was first published in 2011 with the stated purpose of presenting a view of nudity in opposition to media images of the ideal body but instead depicting ordinary people swimming naked in the sea including a teacher and a policeman. In a 2014 cable news appearance Jean- Fran√ßois Cop√©, then leader of the political party Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) decried the book as undermining the dignity of persons in authority. Attempts by UMP to exclude the book from schools prompted French booksellers and librarians to hold a nude protest in support of the book's viewpoint. As part of a science program on Norwegian public television (NRK), a series on puberty intended for 8‚Äì12-year-olds includes explicit information and images of reproduction, anatomy, and the changes that are normal with the approach of puberty. Rather than diagrams or photos, the videos are shot in a locker room with live nude people of all ages. The presenter, a physician, is relaxed about close examination and touching of relevant body parts, including genitals. While the videos note that the age of consent in Norway is 16, abstinence is not emphasized. In a subsequent series for teens and young adults, real people were recruited to have sex on TV as counterbalance to the unrealistic presentations in advertising and porn. A 2020 episode of a Danish TV show for children presented five nude adults to an audience of 11‚Äì13-year- olds with the lesson \\"normal bodies look like this\\" to counter social media images of perfect bodies. As of 2015, however, 37 U.S. states required that sex education curricula include lessons on abstinence and 25 required that a \\"just say no\\" approach be stressed. Studies show that early and complete sex education does not increase the likelihood of becoming sexually active, but leads to better health outcomes overall. The Netherlands also has open and comprehensive sex education beginning as early as age 4, which similar health outcomes, in addition to promoting social benefits such as gender equality. Young children often play outdoors or in public wading pools nude. In a 2018 survey of predominantly white middle-class college students in the United States, only 9.98% of women and 7.04% of men reported seeing real people (either adults or other children) as their first childhood experience of nudity. Many were accidental (walking in on someone) and were more likely to be remembered as negative by women. Only 4.72% of women and 2% of men reported seeing nude images as part of sex education. 83.59% of women and 89.45% of men reported that their first image of nudity was in film, video, or other mass media. A 2009 report issued by the CDC comparing the sexual health of teens in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States concluded that if the US implemented comprehensive sex education similar to that in the three European counties there would be as significantly reduction in teen pregnancies, abortions and the rates of sexually transmitted diseases, and save hundreds of millions of dollars. =High and low context cultures= High and low context cultures were defined by Edward T. Hall. The behaviors and norms of a high context culture depend upon shared implicit intuitions that operate within a social situation, while in a low context culture behavior is more dependent upon explicit communications. An example of this distinction was found in research on the behavior of French and German naturists on a nude beach. Germans are extremely low in cultural context. They are characterized by individualism, alienation, estrangement from other people, little body contact, low sensitivity to nonverbal cues, and segmentation of time and space. By contrast, the French, in their personal lives are relatively high context: they interact within closely knit groups, are sensitive to nonverbal cues, and engage in relatively high amounts of body contact. To maintain public propriety on a nude beach, German naturists avoided touching themselves and others and avoid any adornments or behaviors that would call attention to the body. French naturists, on the other hand, were more likely than Germans to wear make-up and jewelry and to touch others as they would while dressed. =Concepts of privacy= Societies in continental Europe conceive of privacy as protecting a right to respect and personal dignity. In America, the right to privacy is oriented toward values of liberty, especially in one's home. Europeans maintain their dignity, even naked where others may see them, while Americans see public nakedness as a surrender of \\"any reasonable expectation of privacy\\". Such cultural differences may make some laws and behaviors of other societies seem incomprehensible. =Gender differences= In Western cultures, shame can result from not living up to the ideals of society with regard to physical appearance. Historically, such shame has affected women more than men. With regard to their naked bodies, the result is a tendency towards self-criticism by women, while men are less concerned by the evaluation of others. In many European countries women may sunbathe without covering their breasts. In much of the world, the modesty of women is a matter not only of social custom but of the legal definition of indecent exposure. In the United States, the exposure of female nipples is a criminal offense in many states and is not usually allowed in public. The illegality of exposing female breasts in situations where men are allowed to go shirtless is viewed as institutionalization of negative cultural values that affect women's body image. The \\"topfreedom\\" movement promotes equal rights for women to be naked above the waist in public on the same basis that would apply to men in the same circumstances. Breastfeeding in public is forbidden in some jurisdictions, not regulated in others, and protected as a legal right in public and the workplace in still others. Where public breastfeeding is a legal right, some mothers may be reluctant to breastfeed, and some people may object to the practice. Imposed nudity One of the iconic photographs of the Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal: a naked prisoner being forced to crawl and bark like a dog on a leash. =Punishment= In some situations, nudity is forced on a person. For example, imposed nudity (full or partial) can be part of a corporal punishment or as humiliation, especially when administered in public. For example, in 2017, students at a girls' school in the north-east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh were forced to undress as a form of punishment, police say. Although not as common as corporal punishment, it is not unusual for stripping to be used as a form of punishment in Indian schools. =Torture= Nazis used forced nudity to attempt to humiliate inmates in concentration camps. This practice was depicted in the film Schindler's List (1994). In 2003, Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad (Iraq) gained international notoriety for accounts of torture and abuses by members of the United States Army Reserve during the post-invasion period. Photographic images were circulated that showed the posing of prisoners naked, sometimes bound, and being intimidated and otherwise humiliated, resulting in widespread condemnation of the abuse. =Strip search= A strip search is the removal of some or all of a person's clothing to ensure that they do not have weapons or contraband. Such searches are generally done when an individual is imprisoned after an arrest, and is justified by the need to maintain order in the facility, not as punishment for a crime. Laws regarding public nudity Worldwide, laws regarding clothing specify what parts of the body must be covered, prohibiting complete nudity in public except for those jurisdictions that allow nude recreation. Specific laws may either require or prohibit religious attire (veiling) for women. In a survey using data from 2012-2013, there were 11 majority Muslim countries where women must cover their entire bodies in public, which may include the face. There were 39 countries, mostly in Europe, that had some prohibition of religious attire, in particular face coverings in certain situations, such as government buildings. Within Russia, laws may either require or prohibit veiling depending upon location. The brief, sudden exposure of parts of the body normally hidden from public view has a long tradition, taking several forms. *Flashing refers to the brief public exposure of the genitals or female breasts. At Mardi Gras in New Orleans flashing‚Äîan activity that would be prohibited at any other time and place‚Äîhas become a ritual of long standing in celebration of carnival. While many celebrations of carnival worldwide include minimal costumes, the extent of nudity in the French Quarter is due to its long history as a \\"red light district\\". The ritual \\"disrobing\\" is done in the context of a performance which earns a payment, even though it is only symbolic (glass beads). Although the majority of those performing continue to be women, men (both homosexual and heterosexual) now also participate. *Mooning refers to exposure of the buttocks. Mooning opponents in sports or in battle as an insult may have a history going back to ancient Rome. *Streaking refers to running nude through a public area. While the activity may have a long history, the term originated in the 1970s for a fad on college campuses, which was initially widespread but short-lived. Later, a tradition of \\"nude runs\\" became institutionalized on certain campuses, such as the Primal Scream at Harvard. In the United Kingdom, nudity may not be used to \\"harass, alarm or distress\\" according to the Public Order Act of 1986. According to a police spokesperson in 2013, nudity per se is not unlawful in the United Kingdom; however, the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offenses. Most naturists comply with the law by being nude only where others cannot see them. After repeated arrests, prosecutions, and convictions in Great Britain, the activist Stephen Gough sued at the European Court of Human Rights for the right to be nude in public outside of designated areas. His claim was ultimately rejected. In the United States, public nudity is a matter of local laws with the exception of First Amendment protection of free expression, which is generally recognized with regard to performances in an artistic context. However in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. the owner of a bar and an adult bookstore in South Bend, Indiana sought to overturn the state law prohibiting \\"indecent behavior\\". The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Indiana law, but with difference in opinion between justices. Since regulation of everyday public behavior is more often a matter of social convention than written law, some jurisdictions may have no specific law against nudity in public. This was the case in 2006, when three young men who had been skinny- dipping outside Brattleboro, Vermont decided to go into town to see what would happen if they disrobed there. They were not arrested, and the following two summers saw a number of incidents of public nakedness until an ordinance banning nudity was passed. In the 21st century United States, the legal definition of \\"full nudity\\" is exposure of the genitals. \\"Partial nudity\\" includes exposure of the buttocks by either sex or exposure of the female breasts. Legal definitions are further complicated by laws regarding indecent exposure; this term generally refers to engaging in public nudity with an intent to offend common decency. Lewd and indecent behavior is usually defined as causing alarm, discomfort, or annoyance for the average person. Where the law has been challenged by asserting that nudity by itself in not lewd or disorderly, laws have been amended to specify indecent exposure, usually of the genitals but not always of the breast. Public indecency in generally a misdemeanor, but may become a felony upon repeated offense or always if done in the presence of a minor. The law differs between different states. In the State of Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech as long as there is not an \\"intent to arouse\\". The State of Arkansas not only outlaws private nudism, but bans anyone from advocating the practice. After incidents in July 2020 of ticketing women for sunbathing topless, the Minneapolis Parks board moved to change the regulation that prohibits the exposure of female breasts on park property, which is legal elsewhere in the city and the state of Minnesota. Some tickets were issued when sunbathers were spotted in isolated areas by drones with cameras. The police defended the use of drones as being in response to citizen complaints regarding illegal alcohol and drug use in addition to nudity. Morality The moral ambiguity of nudity is reflected in its many meanings, often expressed in the metaphors used to describe cultural values, both positive and negative. One of the first‚Äîbut now obsolete‚Äîmeanings of nude in the 16th century was \\"mere, plain, open, explicit\\" reflected in the modern metaphors \\"the naked truth\\", \\"the bare facts\\". Naturists often speak of their nakedness in terms of a return to the innocence and simplicity of childhood. The term naturism is based upon nakedness as being connected to nature in a positive way; which includes egalitarianism, that all humans are alike in their nakedness. Nudity also represents freedom; the liberation of the body is associated with sexual liberation, although many naturists tend to downplay this connection. In some forms of group psychotherapy, nudity has been used to promote open interaction and communication. Religious persons who reject the world as it is including all possessions may practice nudism, or use nakedness as a protest against an unjust world. Many of the negative associations are the inverse of positive ones. If nudity is truth, nakedness may be an invasion of privacy or the exposure of uncomfortable truths, a source of anxiety. The strong connection of nudity to sex produces shame when naked in contexts where sexuality is deemed inappropriate. Rather than being natural, nakedness is associated with savagery, poverty, criminality, and death. To be deprived of clothes is punishment; humiliating and degrading. Confronted with this ambiguity, some individuals seek to resolve it by working toward greater acceptance of nudity for themselves and others. The majority of naturists go through stages during which they gradually learn a new set of values regarding the human body. However, Krista Thomason notes that negative emotions including shame exist because they are functional, and that human beings are not perfect. =Moral emotions= Shame is one of the moral emotions often associated with nudity. While guilt is the emotion experienced in response to a particular wrong action, shame is a more general and long-lasting self-assessment. Shame is often thought of as positive in response to a failure to act in accordance with moral values, thus motivating an individual to do better in the future. However, shame is often negative as the response to perceived failures to live up to unrealistic expectations. The shame regarding nudity is one of the classic examples of the emotion, yet rather than being a positive motivator, it is considered unhealthy, standing in the way of developing a positive self- image. Others argue that the shame felt when naked in public is due to valuing modesty and privacy as socially positive. However, the response to such public exposure of normally private behavior is embarrassment (like guilt, also a short-term emotion), rather than shame. Protests People taking part in the World Naked Bike Ride in London Nudity is used to draw public and attention to a cause, sometimes including the promotion of public nudity itself. Particular issues represented include animal rights by the group PETA, environmental issues by the World Naked Bike Ride, women's rights by the organization FEMEN. Sexuality Persons who practice and advocate personal and social nudity distinguish between sexual and non-sexual nudity. Studies of naturism find that its practitioners adopt behaviors and norms that suppress the sexual responses while practicing social nudity. Such norms include refraining from staring, touching, or otherwise calling attention to the body while naked. However, some naturists do not maintain this non-sexual atmosphere, as when nudist resorts host sexually oriented events. Contemporary social practices Norms related to nudity are associated with norms regarding personal freedom, human sexuality, and gender roles, which vary widely among modern societies. Situations where public nudity is accepted vary. Some people practice nudism within the confines of \\"nudist camps\\" or clothing-optional resorts, while naturists seek more open acceptance of nudity in everyday life and in public spaces. Public baths and spas Bathing for cleanliness and recreation is a human universal, and the communal use of bathing facilities has been maintained in many cultures from varying traditional sources. When there is complete nudity, the facilities are often segregated by sex, but not always. The sauna is attended nude in its source country of Finland, where many families have one in their home. Saunas have been adopted worldwide, first in Scandinavian and German-speaking countries of Europe, with the trend in some of these being to allow both genders to bathe together nude. For example, the Friedrichsbad in Baden-Baden has designated times when mixed nude bathing is permitted. The German sauna culture also became popular in neighbouring countries such as Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. In contrast to Scandinavia, public sauna facilities in these countries‚Äîwhile nude‚Äîdo not usually segregate genders. The sauna came to the United States in the 19th century when Finns settled in western territories, building family saunas on their farms. When public saunas were built in the 20th century, they might include separate steam rooms for men and women. In Japan, public baths (Sent≈ç) were once common, but became less so with the addition of bathtubs in homes. Sent≈ç were mixed gender (konyoku) until the arrival of Western influences, but became segregated by gender in cities. Nudity is required at Japanese hot spring resorts (Onsen). Some such resorts continue to be mixed gender, but the number of such resorts is declining as they cease to be supported by local communities. In Korea, bathhouses are known as Jjimjilbang. Such facilities may include mixed-sex sauna areas where clothing is worn, but bathing areas are gender segregated; nudity is required in those areas. Korean spas have opened in the United States, also gender separated except the bathing areas. In addition to the health benefits, a woman wrote in Psychology Today suggesting the social benefits for women and girls having real life experience of seeing the variety of real female bodies‚Äîeven more naked than at a beach‚Äîas a counterbalance to the unrealistic nudity seen in popular media. In Russia, public banyas are clothing-optional and are usually gender-segregated. Indigenous traditions Mru women working in Bangladesh In India, priests of the Digambara (\\"skyclad\\") sect of Jainism and some Hindu Sadhus refrain from wearing clothing to symbolize their rejection of the material world. In Bangladesh, the Mru people have resisted centuries of Muslim and Christian pressure to cloth their nakedness as part of religious conversion. Most retain their own religion, which includes elements of Buddhism and Animism; as well as traditional clothing, a loincloth for men and a skirt for women. A woman at the Reed Dance ceremony In sub-Saharan Africa, full nudity or nudity below the waist is observed among some Burkinabese and Nilo-Saharan (e.g. Nuba and Surma people)‚Äîduring particular occasions. For example, stick-fighting tournaments in Ethiopia. The revival of post-colonial culture is asserted in the adoption of traditional dress‚Äîyoung women wearing only beaded skirts and jewelry‚Äîin the Umkhosi Womhlanga (Reed Dance) by the Zulu and Swazi. However, the authenticity and propriety of the paid performance of \\"bare chested\\" Zulu girls for international tourists is sometimes questioned. In Brazil, the Yawalapiti‚Äîan indigenous Xingu tribe in the Amazon Basin‚Äîpractice a funeral ritual known as Quarup to celebrate life, death and rebirth. The ritual involves the presentation of all young girls who have begun menstruating since the last Quarup and whose time has come to choose a partner. The Aw√° hunters, an indigenous people of Brazil living in the eastern Amazon rainforest, are completely naked apart from a piece of string decorated with bird feathers tied to the end of their penises. This minimalist dress code reflects the spirit of the hunt and being overdressed may be considered ridiculous or inappropriate. Kayapo women, Par√° State, Brazil Two women of the Zo'√© tribe of Par√° State, Brazil =Clothing-optional recreation= Western societies =Private nudity= According to a 2004 U.S. survey by ABC News, 31% of men and 14% of women report sleeping in the nude, In a 2018 U.S. survey by USA Today, 58% reported that they slept in the nude; by generation 65% of Millennials, but only 39% of Baby boomers. =Nudity in semi-public facilities= Historically, certain facilities associated with activities that require partial or complete nakedness, such as bathing or changing clothes, have limited access to certain members of the public. These normal activities are guided by generally accepted norms, the first of which is that the facilities are most often segregated by gender; however, this may not be the case in all cultures. Neustadt-Dosse in East Germany (1987) Changing rooms may be provided in stores, workplaces, or sports facilities to allow people to change their clothing. Some changing rooms have individual cubicles or stalls affording varying degrees of privacy. Locker rooms and communal showers associated with sports generally lacked any individual space, thus providing minimal physical privacy. The men‚Äôs locker room‚Äîwhich historically in Western cultures had been a setting for open male social nudity‚Äîis, in the 21st century United States, becoming a space of modesty and distancing between men. For much of the 20th century, the norm in locker rooms had been for men to undress completely without embarrassment. That norm has changed; in the 21st century, men typically wear towels or other garments in the locker room most of the time and avoid any interaction with others while naked. This shift is the result of changes in social norms regarding masculinity and how maleness is publicly expressed; also, open male nudity has become associated with homosexuality. In facilities such as the YMCA that cater to multiple generations, the young are uncomfortable sharing space with older people who do not cover up. The behavior in women's locker rooms and showers also indicates a generational change, younger women covering more, and full nudity being brief and rare, while older women are more open and casual. By the 1990s, communal showers in American schools had become \\"uncomfortable\\", not only because students were accustomed to more privacy at home, but because young people became more self-conscious based upon the comparison to mass media images of perfect bodies. In the 21st century, some high-end New York City gyms were redesigned to cater to millennials who want to shower without ever being seen naked. The trend for privacy is being extended to public schools, colleges and community facilities replacing \\"gang showers\\" and open locker rooms with individual stalls and changing rooms. The change also addresses issues of transgender usage and family use when one parent accompanies children of differing gender. This shift in attitudes has come to societies historically open to nudity. In Denmark, secondary school students are now avoiding showering after gym classes. In interviews, students cited the lack of privacy, fears of being judged by idealized standards, and the possibility of being photographed while naked. Similar results were found in schools in Norway. =Social and public nudity= Nude people at Fremont Solstice Parade in Seattle, Washington, USA Attitudes toward public nudity vary depending on culture, time, location, and context. There are particular contexts in which nudity is tolerated, accepted, or even encouraged in public spaces. In Europe, such contexts include nude beaches, within some intentional communities (such as naturist resorts or clubs) and at special events. While some European countries (such as Germany, for example) are rather tolerant of public nudity, other nations disfavor or punish public nudity. In the United States in 2012, the city council of San Francisco, California banned public nudity in the inner-city area. This move was met by harsh resistance because the city was known for its liberal culture and had previously tolerated public nudity. Similarly, park rangers began filing tickets against nudists at San Onofre State Beach‚Äîalso a place with long tradition of public nudity‚Äîin 2010. =Naturism= A group of naturists on a beach in Crimea, 2008 Naturism (or nudism) is a subculture advocating and defending private and public nudity as part of a simple, natural lifestyle. Naturists reject contemporary standards of modesty that discourage personal, family and social nudity. They instead seek to create a social environment where individuals feel comfortable being in the company of nude people and being seen nude, either by other naturists or by the general public. In contradiction of the popular belief that nudists are more sexually permissive, research finds that nudist and non-nudists do not differ in their sexual behavior. The social sciences until the middle of the 20th century often studied public nakedness, including naturism, in the context of deviance or criminality. However, more recent studies find that naturism has positive effects on body image, self esteem and life satisfaction. The Encyclopedia of Social Deviance continues to have an entry on \\"Nudism\\", but also defines \\"Normal Deviance\\" as violating social norms in a positive way, leading to social change. =Nude beaches= A nude beach, sometimes called a clothing-optional or free beach, is a beach where users are at liberty to be nude. Such beaches are usually on public lands. Nude beaches may be official (legally sanctioned), unofficial (tolerated by residents and law enforcement), or illegal but so isolated as to escape enforcement. =Arts-related activities= Distinct from the nude artworks created, sessions where artists work from live models are a social situation where nudity has a long tradition. The role of the model both as part of visual art education and in the creation of finished works has evolved since antiquity in Western societies and worldwide wherever western cultural practices in the visual arts have been adopted. At modern universities, art schools, and community groups \\"art model\\" is a job, one requirement of which is to pose \\"undraped\\" and motionless for minutes, hours (with breaks) or resuming the same pose days as the artwork requires. Some have investigated the benefits of arts education including nudes as an opportunity to satisfy youthful curiosity regarding the human body. Photography of groups of nude people in public places has been done around the world with or without official cooperation. The gathering itself is proposed as performance art, while the resulting images become statements based upon the identities of people invited to participate by posing, and the location selected; urban, scenic landscapes, or sites of historical significance. The photographers including Spencer Tunick and Henning von Berg state a variety of artistic, cultural, and political reasons for their work, while those being photographed may be professional models or unpaid volunteers attracted to the project for personal reasons. Depictions of nudity Images of a man and woman attached to Pioneer 10 as part of a message to any extra-terrestrial intelligence the space probe might encounter. In a picture-making civilization, pictorial conventions continually reaffirm what is natural in human appearance, which is part of socialization. In Western societies, the contexts for depictions of nudity include information, art and pornography. Any ambiguous image not easily fitting into one of these categories may be misinterpreted, leading to disputes. The nude in photography includes scientific, commercial, fine art, and erotic photography. Art The nude human figure has been one of the subjects of art from its Paleolithic beginnings, and a major preoccupation of Western art since the ancient Greeks. In \\"The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form\\", Lord Kenneth Clark states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations. This separation of the artistic form from the related social and cultural issues was largely unexamined by classical art historians, but became a focus of social and feminist critiques in the 1970s, when classical nudes of women were seen as symbolic of male objectification of female bodies. The debate over objectification has continued, recently energized by the #MeToo movement. Indecency and obscenity Limits on the depiction of nudity are based upon the legal definitions of indecency and obscenity. In 1973, the Supreme Court in Miller v. California established the three-tiered Miller test to determine what was obscene (and thus not protected) versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the First Amendment. Depictions of child nudity (or of children with nude adults) appear in works of art in various cultures and historical periods. These attitudes have changed over time and have become increasingly frowned upon, especially in the case of photography. In recent years, snapshots taken by parents of their nude infant or toddler children were challenged as child pornography. The legal definition of child pornography is that it depicts sexually explicit conduct. Performance Nudity may be used as a part of live performances, such as dance, theater, performance art and nude body painting. Dance Dance, as a sequence of human movement, may be ceremonial, social or one of the performing arts. Partial or complete nudity is a feature of ceremonial dances in some tropical countries. However, some claim that modern practices may be used to promote \\"ethnic tourism\\" rather than to revive authentic traditions. In Western traditions, dance costumes have evolved towards providing more freedom of movement and revealing more of the body; complete nakedness is the culmination of this process. Modern choreographers consider nudity one of the possible \\"costumes\\" available for dance, some seeing nudity as expressing deeper human qualities through dance which works against the sexual objectification of the body in commercial culture. While nudity in social dance is not common, events such as \\"Naked Tango\\" have been held in Germany. Theater A well-known performance that included nudity was the Broadway musical Hair in 1968. The New York Times printed a number of letters to the editor in 1969 with opinions ranging from actress June Havoc stating that nudity indicates that the producer has run out of ideas; while actress Shelley Winters joked that it was disgusting, but if she were 22 she would do it. Erotic performances Models posing on stage nude was a feature of tableaux vivants at London's Windmill Theatre and New York's Ziegfeld Follies in the early 20th century. English law did not allow nude actresses to move on stage, but allowed them stand motionless to imitate works of art.

It is situated on the Plateau de Millevaches in the d√©partements of Creuse and Haute-Vienne. It is the largest area of water in the Limousin region of France and provides water supplies, hydroelectricity, and leisure facilities. Construction The lake was constructed after World War II and opened at Christmas 1950. It is the product of two dams in the valley of the Maulde River, an important tributary of the Vienne River. Sketch map of Vassivi√®re Lake. The Maulde is the most important source of water for the lake, and the lac de Lavaud-Gelade, a reservoir to the east, is able to feed it via an underground canal. The lac de Vassivi√®re feeds water to a hydro-electric station at Mazet, to the west. Geography and environment The lac de Vassivi√®re is surrounded by more than of land of ecological or natural interest (ZNIEFF: Zone naturelle d'int√©r√™t √©cologique, faunistique et floristique), level 1, grouped in 15 distinct areas. These present the full range of landscapes characteristic of the Plateau de Millevaches: peat bog, wetland, heath and forest. The bogs, in particular, are unique and fragile small ecosystems, composed of many strata of plant material, and forming a carbon sink. They are the sources of many of the streams and rivers that flow from the region. The climate is heavily influenced by the elevated, inland location. Milevaches winters are cold with snowfalls heavy enough for some winter sports. Spring is generally cool and wet, and summer is warm and pleasant, albeit with occasional fierce thunderstorms. Autumn often brings a period of considerable sun and warmth. The lac de Vassivi√®re is the 16th largest lake in France by area, but sixth among the artificial lakes, and tenth among fresh water lakes. It is surrounded by many different communes, including: * in Creuse : Faux-la-Montagne, Roy√®re-de-Vassivi√®re. * in Haute- Vienne : Beaumont-du-Lac, Peyrat-le-Ch√¢teau, Amenities As the lac de Vassivi√®re is entirely inside the Millevaches Regional Natural Park, large parts of its shoreline are protected from excessive development, and form an important haven for wildlife, and wild flowers in particular. However, with 45 kilometres of shoreline there has still been room for a good deal of tourist development, mostly at well-separated, small sites. This provides camping and picnic facilities, small-scale catering, hotels, artificial beaches, and small ports. There are demarcated zones for motor boating and water skiing, but most of the surface is dominated by small sailing boats. Much of the surrounding housing caters for tourists. There are numerous organised cycling and walking events. The lake has, in fact, become the most important area for sport, and especially water sports, in the region. Isle of Vassivi√®re The Isle of Vassivi√®re is an island at the centre of the lake with an area of 0.75 km¬≤. It is dominated by a ch√¢teau and features a number of exhibition and performance spaces, a landscape sculpture park and small menagerie. It is also the site of the lake's main lighthouse, designed in 1988 by Aldo Rossi. The island is connected to the shore by a causeway. Only authorised vehicles are allowed, so it is normally accessed on foot or by road train. Transport The Lake is entirely encircled by roads and footpaths. The nearest railway station is Eymoutiers/Lac de Vassivi√®re. As well as guided tours by boat, there is a free water taxi on the lake.

W. Hornung, and features the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, and his companion and biographer, Bunny Manders. The story was published in September 1905 by Pall Mall Magazine in London.Rowland, page 282 The story was also included as the eighth story in the collection A Thief in the Night, published by Chatto & Windus in London, and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York, both in 1905.Rowland, page 280. Plot It is December 1899, at which time the reputations of Raffles and Bunny are ruined and they are secretly living in Ham Common. They read in a magazine about the so-called Raffles Relics on display at the Black Museum at Scotland Yard. Excited, Raffles passive-aggressively persuades Bunny, now a journalist, to get a journalist's pass for two to visit the museum. They enter the museum without incident. An enthusiastic young clerk arrives to give them a tour, though he is less knowledgeable than Raffles and Bunny on the museum's inventory, which includes the infamous cigarette box of two criminals who were never caught. Eventually, the clerk shows them the Raffles Relics, taken from Raffles's Albany rooms after his apparent death. He points out several objects, including Raffles's old revolver, which Raffles had once fired at a man on a roof and had once hidden a pearl inside of, the rope-ladder and telescope walking-stick he used at the house of Lord Thornaby, the velvet bag whose use is unknown, the life-preserver that Bunny had once hit Raffles with, and Raffles's chest. The clerk speaks poorly of Raffles's partner, to Bunny's chagrin. A well-known detective and two other guests also browse the museum. Raffles, wary of the detective, tells Bunny to hide his face in some photographs; Bunny does so, until he realizes that Raffles has vanished. Irritated, he nonetheless tells the clerk that Raffles had to catch a train. Bunny lingers until the detective's party leaves, then tips the clerk and leaves. He searches for Raffles for four hours, in vain. At home, he anxiously waits hours for Raffles. Bunny wakes abruptly in the morning to see Raffles, and the entire collection of Raffles Relics, except for the chest. Raffles had hid himself in the chest, using its secret side door. He had replaced his relics with items from other collections, so that the robbery will not be noticed for weeks. Raffles wonders about putting his relics to use again, but also speaks prophetically about the competing excitement that the ongoing war might soon offer them. Adaptations BBC Radio adapted the story into the first half of the sixteenth episode of its Raffles radio drama, \\"The Raffles Relics\\", which first aired on 20 August 1992. The drama features Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny. The episode faithfully follows the plot of the original story, with a minor change: * In the drama, the stealing of the Raffles Relics is their first Ham Common crime, rather than their last.

Biography He was born on 10 August 1884, in Castle Cary, Somerset, England, the seventh of eight children of William Macmillan (1844‚Äì1911) and his wife Emily (1843‚Äì1937). He was educated at Sexey's School, Bruton (1894‚Äì1897), the Quaker Sidcot School, Winscombe (1897‚Äì1901), and then at the Birkbeck, University of London in 1901. Macmillan entered the civil service in London in 1902 and worked in the Board of Agriculture and, later, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, retiring as a staff officer in 1945. The death of his father from cancer, in 1911, left a deep impression on Macmillan, and the following year, despite having no medical background himself, he founded the Society for the Prevention and Relief of Cancer, with a donation of ¬£10. The National Health Service (NHS) had yet to be established, and registration of nurses was not introduced until 1919. At the time no health and safety acts had been passed by Parliament and public health had yet to become a priority for the state. In setting up the society, Macmillan \\"wanted to see homes for cancer patients throughout the land, where attention will be provided freely or at low cost, as circumstances dictate... [and]... panels of voluntary nurses who can be detailed off to attend to necessitous patients in their own homes.\\" Macmillan managed the charity, along with other volunteers, while working full-time as a civil servant. In 1924 he moved to Knoll Road, Sidcup, where he would live until 1966. In 1930 the charity took on its first full- time member of staff. The organisation he founded has since flourished and is today known as Macmillan Cancer Support. A blue plaque was erected to honour him at his former residence of 15 Ranelagh Road, Pimlico in 1997 and another in 2019 at his birthplace in Castle Cary. In October 2010, The Bexley Civic Society invited the Mayor of Bexley, Cllr Val Clark, to unveil another plaque on his house in Knoll Road, Sidcup where he lived for 30 years. Macmillan was a vegetarian. In 1909, he wrote an open letter to all Christians entitled Shall we slay? which encouraged orthodox Christians to consider vegetarianism.Shall we slay?

Frederick was the son of James Ransome, 1782-1849, a member of the Ransomes steel and agricultural equipment-making family of Ipswich. In 1844 Frederick invented an artificial sandstone, using sand and powdered flint in an alkaline solution. By heating it in an enclosed high temperature steam boiler the siliceous particles were bound together and could be moulded or worked. With properties equivalent to natural stone, it found applications as filtering slabs, vases, tombstones, decorative architectural work, emery wheels and grindstones. Ransome founded the Patent Siliceous Stone Company in 1852 in order to produce and sell the stone, with an illustrious group of backers that included Charles Darwin, and the Patent Concrete Stone Company in 1865. However, the stone fell out of use, in favour of Portland cement-based concrete, which could be more simply cast on-site. Ransome moved the manufacture of the artificial stone from Ipswich to Blackwall Lane, Greenwich, in 1866. The Blackwall Lane works covered about four acres, connected to a jetty on the Thames by a tramway. The company‚Äôs decorative \\"stonework\\" was used at the Brighton Aquarium, London Docks, the Indian Court, Whitehall, St. Thomas's Hospital, and at the University of Calcutta and other buildings in India. They also made paving tiles, which were used on the Albert Bridge and inscribed memorial headstones. By far his most economically important invention (Patents 5442/1885, 10530/1887 and 15065/1887) was the rotary cement kiln. Although his experiments with this were not a commercial success, his designs provided the basis for successful kilns in the USA from 1891, subsequently emulated worldwide. Ransome became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1848. He died at East Dulwich on 19 April 1893 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His son, Ernest L. Ransome, born in 1844, moved to the United States and became a significant innovator of reinforced concrete in his own right.

At the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season, Coulibaly left KVK Ninove for KMSK Deinze, which played in the Second Division, where he scored 15 times in 36 games over two seasons. KV Kortrijk At the end of the 2005-06 season, Coulibaly joined the West- Flemish fellow Second Division team KV Kortrijk on a two-year-contract. In his first season, he managed five goals in 27 games while his club was promoted to the Belgian Pro League. The season 2008‚Äì2009 became the breakthrough of Coulibaly: thanks to his 11 goals, Kortrijk managed to avoid relegation from the Pro League. AA Gent In summer 2009, Coulibaly signed a three-year contract with AA Gent. Following a slow start to the 2009‚Äì2010 season with few appearances he got his first goal versus Mechelen before going on to score 11 goals for the season and thus greatly contributing to AA Gent's vice- championship. Coulibaly also scored the first goal in the cup final as his club beat Cercle Brugge to win the 2009‚Äì10 Belgian Cup. Coulibaly's second season in Ghent was less spectacular than his first. He scored AA Gent's first ever goal in Champions League qualification as his team lost 6‚Äì1 on aggregate to Dynamo Kyiv in the third qualifying round for the 2010‚Äì2011 Champions League and helped AA Gent make the group phase of the Europa League by scoring in their return leg against Feyenoord in the playoff round, but later lost his place in the starting lineup to new arrival Shlomi Arbeitman.

He arrived in Maryland in 1637, and, being a man of great executive ability, took over the care of the mission, \\"a charge which at that time required rather business men than missionaries\\". In 1645, Fisher was arrested and carried in chains to England, with Father Andrew White, the founder of the English mission in America. After enduring hardships he was released, and returned to Maryland (February, 1648).

It is based on the purportedly true story of three student filmmakers‚ÄîHeather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard‚Äîwho hike in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The three disappear, but their equipment and footage is discovered a year later. The purportedly \\"recovered footage\\" is the film the viewer sees. Myrick and S√°nchez conceived of a fictional legend of the Blair Witch in 1993. They developed a 35-page screenplay with the dialogue to be improvised. A casting call advertisement in Backstage magazine was prepared by the directors; Donahue, Williams and Leonard were cast. The film entered production in October 1997, with the principal photography taking place in Maryland for eight days. About 20 hours of footage was shot, which was edited down to 82 minutes. Shot on an original budget of $35,000‚Äì60,000, the film had a final cost of $200,000‚Äì750,000 after post-production edits. When The Blair Witch Project premiered at the Sundance Film Festival at midnight on January 23, 1999, its promotional marketing campaign listed the actors as either \\"missing\\" or \\"deceased\\". Owing to its successful run at Sundance, Artisan Entertainment bought the film's distribution rights for $1.1 million. The film had a limited release on July 14, 1999, before expanding to a wider release starting July 30. While critical reception was mostly positive, audience reception was split. The film is heavily credited with reviving the found- footage technique which was later used by similarly successful horror films such as Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield. A sleeper hit, The Blair Witch Project grossed nearly $250 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent films of all time, as well as one of the most profitable. The film launched a media franchise, which includes two sequels (Book of Shadows and Blair Witch), novels, comic books, and video games. Plot In October 1994, film students Heather, Mike, and Josh set out to produce a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, and interview residents about the legend. Locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit who lived in the woods and kidnapped seven children in the 1940s, supposedly killing all of them on the orders of the witch. The students explore the woods in north Burkittsville to research the legend. They meet two fishermen, one of whom warns them that the woods are haunted. He tells them of a young girl named Robin Weaver, who went missing in 1888; when she returned three days later, she talked about \\"an old woman whose feet never touched the ground.\\" The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century. Their bodies later disappeared. They camp for the night, and the next day, find an old cemetery with seven small cairns. That night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping. The following day, they try to hike back to the car but cannot find it before dark and make camp. They again hear twigs snapping. In the morning, they find that three cairns have been built around their tent. Heather learns her map is missing. Mike reveals he kicked the map into a creek out of frustration, which prompts the other two to attack him in rage as they realize they are now lost. They decide to head south, using Mike's compass and discover humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. They again hear strange sounds that night, including children laughing. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn. Upon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime. They come across a river identical to one they crossed earlier and realize they have walked in a circle. Josh suffers a breakdown because of the dire situation and disappears the next morning. Heather and Mike try in vain to find him before proceeding. That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams but are unable to locate him. They theorize that his screams are a fabrication by the witch to draw them out of their tent. The next day, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks tied with fabric from Josh's shirt. She also finds blood-soaked scraps of his shirt as well as teeth, hair, and a piece of his tongue. Although distraught, she chooses not to tell Mike. That night, she records herself apologizing to her family and Mike's and Josh's families, taking responsibility for their predicament. They again hear Josh's agonized cries and follow them to an abandoned house containing demonic symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Trying to find Josh, they go to the basement, where an unseen force attacks Mike, causing him to drop his camera. Heather enters the basement screaming, and her camera captures Mike standing in a corner. The unseen force attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera, and the footage ends. Production Development Development of The Blair Witch Project began in 1993. While film students at the University of Central Florida, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S√°nchez were inspired to make the film after realizing that they found documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both. In order to produce the project, they, along with Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Michael Monello, started Haxan Films. The namesake for the production company is Benjamin Christensen's 1922 silent documentary horror film H√§xan (English: Witchcraft Through the Ages). Myrick and S√°nchez developed a 35-page screenplay for their fictional film, intending dialogue to be improvised. A casting call advertisement was placed in Backstage by the directors in June 1996, asking for actors with strong improvisational abilities. The informal improvisational audition process narrowed the pool of 2,000 actors. According to Heather Donahue, auditions for the film were held at Musical Theater Works in New York City. The advertisement said a \\"completely improvised feature film\\" would be shot in a \\"wooded location\\". Donahue said that during the audition, Myrick and S√°nchez posed her the question: \\"You've served seven years of a nine year sentence. Why should we let you out on parole?\\" to which she had to respond. Joshua Leonard said he was cast due to his knowledge of how to run a camera, as no omniscient camera was used to film the scenes. Pre-production began on October 5, 1997 and Michael Monello became a co-producer. In developing the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-anagrams: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, began as an anagram for Rasputin. The Blair Witch is said to be, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated that part of the legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, to play on the themes of injustice done to those who were classified as witches. The directors also cited influences such as the television series In Search of..., and horror documentary films Chariots of the Gods and The Legend of Boggy Creek. Other influences included commercially successful horror films such as The Shining, Alien, The Omen, and Jaws‚Äîthe latter film being his major influence, as the film hides the witch from the viewer for its entirety, increasing the suspense of the unknown. Joshua Leonard played a fictionalized version of himself in the film. In talks with investors, the directors presented an eight-minute documentary, along with newspapers and news footage. The documentary was aired on the television series Split Screen hosted by John Pierson on August 6, 1998. Filming Principal photography began on October 23, 1997 in Maryland and lasted eight days, overseen by cinematographer Neal Fredericks. Most of the film was shot in Seneca Creek State Park in Montgomery County, Maryland. A few scenes were filmed in the historic town of Burkittsville. Some of the townspeople interviewed in the film were not actors, and some were planted actors, unknown to the main cast. Donahue had never operated a camera before and spent two days in a \\"crash course\\". Donahue said she modeled her character after a director she had once worked with, noting her character's \\"self-assuredness\\" when everything went as planned, and confusion during crisis. During filming, the actors were equipped with CP-16 film and Hi8 video cameras provided by cinematographer Neal Fredericks. They were given clues as to their next location through messages hidden inside 35 mm film cans left in milk crates they found with Global Positioning Satellite systems. They were given individual instructions to use to help improvise the action of the day. Teeth were obtained from a Maryland dentist for use as human remains in the film. Influenced by producer Gregg Hale's memories of his military training, in which \\"enemy soldiers\\" would hunt a trainee through wild terrain for three days, the directors moved the characters a long way during the day, harassing them by night, and depriving them of food. According to the filmmakers' commentary, the unseen figure that Donahue is shouting about as she is running away from the tent is the film's art director Ricardo Moreno, who was wearing white long-johns, white stockings and white pantyhose pulled over his head. It was initially intended for the figure to be revealed on camera as the Blair Witch herself, but the cameraman forgot to pan to the left of Donahue to capture footage of Moreno. The scene was never reshot. The final scenes were filmed at the historic Griggs House, a 200-year-old building located in the Patapsco Valley State Park near Granite, Maryland. Filming concluded on October 31, Halloween. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, S√°nchez revealed that when principal photography first wrapped, approximately $20,000 to $25,000 had been spent. Richard Corliss of Time magazine reported a $35,000 estimated budget. By September 2016, The Blair Witch Project has been officially budgeted at $60,000. Post-production After filming, the 20 hours of raw footage had to be cut down to two and a half hours; the editing process took more than eight months. The directors screened the first cut in small film festivals in order to get feedback and make changes that would ensure that it appealed to as large an audience as possible. Originally, it was hoped that the film would make it on to cable television, and the directors did not anticipate a wide release. The final version was submitted to Sundance Film Festival. After becoming a surprise hit at Sundance, during its midnight premiere on January 25, 1999, Artisan Entertainment bought the distribution rights for $1.1 million. Prior to that, Artisan had wanted to change the film's original ending, as the test audience were puzzled, although scared. (Donahue screams in terror and finds Michael C. Williams facing a corner in the basement before she is knocked to the ground.) The directors and Williams traveled back to Maryland and shot four alternate endings, one of which employed bloody elements. Ultimately, they decided to keep the original. Myrick said, \\"What makes us fearful is something that's out of the ordinary, unexplained. The first ending kept the audience off balance; it challenged our real world conventions and that's what really made it scary.\\" Post-production fees increased the cost of the film to several hundred thousand dollars before its Sundance debut and, after marketing costs, the total cost of the film has been estimated as ranging between $500,000 and $750,000. Marketing A missing person poster showing Heather Donahue (left), Joshua Leonard (middle), and Michael C. Williams (right) as part of the film's marketing campaign tactic to portray its events as real The Blair Witch Project is thought to be the first widely released film marketed primarily by the Internet. Kevin Foxe became executive producer in May 1998 and brought in Clein & Walker, a public relations firm, and the film's official website launched in June 1998, featuring faux police reports as well as \\"newsreel-style\\" interviews, and fielding questions about the \\"missing\\" students. These augmented the film's found footage device to spark debates across the Internet over whether the film was a real-life documentary or a work of fiction. Some of the footage was screened during the Florida Film Festival in June. During screenings, the filmmakers made advertising efforts to promulgate the events in the film as factual, including the distribution of flyers at festivals such as Sundance, asking viewers to come forward with any information about the \\"missing\\" students. The campaign tactic was that viewers were being told, through missing persons posters, that the characters were missing while researching in the woods for the mythical Blair Witch. The IMDb page also listed the actors as \\"missing, presumed dead\\" in the first year of the film's availability. The film's website contains materials of actors posing as police and investigators giving testimony about their casework, and shared childhood photos of the actors to add a sense of realism. By August 1999, the website had received 160 million hits. After the Sundance screening, Artisan acquired the film and a distribution strategy was created and implemented by Steven Rothenberg. The film's trailer was leaked on the website Aint It Cool News on April 2, 1999 and the film was screened at 40 colleges in the United States to build word- of-mouth. A third, 40-second, trailer was shown before Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace in June. USA Today reported that The Blair Witch Project was the first film to go viral despite having been produced before many of the technologies that facilitate such phenomena existed. Fictional legend The backstory for the film is a legend fabricated by S√°nchez and Myrick which is detailed in the Curse of the Blair Witch, a mockumentary broadcast on the SciFi Channel on July 12, 1999. S√°nchez and Myrick also maintain a website which adds further details to the legend. The legend describes the killings and disappearances of some of the residents of Blair, Maryland (a fictitious town on the site of Burkittsville, Maryland) from the 18th to 20th centuries. Residents blamed these occurrences on the ghost of Elly Kedward, a Blair resident accused of practicing witchcraft in 1785 and sentenced to death by exposure. The Curse of the Blair Witch presents the legend as real, complete with manufactured newspaper articles, newsreels, television news reports, and staged interviews. Release The Blair Witch Project premiered as a Midnight Screening on Saturday, January 23, 1999 at the Sundance Film Festival, and opened Wednesday, July 14, 1999 at the Angelika Film Center in New York City before expanding to 25 cities at the weekend. It expanded nationwide on July 30.  Television broadcast  For its television premiere in October 2001 on the FX Channel, two deleted scenes were reinserted during the end credits of the film. Neither deleted scene has ever been officially released. Home media The Blair Witch Project was released on VHS and DVD on October 22, 1999 by Artisan, presented in a 1.33:1 windowboxed aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Special features include the documentary Curse of the Blair Witch, a five-minute Newly Discovered Footage, audio commentary, production notes, and cast and crew biographies. The audio commentary presents directors Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S√°nchez, and producers Rob Cowie, Mike Monello and Gregg Hale, in which they discuss the film's production. The Curse of the Blair Witch feature provides an in-depth look inside the creation of the film. More than $15 million was spent to market the home video release of the film. The film's Blu-ray version was released on October 5, 2010 by Lionsgate. Best Buy and Lionsgate had an exclusive release of the Blu-ray made available on August 29, 2010. Reception Box office The film earned $1.5 million from 27 theaters in its opening weekend, with a per-screen average of $56,002. The film expanded nationwide in its third weekend and grossed $29.2 million from 1,101 locations, placing at number two in the United States box office, surpassing the science fiction horror film Deep Blue Sea but behind Runaway Bride. The film expanded further to 2,142 theaters and again finished in second place with a gross of $24.3 million in its fourth weekend, behind another horror film The Sixth Sense. The film dropped out of the top-ten list in its 10th weekend and by the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $140.5 million in the US and Canada and grossed $108.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $248.6 million (over 4,000 times its original budget). The Blair Witch Project was the 10th highest-grossing film in the US in 1999, and has earned the reputation of becoming a sleeper hit. Because the filming was done by the actors using hand-held cameras, much of the footage is shaky, especially the final sequence in which a character is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some audience members experienced motion sickness and even vomited as a result. Critical reception The Blair Witch Project drew positive reviews from critics. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 86% based on 162 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \\"Full of creepy campfire scares, mock-doc The Blair Witch Project keeps audiences in the dark about its titular villain, proving once more that imagination can be as scary as anything onscreen.\\" On Metacritic, the film received \\"universal acclaim\\" and was awarded its \\"Must-See\\" badge, with a weighted average of 81 out of 100 based on 33 reviews. Audience reception to the film, though, remains divided; CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \\"C+\\" on a scale ranging from A+ to F based on audiences polled during the film's opening weekend. The Blair Witch Project found-footage technique received near-universal praise. Although this was not the first film to use it, the independent film was declared a milestone in film history due to its critical and box office success. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a total of four stars, and called it \\"an extraordinarily effective horror film\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it \\"a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium\\". Todd McCarthy of Variety said, \\"An intensely imaginative piece of conceptual filmmaking that also delivers the goods as a dread-drenched horror movie, The Blair Witch Project puts a clever modern twist on the universal fear of the dark and things that go bump in the night.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave a grade of \\"B\\", saying, \\"As a horror picture, the film may not be much more than a cheeky game, a novelty with the cool, blurry look of an avant-garde artifact. But as a manifestation of multimedia synergy, it's pretty spooky.\\" Some critics were less enthusiastic. Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer deemed it \\"overrated,\\" as well as a rendition of \\"the ultimate triumph of the Sundance scam: Make a heartless home movie, get enough critics to blurb in near unison 'scary,' and watch the suckers flock to be fleeced\\". A critic from The Christian Science Monitor said that while the film's concept and scares were innovative, he felt it could have just been shot \\"as a 30-minute short ... since its shaky camera work and fuzzy images get monotonous after a while, and there's not much room for character development within the very limited plot.\\" R. L. Schaffer of IGN scored it two out of ten, and described it as \\"boringreally boring\\", and \\"a Z-grade, low-rent horror outing with no real scares into a genuine big-budget spectacle\\". Accolades The 20th Golden Raspberry Awards gave Heather Donahue its Worst Actress award, and nominated producers Robin Cowie and Gregg Hale for the Worst Picture award. At the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film won the Biggest Disappointment category and received three nominations: Worst Picture (Cowie and Hale), Worst Actress (Donahue), and Worst Screen Debut (Heather, Michael, Josh, the Stick People and the world's longest running batteries). At the 1st Golden Trailer Awards, it received a nomination for Most Original Trailer and won two categories: Best Horror/Thriller and Best Voice Over. The Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award awarded The Blair Witch Project its Best Film. Legacy An array of other films have relied on the found-footage concept and shown influence by The Blair Witch Project. These include Paranormal Activity (2007), REC (2007), Cloverfield (2008), The Last Exorcism (2010), Trollhunter (2010), Chronicle (2012), Project X (2012), V/H/S (2012), End of Watch (2012), and The Den (2013). Some critics have also noted that the film's basic plot premise and narrative style are strikingly similar to Cannibal Holocaust (1980) and The Last Broadcast (1998). Although Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato has acknowledged the similarities of The Blair Witch Project to his film, he criticized the publicity that it received for being an original production; advertisements for The Blair Witch Project also promoted the idea that the footage is genuine. Despite initial reports that The Last Broadcast creators‚ÄîStefan Avalos and Lance Weiler‚Äîhad alleged that The Blair Witch Project was a complete rip-off of their work and would sue Haxan Films for copyright infringement, they repudiated these allegations. One of the creators told IndieWire in 1999, \\"If somebody enjoys The Blair Witch Project there is a chance they will enjoy our film, and we hope they will check it out.\\" Film critic Michael Dodd has argued that the film is an embodiment of horror \\"modernizing its ability to be all-encompassing in expressing the fears of American society\\". He noted that \\"In an age where anyone can film whatever they like, horror needn't be a cinematic expression of what terrifies the cinema-goer, it can simply be the medium through which terrors captured by the average American can be showcased\\". In 2008, The Blair Witch Project was ranked by Entertainment Weekly as number ninety-nine on their list of 100 Best Films from 1983 to 2008. In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association ranked it as number 12 on their list of Top 100 Scariest Movies. It was ranked number 50 on Filmcritic.com's list of 50 Best Movie Endings of All Time. In 2016, it was ranked by IGN as number 21 on their list of Top 25 Horror Movies of All Time, number 16 on Cosmopolitans 25 Scariest Movies of All Time, and number three on The Hollywood Reporters 10 Scariest Movies of All Time. In 2013, the film also made the top-ten list of The Hollywood Reporters highest-grossing independent films of all time, ranking number six. Director Eli Roth has cited the film as a marketing influence to promote his 2002 horror film Cabin Fever with the Internet.Roth, Eli. Cabin Fever DVD, Lions Gate Entertainment, 2004, audio commentary. ASIN: B0000ZG054 The Blair Witch Project was included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. After the film was released, in late November 1999, the historic house where it was filmed was reportedly being overwhelmed by film fans who broke off chunks as souvenirs. The township ordered the house demolished the next month. Media tie-ins =Books= In September 1999, D.A. Stern compiled The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier. Building on the film's \\"true story\\" angle, the dossier consisted of fabricated police reports, pictures, interviews, and newspaper articles presenting the film's premise as fact, as well as further elaboration on the Elly Kedward and Rustin Parr legends. (Another \\"dossier\\" was created for Blair Witch 2). Stern wrote the 2000 novel Blair Witch: The Secret Confessions of Rustin Parr. He revisited the franchise with the novel Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift, which features original characters and plot. A series of eight young adult books, entitled The Blair Witch Files, were released by Random subsidiary Bantam from 2000 to 2001. The books center on Cade Merill, a fictional cousin of Heather Donahue, who investigates phenomena related to the Blair Witch. She tries to learn what really happened to Heather, Mike, and Josh. =Comic books= In July 1999, Oni Press released a one-shot comic promoting the film, titled The Blair Witch Project #1. Written and illustrated by Cece Malvey, the comic was released in conjunction of the film. In October 2000, coinciding with the release of Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, Image Comics released a one-shot called Blair Witch: Dark Testaments, drawn by Charlie Adlard. =Video games= In 2000, Gathering of Developers released a trilogy of computer games based on the film, which greatly expanded on the myths first suggested in the film. The graphics engine and characters were all derived from the producer's earlier game Nocturne. The first volume, Rustin Parr, received the most praise, ranging from moderate to positive, with critics commending its storyline, graphics and atmosphere; some reviewers even claimed that the game was scarier than the film. The following volumes, The Legend of Coffin Rock and The Elly Kedward Tale, were less well received, with PC Gamer saying that Volume 2's \\"only saving grace was its cheap price\\", and calling Volume 3 \\"amazingly mediocre\\". At E3 2019, Bloober Team introduced Blair Witch, a first-person survival horror game based on the Blair Witch franchise. The game was released on August 30, 2019. =Documentary= The Woods Movie (2015) is a feature-length documentary exploring the production of The Blair Witch Project. For this documentary, director Russ Gomm interviewed the original film's producer, Gregg Hale, and directors Eduardo S√°nchez and Daniel Myrick. Parodies The Blair Witch Project inspired a number of parody films, including The Bogus Witch Project, The Tony Blair Witch Project (both 2000), and The Blair Thumb (2001), as well as the pornographic films The Erotic Witch Project and The Bare Wench Project. The film also inspired the Halloween television special The Scooby-Doo Project, which aired during a Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! marathon on Cartoon Network on October 31, 1999. Sequels A sequel entitled Book of Shadows was released on October 27, 2000; it was poorly received by most critics. A third installment announced that same year did not materialize. On July 22, 2016, a surprise trailer for Blair Witch was revealed at the San Diego Comic-Con. The film was originally marketed as The Woods so as to be an exclusive surprise announcement for those in attendance at the convention. The film, distributed by Lionsgate, was slated for a September 16 release and stars James Allen McCune as the brother of the original film's Heather Donahue. Directed by Adam Wingard, Blair Witch is a direct sequel to The Blair Witch Project, and does not acknowledge the events of Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. However, Wingard has said that although his version does not reference any of the events that transpired in Book of Shadows, the film does not necessarily discredit the existence of Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. In September 2016, screenwriter Simon Barrett explained that in writing the new film, he only considered material that was produced with the involvement of the original film's creative team (directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S√°nchez, producer Gregg Hale, and production designer Ben Rock) to be \\"canon\\", and that he did not take any material produced without their direct involvementsuch as the first sequel Book of Shadows or The Blair Witch Files, a series of young adult novelsinto consideration when writing the new sequel. Television In October 2017, co- director Eduardo S√°nchez revealed that he and the rest of the film's creative team are developing a Blair Witch television series, though he clarified that any decisions would ultimately be up to Lionsgate now which owns the rights to it. In February 2018, it was announced that the series will be released on the studio's new subsidiary, Studio L, which specializes in digital releases.

Hamilton Co. of Washington, D.C., United States Shampoo () is a hair care product, typically in the form of a viscous liquid, that is used for cleaning hair. Less commonly, shampoo is available in bar form, like a bar of soap. Shampoo is used by applying it to wet hair, massaging the product into the scalp, and then rinsing it out. Some users may follow a shampooing with the use of hair conditioner. The typical reason of using shampoo is to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable. Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water. The sulphate ingredient acts as a surfactant, essentially heavy duty soap that makes it easier to trap oil and grease. Specialty shampoos are marketed to people with dandruff, color-treated hair, gluten or wheat allergies, an interest in using an organic product, infants and young children (\\"baby shampoo\\" is less irritating). There are also shampoos intended for animals that may contain insecticides or other medications to treat skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas. Etymology The word shampoo entered the English language from the Indian subcontinent during the colonial era.M. J. Campion, Hobson-Jobson: The words English owes to India. BBC News, 11 July 2012. It dated to 1762 and was derived from Hindi ( ), ( ) is the imperative of ( ), \\"to smear, knead the muscles, massage the head and hair\\".American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition, See Shampoo; Also see Shampoo. Hobson-Jobson (1903), University of Chicago. itself derived from the Sanskrit root (), which meant to press, knead, or soothe.Sanskrit Lexicon, University of Koeln, Germany, see ‡§ö‡§™‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø (2008).Shampoo, Etymology Dictionary (2006). History  Indian subcontinent  In the Indian subcontinent, a variety of herbs and their extracts have been used as shampoos since ancient times. A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried Indian gooseberry (amla) and a selection of other herbs, using the strained extract. Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, a tropical tree widespread in India, is called ksuna (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§£)kSuNa, Sanskrit Lexicon, Monier-Williams Dictionary (1872) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contains saponins which are a natural surfactant. The extract of soapberries creates a lather which Indian texts called phenaka (Sanskrit: ‡§´‡•á‡§®‡§ï).phenaka, Spoken Sanskrit, University of Koeln, Germany It leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable. Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), hibiscus flowers,Rahman, , Oxford University Press, , page 145 ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara). Guru Nanak, the founder and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to soapberry tree and soap in the 16th century.Khushwant Singh, Hymns of Guru Nanak, Orient Longman, Cleansing with hair and body massage (champu) during one's daily bath was an indulgence of early colonial traders in India. When they returned to Europe, they introduced the newly learned habits, including the hair treatment they called shampoo.Virginia Smith (2007), Clean: A History of Personal Hygiene and Purity, Oxford University Press, Europe Swedish advertisement for toiletries, 1905/1906 Sake Dean Mahomed, an Indian traveller, surgeon, and entrepreneur, is credited with introducing the practice of champooi or \\"shampooing\\" to Britain. In 1814, Mahomed, with his Irish wife Jane Daly, opened the first commercial \\"shampooing\\" vapour masseur bath in England, in Brighton. He described the treatment in a local paper as \\"The Indian Medicated Vapour Bath (type of Turkish bath), a cure to many diseases and giving full relief when everything fails; particularly Rheumatic and paralytic, gout, stiff joints, old sprains, lame legs, aches and pains in the joints\\". During the early stages of shampoo in Europe, English hair stylists boiled shaved soap in water and added herbs to give the hair shine and fragrance. Commercially made shampoo was available from the turn of the 20th century. A 1914 advertisement for Canthrox Shampoo in American Magazine showed young women at camp washing their hair with Canthrox in a lake; magazine advertisements in 1914 by Rexall featured Harmony Hair Beautifier and Shampoo.Victoria Sherrow, Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history, 2006 s.v. \\"Advertising\\" p. 7. In 1927, liquid shampoo was invented by German inventor Hans Schwarzkopf in Berlin, whose name created a shampoo brand sold in Europe. Originally, soap and shampoo were very similar products; both containing the same naturally derived surfactants, a type of detergent. Modern shampoo as it is known today was first introduced in the 1930s with Drene, the first shampoo using synthetic surfactants instead of soap. Shampoo is also more beneficial for the hair roots. Indonesia Early shampoos used in Indonesia were made from the husk and straw (merang) of rice. The husks and straws were burned into ash, and the ashes (which have alkaline properties) are mixed with water to form lather. The ashes and lather were scrubbed into the hair and rinsed out, leaving the hair clean, but very dry. Afterwards, coconut oil was applied to the hair in order to moisturize it. Pre-Columbian North America Certain Native American tribes used extracts from North American plants as hair shampoo; for example the Costanoans of present-day coastal California used extracts from the coastal woodfern, Dryopteris expansa,C. Michael Hogan. 2008. Coastal Woodfern (Dryopteris arguta), GlobalTwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg Pre-Columbian South America Before quinoa can be eaten the saponin must be washed out from the grain prior to cooking. Pre-Columbian Andean civilizations used this soapy by-product as a shampoo. Composition Typical liquid shampoo Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water to form a thick, viscous liquid. Other essential ingredients include salt (sodium chloride), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrance.Robbins, Clarence R., Chemical and physical behavior of human hair, 4th ed (Springer Verlag: New York) 2002. Other ingredients are generally included in shampoo formulations to maximize the following qualities: * pleasing foam * ease of rinsing * minimal skin and eye irritation * thick or creamy feeling * pleasant fragrance * low toxicity * good biodegradability * slight acidity (pH less than 7) * no damage to hair * repair of damage already done to hair Many shampoos are pearlescent. This effect is achieved by the addition of tiny flakes of suitable materials, e.g. glycol distearate, chemically derived from stearic acid, which may have either animal or vegetable origins. Glycol distearate is a wax. Many shampoos also include silicone to provide conditioning benefits. Commonly used ingredients * Ammonium chloride * Ammonium lauryl sulfate * Glycol * Sodium laureth sulfate is derived from coconut oils and is used to soften water and create a lather. There was some concern over this particular ingredient circa 1998 as evidence suggested it might be a carcinogen, and this has yet to be disproved, as many sources still describe it as irritating to the hair and scalp. * Sodium lauryl sulfate * Sodium lauroamphoacetate is naturally derived from coconut oils and is used as a cleanser and counter-irritant. This is the ingredient that makes the product tear-free. * Polysorbate 20 (abbreviated as PEG(20)) is a mild glycol-based surfactant that is used to solubilize fragrance oils and essential oils, meaning it causes liquid to spread across and penetrate the surface of a solid (i.e. hair). * Polysorbate 80 (abbreviated as PEG(80)) is a glycol used to emulsify (or disperse) oils in water (so the oils do not float on top like Italian salad dressing). * PEG-150 distearate is a simple thickener. * Citric acid is produced biochemically and is used as an antioxidant to preserve the oils in the product. While it is a severe eye-irritant, the sodium lauroamphoacetate counteracts that property. Citric acid is used to adjust the pH down to approximately 5.5. It is a fairly weak acid which makes the adjustment easier. Shampoos usually are at pH 5.5 because at slightly acidic pH, the scales on a hair follicle lie flat, making the hair feel smooth and look shiny. It also has a small amount of preservative action. Citric acid, as opposed to any other acid, will prevent bacterial growth. * Quaternium-15 is used as a bacterial and fungicidal preservative. * Polyquaternium-10 has nothing to do with the chemical quaternium-15; it acts as the conditioning ingredient, providing moisture and fullness to the hair. * Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate is a water-dispersible emollient that forms clear solutions with surfactant systems * Methylisothiazolinone, or MIT, is a powerful biocide and preservative. Benefit claims regarding ingredients In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container. The government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit. Shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors, helping to enforce these regulations. While the claims may be substantiated, however, the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward. For example, many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to ultraviolet radiation. While the ingredient responsible for this protection does block UV, it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective. The North American Hair Research Society has a program to certify functional claims based on third-party testing. Shampoos made for treating medical conditions such as dandruff or itchy scalp are regulated as OTC drugs in the US marketplace. In the European Union, there is a requirement for the anti-dandruff claim to be substantiated as with any other advertising claim, but it is not considered to be a medical problem. Health risks A number of contact allergens are used as ingredients in shampoos, and contact allergy caused by shampoos is well known. Patch testing can identify ingredients to which patients are allergic, after which a physician can help the patient find a shampoo that is free of the ingredient to which they are allergic. The US bans 11 ingredients from shampoos, Canada bans 587, and the EU bans 1328. Specialized shampoos Dandruff Cosmetic companies have developed shampoos specifically for those who have dandruff. These contain fungicides such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione and selenium disulfide, which reduce loose dander by killing fungi like Malassezia furfur. Coal tar and salicylate derivatives are often used as well. Alternatives to medicated shampoos are available for people who wish to avoid synthetic fungicides. Such shampoos often use tea tree oil, essential oils or herbal extracts. Colored hair Many companies have also developed color- protection shampoos suitable for colored hair; some of these shampoos contain gentle cleansers according to their manufacturers. Baby Shampoo for infants and young children is formulated so that it is less irritating and usually less prone to produce a stinging or burning sensation if it were to get into the eyes. For example, Johnson's Baby Shampoo advertises under the premise of \\"No More Tears\\". This is accomplished by one or more of the following formulation strategies. # dilution, in case the product comes in contact with eyes after running off the top of the head with minimal further dilution # adjusting pH to that of non-stress tears, approximately 7, which may be a higher pH than that of shampoos which are pH adjusted for skin or hair effects, and lower than that of shampoo made of soap # use of surfactants which, alone or in combination, are less irritating than those used in other shampoos (e.g. Sodium lauroamphoacetate) # use of nonionic surfactants of the form of polyethoxylated synthetic glycolipids and polyethoxylated synthetic monoglycerides, which counteract the eye sting of other surfactants without producing the anesthetizing effect of alkyl polyethoxylates or alkylphenol polyethoxylates The distinction in 4 above does not completely surmount the controversy over the use of shampoo ingredients to mitigate eye sting produced by other ingredients, or the use of the products so formulated. The considerations in 3 and 4 frequently result in a much greater multiplicity of surfactants being used in individual baby shampoos than in other shampoos, and the detergency or foaming of such products may be compromised thereby. The monoanionic sulfonated surfactants and viscosity-increasing or foam stabilizing alkanolamides seen so frequently in other shampoos are much less common in the better baby shampoos. Sulfate-free Shampoos Sulfate-free shampoos are composed of natural ingredients and free from both the sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium Laureth sulfate. The purpose of these sulfates is to create a lathering effect to remove oil and dirt from your hair. If your shampoo easily makes a lather in the shower, there's a good chance it contains sulfates. Sulfate-free shampoos make little to no lather. Animal Shampoo intended for animals may contain insecticides or other medications for treatment of skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special care must be taken not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues. Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended to do more than just clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas. The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused. Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations. Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats). Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur. Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet. Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs. Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos. Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats. Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity. Solid Solid shampoos or shampoo bars use as their surfactants soaps or other surfactants formulated as solids. They have the advantage of being spill-proof. They are easy to apply; one may simply rub the bar over wet hair, and work the soaped hair into a low lather. Jelly and gel Stiff, non-pourable clear gels to be squeezed from a tube were once popular forms of shampoo, and can be produced by increasing a shampoo's viscosity. This type of shampoo cannot be spilled, but unlike a solid, it can still be lost down the drain by sliding off wet skin or hair. Paste and cream Shampoos in the form of pastes or creams were formerly marketed in jars or tubes. The contents were wet but not completely dissolved. They would apply faster than solids and dissolve quickly. Antibacterial s are often used in veterinary medicine for various conditions, as well as in humans before some surgical procedures.  No Poo Movement  Closely associated with environmentalism, the \\"no poo\\" movement consists of people rejecting the societal norm of frequent shampoo use. Some adherents of the no poo movement use baking soda or vinegar to wash their hair, while others use diluted honey. Other people use nothing, rinsing their hair only with conditioner. Theory In the 1970s, ads featuring Farrah Fawcett and Christie Brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week. This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing. Using shampoo every day removes sebum, the oil produced by the scalp. This causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing. According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp. Although this approach might seem unappealing to some individuals, many people try alternate shampooing techniques like baking soda and vinegar in order to avoid ingredients used in many shampoos that make hair greasy over time. There is no known mechanism in the body that allows the sebaceous glands to detect oil on the scalp and react accordingly, as such these claims are unsupported by current science.

Although the word thoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. Thoroughbreds are considered \\"hot-blooded\\" horses that are known for their agility, speed, and spirit. The Thoroughbred as it is known today was developed in 17th- and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th and 18th centuries, and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, and around 100,000 foals are registered each year worldwide. Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing, but are also bred for other riding disciplines such as show jumping, combined training, dressage, polo, and fox hunting. They are also commonly crossbred to create new breeds or to improve existing ones, and have been influential in the creation of the Quarter Horse, Standardbred, Anglo-Arabian, and various warmblood breeds. Thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion, which has resulted in high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs. Other health concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof-to- body-mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and research is ongoing. Breed characteristics alt=Brown horse looking out over a railing. The head is sideways to the camera and the horse is looking into the distance. The typical Thoroughbred ranges from high, averaging . They are most often bay, dark bay or brown, chestnut, black, or gray.Patten Light Horse Breeds pp. 191‚Äì195 Less common colors recognized in the United States include roan and palomino. White is very rare, but is a recognized color separate from gray. The face and lower legs may be marked with white,Bongianni Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies section 12 but white will generally not appear on the body. Coat patterns that have more than one color on the body, such as Pinto or Appaloosa, are not recognized by mainstream breed registries. Good-quality Thoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head on a long neck, high withers, a deep chest, a short back, good depth of hindquarters, a lean body, and long legs.Montgomery The Thoroughbred pp. 338‚Äì354 Thoroughbreds are classified among the \\"hot-blooded\\" breeds, which are animals bred for agility and speed and are generally considered spirited and bold.Henry All About Horses, pp. 60, 66. Thoroughbreds born in the Northern Hemisphere are officially considered a year older on the first of January each year; those born in the Southern Hemisphere officially are one year older on the first of August. These artificial dates have been set to enable the standardization of races and other competitions for horses in certain age groups.Phifer Track Talk p. 38 Terminology The Thoroughbred is a distinct breed of horse, although people sometimes refer to a purebred horse of any breed as a thoroughbred. The term for any horse or other animal derived from a single breed line is purebred.Merriam-Webster The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage p. 905 While the term probably came into general use because the English Thoroughbred's General Stud Book was one of the first breed registries created, in modern usage horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any animal as a thoroughbred except for horses belonging to the Thoroughbred breed. Nonetheless, breeders of other species of purebred animals may use the two terms interchangeably, though thoroughbred is less often used for describing purebred animals of other species. The term is a proper noun referring to this specific breed, though often not capitalized, especially in non-specialist publications, and outside the US. For example, the Australian Stud Book, The New York Times, and the BBC do not capitalize the word. History foundation sires of the Thoroughbredalt=Painting of a brown horse walking behind a man in a blue seventeenth century outfit. Beginnings in England =Early racing= Flat racing existed in England by at least 1174, when four-mile races took place at Smithfield, in London. Racing continued at fairs and markets throughout the Middle Ages and into the reign of King James I of England. It was then that handicapping, a system of adding weight to attempt to equalize a horse's chances of winning as well as improved training procedures, began to be used. During the reigns of Charles II, William III, Anne, and George I, the foundation of the Thoroughbred was laid. The term \\"thro-bred\\" to describe horses was first used in 1713.Barrett Daily Telegraph Chronicle of Horse Racing p. 9 Under Charles II, a keen racegoer and owner, and Anne, royal support was given to racing and the breeding of race horses. With royal support, horse racing became popular with the public, and by 1727, a newspaper devoted to racing, the Racing Calendar, was founded. Devoted exclusively to the sport, it recorded race results and advertised upcoming meets.Wall Famous Running Horses pp. 7‚Äì8 =Foundation stallions= All modern Thoroughbreds trace back to three stallions imported into England from the Middle East in the late 17th and early 18th centuries: the Byerley Turk (1680s), the Darley Arabian (1704), and the Godolphin Arabian (1729).Milner The Godolphin Arabian pp. 3‚Äì6Wall Famous Running Horses p. 8 Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential, but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed. These included the Alcock's Arabian,Willett The Thoroughbred p. 25 D'Arcy's White Turk, Leedes Arabian, and Curwen's Bay Barb.Phifer Track Talk p. 45Morris Thoroughbred Stallions pp. 1‚Äì2 Another was the Brownlow Turk, who, among other attributes, is thought to be largely responsible for the gray coat color in Thoroughbreds. In all, about 160 stallions of Oriental breeding have been traced in the historical record as contributing to the creation of the Thoroughbred. The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines, whether Arabian, Barb, or Turk, to the native English maresWillett The Thoroughbred pp. 22-23 ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book (GSB) in 1791 and the practice of official registration of horses. According to Peter Willett, about 50% of the foundation stallions appear to have been of Arabian bloodlines, with the remainder being evenly divided between Turkoman and Barb breeding. Matchem, a grandson of the Godolphin Arabian, from a painting by alt=Painting of a standing next to two men, one of whom is holding the horse's bridle, the other is pouring water into a water trough. Each of the three major foundation sires was, coincidentally, the ancestor of a grandson or great-great-grandson who was the only male descendant to perpetuate each respective horse's male line: Matchem was the only descendant of his grandsire, the Godolphin Arabian, to maintain a male line to the present;Milner The Godolphin Arabian p. 140 the Byerley Turk's male line was preserved by Herod (or King Herod), a great-great- grandson;Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 38‚Äì39 and the male line of the Darley Arabian owes its existence to great-great-grandson Eclipse, who was the dominant racehorse of his day and never defeated.Willett The Thoroughbred p. 37 One genetic study indicates that 95% of all male Thoroughbreds trace their direct male line (via the Y chromosome) to the Darley Arabian. However, in modern Thoroughbred pedigrees, most horses have more crosses to the Godolphin Arabian (13.8%) than to the Darley Arabian (6.5%) when all lines of descent (maternal and paternal) are considered. Further, as a percentage of contributions to current Thoroughbred bloodlines, Curwen's Bay Barb (4.2%) appears more often than the Byerley Turk (3.3%). The majority of modern Thoroughbreds alive today trace to a total of only 27 or 28 stallions from the 18th and 19th centuries. =Foundation mares= The mares used as foundation breeding stock came from a variety of breeds, some of which, such as the Irish Hobby, had developed in northern Europe prior to the 13th century.Erigero \\"Who's Your Momma III\\" Animal Genetics Other mares were of oriental breeding, including Barb, Turk and other bloodlines,Erigero \\"Who's Your Momma II\\" Animal Genetics although most researchers conclude that the number of Eastern mares imported into England during the 100 years after 1660 was small. The 19th- century researcher Bruce Lowe identified 50 mare \\"families\\" in the Thoroughbred breed, later augmented by other researchers to 74.Erigero \\"New Research Sheds Light on Old Pedigrees\\" Animal Genetics However, it is probable that fewer genetically unique mare lines existed than Lowe identified. Recent studies of the mtDNA of Thoroughbred mares indicate that some of the mare lines thought to be genetically distinct may actually have had a common ancestor; in 19 mare lines studied, the haplotypes revealed that they traced to only 15 unique foundation mares, suggesting either a common ancestor for foundation mares thought to be unrelated or recording errors in the GSB. Later development in Britain By the end of the 18th century, the English Classic races had been established. These are the St. Leger Stakes, founded in 1776, The Oaks, founded in 1779, and The Derby in 1780. Later, the 2,000 Guineas Stakes and the 1,000 Guineas Stakes were founded in 1809 and 1814. The 1,000 Guineas and the Oaks are restricted to fillies, but the others are open to racehorses of either sex aged three years. The distances of these races, ranging from to , led to a change in breeding practices, as breeders concentrated on producing horses that could race at a younger age than in the past and that had more speed. In the early 18th century, the emphasis had been on longer races, up to , that were run in multiple heats. The older style of race favored older horses, but with the change in distances, younger horses became preferred.Willett The Classic Racehorse pp. 34‚Äì36 Selective breeding for speed and racing ability led to improvements in the size of horses and winning times by the middle of the 19th century. Bay Middleton, a winner of the Epsom Derby, stood over 16 hands high, a full hand higher than the Darley Arabian. Winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional Arabian bloodlines was impossible. This was borne out in 1885, when a race was held between a Thoroughbred, Iambic, considered a mid-grade runner, and the best Arabian of the time, Asil. The race was over , and although Iambic was handicapped by carrying more than Asil, he still managed to beat Asil by 20 lengths.Willett The Classic Racehorse pp. 39‚Äì41 An aspect of the modern British breeding establishment is that they breed not only for flat racing, but also for steeplechasing.Willett The Classic Racehorse p. 57 Up until the end of the 19th century, Thoroughbreds were bred not only for racing but also as saddle horses.Derry Horses in Society p. 41 Soon after the start of the 20th century, fears that the English races would be overrun with American-bred Thoroughbreds because of the closing of US racetracks in the early 1910s, led to the Jersey Act of 1913.Willett The Classic Racehorse pp. 111‚Äì113 It prohibited the registration of any horse in the General Stud Book (GSB) if they could not show that every ancestor traced to the GSB. This excluded most American-bred horses, because the 100-year gap between the founding of the GSB and the American Stud Book meant that most American-bred horses possessed at least one or two crosses to horses not registered in the GSB. The act was not repealed until 1949, after which a horse was only required to show that all its ancestors to the ninth generation were registered in a recognized Stud Book.Willett The Classic Racehorse pp. 71‚Äì74 Many felt that the Jersey Act hampered the development of the British Thoroughbred by preventing breeders in the United Kingdom from using new bloodlines developed outside the British Isles.Willett The Classic Racehorse p. 56 In America The first Thoroughbred horse in the American Colonies was Bulle Rock, imported in 1730.Robertson History of Thoroughbred Racing in America p. 16Bruce The American Stud Book Volume 1 p. 10 Maryland and Virginia were the centers of Colonial Thoroughbred breeding, along with South Carolina and New York. During the American Revolution importations of horses from England practically stopped but were restarted after the signing of a peace treaty. Two important stallions were imported around the time of the Revolution; Messenger in 1788 and Diomed before that. Messenger left little impact on the American Thoroughbred, but is considered a foundation sire of the Standardbred breed. Diomed, who won the Derby Stakes in 1780, had a significant impact on American Thoroughbred breeding, mainly through his son Sir Archy.Montgomery The Thoroughbred pp. 131‚Äì136 John F. Wall, a racing historian, said that Sir Archy was the \\"first outstanding stallion we can claim as native American.\\"Wall Famous Running Horses pp. 114‚Äì115 He was retired from the racetrack because of lack of opponents. After the American Revolution, the center of Thoroughbred breeding and racing in the United States moved west. Kentucky and Tennessee became notable centers. Andrew Jackson, later President of the United States, was a breeder and racer of Thoroughbreds in Tennessee.Montgomery The Thoroughbred pp. 142‚Äì143 Famous match races held in the early 19th century helped popularize horse racing in the United States. One took place in 1823, in Long Island, New York, between Sir Henry and American Eclipse. Another was a match race between Boston and Fashion in 1838 that featured bets of $20,000 from each side.Montgomery The Thoroughbred pp. 143‚Äì147 The last major match races before the American Civil War were both between Lexington and Lecompte. The first was held in 1854 in New Orleans and was won by Lecompte. Lexington's owner then challenged Lecompte's owner to a rematch, held in 1855 in New Orleans and won by Lexington. Both of these horses were sons of Boston, a descendant of Sir Archy.Montgomery The Thoroughbred pp. 152‚Äì154 Lexington went on to a career as a breeding stallion, and led the sires list of number of winners for sixteen years, fourteen of them in a row.Wall Famous Running Horses p. 119 After the American Civil War, the emphasis in American racing changed from the older style of four-mile (6 km) races in which the horses ran in at least two heats. The new style of racing involved shorter races not run in heats, over distances from five furlongs up to . This development meant a change in breeding practices, as well as the age that horses were raced, with younger horses and sprinters coming to the fore. It was also after the Civil War that the American Thoroughbred returned to England to race. Iroquois became the first American-bred winner of the Epsom Derby in 1881. The success of American-bred Thoroughbreds in England led to the Jersey Act in 1913, which limited the importation of American Thoroughbreds into England.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 159‚Äì163 After World War I, the breeders in America continued to emphasize speed and early racing age but also imported horses from England, and this trend continued past World War II.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 165‚Äì171 After World War II, Thoroughbred breeding remained centered in Kentucky, but California, New York, and Florida also emerged as important racing and breeding centers.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 175‚Äì176 Thoroughbreds in the United States have historically been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds. The early import Messenger was the foundation of the Standardbred,Evans The Horse pp. 28‚Äì29 and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental in the development of the American Quarter Horse.Evans The Horse pp. 23‚Äì27 The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred.Evans The Horse p. 36 Between World War I and World War II, the U.S. Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their Remount Service, which was designed to improve the stock of cavalry mounts.Derry Horses in Society pp. 136‚Äì137Buecker Fort Robinson pp. 27‚Äì29 In Europe Thoroughbreds began to be imported to France in 1817 and 1818 with the importation of a number of stallions from England, but initially the sport of horse racing did not prosper in France. The first Jockey Club in France was not formed until 1833, and in 1834 the racing and regulation functions were split off to a new society, the Societe d'Encouragement pour l'Amelioration des Races de Chevaux en France, better known as the Jockey-Club de Paris.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 119‚Äì122 The French Stud Book was founded at the same time by the government.Willett The Classic Racehorse p. 30 By 1876, French-bred Thoroughbreds were regularly winning races in England, and in that year a French breeder-owner earned the most money in England on the track.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 125‚Äì128 World War I almost destroyed French breeding because of war damage and lack of races.Willett The Thoroughbred p.134 After the war, the premier French race, the Grand Prix, resumed and continues to this day. During World War II, French Thoroughbred breeding did not suffer as it had during the first World War, and thus was able to compete on an equal footing with other countries after the war.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 139‚Äì143 Organized racing in Italy started in 1837, when race meets were established in Florence and Naples and a meet in Milan was founded in 1842. Modern flat racing came to Rome in 1868. Later importations, including the Derby Stakes winners Ellington (1856) and Melton (1885), came to Italy before the end of the 19th century.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 180‚Äì82 Modern Thoroughbred breeding in Italy is mostly associated with the breeding program of Federico Tesio, who started his breeding program in 1898. Tesio was the breeder of Nearco, one of the dominant sires of Thoroughbreds in the later part of the 20th century.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 182‚Äì187 Other countries in Europe have Thoroughbred breeding programs, including Germany,Willett The Classic Racehorse pp. 162‚Äì169 Russia, Poland, and Hungary.Willett The Classic Racehorse pp. 202‚Äì211 In Australia and New Zealand Horses arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 along with the earliest colonists.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 202‚Äì205 Although horses of part- Thoroughbred blood were imported into Australia during the late 18th century, it is thought that the first pureblood Thoroughbred was a stallion named Northumberland who was imported from England in 1802 as a coach horse sire. By 1810, the first formal race meets were organized in Sydney, and by 1825 the first mare of proven Thoroughbred bloodlines arrived to join the Thoroughbred stallions already there. In 1825, the Sydney Turf Club, the first true racing club in Australia, was formed. Throughout the 1830s, the Australian colonies began to import Thoroughbreds, almost exclusively for racing purposes, and to improve the local stock. Each colony formed its own racing clubs and held its own races. Gradually, the individual clubs were integrated into one overarching organization, now known as the Australian Racing Board. Thoroughbreds from Australia were imported into New Zealand in the 1840s and 1850s, with the first direct importation from England occurring in 1862.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 213‚Äì215 In other areas Thoroughbreds have been exported to many other areas of the world since the breed was created. Oriental horses were imported into South Africa from the late 17th century in order to improve the local stock through crossbreeding. Horse racing was established there in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and Thoroughbreds were imported in increasing numbers. The first Thoroughbred stallions arrived in Argentina in 1853, but the first mares did not arrive until 1865. The Argentine Stud Book was first published in 1893.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 233‚Äì235 Thoroughbreds were imported into Japan from 1895, although it was not until after World War II that Japan began a serious breeding and racing business involving Thoroughbreds.Willett The Thoroughbred pp. 238‚Äì40 Registration, breeding, and population Twilight, the Thoroughbred mare who serves as the subject of the Equine Genome Project The number of Thoroughbred foals registered each year in North America varies greatly, chiefly linked to the success of the auction market which in turn depends on the state of the economy. The foal crop was over 44,000 in 1990, but declined to roughly 22,500 by 2014. The largest numbers are registered in the states of Kentucky, Florida and California. Australia is the second largest producer of Thoroughbreds in the world with almost 30,000 broodmares producing about 18,250 foals annually. Britain produces about 5,000 foals a year, and worldwide, there are more than 195,000 active broodmares, or females being used for breeding, and 118,000 newly registered foals in 2006 alone. The Thoroughbred industry is a large agribusiness, generating around $34 billion in revenue annually in the United States and providing about 470,000 jobs through a network of farms, training centers and race tracks. Unlike a significant number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping.Equine Research Breeding Management and Foal Development p. 349 The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares.Australian Stud Book: Encosta De Lago (AUS), Australian Jockey Club Limited and Victoria Racing Club Limited Retrieved 2009-1-25 By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages. Concern exists that the closed stud book and tightly regulated population of the Thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because of the level of inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population. According to one study, 78% of alleles in the current population can be traced to 30 foundation animals, 27 of which are male. Ten foundation mares account for 72% of maternal (tail- female) lineages, and, as noted above, one stallion appears in 95% of tail male lineages. Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the maternal line, called the distaff line. The line that a horse comes from is a critical factor in determining the price for a young horse.Napier Blood will tell pp. 17‚Äì18 Value Prices of Thoroughbreds vary greatly, depending on age, pedigree, conformation, and other market factors. In 2007, Keeneland Sales, a United States-based sales company, sold 9,124 horses at auction, with a total value of $814,401,000, which gives an average price of $89,259. As a whole for the United States in 2007, The Jockey Club auction statistics indicated that the average weanling sold for $44,407, the average yearling sold for $55,300, average sale price for two-year-olds was $61,843, broodmares averaged $70,150, and horses over two and broodmare prospects sold for an average of $53,243. For Europe, the July 2007 Tattersall's Sale sold 593 horses at auction, with a total for the sale of 10,951,300 guineas,Traditionally, the obsolete guinea, ¬£1.05, formerly 21 shillings, is retained as the unit of account for these sales. for an average of 18,468 guineas. Also in 2007, Doncaster Bloodstock Sales, another British sales firm, sold 2,248 horses for a total value of 43,033,881 guineas, making an average of 15,110 guineas per horse. Australian prices at auction during the 2007-2008 racing and breeding season were as follows: 1,223 Australian weanlings sold for a total of $31,352,000, an average of $25,635 each. Four thousand, nine hundred and three yearlings sold for a total value of A$372,003,961, an average of A$75,853. Five hundred two-year-olds sold for A$13,030,150, an average of A$26,060, and 2,118 broodmares totalled A$107,720,775, an average of A$50,860. Averages, however, can be deceiving. For example, at the 2007 Fall Yearling sale at Keeneland, 3,799 young horses sold for a total of $385,018,600, for an average of $101,347 per horse. However, that average sales price reflected a variation that included at least 19 horses that sold for only $1,000 each and 34 that sold for over $1,000,000 apiece. The highest price paid at auction for a Thoroughbred was set in 2006 at $16,000,000 for a two-year-old colt named The Green Monkey. Record prices at auction often grab headlines, though they do not necessarily reflect the animal's future success; in the case of The Green Monkey, injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008, and he never won a race. Conversely, even a highly successful Thoroughbred may be sold by the pound for a few hundred dollars to become horsemeat. The best-known example of this was the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, exported to Japan to stand at stud, but was ultimately slaughtered in 2002, presumably for pet food. However, the value of a Thoroughbred may also be influenced by the purse money it wins. In 2007, Thoroughbred racehorses earned a total of $1,217,854,602 in all placings, an average earnings per starter of $16,924. In addition, the track record of a race horse may influence its future value as a breeding animal. Stud fees for stallions that enter breeding can range from $2,500 to $500,000 per mare in the United States, and from ¬£2000 to ¬£75,000 or more in Britain. The record stud fee to date was set in the 1980s, when the stud fee of the late Northern Dancer reached $1 million. During the 2008 Australian breeding season seven stallions stood at a stud fee of A$110,000 or more, with the highest fee in the nation at A$302,500. Uses alt=Two horses racing along a grass racetrack, the horses are side by side with both jockeys urging the horses faster. Although the Thoroughbred is primarily bred for racing, the breed is also used for show jumping and combined training because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, dressage horses, and youth show horses. The larger horses are sought after for hunter/jumper and dressage competitions, whereas the smaller horses are in demand as polo ponies. Horse racing Thoroughbred horses are primarily bred for racing under saddle at the gallop. Thoroughbreds are often known for being either distance runners or sprinters, and their conformation usually reflects what they have been bred to do. Sprinters are usually well muscled, while stayers, or distance runners, tend to be smaller and slimmer.Phifer Track Talk p. 26 The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse. Although there have been champion racehorses of every height, from Zenyatta who stood 17.2 hands, to Man o' War and Secretariat who both stood at 16.2 hands,Montgomery The Thoroughbred pp. 183‚Äì186Bongianni Champion Horses pp. 112‚Äì113 down to Hyperion, who was only 15.1,Bongianni Champion Horses p. 56 the best racehorses are generally of average size.Hedge Horse Conformation p. 35 Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet, predisposing them to lameness.Barakat \\"Why Size Matters\\" Equus Smaller horses are considered by some to be at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them, especially in the starting gate. Historically, Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size: the average height of a Thoroughbred in 1700 was about 13.3 hands high. By 1876 this had increased to 15.3.Phifer Track Talk p. 24 In 2007, there were 71,959 horses who started in races in the United States, and the average Thoroughbred racehorse in the United States and Canada ran 6.33 times in that year. In Australia, there were 31,416 horses in training during 2007, and those horses started 194,066 times for A$375,512,579 of prize money. During 2007, in Japan, there were 23,859 horses in training and those horses started 182,614 times for A$857,446,268 of prize money. In Britain, the British Racing Authority states there were 8,556 horses in training for flat racing for 2007, and those horses started 60,081 times in 5,659 races. Statistically, fewer than 50% of all race horses ever win a race, and less than 1% ever win a stakes race such as the Kentucky Derby or The Derby. Any horse who has yet to win a race is known as a maiden. Horses finished with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions. A number of agencies exist to help make the transition from the racetrack to another career, or to help find retirement homes for ex-racehorses. Other disciplines A Thoroughbred competing in alt=A horse just taking off from the ground to jump a wooden jump. The horse's back legs are still on the ground but its two front legs are stretched forward and upward to reach over the jump. The rider is flat against the horse's neck. In addition to racing, Thoroughbreds compete in eventing, show jumping and dressage at the highest levels of international competition, including the Olympics. They are also used as show hunters, steeplechasers, and in western riding speed events such as barrel racing. Mounted police divisions employ them in non-competitive work, and recreational riders also use them. Thoroughbreds are one of the most common breeds for use in polo in the United States. They are often seen in the fox hunting field as well.Jones \\"Fox Hunting in America\\" American Heritage Magazine Crossbreeding Thoroughbreds are often crossed with horses of other breeds to create new breeds or to enhance or introduce specific qualities into existing ones. They have been influential on many modern breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, the Standardbred, and possibly the Morgan, a breed that went on to influence many of the gaited breeds in North America. Other common crosses with the Thoroughbred include crossbreeding with Arabian bloodlines to produce the Anglo-Arabian as well as with the Irish Draught to produce the Irish Sport Horse. Thoroughbreds are often crossed with various Warmblood breeds due to their refinement and performance capabilities. Health issues Although Thoroughbreds are seen in the hunter-jumper world and in other disciplines, modern Thoroughbreds are primarily bred for speed, and racehorses have a very high rate of accidents as well as other health problems. One tenth of all Thoroughbreds suffer orthopedic problems, including fractures. Current estimates indicate that there are 1.5 career-ending breakdowns for every 1,000 horses starting a race in the United States, an average of two horses per day. The state of California reported a particularly high rate of injury, 3.5 per 1000 starts.Rosenblatt \\"Barbaro's Legacy\\" Washington Post Other countries report lower rates of injury, with the United Kingdom having 0.9 injuries/1,000 starts (1990‚Äì1999) and the courses in Victoria, Australia, producing a rate of 0.44 injuries/1,000 starts (1989‚Äì2004).Oke, \\"Understanding and Preventing Catastrophic Injuries\\", The Horse, 26‚Äì36. Thoroughbreds also have other health concerns, including a majority of animals who are prone to bleeding from the lungs (exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage), 10% with low fertility, and 5% with abnormally small hearts. Thoroughbreds also tend to have smaller hooves relative to their body mass than other breeds, with thin soles and walls and a lack of cartilage mass, which contributes to foot soreness, the most common source of lameness in racehorses.Arthur Diagnosis and Management of Lameness in the Horse p. 872 Selective breeding One argument for the health issues involving Thoroughbreds suggests that inbreeding is the culprit. It has also been suggested that capability for speed is enhanced in an already swift animal by raising muscle mass, a form of selective breeding that has created animals designed to win horse races.Kluger \\"Bred for Speed...Built for Trouble\\" Time Magazine Thus, according to one postulation, the modern Thoroughbred travels faster than its skeletal structure can support.Finley \\"Sadly, No Way to Stop Deaths\\" New York Daily News Veterinarian Robert M. Miller states that \\"We have selectively bred for speeds that the anatomy of the horse cannot always cope with.\\"Miller \\"And They Call Us Horse Lovers\\" Cowboy Magazine Poor breeding may be encouraged by the fact that many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on. Excess stress A high accident rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, particularly in the United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds.Bourke \\"Fatalities on racecourses in Victoria\\" Proceedings of the 10th International Conference of Racing Analysts and Veterinarians Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury. Studies have shown that track surfaces,Oikawa \\"Effect of restructuring of a racetrack on the occurrence of racing injuries in thoroughbred horses\\" Journal of Equine Veterinary Science horseshoes with toe grabs, use of certain legal medications, and high- intensity racing schedules may also contribute to a high injury rate.Pedulla \\"Injury steps up scrutiny on Triple Crown Schedule\\" USA Today One promising trend is the development of synthetic surfaces for racetracks, and one of the first tracks to install such a surface, Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky, saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004‚Äì05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation. The material is not perfected, and some areas report problems related to winter weather, but studies are continuing. Medical challenges The level of treatment given to injured Thoroughbreds is often more intensive than for horses of lesser financial valueWalker \\"Barbaro's injury highlighted problems, medical advances\\" Baltimore Sun but also controversial, due in part to the significant challenges in treating broken bones and other major leg injuries.Grady \\"State of the Art to Save Barbaro\\" The New York Times Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life-threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems, laminitis, and other infections. If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily, there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load. While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time, a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human's \\"bed rest\\" because of the risk of developing sores, internal damage, and congestion. Whenever a racing accident severely injures a well-known horse, such as the major leg fractures that led to the euthanization of 2006 Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro, or 2008 Kentucky Derby runner-up Eight Belles, animal rights groups have denounced the Thoroughbred racing industry. On the other hand, advocates of racing argue that without horse racing, far less funding and incentives would be available for medical and biomechanical research on horses. Although horse racing is hazardous, veterinary science has advanced. Previously hopeless cases can now be treated, and earlier detection through advanced imaging techniques like scintigraphy can keep at-risk horses off the track.Mackey \\"Stress fractures of the humerus, radius and tibia in horses\\" Veterinary Radiology See also * Thoroughbred breeding theories *Glossary of North American horse racing * Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand Notes Footnotes References    which cites * which cites * which cites       External links * Jockey Club (UK) * The Jockey Club (USA) * Thoroughbred Bloodlines * Australian Stud Book * Royal Ascot Bloodline Interactive Tool Horse breeds originating in England Horse breeds Horse racing Thoroughbred horses Contexts for auctions ","title":"Thoroughbred"},{"id":"18842024","text":"Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy (born February 4, 1954) is a retired Egyptian diplomat and former Senior United Nations official .

The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in The Amazing Spider- Man #14 (cover dated July 1964) as the original and most well-known incarnation of Green Goblin. As the amoral industrialist head of Oscorp, Norman was exposed to an experimental formula which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect, but also drove him to insanity. Having endured as Spider-Man's archenemy, Osborn has been part of the superhero's defining stories as well as being the father of Harry Osborn and Gabriel Stacy, the grandfather of Normie Osborn, and the killer of Gwen Stacy, Ben Reilly and Flash Thompson. Although his primary obsession is Spider-Man, Osborn often comes into conflict with other superheroes in the Marvel Universe. As the Goblin, he adopted a Halloween-themed appearance: dressing in a goblin costume, riding on a bat-shaped \\"Goblin Glider\\", and using an arsenal of high- tech weapons, such as grenade-like \\"Pumpkin Bombs\\", to terrorize New York City. Although Osborn sometimes works with other supervillains such as Doctor Doom and Loki and groups like the Sinister Six and the Dark Avengers, these relationships often collapse due to his desire for unbridled chaos and destruction. In recent years, Osborn gained new status as a public hero as the original iteration of Iron Patriot. The character has been in various top villain lists as one of Spider-Man's greatest enemies and one of the greatest comic book villains of all time. The character's popularity has seen him appear on a variety of merchandise, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and be referenced in a number of media. He has been adapted to serve as Spider-Man's adversary in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. Willem Dafoe portrayed the character in Sam Raimi's Spider- Man film trilogy and Chris Cooper portrayed the character in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Among others, Neil Ross, Alan Rachins, Steve Blum, Steven Weber and Josh Keaton provided the character's voice throughout various animated Spider-Man series over the years. Publication history The Amazing Spider-Man #14 (July 1964), the Green Goblin's first appearance; the character originally used a turbo-fan-powered \\"flying broomstick\\". Cover art by Steve Ditko. Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko are credited with creating the character, they each collaborated with one another on how the character would be portrayed. According to Ditko: \\"Stan's synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an Egyptian-like sarcophagus. Inside was an ancient, mythological demon, the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan's mythological demon into a human villain\\". The Green Goblin debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced.Ro, Ronin. Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution, p. 107 (Bloomsbury, 2004) Lee elaborated: \\"Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then what was the point of following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader\\". However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished. Though Osborn would not be introduced by name until The Amazing Spider-Man #37, Ditko has said that a character he drew in the background of two panels in issue #23 was intended to be Osborn, seeded in advance of the reveal. This background character, a member of a businessmen's club and a friend of J. Jonah Jameson, would reappear in The Amazing Spider-Man #25, 26, and 27, and when Norman was formally introduced in issue #37, he too was stated to be a member of the club and friend of Jameson's. Ditko left the series with issue #38, just one issue after Norman Osborn was introduced as the father of Harry Osborn. The first issue without Ditko saw the Green Goblin unmasked. John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalled: In the landmark story \\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" (The Amazing Spider-Man #121-122), the Green Goblin kills Gwen Stacy and later perishes in a fight against Spider-Man. However, the story's writer, Gerry Conway, had Harry Osborn adopt the Green Goblin identity in the aftermath of \\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\", later remarking that \\"I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept\\". Harry Osborn's becoming the Green Goblin was mostly well-received, with fans remarking that Harry was more menacing than his father had ever been. Writer Roger Stern later introduced the Hobgoblin to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy. Return During the \\"Clone Saga\\", a retcon was made, which determined that Norman Osborn survived the events of The Amazing Spider-Man #122, and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man's adventures since then. During the \\"Clone Saga\\", the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter Parker with his clone Ben Reilly as the true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to use Mephisto, but they felt a more down-to- earth character was needed.Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed 174, Comics Should be Good Comic Book Resources, September 25, 2008 It was then suggested that the semi-zombified cyborg \\"Gaunt\\" be revealed as Harry Osborn (who was killed in The Spectacular Spider-Man #200). Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter into thinking he was a clone, and assuming his father's Green Goblin identity. However, this narrative was rejected by newly- promoted editor in chief Bob Harras, and eventually Norman was chosen to be the mastermind. Following the Clone Saga, Green Goblin re-established himself as a supervillain and Spider-Man's nemesis, serving as the main antagonist of several arcs thereafter. Osborn returns in Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 and is blown up at the end of the issue. It is shown in Spectacular Spider-Man #250 that he has recovered, and he returns to his civilian life. Without the Green Goblin identity, Osborn would then go on to attack Spider-Man indirectly, through minions and via smear campaigns designed to portray him as a monster. However, Norman would still wear his Green Goblin costume when needed to. New roles When Spider-Man revealed his public identity, Osborn is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in Paris. Following the Civil War story arc, Warren Ellis began writing Thunderbolts,Ellis Gets Thunderstruck: Brevoort talks \\"Thunderbolts\\", Comic Book Resources, October 6, 2006 and Osborn was brought into this title as the director of the eponymous team. He was one of several characters offered to Ellis, who picked him because, according to Thunderbolts editor Molly Lazer, \\"[t]here was something about Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he's in the book!\\"Better Know a Thunderbolt: Green Goblin , Newsarama, December 21, 2006 Ellis admitted not being very familiar with the character, saying: \\"All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... [Joe Quesada] talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing\\". Lazer confirmed that the new team was answerable to the Commission on Superhuman Activities, giving him the opportunity to do what he wanted: \\"He's a free man with a lot of power .... And his agenda, well, it's not that secret. He wants to get Spider-Man\\".NUTS AND T-BOLTS: Lazer talks \\"Thunderbolts\\", Comic Book Resources, June 22, 2007 Writer Christos Gage took over for the Secret Invasion tie-in stories,Christos Gage: Taking The Thunderbolts Through The Invasion , Newsarama, March 25, 2008Monsters and Marvels: Gage Talks \\"Thunderbolts\\", Comic Book Resources, April 25, 2008 which end with Osborn taking credit for the defeat of the Skrulls after he kills the Skrull queen Veranke. This allowed the character to be placed into an influential position in the aftermath of Dark Reign. Although the dark turn at the end was always part of the plan for the storyline, Brian Michael Bendis, Secret Invasion's writer, says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis.Brian Bendis ‚Äì Wrapping it All Up & Starting Dark Reign, Newsarama, December 5, 2008THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers, Comic Book Resources, January 22, 2008 Meanwhile, Andy Diggle took over the writing of Thunderbolts.SDCC '08 ‚Äì Writer Andy Diggle Takes on the T-Bolts, Newsarama, July 26, 2008. He introduced new characters to serve as Osborn's black ops team, explaining: He appeared as a regular character in the Dark Avengers series from issue #1 (March 2009) through issue #16 (June 2010),\\"The Osborn Supremacy: Dark Avengers\\", Comic Book Resources, January 22, 2008 as well as the mini-series \\"Siege\\", which saw Norman being arrested for his crimes, following the events of the Civil War storyline. The first was \\"Brand New Ways To Die\\" which featured Norman and the Thunderbolts versus Spider-Man and the original Venom. His second appearance explained that following Mephisto's alteration of Spider-Man's past, Norman's return was significantly altered. He had returned earlier than he had originally, and, due to concern for his son's mental wellbeing after once again being the Green Goblin, had arranged for Harry's death to be faked, with help from Mysterio. In his final appearance in the storyline, Norman attempts to convince Harry to become a super-hero so that Norman can kill his son off and exploit said demise. It is also revealed that he was sleeping with the supervillain Menace (Harry's ex-girlfriend), with Norman believing that the villain's child she was carrying was his. A five issue mini-series followed, written by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Emma Rios. The mini-series would lead into a dual storyline running in the pages of New Avengers #17‚Äì24 and Avengers #18‚Äì24, in which the character formed a new version of the Dark Avengers and ultimately garnered new powers, having turned himself into a Super-Adaptoid. Fictional character biography Early life Norman was born in New Haven, Connecticut as the son of wealthy industrialist Amberson Osborn. Amberson, a brilliant student in the fields of science, became an alcoholic after losing control of a manufacturing company and fortune, and became physically abusive toward the family. Norman quickly came to despise his father, resolving to be a better breadwinner while developing early homicidal tendencies as a means of relieving the stress of his father's abuse. In college, where he studied chemistry, business administration, and electrical engineering, Norman meets his college sweetheart, eventually getting married and have their son Harold \\"Harry\\" Osborn. In his adulthood, with the help of his college professor Mendel Stromm, he co-founds the chemical company Oscorp Industries and establishes himself as CEO and President. The company was hugely successful, and Norman re-gained the wealth that he had lost during his childhood. However, his wife becomes ill and dies when Harry is barely a year old, the stress of which pushes Norman to work harder, leading him to emotionally neglect Harry. Hoping to gain more control of Oscorp Industries, Osborn accused Stromm of embezzlement and has his partner arrested and shares in his company sold to him. Searching his former mentor's possessions, Norman discovers an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula, but in attempting to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities as intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into self-destructive insanity, just like his father from years ago. The original Green Goblin Norman Osborn as Green Goblin on the cover of Secret Invasion: Dark Reign vol. 1 #1 (December 2008). Art by Bryan Hitch. Norman adopts the Green Goblin identity with the goal of being the leader of organized crime in New York City, and intends to cement his position by defeating Spider-Man. Acting on his own as the Goblin, or through his employment of other super-criminals such as the Headsman, he would harass Spider-Man many times, but fail to achieve his goal. Soon, Stromm returns from prison, and attempts to exact revenge on Osborn using an army of robots, but Norman is saved by Spider-Man, and Stromm apparently dies of a heart attack. In order to discover his nemesis's secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero's spider- senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is Peter Parker, a college student and his son's classmate and friend. While Parker is going about civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks Parker out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking the youth to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became the Goblin, and uses the time to break free. In the ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of electrical wires, wiping out his memory. Feeling sorry for his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (especially Parker's best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory while helping to defeat the Goblin. Soon, Osborn is troubled by repressed memories of the Goblin and Spider-Man. After a presentation on supervillains by NYPD Captain George Stacy restores Osborn's memory, he experiences a brief return to his Goblin persona. While abducting Parker's friends and threatening Parker's elderly aunt, he is exposed to one of his own \\"psychedelic bombs\\", causing a relapse of amnesia. Later, Osborn stumbles upon an old Goblin hideout which, again, restores his memory. However, the shock of seeing Harry hospitalized, overdosed on drugs, causes Osborn's amnesia to return once more. After the final restoration of his memories, the Goblin kidnaps and takes Gwen Stacy to a bridge.Saffel, p. 65, states, \\"In the battle that followed atop the Brooklyn Bridge (or was it the George Washington Bridge?)....\\" On page 66, Saffel reprints the panel of The Amazing Spider-Man #121, page 18, in which Spider-Man exclaims, \\"The George Washington Bridge! It figures Osborn would pick something named after his favorite president. He's got the same sort of hangup for dollar bills!\\" Saffel states, \\"The span portrayed...is the GW's more famous cousin, the Brooklyn Bridge. ... To address the contradiction in future reprints of the tale, though, Spider-Man's dialogue was altered so that he's referring to the Brooklyn Bridge. But the original snafu remains as one of the more visible errors in the history of comics\\".Sanderson, Marvel Universe, p. 84, notes, \\"[W]hile the script described the site of Gwen's demise as the George Washington Bridge, the art depicted the Brooklyn Bridge, and there is still no agreement as to where it actually took place\\". During Spider-Man's rescue attempt, Osborn knocks Gwen off the bridge, resulting in the girl's death. Spider-Man, traumatised and obsessed with revenge, tracks the Goblin to his hideout, and in the ensuing battle, Osborn is impaled by his own goblin glider. Return While Osborn lies in the morgue, it is revealed that the Goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown healing factor which restores him to life; in the process of sneaking out, he kills someone with a similar physique to himself to feign his death. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed (later revealed he was in France for some time). During this time abroad, believed dead by the general public, he orchestrates several plots, including replacing May Parker with a genetically altered actress,Amazing Spider-Man #400 (1995) and The \\"Final Chapter\\" storyline in; Sensational Spider-Man #32‚Äì33, Amazing Spider-Man #440‚Äì441, Spider-Man #97‚Äì98 and Spectacular Spider- Man #262‚Äì263 (1998).

Marvel Comics. prior to the timeline change, Harry's corpse, at one point, was exhumed and tested.Spider- Man: Legacy of Evil #1 (June 1996). Marvel Comics. Most significantly, however, he utilizes his fortune to build a vast network of criminals, spies, dupes and co-conspirators to help engineer what would be an almost impossibly complex and meticulously planned plot to destroy Spider-Man's life. To achieve this, he's the leader of the Scrier cabal, taking as his pawns Seward Trainer, Judas Traveller, the Jackal and the cyborg Gaunt, all of whom he utilizes to carry out revenge against Parker. It is this group of individuals who are crucial in duping Parker into believing that the youth is actually a clone of himself created by Jackal,Goletz, Andrew, and Glenn Greenberg. while claiming that the clone ‚Äì who comes to be known as Ben Reilly ‚Äì is actually the original. Frustrated by Parker's perseverance despite everything that's been inflicted, Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on Halloween. During the battle that ensues between the two, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker from Osborn (and immediately deteriorates upon death as all of the Jackal's clones do), Parker discovers of actually being the original. During this same period, Osborn was also responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter & Mary Jane's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently caused the stillbirth of the baby. Returning to his former seat of power, Osborn regains control of his business and also buys out the Daily Bugle, humiliating former friend and societal peer J. Jonah Jameson as the latter no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments Ben Urich and demands a retraction over an expos√© of his time as the Goblin, providing faked evidence that he never was the supervillain, despite Urich's extensive research. However, he saves his most sadistic treatment for Peter, acting not only as a constant reminder of all the pain he's inflicted on his nemesis over the years, but a looming threat that could strike at any time. This build-up of pressure eventually makes Spider-Man snap by savagely beating the civilian and non-resistant Osborn in front of the latter's CCTV, which, combined with Osborn convincing the Trapster to frame Spider-Man for murder, results in Spider-Man being a fugitive again. To get around this, Peter adopts four new identities, using two of these identities to convince Trapster to expose Osborn's scheme, and provide fake evidence that the individual that beat up Osborn was an impostor. For a time, Osborn retires his costumed persona and uses a stand-in so as not to be suspected of being the Green Goblin. This fifth Goblin kidnaps Norman's grandson and clashes with the wanted and injured Spider-Man. Norman also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley and initiates a hostile takeover of Kingsley's corporate empire, in retaliation for raiding the Goblin's arsenal and identity.Spectacular Spider-Man #259-263 (1998) While his stand-in is masquerading as the Goblin, Osborn joins a cult, hoping to receive great power from the 'Gathering of Five', which will grant the participants Power, Knowledge, Immortality, Madness or Death, but while he believes that he will receive Power, he is instead given Madness, which worsens his already mental instability, and threatens the world with genetic bombs. It is during this time that Peter learns May is alive and Osborn's actress died in May's place. Osborn's complete madness is evident, as he hallucinates unmasking and killing Peter; yet in reality Peter easily defeats him. He is rescued from custody thereafter by his cabal of henchmen.The \\"Final Chapter\\" storyline in; Sensational Spider-Man #32‚Äì33, Amazing Spider-Man #440‚Äì441, Spider-Man #97‚Äì98 and Spectacular Spider-Man #262‚Äì263 (1998).

He comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture, but ultimately fails.Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin #1‚Äì3, Amazing Spider-Man #466, Peter Parker: Spider-Man vol. 2, #25 (2000). Marvel Comics. Osborn's next plan involves using Flash Thompson drive drunk a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, the emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn of being tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.Peter Parker: Spider-Man vol. 2, #44‚Äì47 (2002). Marvel Comics. Osborn's Goblin identity is revealed to the public once again through an investigation by Jessica Jones, after Osborn murders one of the reporters from the Daily Bugle. After a battle with Spider- Man and Luke Cage, Osborn is arrested and sent to prison for the first time. However, things were far from over. From behind bars, Osborn again masterminded a plan against Spider-Man. This time, he has MacDonald \\"Mac\\" Gargan as Scorpion kidnap May. The plan was for Spider-Man to break Osborn out of prison in exchange for Parker's aunt's life. Peter reluctantly agreed and with the help of the Black Cat proceeded to break Osborn out, only to have twelve of his greatest enemies waiting on the outside. Osborn had assembled a team of supervillains. However, Mary Jane Watson had contacted S.H.I.E.L.D., and the villains were faced not only by Spider-Man, but the combined might of Captain America, Iron Man, Yellowjacket, Daredevil and the Fantastic Four. During the fracas, the Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane, taking Peter's love interest to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay the murder of the last love interest. However, Doctor Octopus intervenes, attacking the Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after a bolt of lightning sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden May, and rescues the latter as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving to a different residence.Marvel Knights Spider-Man #1‚Äì12 (2004-2005). Marvel Comics. Years after Gwen's death, it is revealed that Osborn had a one-night stand with Gwen after being overwhelmed by his charisma, which led to Gwen's pregnancy with his illegitimate twin children. Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent Gwen from talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself, thus being his ideal heirs. Mary Jane was the only person who knew of their encounter and their children's existence prior to Gwen's death, despising Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before discovering he's the villainous Goblin. Gabriel and Sarah (who rapidly aged to adulthood years because of the Goblin formula in their genes) return to attack Peter as Osborn has the twins believe that Peter is the twins' father who abandoned the two and responsible for Gwen's death to which Peter learned the details of Gwen's past with Osborn and the twins from Mary Jane. Peter is able to convince Sarah of Osborn's villainy, the truth of Sarah's paternity and circumstances of Gwen's death, and stabilized the Goblin physiology with a blood transfusion due to Peter's blood type matching Sarah's. Meanwhile, Gabriel personally learns the truth of his relation to Osborn after watching a video message at one of the Goblin lairs, aligning with his father to stabilize his own condition using a variation of the Goblin formula at the cost of sanity.The Amazing Spider-Man #509-514 (August 2004 ‚Äì January 2005).

Marvel Comics. In the end, Spider-Man manages to evade this coordinated attack and escape. During the \\"Secret Invasion\\" by shape-shifting extra-terrestrials, the Skrulls, Osborn shoots and kills the Skrull queen Veranke. He leverages this widely publicized success, positioning himself as the new director of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-like paramilitary force H.A.M.M.E.R. to advance his agenda, while using his public image to start his own Dark Avengers, substituting Moonstone for Ms. Marvel, Bullseye for Hawkeye, Gargan for Spider-Man, Daken for Wolverine and Noh-Varr for Captain Marvel, as well as manipulating Ares and the Sentry into helping to further his cause. Osborn himself leads the Dark Avengers as the Iron Patriot, a suit of armor fashioned by himself after Iron Man's armor with Captain America's colors. Osborn simultaneously forms the Cabal alliance with Doctor Doom, Emma Frost, Namor, Loki and the Hood, but this 'alliance' quickly falls apart when Namor and Frost betray the Cabal to aid the X-Men. Norman's attempts to exert his authority are increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes. After the Superhuman Registration Act records are deleted so that Osborn has no access to the information recorded about heroes after it was implemented, Osborn attacked the brain-damaged Tony Stark, thus showing Osborn brutally assaulting a physically and mentally incapable individual that was not even attempting to strike back. After the New Avengers are forced to allow Osborn to capture Cage when needing medical treatment, the team uses a tracking device Osborn had planted in Luke to trick him into blowing up his own house after rescuing Cage from Osborn's custody. Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the Dark Avengers. Norman welcomes Harry into Avengers Tower, wanting to make his son into the American Son. When Harry finds a cure for Lily Hollister's Goblin condition for their baby's safety, Lily reveals that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking the American Son armor, whom Norman had plotted would die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and his Dark Avengers. When Lily also reveals that the baby is not Harry's but in fact Norman's, Harry dons his American Son armor, and fights Norman in his Iron Patriot armor. During the battle, Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son, and that he has bred a better child to replace the 'failure' of Harry. After further taunts from Norman, Harry lashes out and defeats his father, declaring \\"I was never your son!\\". When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man says to decapitate him, since Norman's healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to \\"become the son Norman always wanted\\". Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever. At Loki's suggestion, Osborn creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming the world (which was, at the time, positioned at the outskirts of Broxton, Oklahoma) poses a national security threat, by sending the U-Foes to attack Volstagg in Chicago, leading to the destruction of Soldier Field. During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Sentry causes Thor's world to fall to Earth. Osborn fights with the recently-resurrected Steve Rogers, however, Stark removes Osborn's Iron Patriot armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams that the Avengers do not know what they have done, only for Spider-Man to knock him down. He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released.Bendis, Brian Michael. Siege #1-4. Marvel Comics. Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary, he blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world. When transferred to a secret underwater government base, Osborn takes steps to ensure his release from prison. He uses a group of followers known as the \\"Green Goblin Cult\\" to break out with the aid of corrupt senators; he plans to turn himself in after killing his fellow escapees, setting him up as a 'champion' of the judicial system.Osborn #1-#5. Marvel Comics. After the breakout, he awaits his trial in a new prison, this one controlled by his cult members. Using his staged persona as a voice for the 'disenfranchised', Osborn plans to regain the Iron Patriot armor and creates a new team of Dark Avengers, this time substituting June Covington for Scarlet Witch, Ai Apaec for Spider-Man, Barney Barton for Hawkeye, Skaar for Hulk, Superia for Ms. Marvel, Gorgon for Wolverine and the A.I.M.-rebuilt Ragnarok for Thor. In the team's first fight with the New Avengers, Osborn reveals himself as the Super-Adaptoid, declares himself the head of world security, and orders that the Avengers be arrested for war crimes. However, double agent Skaar betrays Osborn, allowing the Avengers to dogpile Osborn's body, overloading him with superpowers and sending him into a coma. A.I.M. and HYDRA pick up Osborn's leftover resources, and H.A.M.M.E.R. is disbanded.New Avengers vol. 2 #20-24, Avengers vol.4 #22 After the Hobgoblin returns to New York, a nurse and doctor are called to Norman's hospital room, only to find him gone. The Goblin King When the children that work for the Vulture are discussing what to do after Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) brutally defeats the Vulture, the Green Goblin approaches and tells the group that he will be the one that crushes Superior Spider-Man. The Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl, and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider- Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals). As he builds this army to attack Superior Spider-Man, he takes on the new alias of the Goblin King. The Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive at the sewers and join up with the Goblin Nation. The group reveals in the news that, thanks to Superior Spider-Man's assault, Osborn now owns over half of New York's organized crime. He claims he now owns New York City as the Goblin Kingpin of Crime. With Menace's help, Osborn later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport and upgrades Urich's Goblin armor and weapons, asking in return only that Urich's only identity from here on shall be Goblin Knight. Osborn trains Goblin Knight, anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. Osborn later poses as the Hobgoblin and is sighted by some of the Spiderlings. Upon Carlie Cooper being brought to his lair by Menace, he receives Carlie's journal from Menace which reveals to him that Otto's mind is in Spider-Man's body. Osborn douses Carlie with the Goblin formula, causing the woman to mutate into the new superhuman villain Monster. He demands to know Spider-Man's identity, but Monster first asks the Goblin to reveal his own identity. He assures Monster that he is Norman, but refuses to remove his Goblin mask until Carlie has proven a loyal follower and dispatches Monster and Menace on a mission. Osborn battles and kills Hobgoblin, although it is revealed to be a servant with Kingsley still in hiding abroad which Goblin Knight discovers. Having staged a coup of New York after spreading his resources by exploiting Otto's reliance on technology, Osborn directly confronts Superior Spider-Man, angry that he was cheated out of the opportunity to defeat his enemy, but offering Otto the chance to join him and Otto rejects the offer. When Otto finds being unable to win against Osborn's resources, having had various allies abandoned, and with faith in his own abilities gone, Otto sacrifices himself to restore the original Spider-Man's mind in order to save Anna Maria Marconi. When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, Osborn quickly realizes that the original personality is back in control when Spider-Man responds to his nemesis' taunts with his own wisecracks. In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Osborn, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as Alchemax's CEO and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that his true likeness is too publicly known as a supervillain. Spider-Man defeats and strips the villain's powers with Otto's serum, but Norman manages to escape through Liz Allan's discreet aid. In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared for him when he returns with a new identity and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Goblin formula.Superior Spider-Man #31. Marvel Comics. All New, All Different Marvel Osborn's Goblin King position was quickly usurped by Phil Urich. However, a mysterious man with a bandaged face is soon shown to be selling Goblin-based weaponry globally to attack Parker Industries. This man reveals himself to be Norman alive again post-Secret Wars and still planning on getting revenge on Spider- Man. He is revealed to have played a part in the recent coup of Symkaria. He restores a semblance of his original features via a twisted form of plastic surgery but which also resembles the Green Goblin's facets, and intends to release a modified version of the Goblin formula to turn the whole country into Goblin-powered soldiers programmed to be loyal to him. However, in his final confrontation with Spider-Man, despite exposing his foe to a series of gases to temporarily neutralize all of his powers, and triggering an EMP to shut down all the gadgetry within his new Spider-armor, Spider-Man is still able to defeat Osborn as the two clash. Managing to escape while Peter is distracted, Osborn resolves to find a means of restoring his powers, concluding that he has only ever defeated Spider-Man when allowing himself to draw on his inner demons. Norman Osborn as Red Goblin on the cover of The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1 #799 (June 2018). Art by Alex Ross.

While interrogating a captive Jameson for information on Spider-Man, Osborn takes a brief interval from the torture to kill the self- proclaimed Goblin King tried to raid one of his old storehouses. After Osborn appeared as the Green Goblin, Jameson mentioned how he could not stop Spider- Man since even throwing Gwen off the bridge did not stop him from fighting back. Those words caused Norman to remember that Spider-Man is Peter Parker.Amazing Spider-Man #797. Marvel Comics. Attacking the Daily Bugle in his familiar Goblin attire, Osborn gives the rest of the staff time to evacuate as he fights Peter before revealing his new bond with Carnage, proclaiming himself to be the Red Goblin, driving Spider-Man away with 'Carnage bombs' that injure his leg. Discovering a sound-transmitting spider- tracer planted on him, Osborn uses this to deliver a 'devil's bargain' to Peter; if Peter abandons the Spider-Man identity and never performs any further heroics, Osborn will leave Parker alone, but the second he sees any sign of Spider-Man's return he will kill everyone in Peter's life. Peter places the Spider-Man top on a flagpole so that Osborn can see it burn, but privately vows that he will find a way to defeat Osborn as Peter rather than Spider-Man.Amazing Spider-Man #798. Marvel Comics. Peter is able to contact various allies like Human Torch, Clash, Silk, Miles Morales, and Agent Anti- Venom to watch over his loved ones. When Norman moves against the Osborns and proves immune to Carnage's traditional weaknesses of Human Torch's fire and Clash's sound devices, Peter is forced to step back into action despite the injured leg, with Agent Anti-Venom sacrificing a chance to get back into action himself to heal Spider-Man's injury as Osborn merges a part of the Carnage symbiote with his grandson Normie turning into a miniature version of Red Goblin.Amazing Spider-Man #799. Marvel Comics. Normie goes after May but she gets some unexpected help in the form of Superior Octopus and J. Jonah Jameson who uses an old Spider-Slayer, however both are defeated by Norman. Soon afterwards, Normie watches as his grandfather throws Liz through a window only to be rescued by Spider-Man which causes Normie to turn on Norman. Norman reveals to Spider-Man he infected some of Peter's friends and family with slivers of the Carnage symbiote which he could send to their brain to kill them. However, it turns out that Flash has figured out Spider-Man's secret identity too and went to May and Mary Jane in order to remove those ticking time bombs. Flash then takes the fight to Norman and while it appears as if he's gaining the upper hand, it turns out that Norman still has some Green Goblin tech beneath the Carnage symbiote and he uses that to electrocute Flash. Flash's injuries prove to be fatal and dies in Spider-Man's arms. Spider-Man confronts Norman at Times Square as Red Goblin gains the upper hand. Peter manages to hold him off by pointing out that it's not the Goblin killing the Spider, but rather Carnage and Cletus Kasady. The villain is enraged by this and when Peter removes the Venom symbiote and to challenge him, Norman takes off the Carnage symbiote to reveal his old Green Goblin persona. Spider-Man manages to take his foe down and when the villain begs the Carnage symbiote to help him, the wall-crawler seemingly destroys it by hitting it with an exploding gas tank. However, the Carnage symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, and he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind.

This leads to Norman removing a fake wall containing Green Goblin weaponry ready for combat.Amazing Spider-Man: The Sins of Norman Osborn #1. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Norman Osborn was turned into the Green Goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor Mendel Stromm. The process granted Osborn superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and stamina as well as a low- level rapid healing factor. In addition to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics, robotics, engineering, physics and applied chemistry. The goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations. Following his confrontation with the returned Spider-Man after his campaign against Otto Octavius in Spider-Man's body, Osborn has been rid of the Goblin formula from his system and thus has lost his superhuman abilities, forcing him to rely on his intellect and other natural abilities. Otto's anti-serum also prevents Osborn's attempts of restoring his powers; ultimately he seeks to rid himself of it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity. Norman bonded to the Carnage symbiote to use to expel the anti-serum from his body which restores his former powers in the process, but once more at the cost of his mind. In addition, the Carnage symbiote eliminates his physical scars including his features'. He has since claimed to have 'perfected' the formula so that it will grant the subjects powers while also reverting those he chooses to a more basic mentality where they will accept his orders. Weapons of Green Goblin The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built- in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of jack-o'-lanterns. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged bat-shaped boomerangs-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick. Weapons as Iron Patriot During the events of the \\"Dark Reign\\" storyline, Osborn created the Iron Patriot identity (an amalgam of Iron Man and Captain America) to cement his standing as a hero. As the Iron Patriot, he utilized an outdated version of Iron Man's armor painted in Captain America's colors. The armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armor utilized repulsor technology, Osborn's design does not; all but one repulsor was destroyed as \\"Oz is too stupid\\" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system. Osborn's star shaped Uni Beam projector on his chest (because of its shape) also has a less powerful output. Powers as Super-Adaptoid Following his time in prison, A.I.M scientists converted Osborn into a Super- Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such superpowered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, and he was able to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two. He is known to have absorbed the abilities of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does. However, Osborn had no control over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would automatically absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead. Powers as Red Goblin After gaining control of the Carnage symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter, Osborn has used it to form a new attire in the form of the 'Red Goblin', which essentially resembles a red version of his Green Goblin outfit without the purple and green clothing, as well as a long tail and flaming breath.Amazing Spider-Man v4 #796 With the symbiote, he can create his own Goblin Glider and what he terms 'Carnage bombs', which are essentially pumpkin bombs that can actually talk to and bite their targets before exploding, as well as the Carnage symbiote's traditional enhancements.Amazing Spider-Man v4 #798 Due to the combination of the symbiote with the new Goblin formula injected into his system, Osborn is immune to the symbiote's traditional weaknesses of fire and sound, although the touch of Anti-Venom is still dangerous to him. He also revived its ability to spread its constituent matter to others.Amazing Spider- Man v4 #799 Characterization Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances, he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. Although the stress caused by his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies. Norman Osborn is shown to be severely manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain. Superhuman psychologist Leonard Samson says of Osborn: \\"In clinical terms, the words psychotic and psychopathic are far from synonymous... but in Norman Osborn's case, both apply. I'd characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism. In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes him one of the most dangerous human beings on the planet\\". There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father. Having become the Goblin, he generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch, despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself. He also missed the opportunity to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being more powerful than the Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual ‚Äì which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively ‚Äì only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers. It has been shown that since having suppressed the rampaging Green Goblin personality and becoming the more dominant personality, Osborn has proven to be just as (if not more) evil and cruel. Osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism: while in prison, a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife; Osborn's advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death. As director of H.A.M.M.E.R., he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy Pepper Potts was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her Rescue armor. His Goblin persona vied for control of his body, as depicted in the January 2010 issue of Dark Avengers, where he is shown writhing on the floor and imploring, apparently to himself, \\"Why won't this face come off...?\\", and finally took over when Osborn's Iron Patriot armor was defeated by Captain America and Iron Man at the end of the \\"Siege\\" arc. Since being cured of the Goblin formula, Osborn claims that his sanity has also been restored. However, he has expressed satisfaction at plastic surgery that 'restored' him to a twisted version of his original features, and intended to use a modified version of the formula to essentially 'infect' the entire country of Symkaria to become goblin-level soldiers without the intellectual capacity to defy him. Other versions A number of alternate universes in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on Osborn, in which the character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. Marvel 2099 depicts the Goblin as a radical trickster who wants to prove that Spider-Man (Miguel O'Hara) is in the pay of a megacorp. He has bat-like glider-wings and a bag of \\"tricks\\", similar to the 20th century version. He also has the ability to project illusions. In Earth X, Osborn's business ventures have completely taken over the United States. Citizens work in his businesses, shop in his stores and eat his food and is partially responsible for the deaths of the Avengers as he sent them to battle a now Super Intelligent Absorbing Man. In the Marvel Noir universe, Osborn is a former circus freak who was mistreated from the audience for his reptile-like skin disorder. This fueled his ambitions in earning his \\"respect\\" by becoming the major Crime Lord in New York. The Ultimate Marvel version of the character was an industrialist and scientist who is trying to perfect the Super Soldier drug for S.H.I.E.L.D., an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife and son.Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). Ultimate Spider-Man. Wizard Xtra!. p. 117. In other media Norman Osborn has appeared in comics, cartoons, films, video games, coloring books, novels, records, and children's books. Osborn also appeared in other print forms besides the comics, including novels, children's books, and the daily newspaper comic strip The Amazing Spider-Man, which debuted in January 1977, with the earliest installments written by Stan Lee and drawn by John Romita, Sr. Osborn has been adapted to other media including games, toys, collectibles, and miscellaneous memorabilia, and has appeared as the main character in numerous computer and video games on over 15 gaming platforms. In television, he first was featured in the ABC animated series Spider-Man (1967‚Äì1970) and later on other animated series featuring the superhero include the syndicated Spider-Man (1981‚Äì1982), Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981‚Äì1983), Fox Kids' Spider-Man (1994‚Äì1998), Spider-Man Unlimited (1999‚Äì2000), Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (2003), The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008‚Äì2009), Ultimate Spider-Man (2012‚Äì2017), Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers (2014‚Äì2015), and Spider-Man (2017‚Äìpresent). Norman was featured in a trilogy of live-action films directed by Sam Raimi and played by Willem Dafoe. He was the main antagonist in the first film (2002), and later made cameo appearances in Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007) as a hallucination. Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man film reboot (2012) featured many references to the character who appeared in the sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2 portrayed by Chris Cooper. Osborn was one of the characters portrayed in the 1987 live adaptation of Spider-Man's wedding at Shea Stadium. Osborn appeared as the main antagonist in the Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, began previews on November 14, 2010 at the Foxwoods Theatre on Broadway, with the official opening night on June 14, 2011.Lustig, Jay. \\"Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark\\".

It was the first Act to protect wild birds in that country.Barclay-Smith (1959) History In 1868, Professor Alfred Newton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science on the \\"On the Zoological Aspect of the Game Laws\\".Barclay-Smith (1959) In particular, he urged for protection of birds of prey and seabirds during the breeding season. The British Association appointed a committee to propose a close season. The committee consisted of Frank Buckland, Henry Eeles Dresser, William Bernhardt Tegetmeier and Henry Baker Tristram. James Edmund Harting was later co-opted onto the committee. Newton's speech cited the destruction of seabirds on the Isle of Wight and Flamborough Head. Wide publicity of his speech led to public condemnation of the residents of Bridlington. Rev. Henry Frederick Barnes-Lawrence of Bridlington Priory held a meeting of local clergy and naturalists and formed the Association for the Protection of Sea-Birds. Barnes-Lawrence's Association had the support of Francis Orpen Morris, William Thomson, Archbishop of York, and local MP Christopher Sykes. As with many animal welfare laws before 1900, the animals' safety was not the main reason for the act. Seabirds were useful to sailors to warn of land in bad weather. If a boat was in fog and the sailors could hear seabirds nearby then they would know that they were near land. If the population of seabirds declined then they would not have this early warning system. The Act The act was introduced by Christopher Sykes (MP), Mr Clay and Mr Ward Jackson on behalf of the Association for the Protection of Sea-Birds. It was designed to reduce the effects of shooting and egg collecting during the breeding season.Barclay- Smith (1959) It gave limited protection to \\"the different species of auk, bonxie, Cornish chough, coulterneb, diver, eider duck, fulmar, gannet, grebe, guillemot, gull, kittiwake, loon, marrot, merganser, murre, oyster catcher, petrel, puffin, razor bill, scout, seamew, sea parrot, sea swallow, shearwater, shelldrake, skua, smew, solan goose, tarrock, tern, tystey, willock\\".Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869, Section 1Greenoak (1979) See also *British Association for the Advancement of Science *British Ornithologists' Union *Conservation biology *Henry Eeles Dresser *Game Act 1831 *James Edmund Harting *Francis Orpen Morris *Alfred Newton *Christopher Sykes (MP) *William Bernhardt Tegetmeier *William Thomson, Archbishop of York *Henry Baker Tristram Footnotes References * Barclay-Smith, Phyllis (1959): The British contribution to bird protection Ibis 101(1):pp 115‚Äì122 * Greenoak, Francesca (1979): All the Birds of the Air Andre Deutsch, London External links *Association for the Protection of Sea-Birds *Hansard: Sea Birds Preservation Bill, Leave *Hansard: Sea Birds Preservation Bill, Second Reading *Hansard: Sea Birds Preservation Bill, Consideration *Hansard: Sea Birds Preservation Bill, Lord's Committee United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1869 Bird conservation ","title":"Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869"},{"id":"18842088","text":"Hypocrisy is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another or the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform. In moral psychology, it is the failure to follow one's own expressed moral rules and principles. According to British political philosopher David Runciman, \\"Other kinds of hypocritical deception include claims to knowledge that one lacks, claims to a consistency that one cannot sustain, claims to a loyalty that one does not possess, claims to an identity that one does not hold\\". American political journalist Michael Gerson says that political hypocrisy is \\"the conscious use of a mask to fool the public and gain political benefit\\". Hypocrisy has been a subject of folk wisdom and wisdom literature from the beginnings of human history. Increasingly, since the 1980s, it has also become central to studies in behavioral economics, cognitive science, cultural psychology, decision making, ethics, evolutionary psychology, moral psychology, political sociology, positive psychology, social psychology, and sociological social psychology. Etymology The word hypocrisy comes from the Greek ·ΩëœÄœåŒ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπœÇ (hypokrisis), which means \\"jealous\\", \\"play-acting\\", \\"acting out\\", \\"coward\\" or \\"dissembling\\".Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary, ed Morwood and Taylor, OUP 2002 The word hypocrite is from the Greek word ·ΩëœÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπœÑŒÆœÇ (hypokritƒìs), the agentive noun associated with ·ΩëœÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒØŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ (hypokrinomai Œ∫œÅŒØœÉŒ∑, \\"judgment\\" ¬ªŒ∫œÅŒπœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ (kritikƒì), \\"critics\\") presumably because the performance of a dramatic text by an actor was to involve a degree of interpretation, or assessment. Alternatively, the word is an amalgam of the Greek prefix hypo-, meaning \\"under\\", and the verb krinein, meaning \\"to sift or decide\\". Thus the original meaning implied a deficiency in the ability to sift or decide. This deficiency, as it pertains to one's own beliefs and feelings, informs the word's contemporary meaning. Whereas hypokrisis applied to any sort of public performance (including the art of rhetoric), hypokrites was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure. In Athens during the 4th century BC, for example, the great orator Demosthenes ridiculed his rival Aeschines, who had been a successful actor before taking up politics, as a hypocrites whose skill at impersonating characters on stage made him an untrustworthy politician. This negative view of the hypokrites, perhaps combined with the Roman disdain for actors, later shaded into the originally neutral hypokrisis. It is this later sense of hypokrisis as \\"play-acting\\", i.e., the assumption of a counterfeit persona, that gives the modern word hypocrisy its negative connotation. History American historian Martin Jay in The Virtues of Mendacity: On Lying in Politics (2012) explores how writers over the centuries have treated hypocrisy, deception, flattery, lying and cheating, slander, false pretenses, living on borrowed glory, masquerading, conventions of concealment, playacting before others and the arts of dissimulation. He assumes that politics is worthwhile, but since it is unavoidably linked to lying and hypocrisy, Jay concludes that lying must not be all that bad.Jay, Martin (2012). The Virtues of Mendacity: On Lying in Politics.Bryan Garsten, \\"Looking for an honest man.\\" Modern Intellectual History 8#3 (2011): 697‚Äì708. Great Britain Hypocrisy became a major topic in English political history in the early 18th century. The Toleration Act of 1689 allowed for certain rights, but it left Protestant nonconformists (such as Congregationalists and Baptists) deprived of important rights, including that of office-holding. Nonconformists who wanted office ostentatiously took the Anglican sacrament once a year in order to avoid the restrictions. High Church Anglicans were outraged and outlawed what they called \\"occasional conformity\\" in 1711 with the Occasional Conformity Act 1711. In the political controversies using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, both high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous, in contrast to their own moderation. This campaign of moderation versus zealotry, peaked in 1709 during the impeachment trial of high church preacher Henry Sacheverell. Historian Mark Knights, argues that by its very ferocity, the debate may have led to more temperate and less hypercharged political discourse. Occasional conformity was restored by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719. In his famous book Fable of the Bees (1714), English author Bernard Mandeville ( 1670‚Äì1733) explored the nature of hypocrisy in contemporary European society. On the one hand, Mandeville was a ‚Äòmoralist‚Äô heir to the French Augustinianism of the previous century, viewing sociability as a mere mask for vanity and pride. On the other, he was a ‚Äòmaterialist‚Äô who helped found modern economics. He tried to demonstrate the universality of human appetites for corporeal pleasures. He argued that the efforts of self-seeking entrepreneurs are the basis of emerging commercial and industrial society, a line of thought that influenced Adam Smith (1723‚Äì1790) and 19th century utilitarianism. The tension between these two approaches modes ambivalences and contradictions‚Äîconcerning the relative power of norms and interests, the relationship between motives and behaviours, and the historical variability of human cultures. In the Enlightenment of the 18th century, discussions of hypocrisy were common in the works of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montaigne. In the 1750 to 1850 era, Whig aristocrats in England boasted of their special benevolence for the common people. They claimed to be guiding and counseling reform initiatives to prevent the outbreaks of popular discontent that caused instability and revolution across Europe. However Tory and radical critics accused the Whigs of hypocrisy‚Äîalleging they were deliberately using the slogans of reform and democracy to boost themselves into power while preserving their precious aristocratic exclusiveness. Historian L.G. Mitchell defends the Whigs, pointing out that thanks to them radicals always had friends at the centre of the political elite, and thus did not feel as marginalized as in most of Europe. He points out that the debates on the 1832 Reform Bill showed that reformers would indeed receive a hearing at parliamentary level with a good chance of success.L.G. Mitchell, \\"The Whigs, the People, and Reform,\\" Proceedings of the British Academy (1999), Vol. 85, pp. 25‚Äì41 Meanwhile, a steady stream of observers from the Continent commented on the English political culture. Liberal and radical observers noted the servility of the English lower classes, the obsession everyone had with rank and title, the extravagance of the aristocracy, a supposed anti-intellectualism, and a pervasive hypocrisy that extended into such areas as social reform. There were not so many conservative visitors. They praised the stability of English society, its ancient constitution, and reverence for the past; they ignored the negative effects of industrialization.Paul Langford, \\"The English as Reformers: Foreign Visitors' Impressions, 1750‚Äì1850\\" Proceedings of the British Academy (1999), Vol. 85, pp. 101‚Äì19. United States In the propaganda battles of World War II, Japan attacked American hypocrisy by emphasizing the injustice of the incarceration camps for Japanese in the United States. Radio Tokyo emphasized that the camps revealed the hypocritical American claim to democratic ideals and fair play. The propaganda quoted American founding fathers, neutral sources, and dissenting opinions from major American newspapers. Radio Tokyo utilized fictitious sources as well. It proclaimed the moral superiority of Japan while threatening to mistreat American POWs in retaliation. Moral and religious codes Many belief systems condemn hypocrisy.Thomas P. Kasulis, \\"Hypocrisy in the Self- Understanding of Religions.\\" in Inter-Religious Models and Criteria (Palgrave Macmillan, 1993) pp. 151‚Äì65. In Islam, Quranic Chapter 63 is often titled \\"The Hypocrites\\" Hypocrisy is viewed as a serious sickness. The Qur'an rails against those who claim to be believers and peacemakers, thinking they are fooling God and others, but only fool themselves.\\"And of mankind are some who say, 'We believe in God and the Last Day,' when they believe not. They think to beguile God and those who believe, and they beguile none save themselves; but they perceive not. In their hearts is a disease, and God increases their disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie. And when it is said to them, 'Make not mischief on the earth,' they say, 'We are only peacemakers.' Behold they are indeed the mischief-makers but they perceive not.\\" Al-Baqara 8‚Äì12 In some translations of the Book of Job, the Hebrew word chaneph is rendered as \\"hypocrite\\", though it usually means \\"godless\\" or \\"profane\\". In the Christian Bible, Jesus condemns the scribes and Pharisees as hypocrites in the passage known as the Woes of the Pharisees.Gospel of Luke and Gospel of Matthew Steve Mason, \\"Pharisaic Dominance Before 70 CE and the Gospels' Hypocrisy Charge (Matt 23: 2‚Äì3).\\" Harvard Theological Review 83#4 (1990): 363‚Äì81. He also denounces hypocrites in more general terms in Matthew 7:5. In the 16th century, John Calvin was critical of Nicodemites. In the Buddhist text Dhammapada, Gautama Buddha condemns a man who takes the appearance of an ascetic but is full of passions within.\\"What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest clean. The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with veins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a Br√¢hmana. I do not call a man a Br√¢hmana because of his origin or of his mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Br√¢hmana. Dhammapada 394‚Äì96, Translated from the P√¢li by F. Max M√ºller Psychology Hypocrisy has long been of interest to psychologists. Carl Jung In Switzerland Carl Jung (1875‚Äì1961) attributed hypocrisy to those who are not aware of the dark or shadow-side of their nature. Jung wrote: :Every individual needs revolution, inner division, overthrow of the existing order, and renewal, but not by forcing them upon his neighbors under the hypocritical cloak of Christian love or the sense of social responsibility or any of the other beautiful euphemisms for unconscious urges to personal power. Jung went on: > It is under all circumstances an advantage to be in full possession of one's > personality, otherwise the repressed elements will only crop up as a > hindrance elsewhere, not just at some unimportant point, but at the very > spot where we are most sensitive. If people can be educated to see the > shadow-side of their nature clearly, it may be hoped that they will also > learn to understand and love their fellow men better. A little less > hypocrisy and a little more self-knowledge can only have good results in > respect for our neighbor; for we are all too prone to transfer to our > fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures. In New Paths in Psychology Jung pointedly referred to the \\"hypocritical pretenses of man\\". \\"Dream-analysis above all else mercilessly uncovers the lying morality and hypocritical pretences of man, showing him, for once, the other side of his character in the most vivid light\\". Jung omitted this characterization from his later essay On the Psychology of the Unconscious, which developed out of the former. Preference for the effortless Niccol√≤ Machiavelli noted that \\"the mass of mankind accept what seems as what is; nay, are often touched more nearly by appearances than by realities\\".Machiavelli, N. (2004), Book 1 Ch 25. Discourses on the First Decade of Titus Livius. Project Gutenberg. Natural selection works by the principle of survival of the fittest, and several researchers have shown that humans evolved to play the game of life in a Machiavellian way. The best way to cultivate a reputation for fairness is to really be fair. But since it is much harder to be fair than to seem fair, and since laziness is built deep into human nature, humans more often choose appearance over reality. Self-deception \\"So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.\\"Franklin, B. (1771), p. 18. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. Ushistory.org Benjamin Franklin's observation has been confirmed by recent studies in self-deception. In everyday reasoning, humans do little to get real evidence when taking positions or making decisions, and do even less to get evidence for opposing positions. Instead, they tend to fabricate \\"pseudo-evidence\\" ‚Äì often after the decision had already been made (\\"post hoc fabrication\\"). Humans take a position, look for evidence that supports it, then, if they find some evidence ‚Äì enough so that the position \\"makes sense\\" ‚Äì they stop thinking altogether (the \\"makes-sense stopping rule\\"). And, when pressed to produce real evidence, they tend to seek and interpret \\"evidence\\" that confirms what they already believe (the \\"confirmation bias\\"). Moreover, humans tend to think highly of themselves, highlighting strengths and achievements, and overlooking weakness and failures (the \\"self-serving bias\\"). When asked to rate themselves on virtues, skills, or other desirable traits (including ethics, intelligence, driving ability, and sexual skills), a large majority say they are above average. Power and privilege magnify the distortion: 94% of college professors think that they do above average work. This effect is weaker in Asian countries and in other cultures which value the group more highly than the self. Evolutionary psychology Evolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban argues that one's moral modules lead one to condemn infidelity while mating modules induce one to commit it. Self-ignorance Robert Wright wrote that \\"Human beings are a species splendid in their array of moral equipment, tragic in their propensity to misuse it, and pathetic in their constitutional ignorance of the misuse.\\" Humans are very good at challenging the beliefs of other people, but when it comes to their own beliefs, they tend to protect them, not challenge them. A consistent finding of psychological research is that humans are fairly accurate in their perceptions of others, but generally inaccurate in their perceptions of themselves. Humans tend to judge others by their behavior, but think they have special information about themselves ‚Äì that they know what they are \\"really like\\" inside ‚Äì and thus effortlessly find ways to explain away selfish acts, and maintain the illusion that they are better than others. Social psychology Social psychologists have generally viewed hypocrisy as an instantiation of attitudinal and/or behavioral inconsistency. Accordingly, many social psychologists have focused on the role of dissonance in explaining individuals' aversion to hypocritical thinking and behavior.Fried, C. B. (1998). \\"Hypocrisy and Identification With Transgressions: A Case of Undetected Dissonance\\", 'Basic and Applied Social Psychology', 20(2), 145‚Äì154. Individuals are motivated to avoid hypocritical stances in order to forestall the negative drive state of dissonance. For example, a dissonance-based study on the use of condoms among young adults showed that induced hypocrisy can lead to increased purchase and use of condoms.Stone, J., E. Aronson, A. L. Crain, M. P. Winslow, & C. B. Fried (1994). \\"Inducing Hypocrisy as a Means of Encouraging Young Adults to Use Condoms, 'Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin', 20(1), 116‚Äì128. Alternatively, some social psychologists have suggested that individuals view hypocrisy negatively because it suggests that hypocrites are providing a false signal regarding their moral goodness.J. J. Jordan, R. Sommers, P. Bloom, & D. G. Rand (2017). \\"Why Do We Hate Hypocrites? Evidence for a Theory of False Signaling\\", 'Psychological Science' (28(3), 356‚Äì368. Philosophy Hypocrisy has been an intermittent topic of interest to philosophers since at least Machiavelli. Philosophical issues raised by hypocrisy can be broadly divided into two kinds: metaphysical/conceptual and ethical. Most philosophical commentary on hypocrisy is concerned with the ethical questions it raises: is hypocrisy morally wrong or bad? If it is, is there anything distinctly objectionable about it, or can it be easily subsumed under a broader category of morally objectionable conduct‚Äìfor example, deceit? Is hypocrisy necessary or desirable for the sake of certain valuable activities‚Äìmost notably, politics? Recently, hypocrisy has emerged as a key focus in philosophical discussions of the ethics of blame. It seems that even if a person has violated some moral norm and is genuinely blameworthy for doing so, it is open to them to challenge the blame leveled at them on the grounds that it is hypocritical; a typical expression of this idea is the phrase, \\"You have no right to blame me!\\" Accordingly, some philosophers argue that in order to have the standing or entitlement to blame others, one's blame must not be hypocritical. Defenses of this position have usually focused on the connection between hypocrisy and fairness: the basic idea is that the hypocritical blamer in some way fails to treat the target of her blame as a moral equal. Other proposed explanations include the idea that standing in a moral community requires a reciprocal willingness to accept blame, a willingness that hypocrites lack. Patrick Todd argues that all and only those who are committed to the relevant norms possess the standing to blame, and hypocrites lack commitment in the relevant sense. Other philosophers reject the \\"No-hypocrisy\\" condition on standing altogether. Typically, these philosophers do not deny that sometimes the wrongness of hypocrisy can outweigh a would-be blamer's entitlement to blame others; but they will insist that this is not invariably the case, and some hypocrites do have standing to blame. R.A. Duff suggests that underlying the disagreement between these two views is a disagreement about the size and scope of moral community, while Kyle Fritz and Daniel Miller suggest that the rejection of the \\"No-hypocrisy\\" condition reflects a failure to distinguish between the right to blame and the value of blaming. The definition of hypocrisy itself is the fundamental question of the relatively new philosophical discussions on hypocrisy. Early answers tended to focus on the deceptive or inconsistent qualities of hypocrisy. For Eva Kittay, for example, the fundamental attribute of hypocrites is \\"self-referential deception,\\" and for Gilbert Ryle, to be hypocritical is to \\"try to appear activated by a motive other than one's real motive.\\"Ryle, Gilbert. The Concept of Mind. London: Hutchinson 1949, 173. On Dan Turner's view, by contrast, the fundamental feature is \\"conflict or disparity\\" between a person's attitudes, where this may or may not involve deception. Bela Szabados and Daniel Statman argue that self-deception is the characteristic attribute of \\"garden variety of hypocrisies.\\" Roger Crisp and Christopher Cowten identify four types of hypocrisy: pretense of moral goodness, moral criticism of others by those possessing faults of their own, failure to satisfy self-acknowledged moral requirements, and a complacent, unreflective commitment to virtues feigned or preached. What unifies these types is a \\"metavice,\\" a lack of \\"moral seriousness.\\" More recently, some philosophers‚Äìnotably, Benjamin Rossi and Fritz and Miller‚Äìhave defined hypocrisy in terms of dispositions to blame others or to avow commitment to certain norms together with an unwillingness to accept blame from others or to blame themselves. Rossi's \\"Commitment Account of Hypocrisy\\" addresses paradigmatic cases of hypocrisy that Fritz and Miller's \\"Differential Blaming Disposition Account\\" does not include. Benefits Although there are many negatives to hypocrisy, there can be benefits from it as well. There are also benefits from ignoring it. Political theorist Judith N. Shklar argues, in \\"Let Us Not Be Hypocritical,\\" we are all too eager to construe even minor deviations from our opponents' professed beliefs as hypocrisy, rather than understandable imperfections and weaknesses to everyone is prone.Judith Shklar, \\"Let us not be hypocritical.\\" Daedalus (1979): 1‚Äì25. in JSTOR Political journalist Michael Gerson notes that, \\"There is often hypocritical deception involved in political and diplomatic negotiations, which generally start with principled, nonnegotiable demands that are negotiated away in the process of finding a compromise.\\" Gerson concludes: > hypocrisy is unavoidable and necessary. If people were required, at all > times, to live up to ideals of honesty, loyalty and compassion in order for > those ideals to exist, there would be no ideals. Being a moral person is a > struggle in which everyone repeatedly fails, becoming a hypocrite in each of > those moments. A just and peaceful society depends on hypocrites who > ultimately refused to abandon the ideals they betray.

It is located in the territory of the commune of Tarascon, in the region of the Montagnette, the parishes of which are served by the canons of the monastery. It was originally associated with the Order of Saint Benedict. Monks, canons and friars The monastery, dedicated to Saint Michael, was founded about 960 at Frigolet by Conrad I of Burgundy on one of the numerous hills which lie between Tarascon and Avignon. It was initially occupied by Benedictine monks from Montmajour Abbey. By the 12th century, the abbey was home to a community of Canons Regular. A document from 1133 lists the prior of the canons as Guillaume of Loubi√®res. The chapel of Our Lady of Good Remedy dates from this period. The canonical Augustinian community lasted until 1480, when the canons petitioned the Holy See to suppress the monastery. This request was granted by Pope Sixtus IV, at which time the monastery was abandoned. The chapel, however, remained a popular pilgrimage site. In 1647 the Hieronymites were given possession of the derelict monastery. They worked to restore it, at the same time expanding the complex, enlarging the choir and sacristy, and erecting a chapter house. The community did not stay long, however, and were replaced in 1661 by the Discalced Augustinians. The friars of this order continued the work of the Hieronymites, but also did pastoral care in the surrounding region, providing support to the local clergy. At the time of the French Revolution, it was suppressed and sold by the French First Republic. Premonstratensians: 19th century to the present From that time it changed hands frequently, eventually acquired by a priest, the Abb√© Edmund Boulbon who purchased it from another priest, T. Delestrac. Boulbon, born 14 January 1817, entered the La Trappe Abbey at Bricquebec in 1850, wishing to lead a more dedicated religious life. Acting on the advice of the Trappist superiors, he left the abbey and undertook the restoration of the Premonstratensians, or Order of Norbert of Xanten. On 6 June, the feast day of Norbert, Boulbon received the white habit of the Premonstratensians from the hands of Paul-Armand de Cardon de Garsignies, Bishop of Soissons, at Pr√©montr√© Abbey. Pope Pius IX approved the project in an audience which he granted him on 4 December 1856. With the consent of Georges-Claude-Louis-Pie Chalandon, Archbishop of Aix, Boulbon took possession of Frigolet and, having admitted several novices, commenced community life there. In honour of Mary, mother of Jesus he erected a magnificent church, which was solemnly consecrated on 6 October 1866. The monastery was canonically erected as a priory on 28 August 1868, and as an abbey in September 1869, with Boulbon as its first abbot. On 8 November 1880, under the French anti-clerical laws, the Abbey of Frigolet was seized and the religious expelled. Eventually, however, they were permitted to return. Boulbon died on 2 March 1883. His successor, Paulinus Boniface, named abbot on 10 June 1883, undid by poor administration the work begun by Boulbon; but, after a canonical visitation by Fran√ßois Xavier Gouthe-Soulard, Archbishop of Aix, he was deposed, and the direction of the abbey entrusted to Denis Bonnefoy. Up to this time, Frigolet Abbey with the priories it had founded had formed, as it were, a separate congregation with an organization of its own, having no connection with the other abbeys or the General Chapter of the Premonstratensian Order. This state of affairs was changed by a decree of the Roman Curia, dated 17 September 1898, when the congregation of Frigolet was incorporated into the Order. Denis Bonnefoy, who was made abbot on 21 March 1899, died on 20 September of the same year. The canons of Frigolet then chose for their abbot Godfrey Madelaine, then prior of Mondaye Abbey, Calvados, the author of L'histoire de S. Norbert and other books. Under his administration, Frigolet Abbey sent missionaries to Madagascar, and founded priories at Conques and √âtoile (now in Authon, Loir-et-Cher) in France, and at Storrington and Bedworth in England. Meanwhile, the French Republic had framed new laws against all religious institutes, and on 5 April 1903 the canons, again expelled from their abbey, took refuge either in Belgium, in Norbertine abbey in Leffe, or in the priory at Storrington in England. The community at Leffe suffered severely from the German occupation during World War I: some were killed, and the rest were driven into further exile. Frigolet was reoccupied by the Premonstratensians in 1923 and remains in operation, although the communities at Leffe and Storrington also continued. The Abbot of Frigolet from 1946 was P. Norbert Calmels, later distinguished as the Abbot- General of the Premonstratensian Order from 1961 to 1981, during which time he participated in the Second Vatican Council. Under Pope John Paul II the abbey church of Frigolet was raised to the status of a minor basilica.

Early life Redman was the son of Sir Matthew Redman, who served in France and Spain under John of Gaunt, and grandson of another Sir Matthew Redman who was the Member of Parliament for Westmorland in 1357 and 1358. Career Redman began his career as a soldier, campaigning on the continent, and was knighted by 1376. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland for 1387, 1391, 1394, 1397, 1401 and 1410 and High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1403 and 1415. In 1393 Richard was granted leave to hold a tournament in Carlisle. In 1397, after campaigning in Ireland with Richard II he was appointed Master of the Horse. Between 1399 and 1400 he travelled to Ireland with John de Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham before returning to England in May to create a peace with Scotland. In 1405 he was commissioned to fine members of the gentry associated with the rebellion by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and was the same year elected to represent Yorkshire as a knight of the shire (MP), a job he returned to for the Parliaments of 1414, 1415, 1420 and 1421. In 1408 he was commissioned again to fine gentry associated with the Percy Rebellion after their defeat at the Battle of Bramham Moor. In 1409 and 1410 he attempted to gain peace with the Scots; after this failed he was tasked with raising forces against them. In 1415 along with John Strange he raised forces against the French before the Hundred Years' War (1415‚Äì1429) and was elected speaker of the 1415 parliament, which met on 4 November and lasted only eight days due to the loyalist feeling after the Battle of Agincourt before Parliament voted for supplies to maintain the war with France. In 1421 he was again commissioned to raise money for the war with France before his death in 1426. Later life Redman died in 1426 and was buried in the Church of the Black Friars, York. An elaborate memorial to him was installed in Harewood church, Yorkshire, where his estates lay. He had married twice, secondly to Elizabeth, the daughter of William, 1st Lord Aldeburgh of Aldeburgh and Harewood, and sister and co-heiress of William, 2nd Lord Aldeburgh and widow of Sir Brian Stapleton of Carlton, with whom he had at least two sons and two daughters. His surviving son, Matthew Redman, died before him in 1419 and he was succeeded by his grandson, Richard. Richard Redman, the Bishop of Exeter, was most likely his great-grandson.

The affair led to the resignation of the government led by Poul Schl√ºter in 1993. The scandal was first uncovered in a series of articles written by Nils Ufer in Weekendavisen. Ufer later dramatized it in the play Mens vi venter p√• retf√¶rdigheden. He received the Cavling Prize for his work on it posthumously in 1992. Background The case began in 1987, when the government examined the possibilities of decreasing the number of Tamil family reunifications. Following this, the Minister of Justice Erik Ninn-Hansen decided to stall the advance of family reunification of Tamil refugees. Danish law clearly granted the Tamil refugees the right to family reunification, thus rendering the justice minister's order illegal. Media Nils Ufer uncovered the affair in series of articles in Weekendavisen. His articles relied on information from confidential interrogations of civil servants. In 2011, former Weekendavisen editor-in-chief T√∏ger Seidenfaden disclosed that Ufer's secret source was Hans Gammeltoft-Hansen. Ufer received the Cavling Prize posthumously for his coverage of the scandal in 1992. He also wrote a five hour long, dramatized monologue Mens vi venter p√• retf√¶rdighed (\\"While we wait for justice\\") about the affair. It played at Caf√© Teatret in Copenhagen with Peter Larsen in its only role and was also broadcast on DR1 in 1992. Consequences When the case appeared in the media, several political parties opposed a re-election of Ninn-Hansen, and others demanded an investigation. This ultimately lead to his resignation as minister of justice in 1989. Four civil servants in the Ministry of Justice were charged, and the minister of justice was impeached, which led to the resignation of the government in 1993. In 1995, Ninn-Hansen was found guilty in three cases of abuse of power, and received a suspended sentence of four months imprisonment.Thi kendes for ret. Dokument.

Cerro Marahuaca actually consists of two summit plateaus, the slightly larger northern one going by the Yekwana Amerindian name Fufha or Huha (). The southern plateau () is known by two local names; its northwestern edge is called Fuif or Fhuif, whereas its southeastern portion is called Atahua'shiho or Atawa Shisho. A massive ridge known as Cerro Petaca rises to at least just west of these two plateaus. The first recorded climb of Cerro Marahuaca dates back to 1984 on its Southwest face by Venezuelan climbers Luis Enrique Arnal, Ram√≥n Blanco, Manuel Guariguata and Jos√© Luis Pereyra. Cerro Marahuaca has a total summit area of and an estimated slope area of . Flora and fauna Several frog species are only known from the summit of Cerro Marahuaca, including Pristimantis marahuaka, Metaphryniscus sosai, and Myersiohyla inparquesi.

Replacing early punched cards and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input method for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s. Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them, and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or symbols (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can prompt the computer to execute system commands, such as such as the Control-Alt-Delete combination used with Microsoft Windows. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software: the information sent to the computer, the scan code, tells it only which key (or keys) on which row and column, was pressed or released.Microsoft Keyboard Scan Code Specification (Appendix C, \\"USB Keyboard/Keypad Page (0x07)\\"), Microsoft. Revision 1.3a, 2000-03-16, accessed 2018-10-13. In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text, numbers, and symbols into application software such as a word processor, web browser or social media app. History While typewriters are the definitive ancestor of all key-based text entry devices, the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives largely from the utility of two devices: teleprinters (or teletypes) and keypunches. It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts. As early as the 1870s, teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto ticker tape. The teleprinter, in its more contemporary form, was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard, with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne. Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as Royal Earl House and Frederick G. Creed. Earlier, Herman Hollerith developed the first keypunch devices, which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s. The keyboard on the teleprinter played a strong role in point-to-point and point- to-multipoint communication for most of the 20th century, while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long. The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards: the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device, while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape (instead of paper) and data output. The keyboard remained the primary, most integrated computer peripheral well into the era of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as a consumer device in 1984. By this time, text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen. However, keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present, even as mobile personal computing devices such as smartphones and tablets adapt the keyboard as an optional virtual, touchscreen-based means of data entry. Types and standards A wired computer keyboard for desktop use, by Lenovo Different types of keyboards are available and each is designed with a focus on specific features that suit particular needs. Today, most full-size keyboards use one of three different mechanical layouts, usually referred to as simply ISO (ISO/IEC 9995-2), ANSI (ANSI-INCITS 154-1988), and JIS (JIS X 6002-1980), referring roughly to the organizations issuing the relevant worldwide, United States, and Japanese standards, respectively. (In fact, the mechanical layouts referred such as \\"ISO\\" and \\"ANSI\\" comply to the primary recommendations in the named standards, while each of these standards in fact also allows the other way.) ANSI standard alphanumeric keyboards have keys that are on three-quarter inch centers (), and have a key travel of at least . Modern keyboard models contain a set number of total keys according to their given standard, described as 101, 104, 105, etc. and sold as \\"Full-size\\" keyboards. Modern keyboards matching US conventions typically have 104 keys while the 105 key layout is the norm in the rest of the world. This number is not always followed, and individual keys or whole sections are commonly skipped for the sake of compactness or user preference. The most common choice is to not include the numpad, which can usually be fully replaced by the alphanumeric section. Laptops and wireless peripherals often lack duplicate keys and ones seldom used. Function- and arrow keys are nearly always present. Another factor determining the size of a keyboard is the size and spacing of the keys. The reduction is limited by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. Alternatively, a tool is used for pressing small keys. Desktop or full-size Desktop computer keyboards include alphabetic characters and numerals, typographical symbols and punctuation marks, one or more currency symbols and other special characters, diacritics and a variety of function keys. The repertoire of glyphs engraved on the keys of a keyboard accords with national conventions and language needs. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command key or Windows keys.  Laptop-size  Keyboards on laptops usually have a shorter travel distance and a reduced set of keys. Keyboards on laptops and notebook computers usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke, shorter over travel distance, and a reduced set of keys. They may not have a numeric keypad, and the function keys may be placed in locations that differ from their placement on a standard, full-sized keyboard. The switch mechanism for a laptop keyboard is more likely to be a scissor switch than a rubber dome; this is opposite the trend for full-size keyboards.  Flexible keyboards  Flexible keyboards are a junction between normal type and laptop type keyboards: normal from the full arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows the user to fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority of flexible keyboards in the market are made from silicone; this material makes them water- and dust- proof. This is useful in hospitals, where keyboards are subjected to frequent washing, and other dirty or must-be-clean environments.  Handheld  An AlphaGrip handheld keyboard Handheld ergonomic keyboards\\"One of the first products we caught wind of at the Consumer Electronics Show was the TrewGrip keyboard, a handheld model\\" \\"Jul 28, 2009 ‚Äì If you do a lot of typing, or if you have employees who do a lot of typing ‚Äì ergonomic keyboards make a great deal of sense.\\" are designed to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard.Alpha Grip Programming and Productivity Improvement White Paper . Alphagrips.com. Retrieved on 9 December 2013. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer.The Alphagrip ‚Äì The World's most Comfortable Ergonomic Keyboard for Typing and Programming . Alphagrips.com. Retrieved on 9 December 2011. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.\\"It combines the body of a game controller with the functions of both a trackball and a keyboard.\\"  Thumb-sized  Smaller external keyboards have been introduced for devices without a built-in keyboard, such as PDAs, and smartphones. Small keyboards are also useful where there is a limited workspace. A thumb keyboard (thumb board) is used in some personal digital assistants such as the Palm Treo and BlackBerry and some Ultra-Mobile PCs such as the OQO. Numeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys. They are often used to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, arrow keys, Navigation keys, Num Lock and Enter key.  Multifunctional  Multifunction keyboard with LCD function keys Multifunctional keyboards provide additional function beyond the standard keyboard. Many are programmable, configurable computer keyboards and some control multiple PCs, workstations and other information sources, usually in multi-screen work environments. Users have additional key functions as well as the standard functions and can typically use a single keyboard and mouse to access multiple sources. Multifunction keyboard with touch Multifunctional keyboards may feature customised keypads, fully programmable function or soft keys for macros/pre-sets, biometric or smart card readers, trackballs, etc. New generation multifunctional keyboards feature a touchscreen display to stream video, control audio visual media and alarms, execute application inputs, configure individual desktop environments, etc. Multifunctional keyboards may also permit users to share access to PCs and other information sources. Multiple interfaces (serial, USB, audio, Ethernet, etc.) are used to integrate external devices. Some multifunctional keyboards are also used to directly and intuitively control video walls. Common environments for multifunctional keyboards are complex, high-performance workplaces for financial traders and control room operators (emergency services, security, air traffic management; industry, utilities management, etc.).  Non-standard layout and special-use types   Chorded  While other keyboards generally associate one action with each key, chorded keyboards associate actions with combinations of key presses. Since there are many combinations available, chorded keyboards can effectively produce more actions on a board with fewer keys. Court reporters' stenotype machines use chorded keyboards to enable them to enter text much faster by typing a syllable with each stroke instead of one letter at a time. The fastest typists (as of 2007) use a stenograph, a kind of chorded keyboard used by most court reporters and closed-caption reporters. Some chorded keyboards are also made for use in situations where fewer keys are preferable, such as on devices that can be used with only one hand, and on small mobile devices that don't have room for larger keyboards. Chorded keyboards are less desirable in many cases because it usually takes practice and memorization of the combinations to become proficient.  Software  Software keyboards or on-screen keyboards often take the form of computer programs that display an image of a keyboard on the screen. Another input device such as a mouse or a touchscreen can be used to operate each virtual key to enter text. Software keyboards have become very popular in touchscreen enabled cell phones, due to the additional cost and space requirements of other types of hardware keyboards. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and some varieties of Linux include on-screen keyboards that can be controlled with the mouse. In software keyboards, the mouse has to be maneuvered onto the on-screen letters given by the software. On the click of a letter, the software writes the respective letter on the respective spot.  Projection  Projection keyboards project an image of keys, usually with a laser, onto a flat surface. The device then uses a camera or infrared sensor to \\"watch\\" where the user's fingers move, and will count a key as being pressed when it \\"sees\\" the user's finger touch the projected image. Projection keyboards can simulate a full size keyboard from a very small projector. Because the \\"keys\\" are simply projected images, they cannot be felt when pressed. Users of projected keyboards often experience increased discomfort in their fingertips because of the lack of \\"give\\" when typing. A flat, non- reflective surface is also required for the keys to be projected. Most projection keyboards are made for use with PDAs and smartphones due to their small form factor.  Optical keyboard technology  Also known as photo- optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard, photo-electric keyboard and optical key actuation detection technology. An optical keyboard technology utilizes LEDs and photo sensors to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located in the perimeter, mounted on a small PCB. The light is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly vertical beam and horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly horizontal beam).  Key types   Alphanumeric  Greek and the Latin alphabet (MacBook Pro). Control, Windows, and Alt keys are important modifier keys. A Space-cadet keyboard has many modifier keys. Alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys. The Space bar is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.  Modifier keys  Modifier keys are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an active window. In contrast, pressing just will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing. The most widely used modifier keys include the Control key, Shift key and the Alt key. The AltGr key is used to access additional symbols for keys that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the Option key and Command key, respectively. On Sun Microsystems and Lisp machine keyboards, the Meta key is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a Windows key. Compact keyboard layouts often use a Fn key. \\"Dead keys\\" allow placement of a diacritic mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the Compose key). The Enter/Return key typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an \\"entry\\" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.  Cursor keys  Navigation keys or cursor keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next tab stop. The Insert key is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position \\"back\\" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The Backspace key deletes the preceding character. Lock keys lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The lock keys include Scroll lock, Num lock (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and Caps lock. System commands 4800-52 mainframe / dumb terminal keyboard, circa mid 1980s. Note the obscure configuration of modifier and arrow keys, line feed key, break key, blank keys, and repeat key. The SysRq and Print screen commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a \\"panic\\" button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the Linux kernel; see Magic SysRq key). The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but in the present it usually puts a screenshot in the clipboard. =Break key= The Break key/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties. =Escape key= The escape key (often abbreviated Esc) \\"nearly all of the time\\" signals Stop - QUIT - let me \\"get out of a dialog\\" (or pop-up window): LET ME ESCAPE. Another common application today of the Esc key is to trigger the Stop button in many web browsers. ESC origins ESC was part of the standard keyboard of the Teletype Model 33 (introduced in 1964 and used with many early minicomputers). https://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/kbd_top.shtml?large The DEC VT50, introduced July 1974, also had an Esc key. The TECO text editor (ca 1963) and its descendant Emacs (ca 1985) use the Esc key extensively. Historically it also served as a type of shift key, such that one or more following characters were interpreted differently, hence the term escape sequence, which refers to a series of characters, usually preceded by the escape character. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the \\"start\\" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10. =Enter key= The Enter key is located: One in the alphanumeric keys and the other one is in the numeric keys. When one worked something on their computer and wanted to do something with their work, pressing the enter key would do the command they ordered. Another function is to create a space for next paragraph. When one typed and finished typing a paragraph and they wanted to have a second paragraph, they could press enter and it would do spacing. =Shift key= Shift key: when one presses shift and a letter, it will capitalize the letter pressed with the shift key. Another use is to type more symbols than appear to be available, for instance the apostrophe key is accompanied with a quotation mark on the top. If one wants to type the quotation mark but pressed that key alone, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe. The quotation mark will only appear if both the required key and the Shift key are pressed. =Menu key= The Menu key or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only. This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 keyboard shortcut).  Number pad  Many, but not all, computer keyboards have a numeric keypad to the right of the alphabetic keyboard, often separated from the other groups of keys such as the function keys and system command keys, which contains numbers, basic mathematical symbols (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.), and a few function keys. In addition to the row of number keys above the top alphabetic row, most desktop keyboards have a number pad or accounting pad, on the right hand side of the keyboard. While num lock is set, the numbers on these keys duplicate the number row; if not, they have alternative functions as engraved. In addition to numbers, this pad has command symbols concerned with calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division symbols. The enter key in this keys indicate the equal sign.  Miscellaneous  Multimedia buttons on some keyboards give quick access to the Internet or control the volume of the speakers. On Japanese/Korean keyboards, there may be Language input keys for changing the language to use. Some keyboards have power management keys (e.g., power key, sleep key and wake key); Internet keys to access a web browser or E-mail; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls; or keys that can be programmed by the user to launch a specified application or a command like minimizing all windows.  Multiple layouts  It is possible to install multiple keyboard layouts within an operating system and switch between them, either through features implemented within the OS, or through an external application. Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac provide support to add keyboard layouts and choose from them.  Illumination  Keyboards and keypads may be illuminated from inside, especially on equipment for mobile use. Both keyboards built into computers and external ones may support backlighting; external backlit keyboards may have a wired USB connection, or be connected wirelessly and powered by batteries. Illumination facilitates the use of the keyboard or keypad in dark environments. For general productivity, only the keys may be uniformly backlit, without distracting light around the keys. Keys with integrated LED indicator lights Many gaming keyboards are designed to have an aesthetic as well as functional appeal, with multiple colours, and colour-coded keys to make it easier for gamers to find command keys while playing in a dark room. Many keyboards not otherwise illuminated may have small LED indicator lights in a few important function keys, or elsewhere on the housing, if their function is activated (see photo).  Technology   Key switches  In the first electronic keyboards in the early 1970s, the key switches were individual switches inserted into holes in metal frames. These keyboards cost from 80 to 120 USD and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were reed switches (contacts enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the switch plunger). In the mid-1970s, lower-cost direct- contact key switches were introduced, but their life in switch cycles was much shorter (rated ten million cycles) because they were open to the environment. This became more acceptable, however, for use in computer terminals at the time, which began to see increasingly shorter model lifespans as they advanced. In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies not to use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive- coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other \\"solid-state switch\\" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved, and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer. Meanwhile, IBM made their own keyboards, using their own patented technology: Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a \\"buckling spring\\" mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, triggering a hammer that presses two plastic sheets (membranes) with conductive traces together, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound and gives physical feedback for the typist, indicating that the key has been depressed.A Passion for the Keys: Particular About What You Type On? Relax ‚Äì You're Not Alone. Loose Wire, by Jeremy Wagstaff, Wall Street Journal, 23 November 2007. The first electronic keyboards had a typewriter key travel distance of 0.187 inches (4.75 mm), keytops were a half-inch (12.7 mm) high, and keyboards were about two inches (5 cm) thick. Over time, less key travel was accepted in the market, finally landing on 0.110 inches (2.79 mm). Coincident with this, Key Tronic was the first company to introduce a keyboard that was only about one inch thick. And now keyboards measure only about a half-inch thick. Cherry MX \\"Black\\" switches it is based on. MX switches are a common choice for mechanical keyboards. The tactile, non-clicky \\"brown\\" version of the Cherry MX switch shown in disassembled form (four parts, left and centre), with the top off (top right) and reassembled (bottom right). Keytops are an important element of keyboards. In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a \\"dish shape\\" on top, like typewriters before them. Keyboard key legends must be extremely durable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme mechanical wear from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by two-shot (or double- shot, or two-color) molding, where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to save cost, other methods were explored, such as sublimation printing and laser engraving, both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time. Initially, sublimation printing, where a special ink is printed onto the keycap surface and the application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or \\"keycaps\\", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material. Three final mechanical technologies brought keyboards to where they are today, driving the cost well under $10: # \\"Monoblock\\" keyboard designs were developed where individual switch housings were eliminated and a one-piece \\"monoblock\\" housing used instead. This was possible because of molding techniques that could provide very tight tolerances for the switch-plunger holes and guides across the width of the keyboard so that the key plunger-to-housing clearances were not too tight or too loose, either of which could cause the keys to bind. # The use of contact-switch membrane sheets under the monoblock. This technology came from flat-panel switch membranes, where the switch contacts are printed inside of a top and bottom layer, with a spacer layer in between, so that when pressure is applied to the area above, a direct electrical contact is made. The membrane layers can be printed by very-high volume, low-cost \\"reel-to-reel\\" printing machines, with each keyboard membrane cut and punched out afterwards. Plastic materials played a very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until \\"monoblocks\\" came along, GE's \\"self-lubricating\\" Delrin was the only plastic material for keyboard switch plungers that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling switch plungers was undesirable because it would attract dirt over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key plungers and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But Delrin was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use ABS plastic. However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75 mm to 2.79 mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monoblocks also made of ABS. In common use, the term \\"mechanical keyboard\\" refers to a keyboard with individual mechanical key switches, each of which contains a fully encased plunger with a spring below it and metallic electrical contacts on a side. The plunger sits on the spring and the key will often close the contacts when the plunger is pressed half-way. Other switches require the plunger to be fully pressed down. The depth at which the plunger must be pressed for the contacts to close is known as the activation distance. Analog keyboards with key switches whose activation distance can be reconfigured through software, optical switches that work by blocking laser beams, and Hall Effect keyboards that use key switches that use a magnet to activate a hall sensor, are also available.  Control processor  Scanning procedure Computer keyboards include control circuitry to convert key presses into key codes (usually scancodes) that the computer's electronics can understand. The key switches are connected via the printed circuit board in an electrical X-Y matrix where a voltage is provided sequentially to the Y lines and, when a key is depressed, detected sequentially by scanning the X lines. The first computer keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor was introduced in 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional to the extent that the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights. One test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the caps lock key. The keyboard sends the key code to the keyboard driver running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the Shift, alt and control state of the keyboard. Some lower-quality keyboards have multiple or false key entries due to inadequate electrical designs. These are caused by inadequate keyswitch \\"debouncing\\" or inadequate keyswitch matrix layout that don't allow multiple keys to be depressed at the same time, both circumstances which are explained below: When pressing a keyboard key, the key contacts may \\"bounce\\" against each other for several milliseconds before they settle into firm contact. When released, they bounce some more until they revert to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) \\"debounces\\" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one \\"confirmed\\" keystroke. Some low-quality keyboards also suffer problems with rollover (that is, when multiple keys pressed at the same time, or when keys are pressed so fast that multiple keys are down within the same milliseconds). Early \\"solid-state\\" keyswitch keyboards did not have this problem because the keyswitches are electrically isolated from each other, and early \\"direct-contact\\" keyswitch keyboards avoided this problem by having isolation diodes for every keyswitch. These early keyboards had \\"n-key\\" rollover, which means any number of keys can be depressed and the keyboard will still recognize the next key depressed. But when three keys are pressed (electrically closed) at the same time in a \\"direct contact\\" keyswitch matrix that doesn't have isolation diodes, the keyboard electronics can see a fourth \\"phantom\\" key which is the intersection of the X and Y lines of the three keys. Some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. \\"Three-key\\" rollover, also called \\"phantom key blocking\\" or \\"phantom key lockout\\", will only register three keys and ignore all others until one of the three keys is lifted. This is undesirable, especially for fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys), and games (designed for multiple key presses). As direct-contact membrane keyboards became popular, the available rollover of keys was optimized by analyzing the most common key sequences and placing these keys so that they do not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.  Connection types  Apple wireless keyboard There are several ways of connecting a keyboard to a system unit (more precisely, to its keyboard controller) using cables, including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the PS/2 and the USB connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary Apple Desktop Bus for its keyboard connector. Wireless keyboards have become popular. A wireless keyboard must have a transmitter built in, and a receiver connected to the computer's keyboard port; it communicates either by radio frequency (RF) or infrared (IR) signals. A wireless keyboard may use industry standard Bluetooth radio communication, in which case the receiver may be built into the computer. Wireless keyboards need batteries for power, and may be at risk of data eavesdropping. Wireless solar keyboards charge their batteries from small solar panels using natural or artificial light. The 1984 Apricot Portable is an early example of an IR keyboard.  Alternative text-entering methods  On-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility Optical character recognition (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine- readable format (for example, a Linotype-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future. Speech recognition converts speech into machine- readable text (that is, a string of character codes). This technology has also reached an advanced state and is implemented in various software products. For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) speech recognition is starting to replace the keyboard. However, the lack of privacy when issuing voice commands and dictation makes this kind of input unsuitable for many environments. Pointing devices can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are Graffiti, Dasher and on-screen virtual keyboards.  Other issues   Keystroke logging  Unencrypted wireless Bluetooth keyboards are known to be vulnerable to signal theft by placing a covert listening device in the same room as the keyboard to sniff and record Bluetooth packets for the purpose of logging keys typed by the user. Microsoft wireless keyboards 2011 and earlier are documented to have this vulnerability. Keystroke logging (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legally to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by hackers for various illegal or malicious acts. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypass other security measures. Keystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices. Anti-spyware applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by anti-spyware programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a firewall does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured. Network monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from \\"phoning home\\" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window. Keyboards are also known to emit electromagnetic signatures that can be detected using special spying equipment to reconstruct the keys pressed on the keyboard. Neal O'Farrell, executive director of the Identity Theft Council, revealed to InformationWeek that \\"More than 25 years ago, a couple of former spooks showed me how they could capture a user's ATM PIN, from a van parked across the street, simply by capturing and decoding the electromagnetic signals generated by every keystroke,\\" O'Farrell said. \\"They could even capture keystrokes from computers in nearby offices, but the technology wasn't sophisticated enough to focus in on any specific computer.\\"  Physical injury  Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability.Berkeley Lab. Integrated Safety Management: Ergonomics . Website. Retrieved 9 July 2008. Research suggests that the upright position formerly advocated can lead to degenerative disc disease, and that a 45 degree reclined position is healthier.Radiology Society of North America The Way You Sit Will Never Be the Same! Alterations of Lumbosacral Curvature and Intervertebral Disc Morphology in Normal Subjects in Variable Sitting Positions Using Whole-body Positional MRI . The use of any keyboard may cause serious injury (that is, carpal tunnel syndrome or other repetitive strain injury) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to get up and walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing. Some adaptive technology ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to speech recognition software can reduce the risk of injury. Pause software reminds the user to pause frequently. Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a vertical mouse or joystick mouse may provide relief. By using a touchpad or a stylus pen with a graphic tablet, in place of a mouse, one can lessen the repetitive strain on the arms and hands.

It may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or be a somewhat isolated depression (such as a kettle, vernal pool, or prairie pothole). It may contain shallow water with aquatic plants and animals. Factors that affect the type of life found in a pond include depth and duration of water level, nutrients, shade, presence or absence of inlets and outlets, effects of grazing animals, and salinity. Ponds are frequently man-made, or expanded beyond their original depth and bounds. Among their many uses, ponds provide water for agriculture and livestock, aid in habitat restoration, serve as fish hatcheries, are components of landscape architecture, may store thermal energy as solar ponds, and treat wastewater as treatment ponds. Ponds may be freshwater, saltwater, or brackish. Technical definitions Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur, India The technical distinction between a pond and a lake has not been universally standardized. Limnologists and freshwater biologists have proposed formal definitions for pond, in part to include 'bodies of water where light penetrates to the bottom of the waterbody,' 'bodies of water shallow enough for rooted water plants to grow throughout,' and 'bodies of water which lack wave action on the shoreline.' Each of these definitions has met with resistance or disapproval, as the defining characteristics are each difficult to measure or verify. Accordingly, some organizations and researchers have settled on technical definitions of pond and lake that rely on size alone. Even among organizations and researchers who distinguish lakes from ponds by size alone, there is no universally recognised standard for the maximum size of a pond. The international Ramsar wetland convention sets the upper limit for pond size as . Researchers for the British charity Pond Conservation (now called Freshwater Habitats Trust) have defined a pond to be 'a man-made or natural waterbody that is between and in area, which holds water for four months of the year or more.' Other European biologists have set the upper size limit at . In practice, a body of water is called a pond or a lake on an individual basis, as conventions change from place to place and over time. In North America, even larger bodies of water have been called ponds; for example, Crystal Lake at , Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts at , and nearby Spot Pond at . There are numerous examples in other states, where bodies of water less than are being called lakes. As the case of Crystal Lake shows, marketing purposes can sometimes be the driving factor behind the categorization. Formation Pond at the Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses National Park, Brazil Ponds can result from a wide range of natural processes. Any depression in the ground which collects and retains a sufficient amount of precipitation can be considered a pond, and such depressions can be formed by a variety of geological and ecological events. Rivers often leave behind ponds in natural floodplains after spring flooding, and these can be very important to breeding fish, particularly in large river systems like the Amazon. Retreating glaciers can leave behind landscapes filled with small depressions, each developing its own pond; an example is the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Many areas of landscape contain small depressions which form temporary ponds after spring snow melts, or during rainy seasons; these are called vernal ponds, and may be important sites for amphibian breeding. Some ponds are created by animals. Beaver ponds are the best-known example, but alligators also excavate ponds as well. In landscapes with organic soils, fires can also create depressions during periods of drought; these become open water when normal water levels return. Characteristics Claude Monet's artistic production was a series of about 250 oil paintings depicting the lily pond in his flower garden. A defining feature of a pond is the presence of standing water, which provides habitat for wetland plants and animals. Familiar examples might include water lilies, frogs, turtles, and herons. Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by wetland, and these wetlands support the aquatic food web, provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. Some grazing animals like geese and muskrats consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food. In many other cases, however, the pond plants fall into the water and decay. Many invertebrates then feed on the decaying plants, and these invertebrates provide food for wetland species including fish, dragonflies, and herons. The open water may allow algae to grow, and these algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and minnows. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae. Hence, ponds often have many different animal species using the wide array of food sources. They, therefore, provide an important source of biological diversity in landscapes. Vernal ponds are ponds which dry up for part of the year. They are so called because they are typically at their peak depth in the spring (the meaning of \\"vernal\\" comes form the Latin word for spring). Naturally occurring vernal ponds do not usually have fish. The absence of fish is a very important characteristic since it provides amphibians with breeding locations free from predation by fish. Hence, introducing fish to a pond can have seriously detrimental consequences. In some parts of the world, such as California, the vernal ponds have rare and endangered plant species. On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the Mississippi Gopher Frog. Conservation and management Formal rock garden pond with waterfall Ponds, being small, are easily disrupted by human activity, such as hikers. Drainage of ponds is a frequent problem in agricultural areas, such as in the prairie potholes of North America. Although ponds are a useful source of water for cattle, overgrazing and wading can turn a pond into a muddy hole. Nutrient sources such as fertilized pastures, human sewage, and even lawn fertilizer can cause explosive growth of algae and the loss of rooted plants and many other aquatic species. Roads near ponds can kill large numbers of amphibians and turtles that may migrate to and from the pond as part of their annual breeding cycle. Many well-intentioned people introduce fish to ponds, being unaware that some species may eat aquatic plants, stir up sediment, and eat the young of amphibians and many other invertebrate species. The gentle slope of land into ponds also provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows. The construction of retaining walls, or lawns, can severely degrade the life in a pond. In landscapes where ponds are artificially constructed, they are done so to provide wildlife viewing opportunities, to treat wastewater, or for aesthetic purposes, such as part of a golf course. The design of a pond determines how productive it will be for wildlife. In general, gently sloping shorelines with broad expanses of wetland plants not only provide the best conditions for wildlife, but they help protect water quality from sources in the surrounding landscapes. It is also beneficial to allow water levels to fall each year during drier periods. Roads and houses should be kept as far away as possible. Another important way to add ponds back into landscapes is to restore rivers so that they can flood and meander to create large numbers of natural ponds, including vernal pools and wetlands, in river valleys. Nomenclature A pond in Swarzynice, Poland In origin, a pond is a variant form of the word pound, meaning a confining enclosure. As straying cattle are enclosed in a pound so water is enclosed in a pond. In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian, as stew ponds, mill ponds and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds. Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \\"stock pond\\", used for watering livestock. Pond usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water. Pond in winter Some regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than . Minnesota, known as the \\"land of 10,000 lakes\\", is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition, but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore. The term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from surface runoff (ponded water). There are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is lochan, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed playas. Uses A alt= Ponds are used for the provision of fish and other wildlife including waterfowl, which is a source of food for humans. Pollutants entering ponds are often substantially mitigated by the natural sedimentation and biological activities within the water body. Ponds are also a major contributor to local ecosystem richness and diversity for both plants and animals. In the Indian subcontinent, Hindu temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take baths. These ponds are considered sacred. In medieval times in Europe, it was typical for many monastery and castles (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have fish ponds. These are still common in Europe and in East Asia (notably Japan), where koi may be kept. Waste stabilization ponds are used as a low-cost method for wastewater treatment. In agriculture, treatment ponds may reduce nutrients released downstream from the pond. They may also provide irrigation reservoirs at times of drought.

The flow of a stream is controlled by three inputs - surface water, subsurface water and groundwater. The surface and subsurface water are highly variable between periods of rainfall. Groundwater, on the other hand, has a relatively constant input and is controlled more by long-term patterns of precipitation. The stream encompasses surface, subsurface and groundwater fluxes that respond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biotic controls.Alexander, L. C., Autrey, B., DeMeester, J., Fritz, K. M., Golden, H. E., Goodrich, D. C., ... & McManus, M. G. (2015). Connectivity of streams and wetlands to downstream waters: review and synthesis of the scientific evidence (Vol. 475). EPA/600/R-14. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to by a variety of local or regional names. Long large streams are usually called rivers. Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity.

Other terminology ; Bar: A shoal that develops in a stream as sediment is deposited as the current slows or is impeded by wave action at the confluence. ; Bifurcation: A fork into two or more streams. ; Channel: A depression created by constant erosion that carries the stream's flow. ; Confluence: The point at which the two streams merge. If the two tributaries are of approximately equal size, the confluence may be called a fork. ; Drainage basin: (also known as a watershed in the United States) The area of land where water flows into a stream. A large drainage basin such as the Amazon River contains many smaller drainage basins. ; Floodplain: Lands adjacent to the stream that are subject to flooding when a stream overflows its banks. ; Gaging station: A site along the route of a stream or river, used for reference marking or water monitoring. ; Headwaters: The part of a stream or river proximate to its source. The word is most commonly used in the plural where there is no single point source. ; Knickpoint: The point on a stream's profile where a sudden change in stream gradient occurs. ; Mouth: The point at which the stream discharges, possibly via an estuary or delta, into a static body of water such as a lake or ocean. ; Pool: A segment where the water is deeper and slower moving. ; Rapids: A turbulent, fast-flowing stretch of a stream or river. ; Riffle: A segment where the flow is shallower and more turbulent. ; River: A large natural stream, which may be a waterway. ; Run: A somewhat smoothly flowing segment of the stream. ; Source: The spring from which the stream originates, or other point of origin of a stream. ; Spring: The point at which a stream emerges from an underground course through unconsolidated sediments or through caves. A stream can, especially with caves, flow aboveground for part of its course, and underground for part of its course. ; Stream bed: The bottom of a stream. ; Stream corridor: Stream, its floodplains, and the transitional upland fringe\\"Stream Corridor Structure\\" Adapted from Stream Corridor Restoration: Principles, Processes, and Practices ; Streamflow: The water moving through a stream channel. ; Thalweg: The river's longitudinal section, or the line joining the deepest point in the channel at each stage from source to mouth. ; Waterfall or cascade: The fall of water where the stream goes over a sudden drop called a knickpoint; some knickpoints are formed by erosion when water flows over an especially resistant stratum, followed by one less so. The stream expends kinetic energy in \\"trying\\" to eliminate the knickpoint. ; Wetted perimeter: The line on which the stream's surface meets the channel walls. Sources Diamond Ridge, Alaska, US Creek in Perisher Ski Resort, Australia Streams typically derive most of their water from precipitation in the form of rain and snow. Most of this water re-enters the atmosphere by evaporation from soil and water bodies, or by the evapotranspiration of plants. Some of the water proceeds to sink into the earth by infiltration and becomes groundwater, much of which eventually enters streams. Some precipitated water is temporarily locked up in snow fields and glaciers, to be released later by evaporation or melting. The rest of the water flows off the land as runoff, the proportion of which varies according to many factors, such as wind, humidity, vegetation, rock types, and relief. This runoff starts as a thin film called sheet wash, combined with a network of tiny rills, together constituting sheet runoff; when this water is concentrated in a channel, a stream has its birth. Some creeks may start from ponds or lakes. Stream in Southbury, Connecticut, US Characteristics ; Ranking To qualify as a stream, a body of water must be either recurring or perennial. Recurring (intermittent) streams have water in the channel for at least part of the year. A stream of the first order is a stream which does not have any other recurring or perennial stream feeding into it. When two first- order streams come together, they form a second-order stream. When two second- order streams come together, they form a third-order stream. Streams of lower order joining a higher order stream do not change the order of the higher stream. Thus, if a first-order stream joins a second-order stream, it remains a second-order stream. It is not until a second-order stream combines with another second-order stream that it becomes a third-order stream. ; Gradient The gradient of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character and is entirely determined by its base level of erosion. The base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean, a lake or pond, or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient, and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream. In geological terms, the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course. If this base level is low, then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient, and if the base level is relatively high, then the stream will form a flood plain and meander. ; Meander Meanders are looping changes of direction of a stream caused by the erosion and deposition of bank materials. These are typically serpentine in form. Typically, over time the meanders gradually migrate downstream. If some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander, a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter, leaving behind an arc-shaped body of water termed an oxbow lake or bayou. A flood may also cause a meander to be cut through in this way. ; Profile Typically, streams are said to have a particular profile, beginning with steep gradients, no flood plain, and little shifting of channels, eventually evolving into streams with low gradients, wide flood plains, and extensive meanders. The initial stage is sometimes termed a \\"young\\" or \\"immature\\" stream, and the later state a \\"mature\\" or \\"old\\" stream. However, a stream may meander for some distance before falling into a \\"young\\" stream condition. ; Stream load Streams can carry sediment, or alluvium. The amount of load it can carry (capacity) as well as the largest object it can carry (competence) are both dependent on the velocity of the stream. Intermittent and ephemeral streams Australian creek, low in the dry season, carrying little water. The energetic flow of the stream had, in flood, moved finer sediment further downstream. There is a pool to lower right and a riffle to upper left of the photograph. A perennial stream is one which flows continuously all year. Water Supply Paper 494. Some perennial streams may only have continuous flow in segments of its stream bed year round during years of normal rainfall. Water Supply Paper 494. Blue-line streams are perennial streams and are marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line. Ephemeral stream Generally, streams that flow only during and immediately after precipitation are termed ephemeral. There is no clear demarcation between surface runoff and an ephemeral stream, and some ephemeral streams can be classed as intermittent--flow all but disappearing in the normal course of seasons but ample flow (backups) restoring stream presence such circumstances are documented when stream beds have opened up a path into mines or other underground chambers.Black Creek (Susquehanna River)#Hydrology_and_climate, \`Black Creek is an ephemeral stream. It used to drain an area between Turtle Creek and the Susquehanna River, but now loses its flow to underground mines via broken bedrock. Its channel is also disrupted by strip mines and rock piles.', 14 Nov 2016. Intermittent stream ;or seasonal stream In the United States, an intermittent or seasonal stream is one that only flows for part of the year and is marked on topographic maps with a line of blue dashes and dots. A wash or desert wash is normally a dry streambed in the deserts of the American Southwest which flows only after significant rainfall. Washes can fill up quickly during rains, and there may be a sudden torrent of water after a thunderstorm begins upstream, such as during monsoonal conditions. These flash floods often catch travelers by surprise. An intermittent stream can also be called an arroyo in Latin America, a winterbourne in Britain, or a wadi in the Arabic-speaking world. In Italy, an intermittent stream is termed a torrent . In full flood the stream may or may not be \\"torrential\\" in the dramatic sense of the word, but there will be one or more seasons in which the flow is reduced to a trickle or less. Typically torrents have Apennine rather than Alpine sources, and in the summer they are fed by little precipitation and no melting snow. In this case the maximum discharge will be during the spring and autumn. However, there are also glacial torrents with a different seasonal regime. In Australia, an intermittent stream is usually called a creek and marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line. Drainage basins The extent of land basin drained by a stream is termed its drainage basin (also known in North America as the watershed and, in British English, as a catchment). A basin may also be composed of smaller basins. For instance, the Continental Divide in North America divides the mainly easterly-draining Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean basins from the largely westerly-flowing Pacific Ocean basin. The Atlantic Ocean basin, however, may be further subdivided into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico drainages. (This delineation is termed the Eastern Continental Divide.) Similarly, the Gulf of Mexico basin may be divided into the Mississippi River basin and several smaller basins, such as the Tombigbee River basin. Continuing in this vein, a component of the Mississippi River basin is the Ohio River basin, which in turn includes the Kentucky River basin, and so forth. Crossings Stream crossings are where streams are crossed by roads, pipelines, railways, or any other thing which might restrict the flow of the stream in ordinary or flood conditions. Any structure over or in a stream which results in limitations on the movement of fish or other ecological elements may be an issue.

Russia‚ÄìSlovenia relations are foreign relations between Russia and Slovenia. Both countries established diplomatic relations on May 25, 1992. Russia has an embassy in Ljubljana. Slovenia has an embassy in Moscow and two honorary consulates (in Saint Petersburg and Samara). Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe. In March 2011, the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited Slovenia and met with the Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor and the President of Slovenia Danilo T√ºrk. The Russian and Slovenian delegations discussed economic, scientific and cultural partnership, especially regarding the construction of the South Stream pipeline. Slovenia and Russia are traditionally strong economic partners. This applies not only to the inter- state relations but also to the ties between regions. The level of economic exchange between Slovenia and various Russian regions is constantly growing. Such growth is supported by agreements on cooperation, joint ventures and business delegations. Russia is steadily in the top ten trade partners of Slovenia and exports from this Alpine Republic substantially overweigh imports from Russia. The bilateral relations, however, were seriously affected in 2009 by external factors, namely the global financial and economic crisis led to the downturn of economic activities and lower consumption which, as a consequence, resulted in a significant down-slide in the trade between the two countries. The structure of the trade exchange during the crisis though remained largely the same - 60-70 % of Slovenian exports are pharmaceuticals, wired communications systems, electrical equipment, mechanical installations and paints. Imports from Russia are mostly comprised by oil and gas products and their derivatives, aluminium products, together comprising 70-75 % of the total Russian import. After the Ukrainian crisis began in 2013 and later prolonged into conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Slovenia sides with Ukraine over territorial integrity;https://www.europeanvalues.net/slovenia/ however unlike most of Western countries, Slovenia refrains from criticizing against Russia, instead urging for political solution to handle the problem.http://www.sloveniatimes.com/slovenia-expects-diplomatic-solution-of- crimea-crisis  References   Slovenian community of Russia   External links  * Embassy of Russia in Ljubljana * Embassy of Slovenia in Moscow Slovenia Bilateral relations of Slovenia ","title":"Russia‚ÄìSlovenia relations"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",H]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/46.md","filePath":"quotes/46.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/46.md"},z=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{G as __pageData,z as default};
