She was the second Indian woman to win an individual gold medal at the Asian Games and the first to win it on Indian soil. Early life Valsamma was born on 21 October 1960 in Ottathai, Kannur district of Kerala. She started her athletics career during school days though she only took it more seriously when she moved to Mercy College,Mercy College, Palakkad Palakkad, for further studies. Her first medal was for Kerala in the 100 metres hurdles and pentathlon in the Inter-University Championship at Pune in 1979. She was enrolled in Southern Railway (India) and was coached by A. K.

She created a great impression at the Inter-State Meet at Bangalore in 1981 by winning five gold medals, the hurdles over 100 and 400 metres in addition to the 400 metres flat and the 400 m and 100 m relays. That performance catapulted her into the Railway and national teams and in 1982 she became the national champion over 400-metre hurdles with a new record, which was also better than the Asian record. Professional athletics career Valsamma won the gold medal in the 400 m hurdles in an Indian and Asian record time of 58.47 seconds in front of a home crowd at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in the 1982 Asian Games.

Early life  Barrow was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1952 and grew up in a part of town there called Alamo Heights. His father played piano and organ, as had his father, Arthur Barrow of Buffalo, New York, a strict piano teacher and organist. When he was 13, he washed neighborhood cars until he had saved enough money to buy his first electric guitar (an Alamo) and his first amplifier (a Kent). He learned how to play music by ear by copying surf guitar records like The Ventures, and later, Jimi Hendrix, and still later, Frank Zappa. He played in local bands through junior high and high school during the 1960s. He began to study classical organ in 1970. While attending Alamo Heights High School, Arthur Barrow cut his musical teeth playing lead guitar in rock bands such as The Restless Ones (Jesse Childs on bass, Mike Maxwell on drums, and Jim Collins on rhythm guitar) and The Wisdom (Ian \\"Toby\\" French on vocals, Raymond Tolbert on bass, Tom Graham on keyboards, James Yeverino on drums,and Jim Collins on rhythm guitar) playing fraternity parties, high school dances, and small concerts in the San Antonio area. His fellow band members knew that Arthur was \\"marked for greatness\\" due to his outstanding talent and ability to quickly learn songs and teach them to the other band members. (source?). He attended North Texas State University (now University of North Texas) in Denton, Texas from 1971 to 1975 where he studied composition and organ. He began teaching himself bass guitar in 1974 while at school there. He spent many hours in the electronic music labs learning about analog synthesis on the Moog modular systems there. He graduated cum laude, receiving a bachelor of music degree with a major in composition, specializing in electronic music.  Professional career  In 1975 he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a professional music career, with one of his main goals being to play in Frank Zappa's band. He took whatever kind of musical work he could get - night clubs, weddings, high school dances, a few sessions. He met Robby Krieger in 1976 and recorded synthesizer with The Doors on the album American Prayer. He formed a jazz group with Bruce Fowler and Don Preston called Loose Connection in the latter 1970s. They made some recordings in Echo Park and performed a few times in Los Angeles. They did some recordings in Hollywood with Vinnie Colaiuta in December 1978. In mid-1978, he passed the audition and began playing bass in Frank Zappa's band. In 1979, he also took on the duties of being the \\"clonemeister\\", or band rehearsal director. The band rehearsed for eight to ten hours a day, five days a week. He would run the rehearsals for the first half of the day, then Zappa would take over when he arrived. He did four tours with Zappa and can be heard playing bass, guitar and keyboards on about a dozen recorded albums. In the early 1980s he co-wrote music, recorded and toured the U.S. with Robby Krieger. They had a live band then for a short time called Red Shift that did only a few recordings and gigs in the LA area. By this time, having a 1/2\\" eight track tape recorder, an electric piano and some synthesizer gear, he focused a lot of attention to writing and recording music at home. He began working with Giorgio Moroder in the mid-1980s on albums and film sound tracks, including Scarface (1983) and Top Gun (1986). He did keyboards, programming, bass, and arranging for a wide range of artists including Joe Cocker, Diana Ross, Billy Idol, Berlin, The Motels, and others. He opened his own Lotek recording studio in the Mar Vista district of Los Angeles in 1985. Through the latter 1980s and into the 1990s he has produced albums and composed sound tracks for films and television at his studio. He has composed and produced three solo CDs and he is currently working on a fourth CD as well as other projects, like the Strange News from Mars - feat. Tommy Mars and Jon Larsen, and The Mar Vista Philharmonic, featuring Tommy Mars, Bruce Fowler, Vinnie Colaiuta, and other Frank Zappa alumni, on the Zonic Entertainment label. In 2010 he recorded an album with Robby Krieger called Singularity which was nominated for a Grammy. It includes performances by Vinnie Colaiuta, Bruce Fowler, Walt Fowler and Sal Marquez among others. Most of the album was co-written by Arthur Barrow and Robby Krieger and recorded at Barrow's studio. In 2012 and again in 2015, Barrow did residencies at The University of North Texas in connection with a class on Frank Zappa which included concerts of Zappa'a music. View the 2015 concert here: He also did a Zappa residency and concert at The University of South Dakota in 2013.

The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of industrial disputes in that state. The primary courtrooms were located in the Chief Secretary‚Äôs Building in Macquarie Street, Sydney central business district. The Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales consisted of both judicial and non-judicial members, and its members could exercise the arbitration powers of the commission. However, only the Commission sitting \\"in Court Session\\" could exercise the judicial functions of the commission. When the commission sat as the \\"Commission in Court Session\\", it was referred to and was known as the \\"Industrial Court of New South Wales\\". Only a judicial member could hear matters where such relief was sought from the Court. Jurisdiction of the Court The Court had jurisdiction over matters about unfair contracts, prosecutions of offences under the Industrial Relations Act, proceedings for breaches of industrial instruments, appeals against decisions of inferior courts in industrial matters (such as from the Chief Industrial Magistrates Court of New South Wales), and prosecution of occupational health and safety offences under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW). The Court also has jurisdiction over prosecutions for safety related dismissals (see section 23 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) and may grant remedies for safety related dismissals, such as reinstatement and continuity of employment. The Commission when sitting as the Court was and sat as a superior court of record and is of equivalent status to the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales although it does not hold the supervisory jurisdiction held by the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

The name of the court was changed by the Industrial Relations Amendment Act 2005 (NSW) to the \\"Industrial Court of New South Wales\\". Jurisdictional limits of the Court and the Commission Persons seeking relief in the Court for unfair contract needed to bring the claim within 2 years and earn under $200,000 per annum (an extension to the time limit of 3 months was available in certain circumstances). A prosecution for a breach of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) or other occupational health and safety legislation needed to be brought within two years of the breach or two years after the conclusion of a Coronial Inquest by the NSW Coroner. The Howard Government's WorkChoices reforms to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), which took effect on 27 March 2007, excluded the operation of the Commission and Court's jurisdictions over matters involving Constitutional Corporations and persons employed by such corporations.

Early life Pitt was born at Boconnoc, Cornwall, the only son of Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford and Anne Wilkinson (Lady Camelford). He had a sister, Anne. His early years were spent in Switzerland. He was later educated at Charterhouse School. He spent a number of years there which he regarded as the happiest of his life. Having developed a love of the sea, when his father tried to have him transferred to another English public school, he refused to attend. Instead he decided to join the navy. In the autumn of 1781, while he was under seven years of age, his name was borne on the books of HMS Tobago, but he most likely entered the navy, in actuality, some years later. Pitt was on , under Captain Edward Riou in 1789‚Äì90 when Guardian struck an iceberg near the Cape of Good Hope; most of the crew elected to leave the ship, but with Pitt and the remaining crew's assistance, Riou managed to bring her into Table Bay. The Vancouver Expedition On 13 March 1791, Pitt came aboard to participate in the Vancouver Expedition of diplomacy and exploration. All officer berths having been filled, he signed on as an able seaman. A friend of the family, Lt. Zachary Mudge, was informally requested to watch over the unruly 16-year-old. When the expedition reached Tahiti, Pitt was flogged for trying to trade a piece of broken barrel-hoop for the romantic favours of an island woman. Vancouver had given strict orders against romancing the natives, since such escapades had played a major role in the Mutiny on the Bounty; in addition, any captain was required to punish pilferage. Pitt was flogged again for unauthorised trade with Indians at Port Stewart and then again for breaking the binnacle glass while skylarking with another gentleman. Finally he was placed in irons for being found sleeping on watch, and served this sentence with common seamen. No-one on the expedition could have known that Pitt had become a member of the House of Lords after his father had died on 19 June 1793, but his subsequent conduct leaves no doubt that he resented being disciplined by the low-born Vancouver. When left the expedition to return home in 1793, Vancouver sent Pitt with her, along with a letter to Evan Nepean complaining of his conduct. In The Caneing in Conduit Street (1796), James Gillray caricatured Thomas Pitt's streetcorner assault on George Vancouver. Pitt left Daedalus in Hawaii, found his way to Malacca and joined HMS Resistance as an able seaman on 8 December 1794. He was soon appointed acting lieutenant, but on 24 November 1795 was summarily discharged and left to find his own way home. He took passage in the Union, which was cast away on the coast of Ceylon. He eventually made his way to Europe. Meanwhile, Vancouver had completed his expedition and returned to England in 1795. Pitt's allies, including his cousin, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, treated Vancouver badly enough. However Thomas Pitt took a more direct role; on 29 August 1796 he sent Vancouver a letter heaping many insults on the head of his former captain, and challenging him to a duel. Vancouver gravely replied that he was unable \\"in a private capacity to answer for his public conduct in his official duty\\" and offered instead to submit to formal examination by flag officers. Pitt chose instead to stalk Vancouver, ultimately assaulting him on a London street corner. The terms of their legal dispute required both parties to keep the peace, but nothing stopped his civilian brother Charles from interposing and giving Pitt blow after blow until onlookers restrained the attacker. Charges and counter-charges flew in the press, with the wealthy Camelford faction having the greater firepower until Vancouver, ailing from his long naval service, died. Later life Pitt was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 7 April 1797 and was appointed acting commander of over the head of her first-lieutenant, Charles Peterson, who was his senior. A contemporary account describes Pitt as being of eccentric appearance during this period of his life; dressing in a shabby lieutenant's uniform with buttons turned green with verdigris, topped by an oversized gold-laced hat. In 1798 Lieutenant Peterson transferred away from Favourite and was assigned command of HMS Perdrix in 1798. Both ships were at dock in Antigua when the young officers quarreled over rank. Peterson drew up his men to resist, but Pitt walked up to him, and on Peterson's thrice refusing to obey his orders, shot him dead. Pitt was court-martialled but, probably because England was currently in a panic over the recent Spithead and Nore mutinies, acquitted. In October 1798, Pitt was appointed to HMS Charon. The following January, he was arrested as a result of attempting an unauthorised visit to France, a nation with which England was at war. Angered, Pitt quit the Navy and returned to London. There, Pitt seems not to have moderated his conduct. On 17 May 1799 he was fined for knocking a man down stairs in a quarrel. In January 1802, when he refused to illuminate his house to celebrate the peace with France, an angry mob smashed his darkened windows; he fought the mob until subdued. In 1799 he contributed ¬£1,500 to the establishment of a school by William Nicholson (the chemist) at 10 Soho Square. Death Pitt's life came to an end when he quarrelled with his friend, Captain Best R.N., over a report that the latter had made an uncomplimentary remark about Pitt to a lady whose favours Pitt was then enjoying but who had previously been Best's mistress. Learning of this, Pitt challenged Best and insulted him. The following morning, they met again at a coffee house and Best asked Pitt to withdraw his remarks based upon their former friendship; he refused, possibly knowing that Best's famous skill with the pistol would leave him open to accusations of cowardice. On 7 March 1804, they duelled in a meadow ‚Äì adjacent to the grounds of Holland House ‚Äì with pistols; Pitt missed; Best did not. The bullet had passed through Pitt's fifth rib, the right lobe of his lungs, and finally into the sixth vertebra of his spine. Following the duel, both Best and his second departed. Pitt's second and the local gardeners carried Pitt to the nearby Little Holland House, where surgeon Simon Nickolson examined him. Pitt had been left paralysed and his chest cavity was filled with blood. He died from his wounds three days later. The then owner of the house, Lord Holland, erected an antique Roman altar on the spot where Camelford fell, inscribed with the legend \\"HOC DIS MAN. VOTO DISCORDIAM DEPRECAMUR.\\" Pitt's will made clear that Best was not to be charged in the event of his death. It also pledged ¬£1000 to the city of Berne, Switzerland. Camelford having no known heir, the title became extinct. The attitude of the public toward this violent and unrestrained man may be shown by a quip of the day. His will had directed that his body be buried on the island St. Pierre, Lake Biel, in Switzerland, a place dear to his childhood, but the war delayed this. The body was therefore embalmed and placed in a crypt at St Anne's Church, Soho, whence it disappeared without explanation.The Passing Parade ‚Äì John Doremus. Evenings with George Illich, Radio 2CH, 20:40 30 November 2009. This became the object of humour, with wits merrily quipping \\"What has become of Lord Camelford's body?\\" Insanity Throughout Pitt's life, many thought him to be mad due to his violent nature. He had a strong sense of honour and was far from cowardly, but he was frequently embroiled in violence, which was ultimately the cause of his death. Furthermore, there was rarely a time in his later life when Pitt was not engaged in some legal battle. Following his death, his wish to leave ¬£1000 to the city of Berne was viewed by one acquaintance as \\"proof of his madness\\". When a full-length biography of Pitt was published in 1978, author Nikolai Tolstoy gave it the title The Half-Mad Lord in reference to this characteristic.

The airport is planned to be a transit hub for people from other countries such as Malaysia, Brunei and Philippines who is going to travel to other cities in Indonesia.Juwata Airport is a destination point of the ASEAN Single Aviation Market under Protocol I and II. The airport area and runway is also shared with Suharnoko Harbani Air Force Base, a Type A airbase of the TNI-AU (Indonesian Air Force). The airbase is named after the former Minister of Industry of Indonesia, Suharnoko Harbani, who was also formerly an Air Force officer. Formed in 2006, the establishment of this air base is essentially part of the strategy and efforts to realize the defense of the country from the potential and development of threats that will threaten the Indonesia as well as the organization's demands from the Air Force Operations Command II in Makassar to facilitate control of its duties. Before the formation of the Air Base, there was already an Indonesian Air Force post which was under the Balikpapan Air Force Base but due to the development of situation and tension with Malaysia in Ambalat, the leadership of the Air Force decided to form a new airbase.

Life and career Condon arrived in New York City from Ireland in 1833 and graduated from theological seminary in 1852, after which he traveled to Oregon by ship. As a minister at The Dalles, he became interested in the fossils he found in the area. He found fossil seashells on the Crooked River and fossil camels and other animals along the John Day River. Many of his discoveries were in the present-day John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. He corresponded with noted scientists, including Spencer Baird of the Smithsonian, Edward Cope of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Joseph Leidy, O.C. Marsh, and John C. Merriam, and provided specimens to major museums. Condon was appointed the first State Geologist for Oregon in 1872. He resigned that post to become first professor of geology at the University of Oregon. Previously he was a teacher at Pacific University in Forest Grove. In The Two Islands and What Came of Them, a geology book published in 1902, Condon wrote about two widely separated regions of Oregon that contain its oldest rocks, the Klamath Mountains in the southwestern part of the state and the Blue Mountains in the northeast. The book attempted to summarize what was then known about the state's geology and to draw conclusions about its geologic past. Condon was an advocate of theistic evolution. He has been described as a \\"Christian Darwinist\\".Maynard, Guy; Holt, Kathleen. (2003). Best Essays NW: Perspectives from Oregon Quarterly Magazine. University of Oregon Press. p. 211.

Overview A followup to their earlier \\"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\\", the song is about how Snoopy had to go out and fight the Red Baron on Christmas Eve. The Baron has Snoopy at his mercy after a long dogfight, but instead of shooting him down he forces Snoopy to land and offers Snoopy a holiday toast. Afterward, Snoopy and the Red Baron fly their separate ways, \\"each knowing they'd meet on some other day\\". The release begins with an unknown chorus singing \\"O Tannenbaum\\" (\\"O Christmas Tree\\"). The middle of the song is bridged by chimes ringing out a phrase from \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\". The chimes can also can be heard during the fade-out at the end of the song. The album version of the song has a simulated radio news report of failed efforts at a Christmas truce, leading to Snoopy being sent out to hunt his sworn foe. The song references the 1914 \\"The Christmas Truce\\" of World War I which was initiated not by German and British commanders, but by the soldiers themselves. The length of the cease-fire varied by location, and was reported to have been as brief as Christmas Day or as long as the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. Trench-bound combatants exchanged small gifts across the lines, with Germans giving beer to the British, who sent tobacco and tinned meat back in return. No Man's Land was cleared of dead bodies, trenches were repaired and drained, and troops from both sides shared pictures of their families and, in some places, used No Man's Land for friendly games of football. The song even has the initiator correct as it was generally the German soldiers who called over to the British and initiated the truce and, in the song, it is the Red Baron‚Äîa German WWI hero‚Äîwho extends the hand of Christmas friendship to Snoopy.  Reception  \\"Snoopy's Christmas\\" reached the No. 1 position in the New Zealand and Australia singles charts in 1967, and remains a popular Christmas song in those countries. The song was the fastest-selling single at the time it was originally released and is estimated to be the biggest selling overseas single sold in New Zealand in the 20th century. The song frequently reenters the New Zealand singles chart, charting in December 1987, 1988, 1989, and 2013. \\"Snoopy's Christmas\\" was also voted \\"the worst Christmas song of all time\\" by readers of the New Zealand Herald in 2007.

Motive The motive behind the rampage was not immediately known, though it was suggested that Sanurip was suffering from depression and was not in a healthy state, perhaps due to a malaria infection. It was further reported that an army transporter, carrying the two soldiers killed in Mapenduma, made a fuel stop at Timika airport that morning, and that Sanurip began shooting after seeing their remains and realising that one of them was a friend of his, though it was stated by military spokesmen this information was not true and that there was no connection between the arrival of the bodies and the mass murder.

It was written by Steve Darnall with art by Alex Ross.  Story  The story centers around Sam, an obviously distressed homeless man, who wanders the streets of an unnamed city speaking mostly in odd quotes and sound bites. As he wanders, he has disturbing visions of events of injustice in American history (dealing with Indian Wars, slavery, the Civil Rights Movement, and others). Throughout his wanderings, he occasionally encounters a woman named Bea, and has conversations with Britannia. Eventually, Sam has a profoundly disillusioning vision of himself participating in the bloody crushing of Shays' Rebellion, which suggested to him that America's ideals were never seriously respected from the beginning. Eventually, he comes to the remains of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where he sees Bea once more, now recognizing her as Columbia. She helps Sam gain a more nuanced perspective of his visions of America's negative moments of its history, such as how Shay's Rebellion prompted the writing of the Constitution of the United States to help create a more stable government. He has further encounters with Britannia, Marianne and the Russian Bear, before he confronts a dark, corrupt, overtly capitalist shadow version of himself. He eventually defeats this figure by accepting all its blows, recognizing and accepting his mistakes, and learning from them. Towards the end of the tale he thinks to himself: \\"It's a strange and frightening thing ‚Äî to see yourself at your worst\\". In the end he is seen again as a homeless man, but instead of wildly hallucinating, he's now chipper and optimistic with his traditional hat, ready to face the future. Collected editions In 1998 the series was collected as a trade paperback (Vertigo ,Official Vertigo Comics page (with downloadable sample of the first pages) Titan Books ). In late 2009 it was collected into a Deluxe Edition hardcover (Vertigo , Titan Books ).

Romano is an officer in the United States Air Force and one of 26 American nationals charged by Italian authorities with the 2003 kidnapping of Italian resident cleric Hassan Nasr as part of an alleged covert CIA operation. Romano was subsequently convicted in absentia of kidnapping. On 5 April 2013, Giorgio Napolitano, the President of the Italian Republic, pardoned Romano. Background and career In his own words, Romano comes from a family with a legacy of military service, including his father who served as a corporal in the Korean War.http://www.kwva.org/graybeards/gb_0610/gb_0610_final.pdf Recent activities=Investigation by Italian authorities Image from the CIA's surveillance of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr recovered during investigations by the prosecuting authority of Milan Piano/Esteri/2005/11 Novembre/11/imam.shtml \\"Foto della Cia svela il sequestro dell'imam\\", Corriere della Sera, 12 novembre 2005. At the time of the Hassan Nasr kidnapping, Romano was commander of the 31st Security Forces Squadron stationed in Aviano Air Base near Venice. On June 27, 2005, he was made subject of a Europe-wide arrest warrant,Italy Says CIA Agents Guilty of Abduction, Issues Europe-Wide Arrest WarrantsUK Indymedia - WE \\"OUT\\" AN EX-CIA AGENT - Bush Admin's Renditioner in Italy Scandal centering on contentions of Italian authorities that he was in charge of security operations during the kidnapping of Nasr in February, 2003. The subsequent formal transmission of the arrest warrants to the Eurojust judicial coordination office meant that they became immediately effective throughout all E.U. member countries, and that Romano and all 22 other U.S. nationals named in the warrant were subject to immediate arrest within their respective jurisdictions. Among the evidentiary points cited in the warrant, issued by the Tribunale di Milano, were the fact that one of the four subscribed numbers traced by authorities as having transmitted from the scene of the kidnapping to Aviano was \\"assigned to, owned and used by\\" Col. Romano.Tribunale di Milano, Felony ex Arts, No. 10838/05 A formal indictment was issued by Judge Caterina Interlandi on February 16, 2007. Romano - the only military officer among the 26 U.S. nationals indicted - has refused to comment on the allegations. \\"I have nothing to say,\\" he has said, referring questions about the \\"alleged incident that I'm supposedly involved in\\" to Air Force senior leadership and the service's public affairs office. On November 4, 2009, Romano, along with 22 other Americans, was convicted in absentia in an Italian court for his alleged role in the Hassn Nasr kidnapping. The judge in the case, Oscar Maggi, sentenced Romano to five years in prison. However, it is very unlikely Romano will ever serve any time. Reacting to the verdict, Pentagon press secretary Geoff S. Morrell stated \\"Our view is the Italian court has no jurisdiction over Lieutenant Colonel (Joseph) Romano and should have immediately dismissed the charges. Now that they have not, we will, of course, explore what options we have going forward\\". Referring to all the convictions, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly stated \\"We are disappointed by the verdicts against the Americans and Italians charged in Milan for their alleged involvement in the case involving Egyptian cleric Abu Omar\\". Deployment in Iraq Romano commanded the 586th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron that deployed to Camp Bucca in December 2004.http://www.wood.army.mil/mpbulletin/pdfs/Oct%2005/Romano-Dains-Watts.pdf The unit, was activated in October 2004 and originally called the 732nd Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron; in March 2005 the unit was renamed the 586th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron.

The Airmen performed three of the Army's traditional missions‚Äîdetainee operations, patrolling duties, and convoy escort duties.

He is best known for the soul songs \\"Stealing in the Name of the Lord\\", which was a major hit in 1970, and \\"Hooked, Hogtied & Collared\\". He also wrote \\"Personally\\", which has been widely covered, and was a hit for soul singer Jackie Moore and singer-songwriter Karla Bonoff and country singer Ronnie McDowell. Other songs have been covered by gospel artists, including the Mighty Clouds of Joy and The Staple Singers. Early life Kelly was born in Overtown Miami, Florida, the fourth of six siblings. Kelly was brought up by his grandmother. In about 1956, Kelly's brother Henry formed a vocal group, with Paul as lead vocalist. It only lasted a few months, before Henry left Miami to go to college. Paul then formed a group with school friends from 20th Street School -- The Spades, later known as The Valadeers. Another member was Jimmy Cherry, who later sang with The Fantastics. Solo career In 1960, Kelly went left the group to go solo, recording the standard, \\"I'll String Along with You\\" for Dade Records, which was never released, following a dispute between Kelly and the label. A Miami-based singer-songwriter/producer, Clarence Reid (who would later perform as Blowfly), heard Kelly rehearse, and asked him to fill in on lead vocals with his group, The Delmiros, whose lead singer had laryngitis. Kelly recorded a single, \\"Down with It, Can't Quit It\\"/\\"Sooner Or Later\\", which was released on Selma Records in 1963, under the name Clarence Reid & The Delmiros. Kelly began performing the song live in clubs and became associated with the song. Reid asked him to join The Delmiros on a permanent basis. Kelly's official debut solo single, \\"It's My Bsby\\" b/w \\"The Upset,\\" appeared on the Lloyd label in 1965. It was inspired by the surprise boxing victory of Cassius Clay over Sonny Liston. A second single, \\"Chills and Fever,\\" written by Clarence Reid and Willie Clarke, was picked up by Dial Records and distributed by Atlantic. Relations between Kelly and Reid became strained. Nashville producer Buddy Killen, who had also fallen out with Reid, approached Kelly about working together. Meanwhile, Lloyd Records issued an answer record, \\"Thrills and Chills\\", by Helene Smith. Kelly released a third single, \\"Since I Found You\\" under the name Paul Kelly & the Rocketeers. After this, Kelly released four singles on Philips Records, produced by Killen in Muscle Shoals, including a ballad, \\"Nine Out of Ten Times,\\" written by Kelly, Reid and Clarke). Meanwhile, Dial had released two singles by Joe Tex, one of which,\\"We're Gonna Make It,\\" was co-written with Kelly. At the time, Kelly often opened for Tex on tour. In 1967, Kelly decided to move to Brooklyn, New York City, and invited a songwriting collaborator, Juanita Rogers, to join him. They became a couple and moved in together. Kelly cut material in 1968 for Stan Watson's Philly Groove label, but it remains unissued. \\"Stealing in the Name of the Lord\\" Kelly wrote \\"Stealing in the Name of the Lord\\", with Sam & Dave in mind. However, Sam Moore, whom he had known in Miami, rejected it. The song, whose title references \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\", tackles the hypocrisy of church leaders. It includes the lines: \\"That's been my way of thinking all the time,\\" Kelly said about the song. \\"Thinking about what's wrong with [the] church... And what they talk about and what they do are two different things...\\"\\"Paul Kelly: On the Positive Side\\", In The Basement (magazine), 2003; cited by the Soul Cellar website. Access date: June 26, 2007. Kelly sold the rights to the song to Buddy Killen, and recorded it at Muscle Shoals. Killen got it released through the Hollywood-based Happy Tiger Records. However, R&B; radio stations were worried that the song would offend sponsors, such as those on gospel shows. The record was consequently slow to take off. Around the same time, Annette Snell, recording as Annetta, released \\"Since There Is No More of You,\\" a single written by Kelly, who sang background on the release. \\"Stealing\\" received a push from Jerry \\"Swamp Dogg\\" Williams Jr., who was about to undertake a promotional visit to Baltimore Along with Kelly, he visited a WWIN radio DJ, Rockin' Robin. Although Kelly was now trying to push the b-side, \\"The Day After Forever\\", Rockin' Robin liked \\"Stealing,\\" and played it several times in a row. As Kelly recalled, \\"Everybody started calling in and I never looked back after that.\\"In The Basement, Ibid. The single first appeared on the Cashbox R&B; charts on June 13, 1970 and in Billboard a week later. It peaked at No. 5 (Cashbox) and No. 14 Billboard. The song was covered by Thelma Houston on her eponymous 1972 album, Thelma Houston. The song also became popular in England's Northern Soul club scene and in the 1980s became the basis for a song of the same name by an English post-punk band, Yeah Yeah Noh. Despite Kelly's stand in the lyrics of \\"Stealing in the Name of the Lord\\", another of his songs, \\"God Can\\", has been recorded by the Staple Singers, the Mighty Clouds of Joy and Dorothy Norwood. Mavis Staples, also cut solo versions of Kelly's \\"We Got Love\\" and \\"I've Been to the Well Before\\" songs on her 1979 solo album, Oh What a Feeling (produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett). The 1970s and 1980s In the wake of Kelly's major hit, Happy Tiger quickly released an album and three singles, but the label was in financial trouble and went out of business in 1971. Kelly was signed by Warner Bros. Records, which reissued the Happy Tiger album in 1972 as Dirt, taking the name from the single, \\"(He Ain't Nothin' But) Dirt\\". Kelly's third Warner Bros. Records single, \\"Don't Burn Me\\" (1972), was also a minor hit. It was followed by an album of the same name. A 1974 single, \\"Hooked, Hogtied & Collared\\" was his second biggest self-recorded hit, and it too inspired an album by the same name, with controversial artwork -- a drawing depicting bondage. With disco on the rise, Warner Bros. Records forced out Kelly's preferred producer, Buddy Killen. Kelly recorded with Gene Page (Barry White's co-arranger), but the material was never released. These events signalled a more general disagreement between Kelly and his record company, and the relationship was terminated. After a single for Epic Records, \\"Everybody Got a Jones\\"/\\"Shake Your Mind\\", Kelly decided to concentrate on songwriting and production. He did not perform live after 1977. At around this time, Kelly also wrote a song called \\"Personally\\", which he gave to Jackie Moore. Although it was not a major hit for her, Karla Bonoff recorded the song in 1982 and scored a No. 19 pop hit. Kelly recorded \\"Personally\\" on his 1993 Gonna Stick and Stay album.) In 1983, Kelly started his own independent label, Laurence Records, using the pseudonym \\"Laurence Dunbar\\". The label had a minor hit with \\"Bring It on Home to Me\\", sung by Carol Dennis and written and produced by Kelly, in 1984/85. (He wound up the label in 1991.) In the late 1980s, Kelly and his family moved from Brooklyn to Ruby, South Carolina. Kelly continued to send out demos to labels. Return to recording Kelly recorded an album, Gonna Stick and Stay, in New Orleans in July‚ÄìAugust 1992. In 1994, he suffered a heart failure and another in 1995, as well as a stroke. His vocal range suffered as a result of his health problems, which also caused Kelly to become a vegetarian. Warner Bros. Records issued a 1996 CD titled Best of Paul Kelly as part of their Warner Archives series. Kelly recorded the 1998 album Let's Celebrate Life in South Carolina and released it on Ripete Records. It included a remake of \\"Stealing in the Name of the Lord\\". In late 2011, Kelly released an album titled 1984, containing unreleased songs he recorded in that year. Kelly died in Ruby on October 4, 2012.

The song is a moderately up-tempo number, with Stokkan addressing the object of his desires. He sings about his elaborate preparations to \\"seduce you\\" - going to the lengths of borrowing clothes to look better. His advances appear to have been over-eager, as he sings \\"My greatest pleasure was to touch you/My biggest stupidity was to feel you up\\". His paramour compares him unfavourably to Romeo, telling him that \\"the Gods shall know that you will never become a/Romeo, Romeo, try to take it easy\\", even as he is begging on his knees for the relationship to work. Despite the somewhat unconventional lyrics - Eurovision entries tending to be about requited love - the song is more significant for the appearance onstage of a drag queen, a member of the Norwegian drag troupe \\"Great Garlic Girls\\", dressed in stylised clothing reminiscent of the 18th century. The performance thus represented the first occasion on which a sexual minority was visible onstage. The contest is frequently associated with a gay audience; however, there had been no displays of this sexuality in previous years. The song was performed fourth on the night, following France's Cocktail Chic with \\"Europ√©ennes\\" and preceding the United Kingdom's Ryder with \\"Runner In The Night\\".

Notropis telescopus is primarily found in a small range of waters located in the Southeastern Region of the United States. There is very little published record of the research and management involving the telescope shiner. The following research will provide information on this species that can be helpful toward monitoring efforts of Notropis telescopus populations. The primary population of telescope shiners occurs throughout drainages of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. This population is distributed throughout Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. A second known population occurs in Arkansas and Missouri and is found in the White and Black river systems. The telescope shiner gets its name due to the relatively large eye it possesses compared to other Notropis species. Adult telescopus usually have a length range from 50 to 105 mm. Unlike some other shiners and darters, the telescope shiner is not known for any outstanding coloration. Notropis telescopus occurs in cooler waters such as quick moving streams and small rivers. They can be found in riffle, run, and pool habitats. According to studies the telescope shiner can do better than other similar species when in waters with higher levels of pH, alkalinity, magnesium, and dissolved oxygen. When it comes to feeding, the telescope shiner is classified as an insectivore. Telescope shiners are classified in the spawning guild lithophil. They prefer open rock and gravel to spawn in. Embryos hatch early and stay hidden under the rocks. Notropis species are multiple batch spawners with strong seasonality to gonadal size and condition. The peak of their spawning is usually between April and July. Current monitoring and management is done by government agencies. Most of these surveys are not specific to the telescope shiner, but rather to determine overall biotic integrity of the streams and river systems.

The site is located about 70 km east of Oaxaca city, past Mitla, in the municipality of San Lorenzo Albarradas, with a narrow, winding unpaved road leading to the site. The site consists of two rock shelves or cliffs which rise between fifty and ninety metres from the valley below, from which extend nearly white rock formations which look like waterfalls. These formations are created by fresh water springs, whose water is over-saturated with calcium carbonate and other minerals. As the water scurries over the cliffs, the excess minerals are deposited, much in the same manner that stalactites are formed in caves. One of the cliffs, called the \\"cascada chica\\" (small waterfall) or the Amphitheatre, contains two large artificial pools for swimming as well as a number of small natural pools. One of the artificial pools is very near the edge of the cliff. Location Panorama of the valley with the large \\"waterfall\\" Looking out over the valley The site is located in a very isolated region with rough terrain, dominated principally by holm oak forest, cactus and other semi desert vegetation. The \\"waterfalls\\" or rock formations are on cliffs of mountains that rise abruptly from the narrow valley floor below. It is located in ethnic Mixe territory, with the two closest communities being San Lorenzo Albarradas and San Isidro Roaguia havig populations of 1403 and 320, respectively (2005). The springs that produce the rock formations are one of the few water sources in the area. \\"Waterfall\\" rock formations and springs Rock formation as it \\"goes over\\" the cliff at the Amphitheater The site consists of two waterfall-like rock formations which have been formed over thousands of years. Both cliffs rise over fifty meters from the valley floor, with one rock formation reaching down twelve metres and the other reaching down thirty metres. The twelve meter one is called \\"cascada chica\\" (small waterfall) and \\"flows\\" off a base which is about sixty metres wide. The other, \\"cascada grande\\" (large waterfall), extends down from a base with which is about ninety metres wide and eighty metres above the valley floor. Rock formations of Hierve el Agua from the west and landscape The rock formations are often described as \\"cascadas de sal\\" (salt waterfalls), \\"cascadas petrificadas\\" (petrified waterfalls) and \\"cascadas p√©treas\\" (rock waterfalls) . The falls are formed by relatively small amounts of water which is oversaturated with calcium carbonate and comes to the surface through cracks or fissures on the mountainside. The water has a temperature of . As the water runs down the rock face, it forms large stalactites similar to those found in caves. The flow of water from the spring varies significantly between the dry and rainy seasons. 95% of the surface rock formations are of calcium carbonate; however, lower layers of both rock and water currents are little known as they are sealed by the above layers. The calcium carbonate gives the formations a white or near white appearance, but other minerals that can be present in the water, such as silver, barium and iron can also be found and determines the color of a particular stalactite. The calcium carbonate in the water is due to rainwater which passes underground. First it absorbs carbon dioxide, and forms molecules of carbonic acid. This acid comes into contact with underground marble and partially dissolves creating calcium bicarbonate. When the water runs above ground, the excess minerals fall out. The waters, with their high mineral content, are reputed to have healing qualities. Natural and lower artificial pool The more easily accessible and more often visited of the two waterfalls is the \\"cascada chica,\\" also called the Amphitheatre. This cliff rises over fifty metres above the valley floor, where there is a natural platform about sixty meters wide. This platform has four springs. The water from three of the four springs is captured by a number of small natural pools and two large artificial pools in which visitors can swim. The lower of the two pools is very close to the cliff edge and was built in 2007. In these pools, the water appears a turquoise green due to the mineral concentration. The fourth spring is located closest to the edge and responsible for most of the waterfall rock formation. Two of the four springs on the Amphitheatre side rise from the level floor and appear to bubble up, which is the source of the name. The bubbling action of these and some other springs is thought to occur due to construction of underground water currents. This bubbling action leads to the name of the area, Hierve el Agua (the water boils). Water constantly flows out of the springs and the process of depositing the calcium carbonate is ongoing, which can be seen on the walls of the artificial pools. Trails lead from the cascada chica to the cascada grande, the valley floor and other areas in the vicinity. The cascada grande is just to the south of the cascada chica and easily visible from it. This waterfall rock formation is more vertical than the cascada chica. Similarly, it is a rock shelf from which flows mineral laden water over the side. This shelf is ninety metres above the valley floor, eighty metres wide with the waterfall extending down for about thirty metres. This shelf does not have artificial pools. Ancient canals One of the springs that bubbles up The area is also of archeological interest because of the extensive system of irrigation and terraces built by the Zapotecs as many as 2,500 years ago. It was also most likely a sacred site to the ancient peoples of the Oaxaca valley. The canals are part of an irrigation system which was created more than 2,500 years ago, most of which extend from the Amphitheatre side. Researchers have studied the terraces and canals which have been cut into the sides of the mountains these cliffs are on and have concluded that they were an irrigation system, unique in Mexico. Only vestiges of these irrigation canals remain; however, the archeological area has not been completely explored. These irrigation canals are considered to be unique in Mesoamerica, not only because irrigation was not common in pre-Hispanic Mexico but because they are the only example of lined irrigation canals. It is not known why canal lining does not appear outside of the Hierve el Agua area, and here the lining develops naturally. While seepage and bank erosion were indeed problems with irrigation farming in other parts of Mesoamerica, the nearest example of anything similar is with the Hohokam of southern Arizona in 650 C.E. The tourist attraction Part of Turis Yu'u In addition to the artificial pools on the Amphitheatre side, a number of other services have been built for visitors such as food stands, small markets, cabins and a regular swimming pool. The cabin area, called \\"Turis Yu‚Äôu,\\" with its pool was built in the 1990s and offer areas to change clothes, shower, eat in an open- air restaurant and for overnight stays although the accommodations are very basic. This complex, as well as many of the other stalls are owned by residents of the Roeguia community. Site Access The roads leading in have been occasionally subject to blockades. Despite the development, the nearby communities of San Lorenza Albarradas and San Isidro Roaguia still suffer from poverty. Each visitor is charged between M$10.00 to M$60.00 pesos by the state of Oaxaca to enter the site, depending on the season. But disputes have arisen between the two nearby communities about who should administer it and about income sharing. This led to the closing of the site between 2005 and 2007. Promises by state officials were made to invest the money earned at the site to raising living standards in the area, but residents claim that this has never happened. As a result, the locals set up their own roadside checkpoints to levy a small fee, thus tourists are sometimes charged twice to access the site ‚Äî once on the road and once at the entrance to the park. In the state of Oaxaca, road closures and blockades has been a common form of protest. It has been suggested that this reflects a weakness in the state government, illustrating its inability to maintain order. In March 2014, travelers reported that blockade of the local road to Hierve el Agua had erupted again. In October 2019, residents of Tlacolula de Matamoros, a town roughly 30 km (~18 miles) away, blocked the Pan-American Highway (Federal Highway 190) leading to Hiereve el Agua to call attention to a dispute about whether an elementary school damaged by earthquakes should be repaired or replaced. In April 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread into Oaxaca, residents of San Lorenzo Albarradas blockaded the road over concerns that uncontrolled tourism would infect the locals. The current ombudsman of Oaxaca, Bernardo Rodr√≠guez Alamilla, said that municipalities cannot legally block access or impose traffic restrictions so the state tries to dissuade them. However, sometimes the state may give in to avoid conflicts, even sending in the National Guard to supervise their implementation.

Set in Bordeaux, it describes the marriage of a Parisian gentleman, Paul de Manerville, to the beautiful but spoiled Spanish heiress, Natalie Evangelista. Plot summary Paul de Manerville is a gentleman born of wealth and nobility who decides, over the objections of his worldly friend de Marsay, to give up his elegant bachelor's life and get married at the age of twenty-seven. He falls in love with a beautiful girl named Natalie Evangelista, the daughter of a proud Spanish matriarch whose financial assets have been diminishing since the death of her husband. Too na√Øve and full of illusions to see the hidden motives of Natalie Evangelista's mother, who wants Paul's wealth in order to procure for her daughter the lavish lifestyle she believes to be her birthright, or to recognize that his bride's loyalty is entirely with her mother and not with him, Paul gets himself stuck in a frigid and childless marriage. So strong are his illusions, that even at the end of the novel he remains unaware of his wife's infidelities. Literary significance & criticism A Marriage Contract is one of Balzac's great studies of human illusions, in this case the illusions of married life. Paul is a subtly conveyed example of the husband, \\"the voluntary dupe\\" who prefers \\"to suffer rather than complain.\\" The novel is notable for treating not only the courtship leading up to the marriage, but the negotiations which follow. A Marriage Contract also has one of Balzac's classic dissections of the techniques and wiles of professional negotiators.

The series of 20 half- hour specials, geared toward elementary school aged children, includes biographies of both female and male scientists, inventors, explorers, and social champions from around Europe, North America and the Middle East, including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Florence Nightingale, Maccabees, Wright brothers, Galileo Galilei, Marco Polo, William Bradford, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Ludwig van Beethoven, Harriet Tubman, Joan of Arc, Benjamin Franklin, Helen Keller, Marie Curie, Louis Pasteur and Pocahontas. The Children's Television Act of 1990 required terrestrial television networks to devote time to Educational and Informative programming for children. Even though cable networks were not directly affected by these requirements, these programs were debuted on their HBO network's Saturday morning children's block as a show of good faith that the network was committed to quality educational programming for children. The dramatic biographies were meticulously researched by the producers and written to engage both children and adults, providing an entertaining and accessible way to learn about the positive impact that these women and men have had on our world. In 1996, Nest Entertainment joined Warner Bros. Animation to formed the Warner-Nest Animation, and in the same year, Living History Productions was folded into Nest Entertainment. After Animated Hero Classics videos from Christopher Columbus to Maccabees were re-released by Nest Entertainment and Warner/Nest Animation in 1996, and Animated Hero Classics videos from Alexander Graham Bell to Marie Curie were released by Nest Entertainment and Warner/Nest Animation from 1996 to 1997, the company Warner/Nest Animation was shutdown in 1997. In 2004, the Animated Hero Classics video Beethoven was released by Nest Entertainment, and the series is complete. After the initial limited cable television debut, the programs were released on VHS and DVD. Over the years supplementary learning materials have been added to the series designed to help develop core curriculum knowledge and skills, while building positive character traits. They are used in over 60,000 public schools and libraries, and by countless home educators as they research the heroes of history covered by the series. The series currently airs every Saturday on BYUtv. Individual programs within the series have earned multiple awards and endorsements including the family approved seal from the Dove Foundation, The School Library Journal, The Parent's Choice Foundation award and the National Educational Media Association award, the \\"Award of Excellence\\" from the Film Advisory Board, the Director's Choice Award from Early Childhood News, KIDS FIRST!, and the highest rating from the Practical Homeschooling Magazine. The series was directed by Richard Rich, the ex-Disney director who also directed The Swan Princess trilogy, and three faith-based animated educational series for the church, library and home educator market: Animated Stories from the Bible, Animated Stories from the New Testament and K10C: Kids' Ten Commandments.

He is known for his work in particle physics and for his involvement with SETI. Life Cocconi was born in Como, Italy in 1914. He went to study physics at the University of Milan, and then in February 1938, went to the Sapienza University of Rome on the invitation of Edoardo Amaldi. There he met physicists Enrico Fermi, and Gilberto Bernardini. With Fermi, he built a Wilson chamber to study the disintegration of mesons. In August of that year, Cocconi laid the foundation of cosmic ray research in Milan. While at Milan, Cocconi supervised Vanna Tongiorgi, who picked cosmic rays as her thesis' subject, and later married her in 1945. In 1942, Cocconi was nominated professor at University of Catania, but was engaged by the Italian army to research infrared phenomena for the Italian airforce until the end of World War II, in late 1944. He taught at Catania until 1947, when Hans Bethe made a request that he would join Cornell University. During his stay at Cornell, Cocconi and his wife performed many experiments there and in Echo Lake located in the Rocky Mountains, where they demonstrated the galactic and extragalactic origins of cosmic rays. In 1955, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. While at Cornell he also wrote, with Philip Morrison, his most famous paper \\"Searching for Interstellar Communications\\", on the 21 cm Hydrogen line, which turned out to be of vital importance in the SETI program. During his sabbatical of 1959‚Äì1961, Cocconi helped kick-start the Proton Synchrotron research program at CERN, and conducted a series of experiment on proton-proton scattering, and on the cross section of protons and neutrons. He also continued this research at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). In 1963 he returned at CERN, and discovered with Alan Wetherell, Bert Diddens, and others, that the diffraction peak in proton-proton scattering shrunk with the increase in collision energy. This was interpreted as the \\"exchange of two Regge Poles\\", which later became known as the pomeron. From 1967 to 1969, Cocconi was CERN's research director, and conceived the Roman pot, a type of particle detector. Then with a group led by Klaus Winter, he formed the CHARM collaboration, which worked until the 1980s, which investigated elastic electron-neutrino scattering. He retired in 1979, but kept in touch with the CERN research, and particle physics related research in general. Cocconi died on 9 November 2008. His colleagues and friends wrote the following in his CERN's obituary: > Giuseppe enjoyed the respect of great physicists in the world. As a man of > culture and vision, he was very curious and attentive to what was going on > in the world, and not only in the field of physics. Very kind and always > ready to listen, straightforward but humble in his relations with his > colleagues, always ready to admire other people‚Äôs success, he was happy to > share his knowledge with juniors. His refusal of association with academies, > and his lack of interest in prizes and honours, as well as his wish not to > talk publicly, after his retirement, of his scientific life, are well known. > He was a great physicist.

Life Zani was born at Casalmaggiore in the Province of Cremona. He received his first instruction in playing the violin from his father, an amateur violinist. Subsequently, he received instruction in composition from Giacomo Civeri, a local musician, and studied violin in Guastalla with the court violinist Carlo Ricci. Antonio Caldara, who was working as Capellmeister at the court of Archduke Ferdinand Charles in Mantua, not far from Casalmaggiore, heard Zani play and invited him to accompany him to Vienna. Between 1727 and 1729 Zani arrived in Vienna and was active there as a violinist in the service of the Habsburgs. Following the death of his sponsor Caldara in 1736, he returned to Casalmaggiore where he remained for the rest of his life, except for occasional concert appearances. He died in his home town as the result of an accident, when the carriage in which he was travelling to Mantua overturned. Style and significance Zani's works show the influence of Antonio Vivaldi, but are somewhat less sweeping. His op. 2, published in 1729, is of great historical importance because it is the earliest dated source of symphonies that present no ambiguities of genre .

Marie, Michigan. The station is owned by West Central Michigan Media Ministries, broadcasting a Christian talk radio format simulcasted from Cadillac, Michigan under the branding \\"Strong Tower Radio\\". History WIHC has operated under numerous owners and formats since its launch in December 1988 under the ownership of Leon Van Dam. Originally an easy listening station with the callsign WUPQ, the station was sold to Cambrian Broadcasting in 1995, who switched the station to a country music format under the branding \\"Hot Country 97.9\\", with its callsign changing to WIHC to match the new name and format. The station's license was transferred to Marathon Media in 1998, who ran the station until the fall of 2001, when WIHC was sold to Northern Star Broadcasting as part of a $7.95 million deal involving 10 other stations. Under Northern Star's ownership, WIHC became a part of Northern Star's \\"Classic Rock: The Bear\\" network of classic rock stations in February 2002, broadcasting the same music and syndicated programs as WGFN in Glen Arbor, Michigan, but with local on-air personalities & commercials. When Northern Star Broadcasting sold off the majority of their stations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in February 2010 to Sault Ste. Marie company Sovereign Communications, WIHC was the only non-repeater station retained to ensure that Sovereign's ownership concentration in the Sault Ste. Marie area did not exceed U.S. Federal Communications Commission limits. However, Northern Star opted to take WIHC dark later that month, as it was no longer financially viable to keep on air.http://www.mibuzzboard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=383739 As \\"The Bear\\", WIHC remains the most recent Sault Ste. Marie-market affiliate for the syndicated Bob & Tom Show and Nights with Alice Cooper. In November 2011, West Central Michigan Media Ministries agreed to purchase WIHC from Northern Star Broadcasting for $150,000, and the deal was finalized in February 2012. After two years of silence, WIHC was brought back on air in March 2012 as a simulcast of WGCP in Cadillac, Michigan, simulcasting its Christian talk format under the branding Strong Tower Radio. Prior to buying WIHC, West Central Michigan Media Ministries had bought the construction permit for a planned Newberry radio station (WUMI, 90.3 FM) from Korkee, Inc. in February 2011, but it was left to expire after instead purchasing the already-completed WIHC later that year. Following WIHC's initial closure in 2010, Northern Star Broadcasting changed the format of WLJZ 94.5 FM in Mackinaw City to a Classic Rock: The Bear affiliate, returning the network to much of the Eastern Upper Peninsula region previously covered by WIHC. In 2013, operations at this rebroadcaster later moved to WCHY 97.7 FM in Cheboygan following a station swap with Michigan Broadcasters involving WLJZ, before ultimately moving to 95.3 FM in Tuscarora Township in March 2018.

Missouri's first Constitution in 1820 provided for an appointed Attorney General, but since the 1865 Constitution, the Attorney General has been elected. As of January 2019, there have been 43 attorneys general in Missouri. Eric Schmitt was appointed to become the 43rd Attorney General in January 2019 filling the mid-term vacancy created by Josh Hawley's election to the United States Senate. By law, the attorney general is a member of the Board of Fund Commissioners, the Board of Public Buildings, the Governor's Committee on Interstate Cooperation, the Missouri Highway Reciprocity Commission and the Missouri Housing Development Commission. Offices of the Attorney General are located throughout the state of Missouri with the main office being in the Supreme Court building in Jefferson City. Attorney for the State The Missouri Attorney General is the attorney for the state, representing the legal interests of Missouri and its state agencies. As the state's chief legal officer, the attorney general must prosecute or defend all appeals to which the state is a party, including every felony criminal case appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri and Missouri Court of Appeals. The attorney general also is required to institute, in the name and on behalf of the state, all civil suits and other proceedings that are necessary to protect the state's rights, interests, or claims. The attorney general may appear, interplead, answer or defend any proceedings that involve the state's interests, or appear on behalf of the state in declaratory judgment proceedings when the constitutionality of a statute is challenged. The attorney general also renders official opinions to the executive and legislative branch and the county prosecuting attorneys on questions of law relating to their duties. The attorney general may institute quo warranto proceedings against anyone unlawfully holding office or move to oust any public official for malfeasance in office. To fulfill these and other responsibilities, the attorney general's office is organized into nine divisions. Divisions of the Attorney General=Agriculture and Environment Division The mission of the Agriculture and Environment Division is to \\"protect Missouri's natural resources and agricultural productivity.\\" Attorneys shall take legal action to stop pollution of the state's air, water and soil and penalize polluters through fines, penalties and, in the most serious cases, incarceration. The Attorney General has taken action in recent years to protect the state's interests in management of the Missouri River. Legal battles over the Missouri River often pit Missouri against states that are upstream (specifically North Dakota and South Dakota) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Beginning in 2006, the Attorney General became involved in the controversial Taum Sauk reservoir disaster when, as special prosecutor, he filed a lawsuit against the state's largest utility company asking it be ordered to pay compensation and punitive damages after the release of more than a billion gallons of water from the ruptured mountain-top reservoir caused extensive damage to the nearby east fork of the Black River and Johnson Shut-ins State Park Other legal battles have included the waterways of the White River basin and Missouri's Church Mountain. Consumer Protection Division The attorney general has the responsibility of protecting the public's interests in an open and honest marketplace. The Consumer Protection Division enforces Missouri's Consumer Protection Act and antitrust laws, and has the responsibility of representing the commissioner of securities of the secretary of state's office. Missouri's consumer protection statutes prohibit deception, fraud, unfair practices and misrepresentation or concealment of material facts in the sale or advertisement of goods or services. These laws authorize the attorney general to take action against such fraud and ensure that consumers' rights are protected. Consumers may file complaints against businesses and individuals with the Attorney General. More than 90,000 consumer complaints and inquiries each year are submitted to the Attorney General. Many of those complaints are resolved through mediation by the AG. In cases where a company's actions have been determined to be in violation of Missouri's consumer protection law, complaints lead to legal action. Some complaints are frivolous. Missouri residents may file complaints against any business entity and non-Missouri residents may file complaints against Missouri businesses. Complaints are available for searching by the public. Under the Missouri Antitrust Law, the attorney general has the authority to represent the state or any of its political subdivisions, public agencies, school districts or municipalities in actions to prohibit monopolies and trade restraints. The attorney general also may act under federal antitrust statutes to bring civil actions in the name of the state and on behalf of Missouri residents to recover damages for injuries caused by certain antitrust violations. The attorney general is the state's chief prosecutor for securities fraud, and may initiate legal actions for civil injunctive relief, penalties and restitution under the Missouri Merchandising Practices Law. Attorneys in this division also protect Missourians by enforcing compliance with state laws by trusts, foundations and nonprofit corporations. The Attorney General also administers Missouri's No Call program. The No Call program was designed to reduce unwanted telemarketing calls and has become a model for other states. Persons may register Missouri residential phone lines, lookup whether a phone number has been registered and file a complaint against a telemarketer. The division also has an active consumer education program. The Attorney General's Office has many publications for consumers on topics ranging from adoption to landlord-tenant law and also offers a general guide to consumer entitled, \\"Know Your Rights\\". All publications may be ordered and the cost is free. The Missouri Attorney General was the first Attorney General in the United States to blog. That blog is a consumer education blog published by members of the Consumer Protection division and is part of a larger consumer education effort that includes a consumer encyclopedia, online calculators, quizzes and worksheets. Criminal Division The attorney general represents the state in every felony case appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri and Missouri Court of Appeals. Each year, attorneys in the Criminal Division brief and argue more than 700 cases in the Missouri Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Missouri. Division attorneys also assist with extraditions to and from Missouri of those charged in criminal cases. Financial Services Division The Financial Services Division protects Missourians by recouping money owed to the state or state agencies, including providing collection services to several divisions of the attorney general's office and more than 40 other state agencies. Division attorneys also take legal action to establish and maintain child support obligations, and work to recover money owed by inmates to reimburse the state for the cost of their care. Governmental Affairs Division The Governmental Affairs Division \\"protects the safety and well-being of Missourians by ensuring that regulated professionals adhere to state laws and disciplinary rules, by enforcing state ethics and campaign finance laws, and by removing caregivers who abuse or neglect vulnerable citizens\\". It also charged with helping mentally ill and physically challenged Missourians obtain guardians to help get care. Division attorneys also help Missourians seek redress for claims of discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender, disability, age and familial status. The division provides legal representation to several state agencies, including the departments of Health and Senior Services, Revenue and Social Services; the Missouri Ethics Commission; and more than 30 professional licensing boards, including the Board of Registration for the Healing Arts, which regulates the practice of medicine. Division attorneys enforce the provisions of the tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which has brought in more than $1.2 billion to the state as of 2007. Attorneys in the division also address questions from the public, from government officials and from the media about Missouri's open meetings and records law, commonly known as the Sunshine Law. Labor Division The Labor Division provides general counsel and litigation services for the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations and its officers and agencies. The division also represents the state in prevailing wage disputes, crime victims' claims and workers' compensation cases of state employees, including claims involving the Second Injury Fund. Litigation Division Litigation Division attorneys handle major and complex litigation for Missouri, providing legal defense to state agencies and their employees. Cases in the division include damage claims, contract actions, class‚Äëaction lawsuits, employment issues, constitutional challenges and other types of civil litigation. The division also defends the state in lawsuits brought by inmates of Missouri's correctional facilities. Division attorneys also defend constitutional challenges to state laws and ballot issues. Public Safety Division The Public Safety Division is involved in a wide range of criminal prosecutions at the trial level. The division's special prosecution unit prosecutes or assists in the prosecution of cases throughout Missouri, many of them homicide cases. In 2006, division attorneys handled 794 special prosecutions in 94 of the state's 114 counties. The meth prosecution unit specializes in handling criminal cases involving the manufacture, sale or possession of methamphetamine. The workers' compensation fraud unit prosecutes fraud or misconduct involving workers' compensation, and the Medicaid fraud control unit prosecutes cases involving fraud of the state Medicaid program by health professionals, or abuse or neglect of Medicaid recipients by caregivers. The division's high technology and computer crime unit assists local law enforcement with investigations and prosecutions of computer and Internet crime cases. The sexually violent predator unit seeks the civil commitment of sexual predators who suffer from a mental abnormality making them more likely than not to commit additional predatory acts of sexual violence. Attorneys in the division also serve as legal counsel for the Department of Public Safety, the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the Missouri State Water Patrol and other state law enforcement agencies, and represent those agencies in all civil litigation in which they are a party. Division attorneys also defend the state in all habeas corpus actions filed by prison inmates in state and federal courts. Each year they litigate some 500 federal habeas corpus actions in the federal district courts, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court.

The premillennialist plot revolves around a plan by the Antichrist (York) to take over the world using information hidden in the titular Bible code. The independently produced film was financed and distributed by the Trinity Broadcasting Network, whose head, televangelist Paul Crouch, wrote a novelization of the film's screenplay. The film received a limited theaterical release in the United States on October 15, 1999, grossing $12 million against a $7.2 million budget, before being released on home video by GoodTimes Entertainment. In 2001, the film had a sequel entitled Megiddo: The Omega Code 2, which serves partly as a prequel as well as an alternate retelling of the first film's eschatological plot. While it had a significantly larger budget than the original, it was less enthusiastically received, and was ultimately less popular. Plot In Jerusalem, a rabbi named Rostenburg is using software he designed to decode seventy eschatological prophecies hidden within the Torah. Rostenburg has handwritten each one in a journal, to be entered into the program for deciphering. The program deciphers a prophecy which says that he is about to die; immediately, he tears the page containing the final code from his journal, hiding it in his shirt pocket. He is then shot and killed by an assassin, who takes his journal and the optical disc containing the decoding program. After the assassin leaves, two mysterious men (later revealed to be two prophets) retrieve the journal page Rostenburg had hidden. Television reporter and talk show host Cassandra Barris (Catherine Oxenberg) introduces Dr. Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien) as her show's guest. Lane is a popular author and charismatic motivational speaker who explains that codes hidden in the Old Testament describe events past, present, and future; he sees no contradiction between this belief and his dismissal of religious faith. Media mogul and European Union Chairman Stone Alexander (Michael York) receives a humanitarian award in Rome for having all but eliminated world hunger through advances in nutritional technology. There, we see that the man who killed Rostenburg and stole his decoding software is Alexander's apprentice, Dominic (Michael Ironside). Dr. Lane is in attendance, seeking to meet with Alexander \\"to discuss some ideas.\\" Cassandra, employed by one of Alexander's television networks, is also in attendance, providing Lane brief conversation after Alexander spurns him. Some time afterward, however, Alexander sees a prophecy (deciphered with Rostenberg's program) that leads him to ask Lane to become his Minister of Information. Using each prophecy Rostenburg's program deciphers to guide him, Alexander works toward world domination by whatever means he deems necessary, including secretly arranging for the bombings of Muslim and Jewish holy sites in Israel. Reporting from Jerusalem, Cassandra is caught up in one of the blasts. The two prophets from Rostenburg's study take her from the rubble, telling her that they have \\"a message for [her] to carry\\". Alexander goes on to use the sites' rebuilding to help forge a groundbreaking Middle East peace treaty. Not long thereafter, most national governments agree to join a ten-state \\"World Union\\", of which Alexander is chairman. Lane finds fulfillment in his new position, though he regrets not being able to be with his estranged wife and young daughter. Cassandra delivers to Lane a warning that the prophets gave her, though he is skeptical. Nevertheless, the warning leads Lane to discover the decoding facility where Alexander's staff uses Rostenburg's program. No one else is in the facility at the time, but Lane sees that the program is running, and leafs through printouts of previously deciphered codes. Seeing Lane on a surveillance feed, Alexander and Dominic go to confront him. A disillusioned Lane accuses Alexander of \\"following the code like a script,\\" and being behind the Israeli bombings. Confessing to Lane's charges, Alexander asks him to be \\"my spokesman for this new world, my visionary, my prophet.\\" Believing himself to be the only rightful aspirant to the position, Dominic pulls his gun on Lane, who flees. Firing repeatedly at Lane, Dominic inadvertently shoots Alexander in the head, mortally wounding him. Dominic immediately alerts security, claiming that Lane shot Alexander and fled. Lane escapes Alexander's compound, but becomes the target of a worldwide manhunt. Alexander is pronounced dead at a local hospital. Lane runs into a sympathetic Cassandra, who agrees to smuggle him onto a network jet so that he can return to his family in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Satan enters Alexander's body in the hospital, causing his head wound to heal miraculously and the World Union chairman to rise from the dead. Seven of the ten World Union leaders agree that Alexander will be appointed \\"Chancellor of the United World\\" in a ceremony to be held at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, coincident with the reopening of Solomon's Temple. In Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Lane cannot be safely reunited with his family, which is under heavy surveillance. He and Cassandra end up flying back to Jerusalem, where the prophets give him the page of Rostenburg's journal containing the final code. Immediately thereafter, Cassandra pulls a gun on Lane, demanding the code and revealing that she is loyal to Alexander. At the ceremony in Jerusalem, Chairman Alexander (now Chancellor Alexander) proclaims that he has become \\"both king and god!\\" The crowd is upset by this statement, with some devout Jewish and Muslim listeners denouncing him as a blasphemer. Out of the growing tumult, the two prophets appear inside the temple, identifying Alexander as the Abomination of Desolation, quoting evangelistic biblical prophecies, and predicting that they would be resurrected three days after their deaths. Alexander has Dominic kill them both, and put them on display as an example of what happens to those who oppose him. He leaves for his compound in Rome, as Dominic relays word to him that \\"the Israelis and several others are seceding.\\" Alexander plots a massive military action, including a nuclear strike. Alexander meets Cassandra, who gives him the final code; when he examines the writing, it evaporates from the page supernaturally. Alexander accuses her of conspiring with Lane (who is being detained on-site). The two of them go to Lane's holding cell, where Dominic violently interrogates him as to the whereabouts of the final code. Lane is truly ignorant of its whereabouts, causing the interrogation to reach an impasse. Lane is left alone in his cell. In his solitude, demons swirl around him, tormenting him; Lane prays, \\"God ... Jesus, save me.\\" Immediately, the demons are scattered, Lane's cell door opens, and he exits. Meanwhile, the two prophets are resurrected. Lane, trying to find Alexander, runs into Dominic instead. Dominic is about to kill him when the two prophets supernaturally appear. They strangle Dominic without touching him, and give Lane the journal page with the final code. Lane takes Dominic's gun and confronts Alexander, who, with Cassandra at his side, is about to commence the attack. Alexander uses this as a bargaining chip to get Lane to give him the final code; Lane agrees, typing it into Rostenburg's program for deciphering. Once he does, however, Alexander reveals that he never intended to call off the attack, and now, with the final code, will begin his massive Third World War. Just as Alexander is about to give the final authorization to attack, a blindingly brilliant and pure white light appears on the horizon, expanding like a shockwave through the entire surrounding area. As it reaches Alexander's war room, its appearance is accompanied by a strong wind. While Lane stands safely and peacefully within it, it blows through Alexander violently enough to cause Satan to fly behind him. Initially attempting to grasp onto Alexander's shoulders for stability, Satan is finally blown away, out of sight. At this point, Alexander reaches behind his ear and finds that his hand is bloodied: His head wound was restored after Satan was ejected from him, leaving him dead again. The shockwave of light spreads to cover the entire Earth, then grows in brightness and intensity such that it causes the entire screen to remain white for a few seconds. This effect ends with a fade to the printer in Alexander's facility, the output tray of which bears a freshly-printed page with Rostenburg's final code, deciphered as follows: \\"0000 ... Dawn of New Millennium\\".  Production and distribution  The film was produced by Code Productions in conjunction with Eclipse Catering, TBN's Gener8Xion Entertainment and TBN Films. It was first aired on Trinity Broadcasting Network in 1999, and then distributed by the now bankrupt Good Times Home Video Corporation to both VHS and DVD formats in 2000, and released over the internet in 2002. ; Other distributors * Higher Dreams (1999) (Spain) (theatrical) * Providence Entertainment (1999) (USA, theatrical) * At Entertainment (2000) (Japan, on video) * Eagle Entertainment (2001) (Australia, theatrical) * Argentina Video Home (Argentina, video) * Calif√≥rnia Home V√≠deo (Brazil, VHS only) * Dutch FilmWorks (DFW) (2001) (Netherlands only on DVD) * GoodTimes Home Video (2000) (2002) (USA, only on DVD) * Laurus Entertainment (2001) (Netherlands) (VHS) * RTL Entertainment (2003) (Netherlands) (TV, RTL5) (broadcast premiere) Influences The prophets' public denunciation of Alexander as the Anti-Christ, their immediate death at the hands of his primary enforcer, and subsequent resurrection from the dead, are drawn from \\"A Short Tale of the Anti-Christ\\" by Russian Orthodox theologian and philosopher Vladimir Solovyov. In Solovyov's depiction, however, they are instead the three leaders of the world's remaining Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and conservative Protestants. Reception The film received mostly negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives The Omega Code a rating of 8%, based on reviews from 25 critics., as well as an average grade of 14/100 from Metacritic, based on 9 critic reviews.

He is best remembered for collecting, editing, and publishing the Paston Letters, describing the life and political scheming of the gentry in Medieval England. He was also a justice of the peace who served as High Sheriff of Norfolk for 1791/2. Life Fenn was born 26 November 1739, the son of a surgeon, and was educated at the grammar schools of Scarning and Bottisdale (Botesdale) from which he was admitted to Caius College, Cambridge. At university he became friends with John Frere, and in 1763 he courted his sister Ellenor. They married 1 January 1766 and went to live at Dereham in Norfolk. (Ellenor Fenn was subsequently the author of children's books, under the pseudonyms of Mrs Teachwell and Mrs Lovechild.) After their marriage the couple lived in Dereham. They had no children, but brought up an orphaned heiress and later their nephew, William Frere. Between 1768 and 1775 Fenn helped William Whittingham to publish the remaining parts of the continuation of Francis Blomefield's History of Norfolk. He also became friendly with the antiquary Thomas Martin of Palgrave, and after the latter's death in 1772 assisted in cataloguing many of the latter's manuscripts prior to their sale. It was at this time that he acquired the Paston Letters. The first two volumes of Fenn's edition of the famous letters appeared in January 1787, dedicated to King George III, and caused a literary sensation. Fenn received a knighthood after presenting the originals to the king in May 1787. A third and fourth volume were published in May 1789, but further progress was delayed by his appointment as High Sheriff of Norfolk for 1791. Work on the final volume of letters was almost complete when he died, on 14 February 1794, but a planned biography of the Pastons was never completed. He was buried with his wife at the Frere family's church of St Bartholomew, Finningham, Suffolk, where there was erected a significant marble monument to them both by John Bacon.Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660‚Äì1851, new revised edition, p. 28.

The MCP contains controls that allow the crew of the aircraft to select which parts of the aircraft's flight are to be controlled automatically. In modern MCPs, there are many different modes of automation available. The MCP can be used to instruct the autopilot to hold a specific altitude, to change altitudes at a specific rate, to hold a specific heading, to turn to a new heading, to follow the directions of a flight management computer (FMC), and so on. The MCP is actually independent of the autopilot-- it simply sets the mode in which the autopilot operates, but the autopilot itself (e.g., an AFDS) is a separate aircraft system. The MCP often interacts with both the AFDS or autopilot and the FMC(s). MCPs are usually found in advanced aircraft intended for commercial use, especially jet airliners. They are often mounted on the glare shield, a small panel that overhangs the main instrument panel of the aircraft and also functions as a shield against outside glare.

Tresco Abbey Gardens are located on the island of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly, United Kingdom. The 17 acre gardens were established by the nineteenth-century proprietor of the islands, Augustus Smith, originally as a private garden within the grounds of the home he designed and built. The gardens are designated at Grade I in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Tresco Abbey Augustus Smith chose Tresco as the site of his home because the site was more or less central in relation to the rest of the islands. It is also close to the original abbey ruins, is near a fresh water pool and overlooks the sand dunes and beach at Carn Near. The area at the time was barren land and the original building, designed by Smith and started in 1835, was small in comparison to the current building. He made additions to the house in 1843 and 1861. The Grade II listed house consists of roughly coursed granite with ashlar dressings and a slate roof. Some of the timbers from the 1861 wreck of the Award were used for the panelling and roof of the new dining room, as well as panelling of the rooms Annet, Rosevean and Rosevear. His successor, Thomas Algernon Smith-Dorrien-Smith added the tower in 1891. Abbey Gardens When Augustus Smith chose the area for his house and garden one of his first acts was to build a granite wall for shelter and to scatter gorse (Ulex europaeus) seeds. The seeds were brought from the mainland which suggests that the main gorse plant on the islands was western gorse (Ulex gallii) which, being a low growing plant, would not provide as much shelter. Within the gardens are the remains of a Benedictine abbey founded in 964 AD, although the majority of what remains today comes from the Priory of St Nicholas founded by monks from Tavistock Abbey in 1114. There were hardly any trees on the island and the gorse did not provide enough protection so he planted shelterbelts. The first were mainly deciduous trees such as, elm (Ulmus sp), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), oak (Rubus sp) and poplar (Poplar sp), and later he planted Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) which are fast growing and suited to coastal conditions. A large expansion to the collection was undertaken by Arthur Algernon Dorrien-Smith in the early years of the 20th century. He made many trips to South Africa looking for suitable trees and plants. He went on the 1907 Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition, which had as its primary object magnetic observation in the Auckland and Campbell Islands. Following the expedition he travelled widely in New Zealand, as well as making a shorter visit to Australia. In 1909 he again visited Australia, New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, returning on SS Athenic. By this time he had amassed a total collection of plants and seeds of about 2280 specimens. Because of the mild winter climate, the long hours of summer sunshine, and the high walls and hedges around the garden protecting it from the Atlantic winds, the garden is now home to exotic plants from all over the world: the Mediterranean, South America, South Africa and Australasia.

Valhalla Museum  Valhalla The Valhalla Museum within Tresco Abbey Gardens features the Valhalla Collection containing some 30 figureheads, as well as name-boards and other decorative carvings from the days of sail. The collection was started by Augustus Smith. Most of the figureheads date from the middle and end of the 19th century and come from merchant sailing vessels or early steamships that were wrecked on the Isles of Scilly. Some of the ships which are represented in the collection are: * a 17th-century stern decoration of the Greek god Boreas and possibly carved by Pierre Puget, is said to be from a French ship wrecked on Annet in that century. * HMS Association - wrecked on the night of 22 October 1707 in the Scilly naval disaster of 1707. The bronze cannon was salvaged from this wreck in 1970. It is a French 18-pounder bronze gun, probably a trophy from the siege of Toulon (1707).

It was named for its distinctive wedge shape by the Garibaldi Park Board in 1932 in preference to Mount Vancouver, which had been submitted earlier. It is part of an unnamed range forming the most northerly group of peaks in the Garibaldi Ranges, the other two most notable being Mount Weart, known as the Armchair because of its shape, and Mount Currie, which overlooks the First Nations Reserve of the same name and the neighbouring town of Pemberton. Wedge's very high prominence is defined by the divide between the Green and Cheakamus Rivers at a locality at the south end of Alta Lake known as Tokum Corners. The mountain sits astride the boundary between the New Westminster and Lillooet Land Districts. Climbing and access Wedge Mountain viewed en route to Mount Weart A steep hike leads to a backcountry shelter and camping area at Wedgemount Lake, which is an approximately three-hour hike (without heavy gear) from a parking lot near the Wedgemont Green Lake railstop and track-crossing of the CNR. Across Wedgemount Lake from the cabin is the glacier, and above that the summit. The cabin, located at the North end of the lake, is at approximately feet. There are multiple ways of approaching the summit. The more direct way is a knife-edge ridge called the Northeast Arete, which leads more or less directly to the summit, requiring a full complement of winter mountaineering equipment. Another route that can be taken without such tools is the South face. This part can be seen from the valley, appearing to be a steep rock-covered slope... which it is, or is it. To approach the South face parties must climb over the glacier to the West Couloir, across the bottom of it and up to the left. Most of Wedge is in a provincial park, so helicopters are not allowed to drop people off there. In the early 1970s the glacier that now almost reaches the eastern end of Wedgemount Lake extended into the lake and at its terminus was approximately ten meters in height.Climbing Weddge & Weart 1971 Wedgemount Falls seen from the hike to Wedgemount Lake Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Wedge Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing.

The ride would cost $10 million to build. Jaguar! would open on June 17, 1995. Ride experience=Queue Riders approach the ride through the temple in the Fiesta Village section of the park. Many Mayan-style drawings and paintings can be seen on the walls throughout the entire temple. The bottom queue is the most themed part. On one side, you can see prisoners that were imprisoned in the temple that are now just skeletons. On another side, riders see a giant Aztec idol with skulls on the side of him. The bottom walls are painted to show Aztec gatherings with prisoners and others. The queue winds through a series of rooms and tunnels. As you walk up the next ramp, you can see more skulls into the temple. Straight ahead, there is giant stone tablet of some more Mayan Jaguar Warriors with the head of a jaguar. To the left of that, there is another Mayan idol head. You can sometimes hear the roaring of the Jaguar, activated when the train enters the helix located at the end of the coaster. Tribal drums and other Mayan sound effects can also be heard. The queue rises in elevation to the station where riders board the roller coaster. Layout The ride starts out with ascending a lift hill after exiting the station. Next, the coaster goes to the left and down slightly. After that, the coaster does a banked right turn up, and then travels through the top of the temple (where the fire effect used to occur) and then goes through the loop of Montezooma's Revenge. The train then turns right and travels up a second lift hill. The track bends left, and the coaster goes through a series of bunny hills. As the track approaches the Timber Mountain Log Ride, it turns around. The train travels through some more bunny hills, then does a banked helix to the left. Finally, it goes into a brake run and arrives back in the station. Lifts The train is propelled by drive tires because of the short distance of the two lifts. These tires vary in tread pattern. The main tread pattern is recycled rubber diamond cut. Some tires appear to not be spinning, but rather are speed monitors, which track how fast the train is being propelled and depending on how fast the train is going, tells the other motors how fast to spin. If the train is going too fast, a fault will occur and the train will stop at the next possible stopping point. Each lift is 65 feet high; the first lift is a 20 degree incline, while the second lift is a 25 degree incline.Jaguar! Standard Operating Procedure Manual Trains There are 2 trains, each with 15 cars. The cars have two types of wheels attached to them: Track wheels on top and guide wheels on the side. Every car has a brake fin underneath it to help in propelling the train through the drive tires and to assist in braking. Each car can seat two riders. There are three locking positions for the restraint system. The trains are themed to match the architectural style of the temple and surrounding area, with a man on the front that the employees, specifically the maintenance personnel, call Victor, in honor of a maintenance person who once worked at Knott's Berry Farm that had an uncanny resemblance to the man on the front of the train, but untimely died from a car accident. Block System Jaguar! has a semi-complex \\"block system\\" to prevent the trains from coming too close or in complete contact with each other. The location of each train is monitored by proximity sensors that when sensing the metal of the brake fin, send the location to the main computer, which is displayed on the main dispatch control panel. The ride has three different blocks not including the station. \\"A Block\\" is from the end of station approach into the station. \\"B Block\\" is from the top of Lift 1 to the top of Lift 2. \\"C Block\\", the only possible place to have a \\"Set Up\\" occur, is from the top of the second lift to the station approach section of the track. A \\"set up\\" is what occurs when one train attempts to enter a block already occupied by another train. The dispatch panel only allows the operator to send one train after the second train has cleared the second lift, thus entering the \\"C Block\\". There are six places where the train can stop: Station, Lift 1, Lift 2 Approach, Lift 2, \\"C\\" Brakes, Station Approach. The train enters the station from station approach automatically when \\"Auto Advance\\" is activated. However, if the \\"Auto Advance\\" is deactivated, the train will stay in Station Approach while the other train travels through A and B Block. Once the train hits the top of Lift 2 with the one train in Station Approach, both lifts will stop immediately and the dispatcher's display will read \\"067 Block C/Setup\\", indicating the two trains are attempting to occupy the same block. The other possible setup is an \\"061 Block R/Setup\\", when the trains become too close in the computer's readings, though only one train is occupying the blocks. Changes One of the first changes to the ride may have been the removal of the fire effect from the top of the temple and the steaming from the jaguars located in the Station Approach section of the track during Cedar Fair's corporate take over. Another change that occurred during the operation of Jaguar! was the addition of fabric seatbelts; very similar to the ones found on Montezooma's Revenge and GhostRider, also due to Cedar Fair. A second more noticeable change was the repainting of the attraction. It was changed from a red track with brown supports to a bright orange track with light blue supports. In 2016 the colors were returned to red track and light brown supports.

The Farr family returned to the United States in 1891, and settled in the San Francisco Bay Area. Farr lived at various times in San Francisco (at 2528 Union), and also in Berkeley, Piedmont, and Oakland. From 1909 through the end of his career he maintained an office at 68 Post Street in San Francisco. Farr earned his architecture license in 1901, one of the first in California. He took on a partner in 1922, eventually naming his firm Farr & Ward. Farr and his firm designed buildings throughout the Bay Area, particularly in the San Francisco neighborhoods of Russian Hill, Pacific Heights, Sea Cliff, and St. Francis Wood.

Western Province went on to win the Simon Trophy that season, as they had in the two previous to it. Test career She was named captain of the South African squad to play the touring English women in 1960-61\\\\. Sheelagh Nefdt batted at number five in the first Test, scoring 24 runs in the first-innings before being stumped. For the second-innings, she dropped herself one place down the batting order, to allow Eileen Hurly, scorer of 96* in the first-innings to come ahead of her. Hurly, however, was run out for just 38, while Nefdt made 62 before declaring the innings with South African leading by 284 runs. Nefdt bowled 16 overs between the two innings, claiming the wicket of Anne Sanders in the first, and Rachael Heyhoe in the second. In the second Test, after England won the toss and scored 351, Nefdt and her South African team scored slowly, a first-innings of 134 taking 95 overs, with Nefdt contributing 8 to the score. Similar slow scoring in the second innings helped South Africa force the draw, still trailing by 77 runs with eight wickets down in their second innings following on when the match finished. The third Test again saw South Africa dismissed cheaply twice. A 55-run fourth- wicket partnership in the first-innings between Nefdt and Hurly, and an 83-run fifth-wicket partnership between Nefdt and Barbara Cairncross in the second were the only highlights in a match that South Africa lost by eight wickets. Nefdt scored her second half-century in Test cricket during the second- innings, top-scoring among the South Africans with 68. Sheelagh Nefdt fell for a duck in the first-innings of the final Test in Cape Town, a pitch that saw high-scoring innings from Ruth Westbrook and Helen Sharpe for England, while Yvonne van Mentz scored South Africa's first century in Test cricket. By promoting herself to open in the second-innings, Nefdt added 11 to the score before being caught and bowled by Anne Sanders for the second time in the match.

Lerner (born September 27, 1960) is a member of the faculty at the New York University Langone School of Medicine. He received his M.D. from Columbia in 1986 and his Ph.D. in history from the University of Washington in 1996. In addition to his research, Lerner practices internal medicine and teaches medical ethics and the history of medicine. Lerner was born to infectious disease doctor Phillip I. Lerner and teacher Ronnie Lerner (n√©e Hober) in Boston, Massachusetts and was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Hawken School in 1978, from the University of Pennsylvania in 1982, and from Columbia University's medical school in 1986. His book The Breast Cancer Wars: Hope, Fear and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America, published in 2001, was cited as an American Library Association Notable Book the following year.Notable books of 2002, American Library Association. Lerner also received the 2006 William H. Welch Medal of the American Association for the History of Medicine for the book; one such Medal is awarded each year to the author or authors of a book of \\"outstanding scholarly merit in the field of medical history\\" published during the five calendar years preceding the award.William H. Welch Medal, List of recipients.William H. Welch Medal, Description of award. His book One for the Road: Drunk Driving Since 1900, is the first history of drunk driving in America. It was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in October 2011. Two of Lerner's other books are Contagion and Confinement: Controlling Tuberculosis on the Skid Road (1998) and When Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients and How We Look at Medicine (2006). Lerner's fifth book, The Good Doctor: A Father, a Son, and the Evolution of Medical Ethics, was published in May 2014. It tells the true story of two doctors, a father and son, who practiced in very different times and the evolution of the ethics, paternalism, and patient autonomy that profoundly influenced health care. The son and father here are Lerner and his father, Phillip I. Lerner. The New York Times reviewed the book in July 2014, saying, \\"The Good Doctor is more than a son‚Äôs search to understand his father‚Äôs actions. It raises pointed questions about his own. Was his father just part of an older generation whose ideas had lost their relevance? Or did the son need to revisit ethical norms he had embraced and taught to thousands of trainees? As he asks, 'Did physicians of my father‚Äôs era actually know their patients in a different ‚Äî and better ‚Äî way than physicians do today?'\\" Lerner writes regularly on topics in clinical medicine, bioethics and medical history for the New York Times, the Washington Post, Slate, the Huffington Post and other publications. He currently teaches courses for the Global Public Health Program at New York University. In addition, he is a physician at Bellevue Hospital. Among Lerner's many contributions to The New York Times is an August, 2011 op-ed piece entitled, \\"The Annals of Extreme Surgery\\". It expressed concern over the increasing use of the HIPEC procedure, a controversial treatment for certain cancers.The Annals of Extreme Surgery, a guest editorial by B.H. Lerner, New York Times, 30 August 2011. After his 9-year-old nephew Cooper Stock was struck and killed by a taxi in New York City when he had the right of way, Lerner wrote a piece for the New York Times blog entitled \\"Treat Reckless Driving Like Drunk Driving.\\" In it, he notes that reckless driving \\"is poorly defined in the law, sometimes poorly investigated by police and almost never results in a criminal charge,\\" much like drunk driving was treated in the 1980s.

The team used Peugeot cycles with Campagnolo components. ANC‚ÄìHalfords was the last British-based team that rode the Tour de France until was invited in 2007. History=The 1985 and 1986 season In 1985, the ANC-Freight-Rover team was formed in 1985 by the transport operator Tony Capper and the former racing cyclist Phil Griffiths, who had plans to get the team into the Tour de France. The team competed on the Continent and in Britain. In Britain, the British Cycling Federation limited teams to six riders, while continental squads had 20 or more. To get around this, the squad in Britain split into three different teams with different sponsors e.g. Lycra-Halfords. On the Continent, all the riders rode under one team name. 1987: the Tour de France In 1987, the team rode under the name ANC‚ÄìHalfords. In races outside England, the team was co- sponsored by T√∂nissteiner. ANC got a wildcard invitation to ride the 1987 Tour de France. The team were inexperienced as only Graham Jones had ridden a major stage race. The team turned up in Berlin and were promised the best equipment such as specialist time-trial cycles. Instead, they rode the opening time trial on standard road bikes, with only four disc wheels between nine riders. Only four riders made it to Paris. The only success was Malcolm Elliot's third place on one stage. The best ranked cyclist in the general classification was Adrian Timmis, ranked 70th. The Tour de France had required a ¬£37,000 entry fee. Some of the cyclists stopped early in the race, and Tony Capper invited guests (including his family and potential sponsors) to take their already reserved hotel rooms. In the last week of the race, Tony Capper left the team, and they did not see him anymore. After the Tour de France, the ANC team was only revived for a few races. Joey McLoughlin won the first Kellogg's Tour of Britain and Malcolm Elliott won two stages in the Nissan Classic in Ireland. By the end of the season, the team ran out of money and was no more. The team's period in the Tour de France and the chaos that surrounded it is captured in Wide-eyed and Legless by the British writer Jeff Connor. Notable riders * Malcolm Elliott. After ANC, Elliott rode for several continental squads including the Spanish Teka team with which in 1989 he won the points jersey in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. After racing in Europe, Elliot had a successful stint on the U.S. pro circuit which included a stage in the Tour du Pont. At 50, Elliot is still racing in the British domestic circuit with the Node-4 team which he also is a director sportif. * Joey McLoughlin. After winning the 1986 Milk Race and the 1987 Kellogg's tour, McLoughlin was tipped to become the best British cyclist since Tom Simpson. After ANC, he signed to the French Z squad. Constant injuries robbed McLoughlin of his potential and he retired in 1991. * Shane Sutton. The Australian rider went on to win the 1990 Milk Race with the Banana-Falcon squad. Sutton settled in Britain and worked as a coach with British Cycling which included the hugely successful team that dominated the cycling events in the 2008 Olympic games in China. Shane became a director sportif with Team Sky where he has personally coached Bradley Wiggins and has been awarded an OBE in the 2010 birthday honours list. He is currently coaching at the Chinese national cycling programme, where the aim is to create a Chinese Tour De France winner by 2024. * Graham Jones The Manchester rider is often described as one of the classiest riders that the UK has produced, but his career was hindered by being over raced in his early days, and by injury in his later days. He was route director of the Tour of Britain cycle race. Now lives in Chang Mai in Thailand and does the odd commentary job for Eurosport. * Paul Watson Paul Watson described his experiences with ANC-Halfords, including completing six stages of the Tour de France, in an edition of the Cycling Podcast, in June 2017.

Walsh notes that before the team broke up, the riders had been rounded up by their soigneur and each injected with an undetermined substance. Swart is quoted as saying: > You think it can't be bad since it doesn't test positive. And I wasn't big > enough to have the right to ask questions. I remember two cyclists from the > team who carried their own briefcases, and it wasn't papers that they > carried around with them.Walsh, David (2012), Seven Deadly Sins, Simon & > Schuster UK Ltd, , page 225.

Origins In 1992, an independent committee of inquiry, the National Competition Policy Review Committee, was established by Prime Minister Keating to inquire into and advise on appropriate changes to legislation and other measures in relation to the scope of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the application of the principles of competition policy. The Committee was chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer and also comprised Mr Geoffrey Tapperall and Mr Mark Rayner. The report was commissioned against a backdrop of major microeconomic reforms led by the Keating Government, but slow progress on areas of the economy sheltered from competition as a result of constitutional limits on the application of the Federal Trade Practices Act or of other actions by Federal or state governments. The report thus had important implications for state- owned enterprises, many of which had begun entering into commercial activities; the professions, which were excluded from the application of Federal law; certain agricultural marketing entities granted monopoly rights; and certain infrastructure entities. The report was prepared through a consultation process that included public solicitation of submissions, public meetings, and extensive discussions with State governments. The Committee presented its report, commonly referred to as the 'Hilmer Report', in 1993. The principal recommendations were: * to bring all commercial activity in Australia within the purview of the Trade Practices Act, regardless of legal form or ownership of the enterprise, thus putting to an end anomalies arising from the division of constitutional authority between Federal and State governments. * to establish a new regulatory regime to prevent enterprises that controlled an \\"essential facility\\" with natural monopoly characteristics from abusing their market power. The new \\"access regime\\" was to be part of an expanded Trade Practices Act. * to establish a set of principles which all Australian Governments should adopt, the most important of which were: ** legislative or regulatory impediments to competition should be subject to review to ensure the costs associated with reduced competition were exceeded by public benefits ** before engaging in commercial activity, state-owned entities should be subject to \\"competitive neutrality\\" requirements to address distortions to competition arising from their various policy privileges. * to reform the organisational arrangements competition policy in Australia, by expanding the role of the Trade Practices Commission (to be renamed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) establish a Competition Policy Council to advise on issues arising the inter-governmental arrangements. The report's recommendations were endorsed in their entirety by Federal and State governments but opposed by a range of other parties such as the Greens and the Democrats and independents. The recommended changes to the Trade Practice Act were implemented quickly, and the report was also used as the basis of the Competition Principles Agreement reached at the 1995 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). The term 'Hilmer reforms' is now used to refer to processes arising from the intergovernmental Competition Principles Agreement and the associated Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 (Cwlth). Key provisions The stated objective of National Competition Policy, as it applies to the public sector, is to achieve the most efficient provision of publicly provided goods and services through reforms designed to minimise restrictions on competition and promote competitive neutrality. The principal reform required under the policy is the application of a public benefit test to justify the maintenance of any public policy that prima facie restricts competition. Policies for which a public benefit cannot be demonstrated must be repealed or modified so that they do not reduce competition. The objective of competitive neutrality policy is the elimination of resource allocation distortions arising out of the public ownership of entities engaged in significant business activities: Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of their public sector ownership. Such principles apply only to the business activities of publicly owned entities, not to the non-business non-profit activities of such entities. Other areas of National Competition Policy require structural reform of public monopolies and require owners of monopoly facilities to negotiate third-party access agreements with other users. Benefits Studies undertaken by the Productivity Commission, a strong advocate of microeconomic reform, concluded that the Hilmer reforms had a substantial impact on productivity growth and helped to underpin the strong period of economic growth that Australia enjoyed in the 1990s and the early 2000s. Critics argued that the evidence was at best inconclusive.() Controversy While the report itself involved a limited public consultation process, the relatively rapid pace of implementation of the report's recommendations allowed few opportunities for public education and debate. That contributed to a hostile public reaction, which was particularly evident in support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in the 1998 Queensland election.

Possibly descended from the Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs of what is now County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions. War, increasing mechanisation and declines in the local small-farm population almost resulted in the breed's extinction. In 1994, a local man found and genetically tested a herd of 20 ponies he used as the foundation stock for rebuilding of the breed. In the early 2000s, the breed was recognised by the Irish Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission; equine passports began to be issued for members of the breed, and small numbers of ponies were exported to the United States. At the same time, Irish and American breed registries were formed. As of 2011, the registered population is more than 300 ponies. Characteristics mane and forelock of a Kerry Bog Pony Kerry Bog Ponies generally stand high. The Irish breed standard calls for mares to stand 10‚Äì11 hands and stallions and geldings to stand 11‚Äì12 hands. Their low weight-to-height ratio enables them to walk on wet ground. Their hind feet tend to track outside their front feet, allowing better progress on soft ground. They exhibit a relatively upright pastern and steep hoof angle compared to other breeds, possibly another characteristic that aids their movement in peat bogs. Kerry Bog Ponies are easy keepers, and when feral they lived on low-nutrient heather, sphagnum moss and possibly kelp from the shoreline. Overall, they are muscular and strong and their heads have concave profiles, small ears and large eyes. Their winter coat is long and dense, serving as protection from harsh weather. All solid coat colours are found, including dilute colours such as palomino, and white markings are common. Pinto-coloured animals are not accepted by the Irish registry. The breed is known by enthusiasts for strength, intelligence and athleticism, and generally used for driving, as companion animals and for therapeutic riding programs. Kerry Bog Ponies were historically known in Ireland as \\"hobbies\\", possibly derived from the Gaelic practice of obaireacht, or the calling out of \\"Hup, Hup\\" to attract a pony back to the farmyard. It is considered one of the mountain and moorland pony breeds from the British Isles. A 2006 study using mitochondrial DNA found that the Kerry Bog Pony is not closely related to the other two native Irish breeds, the Irish Draught and the Connemara pony. It has a rare haplogroup more closely related to other small horse breeds found in western Europe, including the Shetland pony and Icelandic horse. A 2012 study found relationships between the Kerry Bog Pony and the Dartmoor Pony and Exmoor Pony breeds, and a lack of common ancestry with the Welsh Pony, as well as reinforcing the lack of relationship to the Connemara. The study also suggested that the Kerry Bog Pony population had some amount of crossbreeding with other mountain and moorland breeds as part of the initial attempts to increase the population in the 1990s. The Kerry Bog Pony may have been one of several breeds that contributed to the development of the Gypsy Vanner horse (also known as the Irish Cob). History A stallion with pack saddle The original ancestry of the Kerry Bog Pony is unknown, but there were horses living a feral existence in peat bogs in what is now County Kerry in southwestern Ireland since at least the 1600s. Some enthusiasts claim that the breed is a descendant of the ancient Irish Hobby. In a 1617 book illustration, the horses pictured resemble both the Kerry Bog Pony of today and the original Irish Hobby, showing the two breeds' similar morphology. Originally, Kerry Bog Ponies were used to transport peat and kelp. They were known for their ability to navigate through the bogs, around soft spots and over rocks often in wet and windy weather, and for their strength relative to their small size. Some were trained to work in harness and used to pull carts. The ponies were turned loose into the peat bogs when they were not needed, then later re-caught for work. Few if any breeding programs existed; instead, they were left to reproduce in their feral setting. In 1720, Isaac Ware travelled to County Kerry and observed that the horses resembled Asturc√≥n ponies from Spain. The British cavalry became aware of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most did not return to Ireland. The famine of 1845‚Äì1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who previously utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals. Re-emergence A pony at the Kerry Bog Village Museum In 1994, John Mulvihill, who operated the Red Fox Inn at the Kerry Bog Village in Glenbeigh, County Kerry, began a search for remnants of the Kerry Bog Pony population, despite reports that the breed was extinct. He eventually found 20 ponies that resembled those he remembered from his childhood, and removed them from the bog to his stables. In 1995, he had blood typing performed on the ponies by Weatherby's Ireland, which identified their DNA markers. Subsequent DNA testing showed them to be a unique breed that formed a separate population from other local ponies and from other breeds in Ireland and Great Britain. Of these 20 ponies, only one was a stallion, named Flashy Fox. Between 1995 and 2012, he sired more than 140 foals, and played a significant role in repopulating the breed. Mulvihill continued breeding and promoting the ponies, and in 2002, the breed was recognised by the Irish Government as the Irish Heritage Pony. The same year, the Kerry Bog Pony Society was formed. Also in 2002, Americans became interested in the breed, and the first ponies were exported from Ireland to the US in 2003, to a farm in Ohio. In 2005, the American Kerry Bog Pony Society was founded, with 11 initial registrants. Also in 2005, the Irish Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission recognised the Kerry Bog Pony as an official breed; the following year, the Irish Horse Board issued the first equine passports for members of the breed. Until 2009, there was an exception in place that allowed unrelated ponies that met the physical breed standards to be bred as Kerry Bog Ponies, with the offspring being registered and given passports certifying them as purebred Kerry Bog Ponies. This was in part due to a concern of inbreeding among the small number of ponies initially registered. Kerry Bog Ponies were also part of the Irish Rural Environment Protection Scheme (closed to new applicants in 2009), which financially rewarded farmers for using environmentally-friendly methods. The Kerry Bog Village, an open-air museum on the Ring of Kerry is one location that breeds and houses part of the existing Kerry Bog Pony population. As of 2011, there were 335 mares and 51 stallions registered with the Irish registry, which included 59 new foals that year. Herd numbers have steadily increased since registrations began in 2005. These numbers make the Kerry Bog Pony third in population numbers among Irish breeds, behind the Connemara pony and the Irish Draught. Despite the increasing numbers, the breed is still considered to be critically endangered by the Equus Survival Trust. The horses are administered by the Kerry Bog Pony Co-Operative Society of Ireland (formerly the Kerry Bog Pony Society), which is based in Ireland with a branch in Great Britain. Inspections are required before ponies are allowed into the studbook. The book is divided into four classes: Class 1 ponies meet all requirements, Class 2 ponies do not meet the height requirement, Class 3 ponies do not meet the color requirements, and Class 4 ponies have yet to submit to an official inspection. The breed association has hosted an annual breed show and sale in Glenbeigh, County Kerry since 2007. The first two ponies exported from Ireland went to a farm in Austria in August 2016. The International Kerry Bog Pony Association was formed around the same time in 2016 by a group of breeders from a small group of countries to create a registry to accommodate pony owners spanning multiple countries.

At the , Portland had a population of 2,424 people.http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/SSC13250?opendocument The town was named after Australia's first cement works. Location Portland is part of the gateway to the Central West and is located between Oberon, Mudgee, Bathurst, Lithgow, and the Blue Mountains. It is a short drive from both the Great Western and Castlereagh Highways. It is accessed from the Great Western Highway via Wallerawang or from Sunny Corner Rd at Meadow Flat. It is accessed from the Castlereagh Highway via Boulder Road at the Mt Piper Power Station. The town centre has a distinct business district, several parks and sporting clubs. History Prior to white settlement, the Portland region was occupied by the Wiradjuri people. The first European in the area was James Blackman who surveyed roads in the area in 1820 and today Blackman's Flat and Blackman's Crown bear the family name. The town of Portland is of interest as an historic mining town, and also as the place of the first cement factory in Australia. Portland really got its start when Thomas Murray selected 61 hectares of land in 1863 and constructed his first lime kiln on what is now the corner of Lime and Villiers Streets. The railway came through Portland in 1882 and the first station opened in 1887 was called Cullen Siding until 1889. The Cullen Bullen Lime and Cement Company established operations in the village that year. During the early 1890s, the first cement-making kilns west of the Blue Mountains were built in Portland. In 1894, the village was gazetted as Portland, the name derived from the cement-making process which was already well underway in the area. The cement works opened in 1902 and Portland was declared a town in 1906. Many of the original buildings in Portland were built by the cement works company for employees and still stand. Well-known Australian brand names now adorn many of the historic shops and buildings, creating a strong link to \\"yesteryear\\" that is celebrated by the town.  Heritage listings  Portland has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Carlton Road: Raffan's Mill and Brick Bottle Kilns * Williwa Street: Portland Cement Works Precinct The cement works Commonwealth Portland Cement Works, . From 1902 cement produced at the \\"Commonwealth Portland Cement Company\\" mill helped build up the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, and Canberra. \\"Portland cement\\", a phrase synonymous with high quality cement anywhere in the world, was milled using limestone from onsite quarries and shipped throughout Australia. The town of Portland grew up around the Cement Works and the company contributed greatly to the area, building facilities that were needed for employees. A bath house, casino, an ice skating rink, Olympic swimming pool, and living quarters were supplied to workers. The cement kilns even generated enough energy to power the homes around it. The factories of Portland and the surrounding area required the transportation of limestone, coal, and other materials, and to this end, a number of private industrial railways and tramways were constructed. Climate and weather At an altitude of 925 metres above sea level, Portland is the 21st highest town in Australia and classified as a temperate zone. Cool winters and warm summers ensure four distinct seasons and snowfalls each winter. The Crystal Theatre Originally constructed as a theatre and public hall, the original building was destroyed by fire in 1925. Current release films are shown monthly and the hall is maintained by volunteers and available for community use. Signs of yesteryear In 2001, Ron Bidwell, a signwriter by trade, together with his fellow \\"Letterheads\\" recreated vintage signs dating from 1895 to 1945 on local shop walls. ‚ÄòPainting Portland‚Äô was a project initiated by Ron Bidwell and completed during the Letterheads Wallnuts Weekend, in 2001. Thirty-four signwriters travelled to Portland to work with locals to restore and reproduce advertising used in the early part of the 20th century. Goanna Salve, Kinkara Tea, Bushell's Tea, Mother's Choice Flour, Uncle Toby's Oats, Arnott's Biscuits, Toohey's Flag Ale, Solvol, Federal Safety Matches and Swagsman Blend Tea are a selection from the colourful Signs of Yesteryear.

Adjacent to the town is a 650-acre Town Common with the Williewa Creek and flats running through the centre. \\"The Williewa\\" is an open eucalypt forest with an abundance of Eucalyptus macrorhyncha (Red stringybark) and native wildflowers and is popular with picnickers, mountain bikers and bushwalkers. There is a small well stocked dam and a plethora of birdlife as well as native wildlife, including Calyptorhynchus funereus (Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo), Platycercus elegans (Crimson rosella), Alisterus scapularis (King Parrot) and Macropus giganteus (Eastern grey Kangaroo). The surrounding forests are popular with 4WD and dirt bike enthusiasts. Sunny Corner, Ben Bullen, Wolgan and Newnes State forests are all nearby and bush camping is available. Portland is also a popular destination for geocaching, as well as rogaining and orienteering. The town is close to the Wollemi National Park, the Gardens of Stone National Park and the Turon National Park. Portland is abundant in wild foods dependent on season. Spring is when wild apples and stone fruits are in bloom. Summer is the season for ripe blackberries, which are a noxious weed, and the more difficult to locate stone fruits. During Autumn, apples, pears and quince are ripe and the forests are rich with mushrooms. Lactarius deliciosus and Boletes (Boletus portentosus) are safe to eat. Trout fishing is possible in local streams and creeks, the best known spot being Thompson's Creek Dam which is a twenty-minute hike from the carpark on Thompson's Creek Rd via the Falnash State Forest. Transport A railway station was opened at Portland with the name \\"Cullen Siding\\" in 1887, being renamed to Portland in 1889, the station was relocated in 1911 . Passenger rail services ceased when services to Mudgee railway station ceased in 1985. Rail services included the Mudgee Mail in the 1960s, and diesel multiple unit services between Lithgow and Mudgee in the 1970s until closing in 1985. As of 2020, Lithgow Buslines operates return services from Lithgow, and well as visiting Portland en route between Lithgow and Bathurst.

In the book, Randi challenges Geller's assertions that he performs paranormal feats. Randi explores Geller's background as a stage magician, and explains how Geller's spoon bending can be easily reproduced by any magician using sleight of hand. In 1991 Geller filed a $15 million lawsuit against Randi and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) over slander concerning Randi's statements that Geller had \\"tricked even reputable scientists\\" with tricks that \\"are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes when I was a kid\\". The court dismissed the case and Geller had to eventually settle the case at a cost of $120,000. In February 1992, Geller sued Randi, Prometheus and local book distributors in London, England for libel concerning The Magic of Uri Geller. The lawsuit centered on the sentence: \\"He began his career as a stage magician in Israel where he was once arrested for claiming his feats were performed with psychic power\\", since Geller had not been arrested but merely sued. The publisher issued an erratum that changed the phrase \\"he was once arrested\\" to \\"he was once sued\\". Randi commented in 1993 that \\"My position is that I made an unintended factual error in misinterpreting the words 'brought to court' and 'guilty' as 'arrested,' and that this was done without malice or reckless disregard for the truth.\\" Geller lost this case as well and had to pay Randi's legal fees. In April 1992 Geller sued Prometheus Books for $4 million alleging libel in two other books. This suit was thrown out in 1994 and the judge ordered Geller to pay $20,272.89 in legal fees. After Geller's three lawsuits, Randi said he \\"never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me, and certainly not to Geller\\". Reception Dave Langford reviewed The Truth About Uri Geller for White Dwarf #43, and stated that \\"Randi puts the boot into the charismatic Uri. His scorn is withering; even if you think he leans too far towards skepticism (I don't), it's impressive and damning that Randi can duplicate any and all of Geller's paltry tricks without need to claim astral powers ‚Äì while Geller's power mysteriously desert him when Randi or other professional magicians happen to be watching.\\" See also *Exposure (magic) ReferencesExternal links 1982 non-fiction books Biographies (books) Books by James Randi Prometheus Books books Scientific skepticism mass media ","title":"The Truth About Uri Geller"},{"id":"9572782","text":"Bracket buster, as a generic phrase, refers to an American college basketball team, usually from a so-called mid-major school, which upsets a highly ranked team in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament and to a lesser extent, the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament. The tournament schedule is set up as a single-elimination \\"bracket\\" format. When the tournament's selection committee announces the teams that are invited to play and the schedule of the games, fans will try to guess the outcome of as many games as possible by filling out the bracket form for each round. This is often accompanied by gambling on the outcome of these predictions; this often takes the form of an informal pool where participants stake a certain amount of money, and the most successful predictor wins the pooled stakes. When a lightly regarded mid-major team upsets a traditional powerhouse team, the result often knocks out subsequent predictions of many players in these informal pools, who are said to have had their brackets busted‚Äîhence, the term \\"bracket buster.\\" There are numerous examples of bracket buster teams over the years of the NCAA Tournament, even dating back before the tournament came to be the widespread cultural event that it is today. One early example is the March 18, 1971 Mideast Regional game in which Western Kentucky defeated its better-known in-state \\"big brother,\\" Kentucky, 107‚Äì83. The game was more significant to hoops fans in the Bluegrass State, as the Kentucky Wildcats and coach Adolph Rupp had steadfastly refused to play any other in-state schools (including Louisville) in regular season games, so the game itself was very significant no matter the outcome. The Hilltoppers later advanced to the Final Four. As the tournament field expanded to the now-familiar six-round bracket and 68 teams (including 4 play-in games), \\"bracket busters\\" became more of a phenomenon. One notable example is George Mason and its improbable run to the Final Four in the 2006 tournament. Bradley was another example in the same tournament, having been assigned the 13th seed in their region, only to upset Kansas and Pitt to reach the \\"Sweet 16\\" round, where the Braves were finally ousted by top-seeded Memphis. The 2010 tournament featured many bracket busters. In the second round, a ten seed (St. Mary's) defeated a two seed (Villanova) while Northern Iowa, a nine seed, defeated the overall top seed, Kansas. In ESPN's bracket challenge, over 42%http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/en/whopickedwhom?entryID=0 picked Kansas to win the tournament, making Northern Iowa's upset one of the biggest in many years. ESPN BracketBusters As the phrase became more popular, ESPN decided to capitalize on the phenomenon with the concept of ESPN BracketBusters. The cable television network worked with a group of non money conferences, including the Mid-American Conference, the Missouri Valley Conference, the Colonial Athletic Association, the Horizon League, and the Western Athletic Conference to stage a series of games where possible bracket-buster teams would play each other outside of regular conference play. The idea was to give these non-money schools more exposure to national audiences than they would otherwise get, and boost their chances of being selected for the NCAA Tournament. The first series began in 2003, where 18 teams played in one weekend. The matchups for these games was left open as late as possible, in order to determine the most likely teams to benefit. The concept proved greatly successful, and the 2006 edition of ESPN BracketBusters‚Äîwith corporate sponsorship by eBay‚Äîfeatured 100 different teams. So many teams were involved that fewer than half the games were actually televised on the ESPN family of networks. The 2007 edition had O'Reilly Auto Parts as the title sponsor. The 2012 edition had Sears as the title sponsor. In 2006, two teams that faced each other in an ESPN BracketBusters game‚ÄîGeorge Mason and Wichita State‚Äîfaced each other in the Sweet 16.

Counts Luitold von Achalm and Kuno von W√ºlflingen gave extensive donations the monastery. There was also at one time a convent on the spot, but by the 14th century it was no longer there. Until the 15th century, the monastery was influential, but in 1525 the German Peasants' War resulted in the monastery being plundered. In 1750 the abbey was granted the status of Reichsabtei, which meant that it had the status of an independent power subject only to the Imperial Crown and was free of the rule of W√ºrttemberg. By 1802, however, the monastery was dissolved as part of the German mediatization. Today it is part of the psychiatric hospital. as Notre-Dame Cathedral, the church in 1806 secularized [8] abbey, considered a masterpiece of the German late Baroque. Construction was started in 1739 by brothers Joseph and Martin Schneider and completed by 1765 by Johann Michael Fischer. The rich interior of the church contains a late Gothic miraculous image of 1430 and baroque frescoed ceilings and an altarpiece by Franz Joseph Spiegler, frescoes by Andreas Meinrad von Au, stucco work by Johann Michael Feuchtmayer d.

The history of Piedmont, California, covers the history of the area in California's San Francisco Bay Area that is now known as Piedmont, up to and beyond the legal establishment of a city. Pre-hotel In 1850, what is now Piedmont was part of Rancho San Antonio. This area, owned by the Peralta family, covered much of the northeastern shore of San Francisco Bay, now northern Alameda County. Rancho San Antonio was sparsely populated except for cattle and the vaqueros who tended them. In 1860, retired South Carolinian Congressman Isaac Holmes bought a piece of land from his neighbor Reed. The area included Bushy Dell Creek, a creek that runs through the dog-walking trail of modern-day Piedmont. Holmes bathed in the foul-smelling pink water of a nearby spring, believing the water beneficial for his rheumatism. Piedmont Springs Hotel In 1870, Walter Blair bought over 800 acres (3.2 km¬≤) of land in the foothills of East Bay. Where the spring was located he built the Piedmont Springs Hotel, of 20 bedrooms and five dining rooms. The water of the spring was thought to have curative powers. Wealthy San Franciscans retired to the hotel during trips to \\"the country.\\" In addition to the hotel, Blair built a dairy farm on what is now Highland Avenue and a quarry where Dracena Park is today. In April 1877, James Gamble bought a 350-acre (1.4 km¬≤) tract of land from Blair, and formed the Piedmont Land Company, along with James deFremery, George W. Beaver, L.A. Booth, and T.L. Barker. The Piedmont Land Company hired landscape engineer William Hammond Hall to plan the avenues and subdivide the tract into 67 parcels. The first auction of land took place on April 10, 1877. In January 1891, the women of Piedmont led a temperance movement to block the sale of liquor at the Piedmont Springs Hotel. They petitioned the Alameda County Board of Supervisors to withdraw the liquor license granted to the owner of the hotel. Prominent signers included Annie Barton, Anna Richardson, N. Randall, Florence Wing, Inez Craig, M. Laurence, Ethyl Robert, and Mary Gamble. Fire The liquor controversy ended quickly with the Piedmont Springs Hotel fire. On November 17, 1892, sparks from the chimney of the hotel set the roof on fire. Newspapers reported that Firefighters had to arrive from Oakland, two hours later, at 11:30 a.m., to contain the flames. Called \\"the Blessed Damozel\\" by George Sterling and photographed here by Laura Adams Armer, Elsie Whitaker served as a \\"muse\\" for the Bohemians of Piedmont, and would marry Xavier Martinez. Bohemians Jack London never actually lived in \\"Piedmont\\", because in 1900, Scenic Avenue was in unincorporated Oakland. After marrying Bess Maddern, the newlywed couple settled in a redwood bungalow in the eastern hills of unincorporated Oakland, later to become part of the present-day city of Piedmont. At the time, this area was growing into a community for artists. It was here that London wrote his novel Call of the Wild.Piedmont Community Calendar 1997. Historical information about Piedmont written by Ann Swift. Printed 1996 by the City of Piedmont. London's two daughters, including Joan London, were born during this time. In 1902, London moved to 206 Scenic Avenue, and \\"tried to create a childhood he never had,\\" Piedmont historian Ann Swift wrote. He entertained \\"Peter Pans of both sexes,\\" flew kites, held bubble-blowing contests, and competed to see who could swallow the most soda crackers. London's friends included fellow Bohemians George Sterling, James Hopper, Herman Whitaker, Xavier Martinez, Blanche Partington, and Charmian Kittredge. After divorcing Bess Maddern London in 1904, he married Kittredge. The Bohemians were characterized by living non- traditional lifestyles as artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Unlike their wealthier neighbors, the Bohemians of Piedmont could not afford to have their homes constructed for them and instead built them themselves. Becoming a city Francis Marion Smith and Frank C. Havens encouraged the development of pre-Piedmont into a city. Smith, who made his fortune on borax, built railroads, especially the East Bay's Key System. Havens headed and was in charge of the Realty Syndicate, which subdivided 13,000 acres (53 km¬≤) of East Bay property. Havens acquired a five-year lease on the Piedmont Springs Park and began a major restoration. In May 1898 the new park was complete. In 1901, the first post office opened. In 1908 Havens built an art gallery where the tennis courts are today. Carrie Sterling, estranged wife of George Sterling, nephew of Havens, served as curator. The population of Piedmont increased fourfold following the 1906 earthquake. San Franciscans fled the City to the hills, which were believed to be safer from earthquakes. To accommodate the growing population, a new city hall and fire station were built a block from the park. Two elections were held among the citizens of Piedmont in 1907, both of which narrowly upheld the decision for Piedmont to become a city. By the Roaring Twenties, Piedmont was known as the \\"City of Millionaires\\" because it had the most resident millionaires per square mile of any city in the United States. Many of these millionaires built mansions that still stand, notably on Glen Alpine Road/Sotelo Avenue and Sea View Avenue in upper Piedmont. Piedmont became a charter city under the laws of the State of California on December 18, 1922. On February 27, 1923, voters adopted the charter, which can only be changed by another vote of the people. By the 1920s, Frank Havens had died and Piedmont Park was on the path towards subdivision. Wallace Alexander, who had recently moved to Piedmont from Hawaii with his wife, Mary Alexander, stepped forward. He loaned the city enough to buy the park, and encouraged the Bay Area architect Albert L. Farr to create the Civic Center Plan. Civic Center Plan This plan was presented to the community in 1922. It included expanding City Hall, building a city library, and connecting the entrance of Piedmont Park to the electric trolley line, which was the transportation at the time. Of the plan, little did materialize. The exedra, the structure that includes the iconic vase of Piedmont, was built at the head of Piedmont Park. Piedmont High School was built in 1921 and opened to students the following year. It was funded by a bond passed by voters in 1920. However, the stock market crash of 1929 plunged many into financial ruin that kept the rest of the plan, for which bonds had not already been passed, from completion. A bond for the creation of Piedmont High School was passed in 1920, and the school was built in 1921. After the school was built for $250,000, it was found that an additional $100,000 was needed. Piedmont High School Up until the creation of the high school, students had attended elementary school in Piedmont, and turned to Oakland for junior and senior high. In September 1922, the Piedmont Unified School District opened the city's first high school. The school was built in 1921 in a neoclassical design, part of the same plan that built the Piedmont city's Exedra. A cafeteria was added in 1923, a library in 1924, and an adjacent junior high in 1926. Since its design by architect W.H. Weeks, the school has undergone several reconstructions, for reasons such as expansion, earthquake retrofitting, and combating dry rot. In 1974, the school was declared unsafe under state earthquake laws. It was demolished, and three new classroom buildings and a gymnasium were built. The original library, quad, and administration buildings were rehabilitated. In the 1920s the high school offered an equestrian club for students who rode their horses around Piedmont, which was then much less developed than today. Girls wore sailor- suit tops with uniform skirts, boys had a stricter dress code than today, and original artwork decorated the walls of the school. Ever since its creation, when an additional $100,000 was needed to expand the school, the high school has faced reconstruction numerous times. In the 1970s the breezeway was one of the \\"back-to-nature\\"-esque additions made. During the 2003-2004 school years an entrance and trophy room to the gymnasium was added. In 2006, voters passed Measure E, issuing $56 million to earthquake retrofitting of the city's schools.Measure E http://www.smartvoter.org/2006/03/07/ca/alm/meas/E/ ReferencesExternal links *History, City of Piedmont Piedmont Piedmont Piedmont Piedmont, California ","title":"History of Piedmont, California"},{"id":"9572800","text":"Vakƒ±flƒ± K√∂y√º ( Vak'√´f, ) is the only remaining Armenian village in Turkey. Located on the slopes of Musa Dagh in the Samandaƒü district of Hatay Province, the village overlooks the Mediterranean Sea and is within eyesight of the Syrian border. It is home to a community of about 130 Turkish-Armenians. The local Western Armenian dialect is highly divergent and cannot be fully understood by other Western Armenians. The residents of Vakƒ±flƒ± are the descendants of those Armenians who resisted the Armenian genocide of 1915 on Musa Dagh. For 53 days they repelled attacks by Turkish troops until French sailors sighted a banner that the Armenians had tied to a tree on the mountain emblazoned with the words \\"Christians in Distress: Rescue\\". After being transported to Port Said by the French, seven Armenian villages returned to their homes while Hatay was under French occupation starting from 1918. Following an agreement between France and Turkey and a controversial Referendum, the district reverted to Turkey on June 29, 1939, a move still not recognized by Syria. After this move the other six Armenian villages immigrated out of Hatay settling in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, especially Anjar, while the residents of Vakƒ±flƒ± chose to stay. Vakƒ±flƒ± suffered from a lack of jobs until the mid-2000s, prompting the younger generation to move to Istanbul. An estimated 500 former residents of Vakƒ±flƒ± live in Istanbul, and the village population increases to around 300 in summer as they visit. However, with the help of the district governor (kaymakam) and the TEMA Foundation, which identified ten villages and developed specific projects for each village to stop the urban migration, Vakƒ±flƒ± was selected for development of organic farming and eco-tourism, and the village obtained the only EU organic farming certification in the region. In 2004, Vakƒ±flƒ± Village Cooperative exported organic oranges worth one million Euros, giving hope of economic viability to the village and prompting some villagers to move back from Istanbul. Between 1994 and 1997, the village church was reconstructed and expanded with assistance from the Turkish government. In 2005, Vakƒ±flƒ± restored its old school building, turning it into a bed-and-breakfast, with two more old houses being converted to bed-and-breakfasts. With the help of the local government and the Association for Development of Vakƒ±flƒ±, an Istanbul based organization, a project for ecotourism is being implemented that aims to restore the traditional stone houses of the village.http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2015/4/for-last-armenian- village-in-turkey-no-remembrance-of-things-past.html Recent development Vakƒ±flƒ± hosted 20 Syrian refugees of Armenian origin from Kesab during the Syrian civil war.Sol newspaper (9. of April, 2014) Education Children in the village take school buses to schools away from the village.

It is the basis of the 2007 movie Freedom Writers, starring Hilary Swank. The Freedom Writers Diary was made up of journals that Erin Gruwell told her students to write in about the troubles of their past, present and future. The Freedom Writers name pays homage to the name of the 1960s civil rights group Freedom Riders. After intercepting a racist drawing from one of her students, Gruwell compared the drawings to Nazi propaganda techniques. She drew blank stares; only one of them had heard of the Holocaust. As a result, she assigned them to read and write about The Diary of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo. The Freedom Writers Foundation continued with exercises and philosophies similar to those used in the original class, and tracks the progress of the original and continuing classes. Plot summary As an idealistic 23-year-old English teacher at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California, Erin Gruwell confronted a room of \\"unteachable, at-risk\\" students. One day she intercepted a note with a racial caricature, and angrily declared that this was precisely the sort of thing that led to the Holocaust ‚Äì only to be met by uncomprehending looks. So she and her students, using the treasured books Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo as their guides, undertook a life-changing, eye-opening, spirit- raising odyssey against intolerance and misunderstanding. They learned to see the parallels between these books and their own lives, recording their thoughts and feelings in diaries and dubbing themselves the \\"Freedom Writers\\" in homage to the civil rights activists \\"The Freedom Riders.\\" With funds raised by a \\"Read-a-thon for Tolerance,\\" they arranged for Miep Gies, the Dutch woman who sheltered the Frank family, to visit them in California during the 1994/1995 school year, where she declared that Erin Gruwell's students were \\"the real heroes.\\" Their efforts have paid off spectacularly, both in terms of recognition ‚Äì appearances on Primetime Live and All Things Considered, coverage in People magazine, a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley ‚Äì and educational benefit. All 150 Freedom Writers graduated from high school and many went on to attend college. Banning of the book in schools On March 11, 2008, an English teacher at Perry Meridian High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, Connie Heermann, was suspended for a year and a half without pay for using the Freedom Writers Diary in her classroom against the wishes of the school board.Teacher banned for using 'Freedom Writers' book Administrators objected to racial slurs and sexual content in portions of the book.

(1998) 'Lime and Limestone' Wiley-VCH pp 406. Such compounds include lead nitrate and calcine. Mineralogy Decrepitation is one of the most accurate ways to calculate a mineral-deposit scale so that the analysis of the hydrothermal system is advanced and improved. Fluid inclusions are important in regards to decrepitation because they are the microscopic areas of gas and liquid within crystals that are decrepitated, or broken, with the application of heat. When decrepitating the crystal or salt, the liquid pressure is released which can result in a crack. However, in some cases the fluid inclusions are not fully decrepitated, in which case other methods must be used. Despite this shortcoming, decrepitation is the preferred procedure for identifying minerals because it allows for the quickest and greatest number of inclusions to be measured. The pressure necessary to spur decrepitation is reliant upon the size of the fluid inclusions; bigger inclusions decrepitate more easily at pressures between 700-900 atmospheres, while smaller fluid inclusions may require upwards of 1200 atmospheres, contrastingly, when fluid inclusions become even smaller, the amount of pressure applied will have no effect and decrepitation will not occur. Decrepitation in metamorphic rock If the decrepitation begins at a temperature less than the temperature required to form the mineral, it is likely that the rate of decrepitation will speed up once the temperature exceeds that of the initial heating . For metamorphic rocks, there are certain principles for measuring the decrepitations. What is known as D1 decrepitation, is classified as a temperature range of about 200-300‚ÑÉ, and is caused by the liquid phase which occupies intricate inclusions, as in hydrothermal minerals. D2 decrepitation is characterized by a starting heat range of about 300-700‚ÑÉ, the temperature can also increase rapidly for a few hundred degrees, such as in solid inclusions. D3 decrepitation is continuously heated until the rate reaches its maximum out at about 350-450‚ÑÉ, D3 decrepitation can be observed in carbonates and is defined by the effect of an inversion of the mineral. Once decrepitation of a D4 mineral is reached it should reach completion within a few degrees, which is seen in the decrepitation of quartz. Decrepitation as a result of decomposition is known as D5 decrepitation, it is characterized by a sharp upwards rate, a definite peak, and a sharp downwards rate, this can be detected by comparing the peaks of various minerals within a rock.

Cortizone's only hope of returning to power resides in the mysterious cargo of a seaplane which flies him over the Pacific. As the plane's pilot, Von Schnabbel, tries to extort money from him, the two men argue and Von Schnabbel is ejected from the cockpit. Cortizone is left alone with the plane's controls. After crashing the aircraft on the bottom of a lagoon in an atoll, he is helped by Spirou and Fantasio, on holiday nearby, who initially do not recognize him. Taking advantage of Fantasio's feelings of depression, Cortizone neutralizes Spirou thanks to a homemade drug, and persuades Fantasio to retrieve his cargo. This cargo later proves to be a large quantity of bad luck charms, stolen from Chinese Triads. However, the Chinese arrive, guided by Von Schnabbel. Cortizone, Spirou and Fantasio are taken captive but the two heroes manage to flee by leaving Cortizone and Von Schnabbel on the atoll, while the Chinese become victims of an explosion.

Stapp was born in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. His family moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 1921, and Stapp was educated in that city. He became the programme controller at Georgia Tech's own radio station and oversaw its development to a commercial radio station as WGST. After relocating to New York, Stapp came to the attention of WSM (AM) back in Nasville, who made him their programme manager. After World War II, Stapp joined forces with Lou Cowan to create Tree International Publishing. Stapp co-wrote, with Harry Stone, the popular song \\"Chattanooga Shoe Shine Boy\\" (1950). By 1954, Tree Publishing's song, \\"By the Law of My Heart\\", was recorded by Benny Martin. The following year, two of Tree Publishing's songwriters, Mae Boren Axton and Tommy Durden, co-wrote \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\". By 1964, Stapp had left his radio duties behind to concentrate his efforts in expanding Tree. He later became a founder-member of the Country Music Association and held top posts with NARAS. Stapp died in 1980, but was posthumously inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1989. Tree International Publishing, a music publisher, is still based in Nashville.

It was one of the first schools in the world authorized to offer all three International Baccalaureate programs. Founded in 1911, the independent, non-profit, non-sectarian school offers co-ed K‚Äì12 education. As of August 2018, the school's total enrollment was 525, with more than 60 nationalities represented. Due to legal requirements, only holders of non-Turkish passports are eligible to apply to the school.  History  IICS was founded in 1911 during the reign of Sultan Mehmed V in the Ottoman Empire. The school was initially named Robert College Community School (RCCS) and served as the sister school to Robert College (RC) for the education of RC faculty members' children. Initially, the school was located in Anderson Hall, which was then part of Robert College and is now part of Boƒüazi√ßi University. The land was bought by Robert College founder Cyrus Hamlin from Ahmed Vefik Pasha in 1861. During World War I and II, RCCS was temporarily closed on multiple occasions. thumb In 1958, RCCS moved to the Grosvenor House near the present-day Hisar Campus. The house was named after Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, who was born in the house, and whose father Edwin taught at Robert College. The school remained primarily in the Grosvenor House until it burned down on 18 December 1985. RCCS was renamed Istanbul International Community School in 1979 to reflect that it was now open to all expatriate students. The primary building at the Hisar Campus, known as the White House, was originally built for an English merchant family in the early 20th century. The house had first been used in the 1969-70 academic year. The ginkgo tree still found at the Early Years playground here is believed to be the first ginkgo tree in Turkey, and originally arrived from London's Kew Gardens.  Campuses  The school is located on two campuses:  Hisar Campus  The smaller Hisar Campus is part of the school's original grounds and is closer to the city center. The 2048 m¬≤ wooded campus overlooks the Rumelian Castle (Turkish: Rumeli Hisarƒ±) in the city's Sarƒ±yer district and serves students from preschool to grade 3. Facilities include a library, PE and music room, rubberized basketball court, football pitch, climbing wall, and two playgrounds.  Marmara Campus  The school's primary, purpose-built campus is located 25 miles (40 km) west of the city center in Karaaƒüa√ß, B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece. The 16 hectare (40 acre) campus which opened in 1999 caters to approximately 75% of the student body and is home to 30+ classrooms and a separate Early Years building. An \\"automated library/media center, music rooms with practice studios, a purpose-built art atelier, a theater and outside amphitheater...2 gymnasiums, outside basketball/tennis courts, and a regulation-sized sports pitch\\" are available for use.  Curriculum  As the school is authorized and accredited by the International Baccalaureate, the three years of Early Years (3, 4, 5) and grades 1-6 are taught through the IB Primary Years Programme. Grades 7-10 follow the IB Middle Years Programme, and grades 11-12 follow the IB Diploma Programme. English is the language of instruction and the overall curriculum is international in nature. Turkish language and culture is taught, while students can choose either French, Spanish, or German to study as a foreign language. For students who have not yet achieved satisfactory English fluency, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) is offered instead of French/Spanish/German. Technology is widely integrated into the curriculum with iPads being used through grade 1 and MacBooks being used from grade 2. All classrooms feature interactive whiteboards.  Accreditations and affiliations  IICS has been globally accredited by the Council of International Schools since 1997, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 2002, and the International Baccalaureate since 1996. The school was last re-accredited through a joint evaluation by CIS and NEASC in May 2018. IICS is also a member of the Central and Eastern European Schools Association, the College Board, European Council of International Schools and the Educational Records Bureau.  Organization  IICS is a U.S. registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and is governed by an elected board of directors. The school is partially sponsored by the United States Department of State's Office of Overseas Schools.

(fl. 1278‚Äì1283) was an Italian Friar Minor, who became Minister General of the Order. In the 1270s he led a papal mission to Michael VIII Palaiologos. Historical context Pope John XXI employed Jerome of Ascoli, Minister General of the Franciscans, and John of Vercelli, Master of the Dominicans, as mediators in the war between Philip III of France and Alfonso X of Castile. This embassy occupied both Superiors till March, 1279, although Jerome was preferred to the cardinalate on 12 March 1278. When Jerome departed on the embassy to the Greeks, he had appointed Bonagratia to represent him at the General Chapter of Padua in 1276. On 20 May 1279, he convened the General Chapter of Assisi, at which Bonagratia was elected Minister General. Bonagratia conducted a deputation from the chapter before Pope Nicholas III, who was then staying at Soriano, and petitioned for a cardinal-protector. The Pope, who had himself been protector, appointed his nephew Matteo Orsini. He also asked for a definition of the rule of the Order, which the pope, after personal consultation with cardinals and the theologians of the order, issued in the Exiit qui seminat of 14 August 1279. In this the order's complete renunciation of property in communi was again confirmed, and all property given to the brothers was vested in the Holy See, unless the donor wished to retain his title. All moneys were to be held in trust by the nuntii, or spiritual friends, for the friars, who could however raise no claim to them. The purchase of goods could take place only through procurators appointed by the pope, or by the cardinal-protector in his name. The Bull of Pope Martin IV Ad fructus uberes (13 December 1281) defined the relations of the mendicants to the secular clergy. The mendicant orders had long been exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and enjoyed (as distinguished from the secular clergy) unrestricted freedom to preach and hear confessions in the churches connected with their monasteries. This had led to endless friction and open quarrels between the two divisions of the clergy, and, although Martin IV granted no new privileges to the mendicants, the strife now broke out with increased violence, chiefly in France and in a particular manner at Paris. In the Bull Exultantes of 18 January 1283, Martin IV instituted the syndici Apostolici. This was the name given to the men appointed by the ministers and custodians to receive in the name of the Holy See the alms given to the Franciscans, and to pay it out again at their request. The syndici consequently replaced the nuntii and procurators. All these regulations were necessary in consequence of the rule of poverty, the literal and unconditional observance of which was rendered impossible by the great expansion of the Order, by its pursuit of learning, and the accumulated property of the large cloisters in the towns. The appointment of these trustees, however, was neither subversive of nor an evasion of the rule, but rather the proper observance of its precepts under the altered conditions of the time. Under Bonagratia, and his immediate successors, the Spiritual movement broke out in the Province of Ancona, under the leadership of Pietro da Macerata.Adapted from http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06281a.htm.

Seen eastwards from an airplane in the 1950s, when it was known as \\"Western Reclamation\\" or \\"Tank Farm\\". View of Auckland CBD from the Wynyard Quarter The Wynyard Quarter (historically also known as the Western Reclamation, Wynyard Point, Wynyard Wharf or Tank Farm) is a reclaimed piece of land on the WaitematƒÅ Harbour at the western edge of the Auckland waterfront, New Zealand. It is located to the north of Freemans Bay and to the west of the Viaduct Basin. As of 2012, a good part of the area is still covered by petrol and liquid chemical storage facilities of Ports of Auckland Ltd (POAL) and various other companies, that gave the area its now slowly disappearing \\"Tank Farm\\" moniker. However, major changes are underway, with the area intended to be redeveloped into a mixed- use residential-commercial area, with a major park to run along the northern headland and up to the point. As one of the first changes, the eastern section of the Quarter, as well as one of the main west-east roads running across it, were revitalised with new office and entertainment/restaurant areas, with several major projects finishing in time for the Rugby World Cup 2011 tournament. Demographics Wynyard Quarter is part of the statistical area of Wynyard-Viaduct, which also covers the Viaduct Harbour, and had a population of 1,008 in the 2018 census. History Bulk liquid storage remains one of the main uses in some areas. fishing and shipbuilding are to remain, mainly concentrated along the west of the new quarter. Early use The Western Reclamation was progressively constructed by the Auckland Harbour Board, of which Ports of Auckland is the successor. The last components of the reclamation (Wynyard Wharf) were being completed in 1930 and provided the growing harbour with additional berthage capacity and increased land for port activities. Initially used mainly by the timber trade, it gradually changed to the current bulk petro-chemical storage.History (Western Reclamation project website of Auckland Regional Holdings). Accessed 14 February 2008. Current use As of the late 2000s, the area was still used by the bulk liquid industry, with 500,000 tonnes of liquids and cement being transported via Wynyard Wharf each year. This provides NZ$1.2 billion of yearly turnover, and 4000 jobs in the Auckland economy. There are also more than 100 marine companies around the area, with a NZ$400 million yearly turnover, exporting items worth NZ$120 million per year. Three fishing fleets, Moana Pacific, Sanford and Simunovich, are based in the area.\\"Tank Farm: Looking at the past, presnt (sic) and future\\". The New Zealand Herald, 2 July 2007 SeaLink runs a car and passenger ferry service to Great Barrier Island from a terminal at the base of Wynyard Wharf. The company was seeking clarification of its future facilities in the area in 2007, as their lease was running out in 2010, and it was unlikely to invest a planned NZ$19 million in a new terminal or start using a new, faster ferry vessel before legal concerns were sorted out. An ARC planning committee noted that it supported the further provision of the ferry service in the area, though there had previously been concerns about the island freight shipping not fitting into the redevelopment vision of the area (see below).\\"Wharf lease key to speedy Barrier ferry\\". The New Zealand Herald, 19 June 2007 The Waterfront Plan completed 2012 does include the island ferry terminal, to be in the same general area as before. Shipping fuel storage, once an important facility at the Tank Farm, and delivered to ships in port by the Tolema refueling barge, was taken over in the late 2000s by a marine fuel tanker, the Awanuia, owned by the Seafuels company. The vessel serves Ports of Auckland shipping by bringing in fuels from the Marsden Point refinery in Whangarei.\\"New refueling ship arrives\\". e.nz magazine, IPENZ, November/December 2009, Page 4 A sand mining company, McCallum Brothers, used part of the western water's edge to unload barges of dredged sand (for construction projects) but has moved out of the area which was subsequently transformed into a public park / event space (Silo Park). Redevelopment=Initial plans Ports of Auckland still owned 18ha of the 35ha site in 2006\\"Auckland's big chance with Tank Farm\\". The New Zealand Herald, 10 March 2006 when it was decided that the land would be transferred to its parent company, Auckland Regional Holdings, owned by the Auckland Regional Council.\\"Ports of Auckland loses ownership of Tank Farm site\\". The New Zealand Herald, 8 December 2006 As was noted on the Tank Farm website in 2006: :Changes in bulk liquid transportation, the advent of the pipeline from Marsden Point, and the progressive expiration of industrial leases in the reclamation means that Ports of Auckland's land is becoming a precinct in search of a new purpose. Following similar declarations by Auckland City and the Auckland Regional Council, political and design processes were underway in the mid and late 2000s to define the future shape of the area, a change process that will take up to 20 years. One of the main public inputs at that time was a wish for increased waterfront access, as well as the desire for more parkland on the point. However, some of these wishes were muted from political sources, as the redevelopment of the area is to be paid by the development of residential areas, with the available land for this use shrinking with an increase of the proposed park space. Already mostly agreed on was a bridge connecting the new quarter to the Viaduct Basin. Early plans intended to name the new area 'Kahurangi', MƒÅori for 'blue/precious jewel'. This has now been replaced with 'Wynyard Quarter', though it is still generally referred to as Tank Farm, including when talking about the whole Western Reclamation.\\"Brian Rudman: It's quite simple, Mr Politician, we want it all and we want it now\\". The New Zealand Herald, 2 July 2007 Others have suggested the label 'Tech-Farm', referencing a 2004 call to showcase on the waterfront New Zealand's best sustainable design and technology,Dushko Bogunovich: Waterfront could be showcase for world, 14 July 2004 as well as anticipating the government's and council's 2012 initiative to establish an 'innovation precinct' within the Wynyard Quarter.\\"Chris Barton: Innovation nation? Searching for the plan to boost R&D;\\". The New Zealand Herald, 30 March 2012 Project scope ;First stage In June 2007, more detailed concept plans were published after a year of negotiation between stakeholders. In the first stage of the redevelopment, the eastern section of the Western Reclamation, along Jellicoe Street, was to be turned into an entertainment strip, to complement similar areas on the eastern side of the Viaduct Basin, and to be completed in time for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. This area was to be linked to the Auckland CBD via a new 'Te Wero' bridge, to be constructed as a lift- or swing bridge after an international design competition, and expected to cost around NZ$35 million.\\"New park 'a gift for our children'\\". The New Zealand Herald, 30 June 2007 As part of the area renewal, the 'Wind Tree' sculpture that was located in Queen Elizabeth II Square outside of Britomart from 1971 until 2002 was installed in the new Jellicoe Square. The August 2011 opening of the Wynyard Quarter to the general public, with the main features being the new Jellicoe Street and North Wharf areas, as well as the open spaces around 'Silo Park' (designed by Taylor Cullity Lethlean and Wraight and Associates) and the Viaduct Events Centre, were met with great public interest, and critical acclaim for the synthesis between open space and formerly industrial use. The July 2007 concept plan for the area. ;Later stages In a next stage, a large 'point park' of 4.25 ha is to be developed on Wynyard Point, with another park strip along the east side of Wynyard Wharf. This larger design followed wide public complaints in 2006 about the new development being dominated by apartments. The layout of the park is also to be decided via an international design competition, and would leave space for a so far unidentified landmark public building. The park would include about 2.4 km of waterfront access, and would be linked with Victoria Park via a 40 m wide tree-lined boulevard and a NZ$5 million pedestrian bridge. This work would likely take place between 2014 and 2017, after commercial leases in the area run out. Other areas in the Western Reclamation will remain set aside for marine industry, with the main bulk of land being developed as apartments, with some associated smaller-scale retail and entertainment areas.\\"Promenades and plazas on waterfront to be proud of\\". The New Zealand Herald, 3 July 2007 One matter of contention, as became visible during previous consultation, is the future building height of the residential areas. After 10‚Äì16-storey buildings proposed in 2006 met strong opposition, the July 2007 design envisages only a small number of 14-storey towers, with the main apartment strips along the eastern side of Wynyard Wharf being no higher than seven storeys at the road, stepping down to three storeys at the water's edge.\\"Project's building heights a balancing act\\". The New Zealand Herald, 2 July 2007 The new Western Reclamation zone is to be dominated by public transport, with the targeted transport mix being 70% public transport / walking / cycling and 30% motor vehicle, a reversal of the typical modal share in Auckland City. Ferries are also mooted as possible connections. ;Cruise ship terminal With new plans to open up the Auckland waterfront for more public access, the lack of sufficient cruise ship berthing space has entered the public discussion early 2008. This led to considerations that a new terminal could be built on the Western Reclamation. A major negative point for this usage would however be the short-term (from 2010 on) need for more cruise ship space, while the tank farm is unlikely to be redeveloped less than a decade in the future.\\"Tank Farm a potential cruise ship terminal\\". The New Zealand Herald, 13 February 2008 Funding The public infrastructure costs of redeveloping the Western Reclamation were first estimated at around NZ$400 million in 2006, of which between 5 per cent and 10 per cent are expected to be spent on cleanup of soil contamination due to petrochemicals. In 2007, this was updated to NZ$504 million (with the whole project, including the private investment, expected to cost more than NZ$2 billion). Most of the public infrastructure costs, NZ$349 million, are expected to be carried by development contributions, with NZ$112 million from Auckland Regional Holdings (Auckland Regional Council) and NZ$43 million from Auckland City Council.\\"Ratepayers get off lightly on Tank Farm\\". The New Zealand Herald, 4 July 2007  Construction  In 2010, the first stages of work began in the Wynyard Quarter, among them the construction of a new-look, 'pedestrian- oriented boulevard' Jellicoe Street, which is to be a new entertainment area, linked to the Viaduct Harbour by a walking/cycling bridge (Wynyard Crossing). Also underway is the construction of a new length of tram track (see further section below). All the projects are to be completed in time for the Rugby World Cup 2011, when the area is to be part of an extended Viaduct Basin visitor zone on the waterfront.  Transport = Tram circuit  A tram outside the Auckland Fish Market, Wynyard Quarter, Auckland As part of the concept to make the new quarter more interesting, as well as accessible, a new tram circuit was constructed around the quarter, using two heritage trams on a 1.5 km $8 million clockwise track. It is hoped that the tram line will later be extended, to serve transport as well as tourist functions for the quarter. Such a link, initially to the Britomart Transport Centre was originally intended to form part of the initial works, but the global financial crisis scuttled plans to make the new Wynyard Crossing substantial enough to also serve trams, though the foundations for the interim bridge will be sufficient for a later bridge upgrade. The tram circuit was proposed by the Campaign for Better Transport and the MOTAT museum, and in Phase 1 includes a 1.5 km loop track with 4 stops and separate sidings to house the trams. Commercial service started on 6 August 2011. Phase 2 will be the later extension to Britomart, with no timeframe set. The 1920s trams are leased from Bendigo Tramway Museum in Australia, and are a W2 Class tram with 52 seats for weekends and holidays, and a 32 seat X1 Class tram for mid-week periods. However, the tram system will also be able to operate both trams at the same time.  Harbour Crossing  Earlier feasibility studies saw the possible terminus of a new WaitematƒÅ Harbour Crossing (possibly as a tunnel) at Wynyard Point.Feasibility of Constructing Another WaitematƒÅ Harbour Crossing (from the Transit New Zealand website) These have now been shelved by Transit New Zealand, with one remaining option being a longer tunnel to surface near Fanshawe Street or further south along Cook Street, possibly with an underground public transport station somewhere underneath the Tank Farm. A less likely option has also been proposed by Mike Lee, Auckland Regional Council chairman, who suggested a tunnel underneath the Auckland CBD to emerge east of the city centre at Stanley Street, thus avoiding the Central Motorway Junction and city centre traffic.\\"Brian Rudman: Hallelujah, talk before bulldozers\\". The New Zealand Herald, 11 July 2007 The plans to connect the new quarter with Victoria Park would make a cut-and-cover tunnel construction possible along the length of the planned Daldy Street boulevard in the Western Reclamation, providing for two public transport and two private vehicle lanes. Light rail was also mentioned as a long-term possibility. However, as it is unlikely that the harbour tunnel section would be built before 2020 earliest, coordination with the development of the new quarter would pose some difficulties.\\"Transit rethinks tunnel entrance\\".

Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions is a 1980 book by magician and skeptic James Randi about paranormal, occult, and pseudoscience claims. The foreword is by science fiction author Isaac Asimov. Randi explores topics which he says that scientists and the media are too willing to promote without skepticism and proper expertise. Content Timothy Ferris wrote that Flim Flam! \\"will enlighten any reader who does not clearly understand that not one shard of evidence exists to prove that the Bermuda Triangle poses any special menace to ships and planes, that earth is being visited by alien spacecraft, that the unassisted power of the mind can read closed books, predict our future or induce levitation, or that the 'psychic surgeons' of the Philippines have relieved their patients of any burden more troublesome than their money.\\" Randi levels criticism at the sloppy study designs and faulty controls of the investigations into remote viewing by Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff. George Kauffman wrote, \\"Randi explores and exposes the outrageous deceptions widely promoted in the sensation-seeking media.\\" The book calls on \\"researchers\\" to be accountable for their failures and impostures. Randi writes the public is badly served by scientists investigating the paranormal who don't adhere to the standards of their profession and shows how sloppy research was followed with rationalization of their failures. The book repeatedly explores the sloppy nature of research into the paranormal, pointing out how commonly carelessness and selective interpretation that would not be tolerated in other fields of research is accepted in investigations of the supernatural. Randi documents how the scientific method is often twisted and bent to accommodate the subject of investigation. One anecdote in the book is Randi's experience as a newspaper astrologer in Montreal under the name Zo- ran where he cut horoscopes from old astrology magazines and randomly assigned them to the twelve signs of the zodiac, publishing the results. Randi also debunks the book Chariots of the Gods? noting, among other things, the author's eurocentrism. The Transcendental Meditation movement and Edgar Cayce's mystic medical practice are subjected to Randi's skeptical scrutiny.Transcendental Meditation and Edgar Cayce:  The author also deconstructs the Cottingley Fairies, particularly addressing how Arthur Conan Doyle fell for the hoax.Cottingley Fairies: The complete absence of any physical evidence of UFOs is also discussed. Later sections of the book cover specific cases of paranormal feats where Randi was consulted as an expert or judge. These include tests of dowsing and pyramid power.Dowsing and pyramid power: In these anecdotes the reader learns some of the methods used by charlatans including how to guess cards, tilt tables, read while blindfolded and produce photographs. Randi announces an annual award for \\"the psychic who fools the greatest number of people with the least effort\\" and the scientists, journalists and foundations they fool. The \\"Uri trophy\\" is a bent spoon on a \\"flimsy and quite transparent base\\". He writes that winners will be notified telepathically. Reception Timothy Ferris wrote in The New York Times Book Review it is \\"a healthy and often hilarious book.\\" He described the \\"Uri trophy\\" as typical of the \\"cheerful devices\\" of Randi's book. Ferris cited Randi's, \\"penchant for sarcasm and overemphasis\\" as a drawback and considered this \\"heavy-handedness\\" appropriate for charlatans who profit from fraud but less so for sincere if gullible true-believers. He noted Randi apologized for this, describing it as, \\"killing the gnat with a sledgehammer.\\" Kirkus Reviews states Flim Flam! has a brisk pace and clear message. They were also critical of Randi's \\"abrasive style\\" but state that after, \\"Randi has set forth the shameless frauds and money-making schemes, the outrageous misstatements and falsifications of data in respected scientific journals, the righteous harangue seems warranted.\\" The magazine describes the anecdotes about cases Randi was involved in as a judge or expert as absorbing and states they go far to make the point, \\"if you design the experiment adequately, no extraordinary powers are demonstrated.\\" concluding, \\"By the end of the book, Randi's personal offer of $10,000 to be paid to anyone who successfully demonstrates paranormal abilities under proper test conditions seems safe beyond a doubt.\\" Dave Langford reviewed Flim-Flam! for White Dwarf #43, and stated that \\"Always he thrusts before your nose the parts of the story which believers' books omit: even if inclined towards the loony, I mean the uncritical viewpoint, you should consult these books for the devil's advocate arguments. They are important. In a world where an ounce of sensationalism sells better than a ton of rationality any day, they are very important.\\" Jack Kirwan writing in the National Review embraced the tone of the book describing the writing as \\"a juicy knock-'em-down style\\" and stating, \\"Randi takes on the heavies of the paranormal scene - von D√§niken, UFOs, Uri Geller, TM - and feeds them into the meat grinder of critical investigation.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle stated, \\"Flim-Flam! is an excellent overview of paranormal claims that analyzes medical humbugs, psychic photography, Transcendental Meditation, ancient astronauts, UFOs, etc. Plentiful photographs catch hoaxers in the act.\\" In a review of the audiotape edition in the Journal of College Science Teaching George Kauffman wrote of Randi's analysis of the failures of paranormal \\"researchers\\", \\"In clearly pointing out their errors and misrepresentations, he provides a compelling and convincing case that will startle and enlighten the listener, especially one unable to distinguish between genuine scientific research and the pseudoscientific nonsense that results in fantastic theories and fallacies. The Lodi News-Sentinel stated Flim Flam! succeeds in discrediting the supernatural. In 2001 Skeptic magazine listed Flim Flam! at number three in its \\"Top Ten Recommended Skeptics' Books\\". Novelist Christopher Brookmyre listed Flim Flam! among four of the best, \\"works evincing a vivid, clear and entertaining rationalism.\\" In a 2010 interview the magician Teller listed it as one of four books \\"In My Library.\\" Flim-Flam!

During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn Jillette stated that he read Flim-Flam! in high school and \\"Randi had already started changing [his] life.\\" Publication history Flim Flam! was originally published in hardcover by Thomas Y. Crowell Co. then by Lippincott Crowell (an imprint of Harper & Row). The publication run by Harper & Row was planned to be 17,500 but was reduced to about 6,000 and the book was declared out of print by the publisher despite outstanding paid orders. Randi charged this was due to the publisher's conflict of interest, as Randi described the market for books promoting belief in the supernatural as, \\"possibly the single greatest moneymaker in publishing today.\\" Harper & Row denied this.

Despite the name's medieval origins, this appellation is one of the youngest in France, having only become official in February 1999. History Ch√¢teaux de Lastours, the site belonged to the lords of Cabaret and is an iconic image in the Cabard√®s AOC. The residents of the Cabardes region produced wine as early as the Roman occupation, but the modern appellation was made official only in 1999.

As of 2007, these wines were relatively unknown in France, and their export, in terms of volume, is exceptionally rare due to limited production quantities and a relatively small marketing budget. Geography and climate The soils of many vineyards in Cabard√®s are very rocky, especially near the foothills. The vineyards of the Cabardes cover a mere 500 hectares on the northwestern border of the modern Languedoc-Roussillon region of France, an area that runs up against the foothills of the Montagne Noire.Henry E. Teitelbaum In France's Cabardes, Bordeaux meets Languedoc May 25, 2007 The Wall Street Journal Europe The appellation really consists of a small grouping of villages directly north of the medieval walled city of Carcassonne. It is exceptionally small in size compared to the neighboring AOC areas like the 5,100 hectare-large Minervois or the 15,000 hectare behemoth of the Corbieres. The soil composition varies between chalky clay, limestone and rocky foothill terroir. The weather is largely dominated by the powerful wind currents of the region, the dry, Atlantic vent Cers and the warm, Mediterranean vent Marin. The appellation's location where these winds meet on the border of two major French climatic zones creates a unique microclimate that has influenced its development as a winemaking region.Jancis Robinson Vintner turns e-author December 21, 2010 JancisRobinson.com Grapes Grenache. Most of the wine produced in the Cabard√®s is red, but ros√© can also be produced under the AOC designation. The region is positioned on the cusp between the distinct climates of the Languedoc-Roussillon and the southwest of France. The appellation is the only AOC in France that permits the blending of grape varieties typically found in Mediterranean climates like Syrah and Grenache with varieties typically found in Atlantic climates like Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Winemakers are required to grow 50% Atlantic varieties and 50% Mediterranean varieties, and must also blend them - the new requirements from 2011 rule that the proportions of both Atlantic or Mediterranean varieties must be 40% or higher.

He became a prominent Left Communist activist and theorist. Early life Appel was born in 1890 in Mecklenburg, Germany. His father was an active socialist and from 1908 he was an active member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Although he trained as a shipbuilder, he joined the army in 1911 and served until 1913. Then he saw active service in the First World War. He was demobilised in 1917 and sent to work in the Vulcan Werft Hamburg shipyard. In January 1918 he participated in the strike wave which involved over 400,000 workers across Germany demanding immediate peace without annexation or indemnity, better food, and end to military discipline in the factories and the release of political prisoners. The German Revolution Jan Appel was involved in German Revolution of November 1918: :‚ÄúWhen, in November 1918 the sailors revolted and the workers of the shipyards in Kiel downed tools, we learned at the Vulkan military shipyard from the workers what had happened. There followed a secret meeting at the shipyards; the factory was under military occupation, work ceased, but the workers remained in assembly in the enterprise. A delegation of 17 volunteers was sent to the union headquarters, to insist on the declaration of a general strike. We insisted on holding an assembly, but it turned out that the known leaders of the ADGB and the SPD and of the unions adopted a negative an attitude towards the strike. There were hours of harsh discussions. During this time, at the Blohm & Voss shipyard, where 17,000 workers were employed, a spontaneous revolt broke out. And so, all the workers poured out of the factories, at the Vulkan shipyard too (where Appel worked) and set off towards the union house. It was at this moment that the leaders disappeared. The revolution had begun.‚Äù By this stage Appel was involved with Hamburg Far-left politics participating in the Spartacus League and then the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) alongside Fritz Wolffheim and Heinrich Laufenberg. He was elected chairperson of the newly formed Revolutionary Shop Stewards (Revolution√§re Obleute). In January 1919, following the murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht the Revolutionary Shop Stewards gathered outside the Trade union Central Headquarters in Hamburg. Here he met Ernst Thalmann, of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), whereupon they participated in a night march on the Bahrenfeld Barracks. Taking the soldiers by surprise they seized the armoury and soon had 4,000 workers under arms. :‚ÄúAt that moment, we reached the conclusion that the unions were unusable for the revolutionary struggle, and that led, at an assembly of the revolutionary delegates to propaganda for the constitution of revolutionary factory organisations, as the basis for the councils. Departing from Hamburg, this propaganda for the formation of enterprise organisations spread, leading to the General Workers' Union of Germany Allgemeine Arbeiter Unionen Deutschland (AAUD)‚Äù Involvement in KPD and KAPD At this time Appel also became chairperson of the Hamburg District KPD, and was a delegate to the Second Congress of the KPD held in Heidelberg. On 15 August, the revolutionary delegates met in Essen, with the approval of the Central Committee of the KPD(S) to found the AAU. In the paper of the KAZ different articles appeared at this time explaining the basis for the decision and why the unions no longer had a raison d‚Äôetre for the working class in decadence, and therefore the revolutionary period, of the capitalist system. Appel, as the president of the revolutionary delegates, and an active organiser, was thus also elected president of the KPD(S) of Hamburg. During the subsequent months, the tensions and conflicts between the central committee of Paul Levi, and the northern section of the KPD(S) in particular, multiplied, above all around the question of the unions, the AAU and the mass party. At the Second Congress of the KPD in October 1919 in Heidelberg, where the questions of the utilisation of parliamentarism and the unions were discussed and voted, Appel, as the president and delegate of the Hamburg district, took up a clear position against the opportunist theses which were opposed to the most revolutionary developments. The opposition, although in a majority, was excluded from the party: at the Congress itself, 25 participants were excluded straight away. The Hamburg group in its quasi-totality declared itself in agreement with the opposition, being followed by other sections. After making different attempts at opposition within the KPD(S), in February 1920 all the sections in agreement with the opposition were finally excluded. But it wasn‚Äôt until March that all efforts to redress the KPD(S) from within broke down. March 1920 was in fact the period of the Kapp Putsch, during which the central committee of the KPD(S) launched an appeal for a general strike, while propagating a line of ‚Äòloyal opposition‚Äô to the social democratic government and negotiating to avoid any armed revolutionary revolt. In the eyes of the opposition, this attitude was a clear and cutting sign of the abandonment of any revolutionary politics. When in April 1920 the Berlin group left the KPD, the basis was given for the construction of the KAPD; 40,000 members, among them Jan Appel, had left the KPD. In the insurrectional combats of the Ruhr in March 1920, Jan Appel was once more to be found in the foremost ranks, in the unions, in the assemblies, in the struggles. On the basis of his active participation in the struggles since 1918 and of his organisational talents, the participants at the Founding Congress of the KAPD appointed Appel and Franz Jung to represent them at the Communist International in Moscow. They came to negotiate adhesion to the Third International and to discuss the treacherous attitude of the Central Committee of the KPD during the insurrection in the Ruhr. In order to get to Moscow, they had to divert the course of a ship. On arrival they held discussions with Zinoviev, president of the Communist International, and with Lenin. On the basis of Lenin‚Äôs text \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, they discussed at great length, refuting among other things the false accusation of syndicalism (in other words the rejection of the role of the party) and of nationalism. Thus Appel, in his article ‚ÄòInformation on Moscow‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhere is R√ºhle heading?‚Äô in the KAZ, defended the position that Laufenberg and Wolffheim ought to be excluded ‚Äúsince we can have more confidence in the Russian communists than in the German nationalists who have left the terrain of the class struggle‚Äù. Appel declared also that he had ‚Äújudged that Ruhle also no longer found himself on the terrain of the programme of the party; if this vision had proven itself to be wrong, the exclusion of Ruhle would not have been posed. But the delegates had the right and the duty in Moscow to defend the programme of the party.‚Äù He made many more trips to Moscow to get the KAPD admitted as a sympathising organisation to the IIIrd International, and thereby participated at the Third Congress in 1921. In the meantime, Appel had travelled around Germany under the false name of Jan Arndt, and was active wherever the KAPD and the AAUD sent him. Thus, he became responsible for the weekly Der Klassenkampf of the AAU in the Ruhr, where he remained until November 1923. At the Third Congress of the Communist International, in 1921, Appel again, along with Meyer, Schwab and Reichenbach, were the delegates to conduct the final negotiations in the name of the KAPD, against the growing opportunism of the CI. They attempted in vain to form a left opposition with the delegations of Bulgaria, Hungary, Luxemburg, Mexico, Spain, Britain, Belgium and the USA. Firstly, ignoring the sarcasms of the Bolshevik delegation or the KPD, Jan Appel, under the pseudonym of Hempel, underlined at the end of the Third Congress some fundamental questions for the world revolution today. Let us recall his words: ‚ÄúThe Russian comrades lack an understanding of what is happening in Western Europe. The Russian comrades have experienced a long Czarist domination, they are hard and solid, whereas where we come from the proletariat is penetrated by parliamentarism and is completely infested by it. In Europe we have to proceed differently. The path to opportunism has to be barred ... Opportunism among us is the utilisation of bourgeois institutions in the economic domain ... The Russian comrades are not supermen either, and they need a counterweight, and this counterweight must be a IIIrd International ridding itself of any tactic of compromise, parliamentarism and the old unions.‚Äù Active in the Netherlands Appel was arrested in November 1923 on the charge of inciting mutiny on the ship with which the delegation had arrived in Moscow in 1920. In prison he prepared a study of the workers‚Äô movement and in particular of the period of transition towards communism, in the light of the lessons of events in Russia. He was set free at the end of 1925, but Germany had become dangerous for him, and he obtained work at a shipyard in the Netherlands. He immediately took contact with Canne-Meyer, whom he had not known personally, in order to be able to integrate himself into the situation in the Netherlands. Departing from this contact, ex‚Äîmembers of the KPN and/or the KAPN regrouped slowly, and in 1927 formed the GIC which published a review, Press Material of the International Communists (PIC), as well as an edition in German. It closely followed the evolution of the KAPD in Germany and oriented itself more towards the Theses of the Berlin KAPD, in opposition to the group around Gorter. Over four years, the GIC studied and discussed the study which Appel had made in prison, and the book Foundations of Communist Production and Distribution was published in 1930 by the Berlin AAU, a book which has been discussed and criticised by revolutionaries throughout the world to this very day. Appel made many other important contributions during the difficult years of the counter-revolution, up until World War II, against the positions of the degenerating Communist Parties, rapidly becoming bourgeois. The GIC worked in contact with other small revolutionary organisations in different countries (like the Ligue des Communistes Internationalistes in Belgium, the group around Bilan, Union Communiste in France, the group around Paul Mattick in the USA etc.), and was one of the most important currents of this period in keeping internationalism alive. From 1933 on Appel kept in the background, since the Dutch state, on good terms with Hitlerite Germany, would have expelled him. Until 1948, Appel remained in clandestinity under the name of Jan Vos. During and after the second world war however, Appel and other members of the GIC regrouped with the Spartacusbond coming out of the Marx-Lenin-Luxemburg Front, the only internationalist organisation in the Netherlands until 1942. The members of the GIC, who were expecting, like all the other revolutionary organisations at that time, important class movements after the war, considered it important to regroup, even if there still existed divergences between them, in order to prepare a more important, stronger revolutionary organisation, with the aim of playing a more preponderant role in the movements. But these movements did not develop, and numerous discussions cropped up in the group on the role and the tasks of the political organisation. Appel remained within the Communistenbond Spartacus. Almost all the GIC members left the group in 1947. Witness a letter by Antonie Pannekoek, himself having become a councilist, in September 1947: :‚ÄúAnd now that the strong mass movement hasn‚Äôt turned up, nor the influx of young workers (we had counted on this for the period after the war, and it was certainly the fundamental motive of the GIC in regrouping with Communistenbond Spartacus in the last year of the war), it follows logically that the GIC returned to its old role, not preventing the Communistenbond Spartacus from returning to its old role as RSP. According to my information, the question of which form of propaganda to choose is presently being discussed in the GIC ... it‚Äôs a pity that Jan Appel has stayed with the people of Communistenbond Spartacus. Already in the past, I have noted how his spirit and his conceptions are determined by his experiences in the great German movement which was the culminating point of his life. It‚Äôs there that he formed his understanding of the organisational techniques of the councils. But he was too much a man of action to be content with simple propaganda. But the wish to be a man of action in a period in which the mass movement doesn‚Äôt yet exist, easily leads to the formulation of impure and mystified forms of action. Perhaps it‚Äôs a good thing after all that Communistenbond Spartacus has held on to one strong element.‚Äù By accident, Appel was re-discovered by the Dutch police in 1948. After encountering many difficulties, he was allowed to stay in the Netherlands, but was forbidden any political activity. Appel thus formally left Communistenbond Spartacus and organised political life. After 1948, however, Appel remained in contact with his old comrades, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere, among others with Internationalisme, predecessor of the International Communist Current, at the end of the forties and during the fifties. That‚Äôs why Jan Appel was once again present at the end of the sixties at the founding of Revolution Internationale, the future section in France of the ICC, and a product of the massive struggles of the proletariat in 1968. Since then with numerous visits from comrades and sympathisers of the ICC, Jan Appel contributed to the formation of a new generation of revolutionaries, participating at the formal constitution of the ICC in 1976, one last time, thereby passing on the torch and the lessons of one generation of revolutionaries to another. Jan Appel, died on 4 May 1985 at the age of 95.

It was released in 1999. According to Andrew Tompkins the album art is of a Los Angeles model, the band actually does not know who the woman is.FAQ on the official Paramaecium website  Themes  A Time to Mourn explores themes such as betrayal (\\"Betrayed Again\\") and the album also deals with issues related to church life (\\"Live for the Day\\") and how we need to make sure that our commitment to a church doesn't override our commitment to God. It makes the point by telling the story of a woman who won't have to think for herself again because she's now a part of the church.Song meanings on the official Paramaecium website The second song on the album, \\"I'm Not to Blame\\" is written from Jesus' perspective and is essentially a comment about the fact that Christians have a tendency to understate the importance of self-control, allowing sin to control their lives and crying out to God to forgive them over and over again without making any effort to alter the behaviour themselves. This is not the behaviour of a repentant individual even though, unfortunately, it is often the mark of a modern Christian. Many Christians cry out to Jesus to give them the strength to resist the temptation to sin. Then, when they succumb to temptation again, it seems to them that Jesus has let them down, that he's to blame. If you ask Jesus to give you the strength to resist sin but go on to sin, part of your mind concludes that Jesus didn't give you the strength. But scripture is clear that you won't be tempted beyond what you can bear which means that there is no excuse for sin. And, even though Christians will continue to sin on a daily basis in some way, the life of the Christian must be one of continual self- improvement: to seek to become more like Christ every single day. The songs which frame the album are the first and last songs on the CD: \\"A Moment\\" and \\"Unceasing\\". These songs deal with the paradox of the basis for the understanding of eternal life. Namely, that as Christians we accept that we are not merely mortal but have everlasting life, eternal life beyond the grave, and yet this also means that life as we know it on earth is viewed more as a drop in the ocean of eternity, or as a mere moment in time. Understanding this is one of the first things a new Christian must deal with and this it is the theme for the beginning and conclusion to the album.

They are endemic to the rainforests of the wet tropics region of north eastern Queensland, Australia. The ivory curl flower, B. celsissima, is the well known, popular and widely cultivated species in gardens and parks, in eastern and southern mainland Australia, and additionally as street trees north from about Brisbane. The second species, B. ferruginiflora, was only recently described in 1988.  History, classification and evolution  The genus was named in 1868 by Ferdinand von Mueller in honour of Richard Grenville, the Duke of Buckingham, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1866 to 1868. It was initially placed in a tribe Grevilleae, but the feature of having four ovules per carpel led C. Venkata Rao to classify it in the tribe Telopeae, and within this a new subtribe Hollandaeae based on the antero-posterior orientation of the perianth, with the genera Hollandaea, Cardwellia, Knightia, Opisthiolepis and Stenocarpus. Lawrie Johnson and Barbara G. Briggs recognised the affinities of this genus with the rainforest taxon Opisthiolepis and classified the two in the subtribe Buckinghamiinae within the tribe Embothrieae in the subfamily Grevilleoideae in their 1975 monograph \\"On the Proteaceae: the evolution and classification of a southern family\\", and thus related to Lomatia, Stenocarpus and the Embothriinae. However, analysis of chloroplast sequences revealed a much closer relationship of Buckinghamia and Opisthiolepis with Grevillea instead. Both genera have eleven pairs of chromosomes, which is reduced further in Grevillea. More recent evolutionary botanical science confirms that they correlate closest with the genera Opisthiolepis, Finschia, Grevillea and Hakea in the subtribe Hakeinae, with Buckinghamia and Opisthiolepis as two early offshoots from the ancestors of the other three genera.  Species and summary descriptions  * Buckinghamia celsissima , ivory curl, ivory curl flower, spotted silky oak, buckinghamia silky oak * Buckinghamia ferruginiflora Buckinghamia celsissima (ivory curl flower) trees grow up to about tall in Australian gardens, parks and botanic gardens and much taller naturally to about . The leaves are glossy dark green, and either lobed or entire, with new growth flushed pink. Spectacular in flower, they bear long showy sprays of sweetly fragrant, creamy-white flowers in summer. In a garden they can grow in full sun or part shade, and will attract birds and bees. Hardy and spectacular trees, they make ideal screens or windbreaks in a garden. B. celsissima (ivory curl flower) trees in the botanic gardens in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane have been in cultivation for over a hundred years. They grow outdoors successfully in places as temperate as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. Its notable landscape designer and director William Guilfoyle already had them growing there over one hundred years ago, resulting today in beautifully flowering, slow growing, established small trees. In the same late 1800s period the Adelaide Botanic Gardens already had them in cultivation also. They are popular and widely cultivated in many parks and gardens in coastal regions of eastern and southern mainland Australia, notably also their long history of planting in Brisbane as street trees. B. celsissima rainforest trees grow naturally up to about tall in tropical rainforests of north eastern Queensland from about altitude. Buckinghamia ferruginiflora (Noah‚Äôs Oak, Spotted Oak) is a species of rainforest trees growing naturally up to about tall. Botanists scientifically recognised these trees‚Äô differences only from about the early 1970s. They have only found them growing naturally in a restricted area of the Daintree region. They grow in luxuriant tropical rainforests from sea level through an area of lowlands up to lower uplands at an altitude of about . Buckinghamia ferruginiflora was formally scientifically described in 1988 by Don Foreman and Bernie Hyland. They have: branchlets often hairy; leaves long, wide; buds, shoots and flower structures with dense ferruginous (rusty coloured) hairs; flower structures of compound inflorescences long; individual flowers creamy brown, with the dense rusty hairs on the tepals‚Äô outer surfaces; styles shorter () than B. celsissima (); fruits follicles long; seeds flat with a small wing. B. ferruginiflora‚Äôs, restricted, endemic, distribution has obtained the conservation status of \\"near threatened\\" currently officially listed by the Queensland government legislation, the Nature Conservation Act 1992.

This association was founded on the initiative of a merchant named Yaƒücƒ±zade ≈ûefik Bey in July 1909, followed shortly afterwards by a wider participation including the more modest layers of the society. It collected funds through voluntary participation from among the Ottoman public to finance her purchase. Mu√¢venet-i Mill√Æye was the first ship purchased, in Germany, through the financing made available thanks to the efforts of the association.The collection of funds for the Ottoman Navy took the proportions of a nation-wide affair, with ordinary households contributing their valuables, housewives, for example, donating their jewellery. For details, see , abstract also in English. Some sources consider the Navy Association to be the direct ancestor of Milli Piyango, the Turkish National Lottery, for the draws of lots it organized within the frame of its fund collection efforts. Three other Turkish Navy ships of different periods, the last being presently in service, were later named in memory of Mu√¢venet-i Mill√Æye to recall her achievement. One of the first aircraft of the Ottoman air squadrons, contemporaneous to the ship, was given the same name.  Operations  Ahmed Saffet Bey Muavenet-i Milliye and her sister ships, Yadigar-i Millet, Numune-i Hamiyet, and Gayret-i Vataniye, were originally laid down as the German torpedo boats S165-S168. Upon completion, they were sold to the Ottoman Navy in September 1910. (Schichau-Werft built a second group of torpedo boats named S165-S168 as replacements, completing them in 1911.) As of 1912, the command of Mu√¢venet-i Mill√Æye was assumed by the Kƒ±demli Y√ºzba≈üƒ± (senior lieutenant, see Naval officer ranks) Ayasofyali Ahmed Saffed (after the Surname Law of 1934: Ahmet Saffet Ohkay), member of a new generation of officers who were specially trained in view of the more modern ships the Ottoman Navy acquired. In the first months of the Ottoman entry into World War I, the ship was assigned to missions in the Black Sea, from where she was re-directed towards √áanakkale with the start of the Dardanelles Campaign. Sinking of Goliath was part of the Allied fleet in the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign, supporting the landing at Cape Helles on 25 April 1915. On the night of 12‚Äì13 May 1915 Goliath was stationed, along with and screened by five destroyers, in Morto Bay off Cape Helles, in an effort to relieve the pressure on the French flank of the landing. HMS Goliath The French had asked the assistance of the battleships against the Ottoman counterattacks targeting to recapture Kerevizdere. Thus, every night two battleships began to bombard the Ottoman positions. The Ottoman side, to eliminate damages caused by these battleships, assigned Mu√¢venet-i-Mill√Æye. During the day, the German captain lieutenant Rudolph Firle and two other officers, who had carried out a reconnaissance mission near Morto Bay earlier, had embarked on Mu√¢venet-i Mill√Æye to manage the torpedo operations. And on 10 May, at 13:30, Mu√¢venet-i-Mill√Æye arrived at the strait and the preparations for its new assignment had begun. It was on 12 May, at 18:40, Mu√¢venet-i- Mill√Æye went into action. Between 19:00 and 19:30, she passed the mines and on 19:40 she anchored in Soƒüanlƒ±dere and waited until midnight. The projectors of the Allied battleships were closed down at 23:30. Mu√¢venet-i-Mill√Æye weighed anchor at 00:30 and slipped through the European side of the strait. The Allied destroyers failed to notice her advance. At 01:00 on the line astern of Mu√¢venet-i-Mill√Æye, two destroyers were seen, on the forehead was Goliath. Goliath asked the password and Mu√¢venet-i-Mill√Æye, without losing time, responded with three torpedoes. The first torpedo hit the bridge, the second hit the funnel and the third the stern. The battleship capsized almost immediately taking 570 of the over 700 crew to the bottom, including her captain. The sinking of Goliath led to direct and drastic upheaval for the British Navy top command and strategy. Two days after the loss of their ship, on 15 May 1915, the First Sea Lord Admiral Fisher resigned amidst bitter arguments with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, causing, on 17 May, Churchill's resignation too. General Hamilton noted in his diary that, \\"The Turks deserve a medal.\\" The Allies had failed to achieve their expectations with the landings. Thus, the British began to make plans for the resumption of the naval attack. However, the torpedoing of Goliath had proven that it would be prohibitively expensive to open the straits by a pure naval attack. The valuable modern battleship was recalled from the Dardanelles. The subsequent loss of battleships at Anzac and at Cape Helles, both torpedoed by , resulted in a further reduction in naval support for the Allied land troops. The ship captain, Kƒ±demli Y√ºzba≈üƒ± Ayasofyali Ahmed Saffed, the German lieutenant Rudolph Firle and his two deputies and the over 90 Ottoman crew were greeted as heroes in Istanbul, all lights along the Bosphorus having been lit specially to their honor, and were rewarded with medals and decorations.Most importantly, this successful operation boosted the moral of the Ottoman soldiers. Ahmet Saffet Ohkay pursued a successful career in the Turkish Navy, the culmination of which was the top command for a brief period in 1924, during the 1924‚Äì1927 transitory phase between the Ottoman Navy and the Turkish Naval Forces. After 1927, he served as deputy in the Turkish Grand National Assembly for three terms. Rudolph Firle wrote a book on the Baltic Sea operations during the war, still a reference, and led a career in the German merchant fleet. Subsequent Operations At the Battle of Imbros on 20 January 1918, Muavenet-i Milliye and three other Ottoman destroyers sortied from the Dardanelles and engaged the British destroyers Lizard and Tigress which were chasing the crippled Ottoman battlecruiser Yav√ªz Sult√¢n Sel√Æm. These were driven off, and Yav√ªz returned to Constantinople. With the collapse of the Ottoman war effort, Muavenet-i Milliye was decommissioned in October 1918. Discarded by the postwar Turkish Navy in 1924, the ship was used as an accommodation hulk at the Ta≈ükƒ±zak shipyard. She was finally scrapped in 1953.

Variants were entered for the event in 1976, 1977 and 1978. An A442B finally won the race on the third occasion, in the hands of Didier Pironi and Jean-Pierre Jaussaud. Also entered in 1978 was the updated Renault Alpine A443 model; essentially an A442 chassis, but powered by a new 2138 cc engine. Following this all-French victory in the premier French motorsport event, Renault withdrew from sports car racing to concentrate their efforts in Formula One. Design Alpine had been working with increasingly close ties to Renault since 1971, and by the beginning of the A442 project in 1975 the two companies were almost completely merged. Renault finally bought Alpine outright in early 1976, Renault inheriting Alpine's sports prototype program. The A442 was a direct evolution of the successful Alpine A440 and title-winning A441 models. However, unlike the previous cars, the A442's 2.0L Renault-Gordini powerplant boasted a large Garrett turbocharger, pushing power output to . Over the next three years this would increase to well over , with the A443's 2.2L unit developing . Jarier/Bell A442A, displaying the acrylic bubble canopy introduced for the 1978 24 Hours of Le Mans race In common with the earlier cars, the engine was suspended inside a relatively small steel spaceframe chassis, which was then clothed in a much longer glassfibre body. The extra length of the body was mostly to be found in the tail section, to improve high-speed aerodynamic efficiency, and hence top speed on the long Mulsanne straight at Circuit de la Sarthe. The bodywork was a conventional open two-seater arrangement. Designed as a \\"hare\\", to stretch their Porsche 936 rivals to breaking point, the A443 also incorporated a slightly longer wheelbase. Following wind tunnel testing during the autumn and winter of 1977, the A442B and A443 were introduced in 1978 each sporting an acrylic glass \\"bubble\\" partial roof, resulting in an additional in top speed at la Sarthe, but reducing visibility from the driving seat. However, during practice for the 1978 Le Mans race, A443 drivers Patrick Depailler and Jean-Pierre Jabouille complained that the bubble made them feel claustrophobic and trapped engine heat inside the cockpit, making driving conditions intolerable. Therefore, only the A442B ever competed with the bubble in place. By 1978, G√©rard Larrousse had moved up from works driver to manage the Renault Sport team. He laid out the team's priorities: win at Le Mans, then focus all attention on repeating the success in Formula One. Renault ploughed a huge budget into developing the A442 into a Le Mans winner. Many hours were spent in testing, particularly using long airport runways to simulate the mechanical and aerodynamic stresses induced on the long, fast Mulsanne Straight. In addition, Renault's engine department went to work on squeezing as much power out of the five-year-old powerplant as was possible. Capacity was upped to 2138 cc, just short of the theoretical 2142 cc limit for turbocharged cars, and this revamped engine was installed into the new, lengthened chassis, becoming the A443. In full qualifying trim, with the bubble roof, the A443 achieved a top speed of on the Mulsanne Straight, making it the fastest car ever produced by Renault, a record which still stands today and includes all of Renault's F1 entries. Race history The A442 made its competition debut in March 1975, at the Mugello 1000 km, with Jabouille and Larrousse, although other sources report the car to be an A441 with the new turbo engine. Despite the relatively underdeveloped turbo addition to the Renault engine, the car lasted long enough for the team to take a surprise win in its very first race. In the 1976 N√ºrburgring 300 km two Renaults qualified in the front row, only to crash out in the second corner. Subsequent repeated mechanical failures meant that going into the 1976 24 Hours of Le Mans the team had failed to win another race. That run of form was not to change, and the single car entered dropped out with engine failure before half of the 24 hours had elapsed. Patrick Depailler driving a Renault Alpine A442 in the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans race For the Renault management, success at Le Mans was a huge prestige issue. For the 1977 race the Renault Sport works team fielded three cars, drafted in endurance specialist Derek Bell, and were supported by an additional, privately entered A442. In the intervening period between the two Le Mans starts, the Renault Alpines had taken second and third places in the 500 km ACF race at Dijon-Prenois, as well as second place at the high-speed 4h Monza round. Expectation and publicity levels were high. It was therefore something of an embarrassment when not one of the four cars reached the finishing flag. Renault's yellow and black liveried squad did not compare favourably with the white Martini Racing Porsche 936 and Porsche 935. In both World Championship series of 1976, these reliable, fast cars scored repeated wins. The 1978 Renault Alpine A443 being demonstrated at Donington Park in 2007 At the 1978 24 Hours of Le Mans, their huge development program paid off. Once again, the works team entered three cars: an old A442, renamed A442A; the bubble-canopied A442B; and the A443. A second A442A was entered by Ecurie Calberson. The work carried out since the 1977 race meant that, for once, Renault was on a par with the dominant Porsche 936 turbo cars, which had been improved, and the two manufacturers shared the first four rows of the grid equally. The Porsche 935/78 Moby Dick, which due to its aerodynamic layout and 800 horsepower achieved over 360 km/h on the straight, qualified third, behind the new 936 and the A443. From the start, the A443 was the class of the field, lapping in under 3 minutes 40 seconds,Lothar Boschen, J√ºrgen Barth: Das Gro√üe Buch der Porsche Typen, Motorbuch Verlag, 1983 while the Porsches had planned to do only 3:40 to 3:50. Jabouille took fastest lap at 3:34, which was six seconds slower than in qualifying, before the A443's engine finally broke in the 18th hour. This was the second Renault retirement, after the Bell/Jarier A442A works car had suffered transmission failure at the half-way point. However, Pironi and Jaussaud in the A442B were well placed to inherit the lead. Two 936s had technical problems, the third crashed at 11 am. The pairing held on to the lead for the final few hours, finishing four laps ahead of the second-placed Porsche. The privateer A442A also finished well, taking fourth place behind the two remaining 936s. After the final flag Pironi was too exhausted to climb up to the podium, where Jaussaud took the trophy alone.

Technical contributions Among Maurer's important contributions is the development and promotion of remote interactive data terminals that could display graphics rather than only the text that was conventional at the time, and even exchange programs. He invented the MUPID system, some of whose ideas would be used in the Bildschirmtext system. A number of his students from this research went on to become influential in computer science, the telecommunications industry, and the civil service. In the 1980s he worked to develop computer network equipment in Styria, and is considered to have helped pave the way for European internet technology.

Maurer thinks that future applications of computers can barely be described using today's terminology, and so employs metaphors such as telepathy and teleportation when discussing some of them. He is also quite concerned with the risks of information technology, particularly the risk of cyberterrorism due to increasing reliance on interconnected networks. He favors a move away from the Von Neumann architecture's treatment of program code as a type of data, with it instead being put on non-modifiable media such as ROM chips that would be more secure from attacks by viruses. On non-technical issues, Maurer writes in favor of greater efforts to promote economic equality in managing a transition to a globalized economy, while maintaining local capabilities.

It competes in the South Australian Grade Cricket League, which is administered by the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). Location In 1963, the City of Burnside relocated the club from the Kensington Oval to the Kensington Gardens Reserve. The club has leases over the three cricket ovals, (Parkinson Oval, Ford Oval and Col. Waite Oval) in perpetuity as compensation for this relocation. Club history Kensington has an extremely rich past player history, dominated by the presence of Sir Donald Bradman and Clarrie Grimmett who played for the club in the 1930s. Other famous names to play for Kensington include Sam Parkinson, Peter Brinsley, John Inverarity, Kevin Wright, Brian Hurn, Ian Glover, Neil Dansie, Rex Sellers, Bob Lloyd, Ashley Woodcock, Terry Jenner, Jeff Hammond, Howard Mutton, James Brayshaw, Tim May, Jamie Siddons, Mark Cleary, Greg Blewett, Dean Waugh and Michael Klinger. Kensington has won 16 A Grade premierships and has been runner up on 6 other occasions. The most recent A grade premiership was in the 2010/2011 season. The club also won the One Day premiership currently known as the XXXX Gold One Day Cup in 2005/06, 2006/07 and 2009/10. Kensington also celebrated its first Twenty20 premiership, winning the 2006/07 title. Kensington were the second club behind Sturt Cricket Club to attempt to win all three A grade premierships in a season. Sturt was defeated by Kensington in the One Day final in 2005/06 and Kensington was defeated by West Torrens Cricket Club in the 2006/07 Grade Final after already claiming the One Day and Twenty20 Premierships. Teams The club has four senior men's teams and three women's teams in the SACA Competition. The men's A, B, C and D grade sides compete in two day, one day and Twenty20 games. The club also has 4 junior teams, in under 14's and 16's. Players from these teams also play in the Ray Sutton Shield (primary school age), u12 statewide cup and u17 BankSA Shield carnivals. Kensington also has an under 11 and under 13 combined 'academy', who receive training and play internal matches, as well as unofficial matches against similar squads from other Grade clubs and college primary A sides, in the absence of a structured SACA under 13 competition. Kensington also has a team in the Adelaide Turf Cricket Association Amateur Competition. Currently the team features past players that are no longer up to the rigours of semi-professional cricket. The team is in the Limited Overs A grade competition. 2008/09 season Kensington recruited Aaron O'Brien and Michael Klinger, two first-class interstate players that signed with the South Australian Redbacks. Kensington have four members in the Redbacks squad for the 2008/09 season, with Jake Brown and Mark Cleary also securing contracts. Former West Torrens, Redback and Australian representative Matthew Elliot also signed with the club after retiring from representative cricket last season. Long time servant and playing member of the club, John Palmer Junior was appointed coach for 2008/09 season. Jake Brown captained the Browns, taking over from Dean Waugh. Kensington played Glenelg Cricket Club at Adelaide Oval on 1 February 2009 in the XXXX Gold One Day Cup Final. Winning the toss, Kensington skipper Jake Brown elected to bat and were bowled out for 153 in the 48th over. Glenelg overhauled the score in the 41st over with the loss of only three wickets. Kensington have now appeared in five One Day Cup finals this decade with a 60% win rate. The Kensington A grade side made it through to the XXXX Golde Grade Cup semi-finals after finishing third on the table in the regular season. Pitted against 2007/08 season's premiers Woodville Cricket Club. Club veteran Jamie Panelli took seven wickets to dismiss Woodville for 80. Woodville ended Kensington's season by then bowling the Browns out for 71. 2009/10 Season Kensington maintained Jake Brown as the club captain and John Palmer Junior as coach. Brown lost his rookie contract with the Redbacks while Cleary, Klinger and O'Brien maintained their contracts. Sam McNeil was selected to represent the South Australia under 23s Futures Team. Tom Brinsley is in the Australian under 19 squad for 2009/10. It was also the 40th Anniversary of the Melbourne Cricket Club and Kensington Cricket Club association which sees an annual match between the two clubs, alternating venue each year. Kensington won their third XXXX Gold One Day Cup for the decade, defeating Northern Districts at Adelaide Oval on 14 February 2010. Batting first, the Browns posted 193 set up by James Hilditch and Aaron O'Brien.

Formed in the early 1990s as a classic heavy metal band, with touches of a down tuned sound. History During their first incarnation in the early 1990s, they released two demos, Thunderstorm (1992) and Force of Evil (1994). In 1998, the band split up due to musical incompatibility issues between members. Their leader and vocalist Fabio \\"Thunder\\" Bellan met drummer Massimo Tironi and formed a new Thunderstorm band, this time geared the sound toward classic doom metal in style of Black Sabbath, Candlemass, and Trouble, and called themselves Sad Symphony. Joining the band soon after was bassist Omar Roncalli, after which the named was then switched back to the original moniker Thunderstorm, and a second guitarist, Sandro Mazzoleni, joined the band. In 1999, this line-up produced a demo called Sad Symphony, which generated interest among record labels, and the band was signed to Northwind Records.Thunderstorm official website Under Northwind, the band released two full-length albums, Sad Symphony (2000) and Witch Hunter Tales (2002). During this time period, Mazzoleni and Tironi departed, Bellan took over full-time guitar duties and brought in new drummer Attilio Coldani. After the latter album was completed, the band decided to switch labels and signed a multi-album deal with Italian label Dragonheart Records and released a full-length album in 2004, Faithless Soul. They disbanded in November 2011 citing musical differences, which was displayed on their official website until the site was taken down. Their albums were recorded at New Sin Studio in Loria, Italy.

The show, which was first exclusively broadcast on KFI AM 640 in Los Angeles, California, was picked up for syndication by Premiere Networks (then Premiere Radio Networks) in February 2007. The show currently has over 160 terrestrial affiliates in cities including Los Angeles, California, San Francisco, California, Houston, Texas, and Washington, DC. Laporte streams video of his side of the show on TWiT Live, including caller audio. Anyone can watch the show live on weekends at 11:00 A.M. PST at live.twit.tv The show reaches 500,000 people through its affiliates, placing it second behind The Kim Komando Show (with 2.25 million weekly listeners) in the tech radio field. The show is a mixture of interviews and call-ins, as well as Leo's own thoughts and opinions on current events in technology. Several regular guests often appear during the show via Skype; AVSForum Editor Scott Wilkinson, Dick DeBartolo of Mad Magazine, and Johnny Jet appear on Saturdays while Chris Marquardt of Tips from the Top Floor has a Sunday segment. Former guests include Steve Gibson, Paul Thurrott, and Ron Rosberg. The show originates from the TWiT Eastside studios in Petaluma, California, a community north of San Francisco. History Leo Laporte has been doing one version or another of his technology talk show since 1990, including a syndicated show originating from KGO. The current incarnation of the show began on KFI weekends in 2004, only months prior to the cancellation of Call for Help and The Screen Savers from the newly merged G4techTV in the United States. According to Leo, he had to find a way to keep talking about technology, and facetiously mentioned that if it wasn't for KFI green lighting the show, he would have ended up \\"having to talk to [his] wife about it.\\", The Tech Guy #327 The show ran weekends on KFI at 11 AM. Leo also appeared on Bill Handel's morning show on Fridays for The Laporte Report segment, and continues to do so. Leo also does a Laporte Report live segment for CFRB in Toronto, Ontario on Saturday mornings. In late 2006, Leo notified his audience on net@nite that his contract with KFI was going to expire soon, and it was hinted at that he would only continue with Clear Channel if The Tech Guy was syndicated. With the help of management at KFI, Premiere Networks picked up the show for syndication, and it was announced on January 27, 2007, that it would roll out nationally., KFI Radio Show is Being Syndicated On February 17, 2007, the newly syndicated Tech Guy radio show launched nationally on eleven radio stations, including KFI. The show has added many affiliates, and has grown sharply from the original twelve to over one hundred (as of the summer of 2010). Live chat There is a public Internet Relay Chat that takes place when the show airs live on the server irc.twit.tv in the #twitlive channel. Leo participates in the chat during commercial breaks and often refers to the chat to give him additional information to assist with some of the callers' questions. The channel is moderated to keep the chat clean and on-topic. Podcast Every show is available as a podcast on the TWiT network, distributed via RSS feed 15px at twit.tv/TTG. Until June 2011, shows were posted intermittently up to a week after their first airdate in order to meet the requirements of Laporte's Premiere contract for exclusivity purposes for the radio affiliates, and the live and taped video versions of the show required caller audio to be muted. After Laporte renewed his Premiere deal that month, these conditions were relaxed, and the show is now allowed to be posted hours after first broadcast to TWiT, and caller audio is now heard on the live video and TWiT.am audio feeds. The new deal also allowed Laporte to solicit his traditional TWiT advertisers to sponsor the podcast feeds, while retaining his advertisers for the radio version. At the end of 2015, The Tech Guy was number 10 on the Top 40 US Technology Podcasts, making it the third highest weekly Twit.tv podcast. Technical details The show was produced from Leo Laporte's \\"TWiT Cottage\\" at 8 Keller St. but moved to the new TWiT studio known as the TWiT Brick House at 140 Keller St. in late July 2011. It is streamed to Premiere Networks via ISDN to Premiere at 64 kbps. From there Premiere uplinks it to their satellite network for distribution. Leo also streams the show on the TWiT Live Website. July 24, 2011‚Äôs show was the last program produced at the TWiT Cottage, with Laporte parading through downtown Petaluma after the end of that day's show to the Brick House with his staff and onlookers to inaugurate the new facility, which opened an hour later with that week's This Week in Tech. The first The Tech Guy show produced at the TWiT Brick House was on July 30, which also was the first broadcast from Leo's office set, which was built to resemble the former Cottage studio. Radio affiliates The Tech Guy radio show is syndicated to several affiliates across America, including the show's flagship, KFI in Los Angeles, California. While formerly on KGO-AM in San Francisco, California‚Äîthe metropolitan area nearest TWiT's studios‚Äîit is now tape-delayed Sundays on KKSF-AM. The show runs live for three hours weekends at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, with some stations delaying their airing until later in the day.

It opened on 30 September 1907. It is operated by the Kings Theatre Trust Ltd. The building was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1976. History The theatre opened on 30 September 1907 with a production of Charles I followed by two further of Sir Henry Irving's Works. During the 1930s it was used to premiere several works by Ian Hay before they transferred to the West End including Orders Are Orders and Admirals All. The theatre stayed in the control of its original owners, The Portsmouth Theatre Company, until 1964 when it was purchased by Commander Reggie & Mrs Joan Cooper. In 1990 it was sold again to Hampshire County Council. In 2001, after a successful campaign by AKTER (Action for Kings Theatre Restoration) to keep the theatre open, the theatre was purchased by Portsmouth City Council and leased to the Kings Theatre Trust Ltd who undertook the restoration of the building. The present day theatre has a seating capacity of 1600 and a computerised booking system. Much of the backstage area is still fully manual, allowing it to retain the tag of a traditional hemp house, though powered flying bars have now been installed to allow large-scale productions. In 1974, director Ken Russell filmed the Pinball Wizard sequence of the rock opera Tommy at the theatre, featuring The Who and Elton John on the stage. The Kings Theatre Trust Ltd The Kings Theatre Trust Ltd. is a registered charity which oversees both the day-to-day running and the restoration of the building, as well as productions at the theatre. The restoration is in part funded by Portsmouth City Council and the Kings Theatre Trust. Staff Led by a team of Directors headed up by Chair of Directors, Paul Woolf, the permanent staff are augmented by apprenticeships and seconded personal who are employed as part of their higher education and vocational training programmes as well as casual staff. The Kings prides itself in the educational and training programmes available to young people in the Portsmouth area. Restoration work As part of the Centenary Project, the Kings Theatre underwent a ¬£500,000 refurbishment of the auditorium, including the ceiling. Beginning on 17 June 2007 the theatre was cleared and scaffolding was constructed to allow access to the higher areas of the auditorium. There was work to restore the decorations of the theatre and maintain the areas. During this work a small 120-seat theatre was created within the auditorium which was known as the Stage 2 Studio. The Studio season was such a success that it was repeated during the Summer of 2008 (throughout August) with music, comedy, children's shows, drama and dance all part of the line up. Between October 2008 and February 2009, the original leaded dome, red painted wooden cupula, the deteriorated wooden statue (now named Aurora) and six lion figures was replicated in glassfibre by Jago Developments of Chichester and successfully installed by them (with the help of a 60-ton crane). Since the restoration programme commenced, over ¬£2 million has been spent on refurbishment using both professional and volunteer workers. The Kings Theatre Trust are in the process of raising funds for a restoration of the currently dilapidated Tower Room, to create a community art studio and exhibition space. File:KINGS_CEILING.jpgRestoration of the ceiling File:Cupola_Crane.jpgTower restoration Shows Many one night touring shows come through the Kings Theatre, from ballet to rock music, through drama to children's shows. Since the major restorations have been undertaken, the Kings Theatre has attracted large national touring productions such as \\"Chicago\\", \\"Beauty & The Beast\\", \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\", \\"The Rocky Horror Show\\", \\"Blood Brothers\\" and \\"Grease\\". Productions from larger amateur societies, such as South Downes Musical Society and The Portsmouth Players, regularly feature in the programme as do many local school productions whose standard of performance fully justifies their inclusion in the programme.

According to the 2011 UK census, Ugthorpe parish had a population of 225, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 201. History Ugthorpe was an ancient demesne of the Crown, and is styled in the Domesday book as Ughetorp. The Mauleys became lords here at an early period, and from them the manor and estate descended by marriage to the Bigods, and afterwards to the Ratcliffes, by whom the whole estate was sold in parcels. The village is situated in the western part of the parish, north of the road between Whitby and Guisborough. Catholic Recusant historyBlessed Nicholas Postgate= In 1596, Blessed Nicholas Postgate, a Catholic priest and martyr, was born and lived in a humble home, now called The Hermitage, at Ugthorpe. He studied at Douay College, France, becoming a priest in 1628. He worked secretly as a priest in a wide area of Yorkshire, finally settling back to Ugthorpe in the 1660s. He is one of the 85 English Catholic Martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II in November 1987. Although anti-Catholic feeling had subsided a good deal, it flared up again due to the fake Popish Plot of 1678; this followed a false testimony from Titus Oates in which he claimed there was a conspiracy to instal a Catholic king, and he managed to ferment a renewed and fierce persecution of English Catholics. It was to be the last time that Catholics were put to death in England for their faith; one of the last victims ‚Äì but not the very last ‚Äì was Nicholas Postgate. During the panic engineered by Oates, a prominent Protestant magistrate in London, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, was murdered and Oates loudly blamed the Catholics; Sir Edmund's manservant, John Reeves, set out to get his revenge. For reasons which are not clear, he decided to base his actions in the Whitby area, possibly because he knew that priests arrived there from France. Nicholas Postgate was arrested at Redbarns Farm, Ugglebarnby, near Whitby, where he was to carry out a baptism. Reeves, with a colleague called William Cockerill, raided the house during the ceremony and caught the priest, then aged 82. He was tried for treason in York and then hanged, disembowelled and quartered. Every year since 1974 an open- air service has been held ‚Äì alternately in Egton Bridge and Ugthorpe ‚Äì in honour of Fr Postgate. Title page to the first edition of the Haydock Bible, published by Thomas Haydock, Manchester, 1811 =Father George Haydock= Early in the 19th century, while the anti-Catholic Penal Laws were still in effect, Ugthorpe was the location of a mission for Catholic Recusants. From 1803‚Äì1827, it was presided over by Father George Leo Haydock (1774‚Äì1849). While serving there, he completed an extensive body of annotations to his edition of the Douay Bible, which became known as The Haydock Bible, published by his brother, Thomas, in 1811, and remaining in print to this day.

Rigby established a new cemetery and founded a college which later became the church hall. About 1884 Rev Rigby handed over the priestly duties to his curate, the Rev. E.J. Hickey. There was an earlier Catholic church here, built around 1812.A Topographical Dictionary of England (1848), pp. 411‚Äì414. Other facts Aaron Hart's Bacon Factory in 1973The village windmill has long been converted into a residential address and no longer grinds corn. In the 1930s, Ugthorpe had two cobblers, a watchmaker, a joiner and a bacon factory with its own slaughterhouse. The slaughterhouse operated until the mid-1970s and was owned and run by Alice and Dinis Hart; the business was continued by their son and after that their grandson, both called Aaron Hart. Originally the slaughterhouse and factory were at White House, later moving to a site near the Black Bull Inn. Pigs were slaughtered each Tuesday and their meat was prepared and sold from the premises, at Whitby, and around the neighbouring villages. The building is still often referred to as the Bacon House but has now been converted into a house. VisitorUK.com: Welcome to WhitbyNorth Yorkshire Federations of Women's Institutes.

In soft contact lenses, it is dependent on the thickness of the lens and the material of the lens, especially concerning the water content. Because of this dependence on thickness, transmissibility level (abbreviated Dk/t), the Dk per thickness of the lens, is more commonly used. The earliest models of soft contact lenses, based on hydrogel material, had a level of oxygen permeability of around 6‚Äì8 Dk/t. Polymacon, the material used in the first hydrogel contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and approved by the FDA in the U.S. in 1971, has a Dk of 9 . These days, typical values of oxygen permeability for hydrogel contact lenses range from 25 to 50. For example, Nelfilcon A has a Dk value of 26, and the Omafilcon A has a Dk of 25. While those numbers are typical of hydrogel contact lenses, many contact lenses are made of silicone hydrogel, which has a much higher oxygen permeability. For example, the Dk value of Lotrafilcon B and Comfilcon A, two silicone hydrogels, is 110 and 128, respectively. These values are more than twice the values of oxygen permeability for hydrogel materials. D being diffusivity (cm2/sec)--a measure of how fast the oxygen moves through the material. Note, different sources may use different units: contact package inserts often use cm2/sec, while academic papers may use other values for distance such as mm2/sec. k being the solubility (ml O2/ml of material x mm Hg)--a measure of how much oxygen is contained in the material.

Popular teams sports in England include football, field hockey, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, and netball. Major individual sports include badminton, athletics, tennis, boxing, golf, cycling, motorsport and horseracing. Cricket is regarded as the national summer sport. Association football is the most popular sport, followed by Cricket, Tennis and Rugby. A number of modern sports were codified in England during the nineteenth century, among them cricket, rugby union, rugby league, football, field hockey, squash, tennis, and badminton. The game of baseball was first described in 18th century England.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3582726 Structure England has its own national team in most team sports, but the United Kingdom sends a combined team to the Olympics. Competition between the home nations was traditionally at the centre of British sporting life, but it has become less important in recent decades. In particular, football's British Home Championship no longer takes place. In some sports there are still national English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish teams. The Club Competitions in most team sports are also English affairs rather than British ones. There are various anomalies however, such as the participation of the three largest Welsh football clubs in the English league system and an English club in the Scottish Football League. The relative prominence of national team and club competition varies from sport to sport. In football, club competition is at the centre of the agenda most of the time because clubs plays more matches each year, but the four national teams are also followed avidly. In cricket the national team is much more widely followed than the county competitions, which have a limited profile, whereas in rugby league club competition generally overshadows international fixtures. Rugby union falls between these two with very high-profile international competitions and a strengthening club game. Sport England is the governing body responsible for distributing funds and providing strategic guidance for sporting activity in England. There are five National Sports Centres: Bisham Abbey, Crystal Palace, Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre, Lilleshall and Plas Y Brenin National Mountain Centre in Wales. Everyday Sport is Sport England's physical activity campaign. There are 49 County Sport Partnerships in England with areas for responsibility separated by Local Authority County boundaries. The English Institute of Sport is a nationwide network of support services, aimed at improving the standard of English athletes. Services include sports medicine, physiotherapy, sports massage, applied physiology, strength and conditioning, nutrition, psychology and Performance Lifestyle support. It is based at 8 regional hubs and other satellite centers. The Minister for Sport and Tourism and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have responsibility for sport in England.

A generation ago, England games looked a lot like Last Night of the Proms, with the red, white and blue firmly to the fore. Now, it seems, the English have begun to remember who they are.\\" Elite level team sports There are four sports in England which operate high-profile professional leagues. Association football is by far the most popular sport and is played from August to May. Rugby union is also a winter sport. Cricket is played in the Summer, from April to September. Rugby league is traditionally a winter sport, but since the late 1990s the elite competition has been played in the summer to appeal to the family market, and take advantage of the faster pitches. Football Manchester United play Arsenal in the 2008‚Äì09 Premier League The most popular sport in the UK, association football was first codified in 1863 in London. It is known in the US and a few other countries as 'soccer.' The impetus for this was to unify English public school and university football games. There is evidence for refereed, team football games being played in English schools since at least 1581. An account of an exclusively kicking football game from Nottinghamshire in the fifteenth century bears striking similarity to football. The playing of football in England is documented since at least 1314. England is home to the oldest football clubs in the world (dating from at least 1857), the world's oldest competition (the FA Cup founded in 1871) and the first ever football league (1888). The modern passing game of football was developed in London in the early 1870s For these reasons England is considered the cradle of the game of football. The governing body for football in England is The Football Association which is the oldest football organisation in the world. It is responsible for national teams, the recreational game and the main cup competitions. They have however lost a significant amount of power to the professional leagues in recent times. English football has a league system which incorporates thousands of clubs, and is topped by four fully professional divisions. The elite Premier League has 20 teams and is the richest football league in the world. The other three fully professional divisions are the run by the English Football League, the oldest league in the world, and include another 72 clubs. Annual promotion and relegation operates between these four divisions and also between the lowest of them and lower level or \\"non-League\\" football. There are a small number of fully professional clubs outside the top four divisions, and many more semi-professional clubs. Thus England has over a hundred fully professional clubs in total, which is considerably more than any other country in Europe. The two main cup competitions in England are the FA Cup, which is open to clubs down to Level 10 of the English football pyramid structure; and the League Cup (currently known as the Carabao Cup), which is for the 92 professional clubs in the four main professional divisions only. Each season the most successful clubs from each of the home nations qualify for the two Europe-wide club competitions organised by UEFA, the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup). England has both produced winners of each of these competitions. The England national football team won the World Cup in 1966 when it was hosted in England. Since then, however, they have failed to reach a final of a major international tournament, though they reached the semi- finals of the World Cup in 1990 and 2018, and the quarter-finals in 1986, 2002 and 2006. England reached the semi-finals of the UEFA European Championship when they hosted it in 1996, and finished third in Euro 1968; they also made the quarter-finals of Euro 2004 and 2012. In the UEFA Nations League, launched in 2018‚Äì19, they were assigned to the top level of that competition, League A, and have advanced to the semi-finals in that season. The FA hopes that the completion of the National Football Centre will go some way to improving the national team's performance. Cricket Cricketer W.G. Grace Cricket is another popular team sport, regarded as the national sport and the second or third most popular and followed sport in the country Although there is some debate about the origins of the game, modern cricket is generally believed to have originated in England with the laws of cricket ‚Äì adhered to by players at all levels worldwide ‚Äì established by the London-based Marylebone Cricket Club. Although the origins of cricket in England date back as far as the sixteenth century, formal laws of the game began to be developed in the eighteenth century. Most recently, the globally popular Twenty20 format of cricket was innovated in England at the turn of the 21st century. The England national cricket team is one of the twelve Full Members of the International Cricket Council, enabling England to participate in Test, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 International matches, as well as the ICC Cricket World Cup. Cricket in England is administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board, having been overseen by the Test and County Cricket Board until 1997. It is one of only 2 countries in Europe to be full ICC members, along with the Ireland cricket team. England's professional domestic system consists of eighteen teams from the historic counties of England and Wales, playing a variety of matches over the summer cricket season. These clubs participate in the County Championship, a two-tiered First Class cricket competition recognised as one of the oldest domestic cricket tournaments in the world, as well as the limited overs 50 Overs tournament (known as the Royal London One Day Cup for sponsorship reasons as of 2019) and the Vitality T20 Blast, which has notably helped in popularising the domestic aspect of the game. Twenty more clubs compete in the amateur Minor Counties Cricket Championship. The Hundred, a new franchise based and new format of the game was scheduled to begin as a domestic competition in the 2020 season, but has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cricket is a popular recreational and summer sport in England, with hundreds of clubs playing at various levels; village cricket in particular is regarded as a key aspect of English culture. The Lancashire League was formed in 1892 and is renowned for the extensive list of professional players who have participated in it, particularly during the middle of the twentieth century. It is also a popular school and university sport in the summer. Lord's Cricket Ground, located in the St. John's Wood area of London, is known as \\"the home of cricket\\" and in addition to housing the Marylebone Cricket Club, is also the headquarters of the European Cricket Council and was until 2005 the headquarters of the International Cricket Council. England has hosted five ICC Cricket World Cups to date, in 1975, 1979, 1983, 1999 and 2019. In addition to these tournaments, England has also hosted the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2004 and 2013. England have won one ICC Cricket World Cup, in 2019. They previously finished as runners up in the 1979, 1987 and 1992 tournaments. In addition, England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the Caribbean. England enjoys a hotly contested and storied rivalry with Australia, against whom they compete for The Ashes in a contest that dates back to the nineteenth century. As of 2019, Australia are holders of the Ashes having retained the trophy in 2017‚Äì18 Ashes series, retaining the Ashes urn in a drawn series in 2019. The English cricket team also enjoys rivalries against India and the West Indies, although the latter is no longer as fierce as it was during its peak in the 1980s. England is also a pioneering nation in the sport of Indoor Cricket. The first organised indoor cricket league in the world took place in 1970 in North Shropshire, and the first national tournament was completed in 1976 with over 400 clubs taking part. By 1979 over 1000 clubs were taking part in indoor cricket in the UK, and it remains extremely popular today with many leagues around the country.\\"Lord's joy for Whitstable\\" from ECB, accessed 28 January 2013 Rugby Like association football, rugby union and rugby league both developed from traditional British football games in the 19th century. Rugby was codified by the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The Rugby Football League developed after a number of leading clubs, that wished to be allowed to compensate their players for missing work, formed their own governing body in 1895 and subsequently the two organisations developed somewhat different rules. For much of the 20th century there was considerable antagonism between rugby league, which was a mainly working class game based in the industrial regions of northern England, and rugby union, which is a predominantly middle class game in England, and is also popular in the other home nations. This antagonism has abated since 1995 when the governing body now known as World Rugby opened rugby union to professional players. =Rugby union= The four home nations compete separately at international level. They take part in the main European international rugby union competition, the Six Nations Championship. England won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the first victory in the competition by a British team (or, for that matter, any Northern Hemisphere country). The main rugby union club competition in England is a 12-team league called the Gallagher Premiership, and there is also a cup competition, the Premiership Rugby Cup, launched in 2018‚Äì19 as the replacement for the now- defunct Anglo-Welsh Cup, which included teams from Wales from 2005 until its demise. Attendances at club rugby in England have risen strongly since the sport went professional. English club sides also take part in the two Europe- wide club rugby competitions, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the European Rugby Challenge Cup. English clubs such as Leicester Tigers, Bath Rugby, Wasps and Northampton Saints have had success in the predecessor to the Champions Cup, the Heineken Cup. =Rugby league= Leeds Rhinos playing at the 2008 boxing day friendly against Wakefield Trinity Wildcats at Headingley, Leeds The governing body of rugby league in the United Kingdom is the Rugby Football League. Rugby league draws most of its support from its heartlands in Yorkshire, North West England, and Cumbria. Although playing numbers have recently topped 60,000 in London and the south east. The top-level league is the 12-team Super League, which was reduced from 14 teams due to a major reorganisation of the professional leagues in 2015. Ten teams are based in the heartlands, with the other teams in France and Canada. Below Super League is the Championship, with 14 teams, and League 1, with 11 teams. As of the next season in 2020, the Championship has twelve teams from the heartlands and one each from London and France; League 1 has six heartland teams, three teams from Newcastle, Coventry and London, and two from Wales ‚Äì one in the North and one in the South West. There is direct promotion and relegation between each of the three divisions in professional Rugby League. The bottom placed team from the Super League is directly relegated to the Championship, replaced by the winner of a five team play-off structure, contested by the top five placed teams in that seasons Championship. The bottom two placed teams of the Championship are directly relegated, replaced by the top placed team in League One, along with the winner of a five team play-off structure, contested by the teams that finish between second and sixth in League One. Following a reorganisation in 2014, the seasons of Super League and the Championship were much more closely integrated than in the past. Following a 22-game home-and- away season in both leagues, the leagues split into three eight-team groups known as \\"Super 8's\\". The first, the Super League Super 8's, involved the top eight teams on the Super League table. After these teams played a round-robin mini-league, with table points carrying over from the league season, the top four entered a knockout play-off that culminated in the Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford. The second group, the Qualifiers Super 8's, involved the bottom four teams from Super League and the top four from the Championship. After a similar round-robin mini-league (but with all teams starting on 0 points), the top three teams earned places in the following year's Super League. The fourth- and fifth-place teams then played a one-off match, billed as the \\"Million Pound Game\\", for the final Super League place. The final group, the Championship Shield Super 8's, involved the bottom eight teams from the Championship. These teams played their own round-robin mini- league, with table points carrying over. The top four teams after the extra games contested a knockout play-off for the Championship Shield, while the bottom two teams are relegated to League 1. From 2009 through to 2014, Super League consisted of 14 franchises, based on renewable three-year licences, but that system was scrapped following the 2014 season. The main knock-out competition is the Challenge Cup, which also includes clubs from France, Canada, Wales, Scotland and Serbia (plus, in the past, Russia), and each year culminates in a history-steeped final at Wembley Stadium. Teams competing in the Challenge Cup range from the top professional teams in the Super League, through to amateur teams, plus representative sides from the British Army, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Police, along with occasional invited teams from other countries, such as Red Star Belgrade of Serbia in 2019. The amateur and representative sides enter in the earliest rounds, with professional teams from the more senior leagues entering at later stages of the competition. In addition to the Challenge Cup, teams from the Championship and League One compete in the 1895 Cup, with the final played at Wembley Stadium on the same day as the Challenge Cup Final. Rugby league is also played as an amateur sport, especially in the heartland areas, where the game is administered by BARLA. Since the rugby union authorities ended the discrimination against playing rugby league amateur numbers in the sport have increased, particularly outside the heartland areas. Through competitions such as the Rugby League Conference, consisting of one nationwide league of ten teams and twelve other regional leagues, including one Welsh and one Scottish league, the sport now has a national spread, at amateur level at least . Internationally, England fields a competitive team in international rugby league. For many tournaments the home nations are combined to compete as Great Britain. The Great Britain team won the Rugby League World Cup in 1954, 1960 and 1972, but England and Wales now compete separately in this tournament and Australia held the title from 1975 until 2008 when they finally lost their grip on the title after being beaten by New Zealand in a thrilling final in Brisbane. England and Wales jointly hosted the World Cup in 2013, with matches also held in France and Ireland; Australia regained the crown, retaining it at the 2017 World Cup after beating England 6‚Äì0 in the final ‚Äì the lowest scoring final in Rugby League World Cup history. The England team competes in the annual Four Nations competition. The England national rugby league team will compete more regularly as a full test nation, in lieu of the Great Britain national rugby league team, which, following the 2007 Centenary Test Series against New Zealand only reforms as an occasional southern hemisphere touring side. However, in 2018, the Great Britain national rugby league team was reformed after a 10-year hiatus in preparation of a tour of the Southern Hemisphere. Ice Hockey Ice Hockey is Britain's largest indoor spectator sport. It has a long history in the UK and it is reasonably well supported, with the larger teams attracting thousands of fans to every game. The main league is the ten-team professional Elite League, which has featured many former NHL players, predominantly during the NHL lockout season. At the moment the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team is in division 1 of the Ice Hockey World Championships. The team is ranked 23rd in the world in the IIHF World Ranking system. Media support for ice hockey has improved on a national level, although the majority of news is still found on the internet. Sky Sports has been covering the Elite league for a few seasons, and starting in the 2010/2011 season they will be showing 8 live games and a highlight show every week; the reason this deal happened was due to the elite league attracting very large viewing figures and Sky seeing the Elite Ice Hockey League as a potentially big and popular league. The Elite Ice Hockey League is well recognised around the ice hockey world, so much so that on 2 October 2010 the Boston Bruins of the NHL took on the Belfast Giants at the Giants Odyssey Arena in Belfast, Northern Ireland Basketball Basketball is a minor sport in England. As of the 2006‚Äì07 season the top-level league is the ten team British Basketball League and second league is the twelve team English Basketball League. The teams are professional or semi-professional but have modest resources. Great Britain men's national basketball team, which was formed by the national basketball organisations of England, Scotland and Wales on 1 December 2005, have not achieved any notable success. Great Britain qualified for the 2009 European basketball championship after 28 years absence from any major international basketball event for any of the Great Britain's countries' national teams. At Eurobasket 2011 Great Britain recorded their first Eurobasket win en route to a 2‚Äì3 record, finishing 13th out of 24 teams. On 13 March 2011, Fiba voted 17‚Äì3 in favour of Great Britain receiving their host nation spot at the 2012 Olympic games with one condition, they have until 30 June 2012 to decide on whether to merge the three nations that make up the team or disband after the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Field hockey  Hockey is a moderately popular recreational sport in England. The Great Britain women's hockey team won the 2016 Rio Olympics with over 10 million viewers on TV, the men's team won the hockey tournament at the 1988 Olympics. Women's hockey at International, Premier League and Conference League level is sponsored by Investec. The Men's England Hockey League and Women's England Hockey League contain very high levels of club hockey ability and usually at least two clubs from both the men's and women's leagues proceed to European Competitions. Each week highlights of that weeks games get posted on YouTube. Hockey's popularity is rising fast with the women winning the Rio Olympics in 2016 and the men winning the Azlan Shah Cup in 2017. The sport has a great future and will continue to grow with hopefully more success to grow on the success already seen in the international are and the club leagues. Other team sports Lacrosse = Lacrosse in England is played in both the men's (field & indoor) and women's (field) versions of the games and governed by English Lacrosse Association. Currently the England men's team are European champions and are ranked fifth in the world. The women's team are currently second in Europe (however have won the competition three out of the seven times it has been competed for); they are also ranked fourth in the World (having won silver in both the 1987 and 1991 World Championships). = Bandy = England is seen as one of the birthplaces of bandy, beside Russia (where a similar game developed simultaneously). The match which later has been dubbed the original bandy match was held in London in 1875.Svenska Bandyf√∂rbundet, bandyhistoria 1875‚Äì1919 England won the 1913 European Bandy Championships in Davos, Switzerland.Bandy World Map ‚Äì England Retrieved 2 February 2014. Following the outbreak of the First World War, the interest for bandy vanished in England and the National Bandy Association was discontinued. Almost a hundred years later, bandy was reintroduced to England and the Bandy Federation of England was founded in 2010, changing names to Great Britain Bandy Federation in 2017. England now has both a men's national team and a women's national team, which hopefully will compete in the future World Championships. = American football = American football was introduced to England during the early part of the 20th century by American servicemen stationed in the country. During the Second World War, matches were played by American and Canadian servicemen stationed in the UK at venues throughout the country. This included the 'Tea Bowl' game played at the White City Stadium in 1944,. In England, Scotland and Wales, the domestic game is organised by the British American Football Association (BAFA), who operate a series of league competitions as the BAFA National Leagues. The championship game is known as the BritBowl. = Australian rules football = Cambridge and Oxford Universities play Australian rules football Australian rules football has a long but obscure history in England but has grown since 1989 to several amateur leagues. England regularly plays international matches against other countries and competes in the Australian Football International Cup as a part of the Great Britain national Australian rules football team. Australian Football League exhibition matches have been held in London every few years since 1972 (see Australian rules football in England). = Gaelic sports = The Irish sports of Gaelic football and hurling are also organised on a similar basis. Dating back to the 1880s London GAA teams compete in top-level competitions in Ireland. During the 1970s, and 1980s there were as many as 85 GAA clubs in the London area and hundreds around Britain, but due to the fall- off in Irish immigration in the 1990s the number has fallen considerably. Elite level individual sports=Tennis Tennis is the largest individual sport in England in terms of registered players and viewing audiences. Every year The Wimbledon Championships take place in London. They are the most prestigious tennis championships in the world and attract the largest global audience. Athletics England does not compete at the Olympic Games instead English athletes compete as part of Great British team, Team GB. London (the Capital of England and the UK) hosted the Summer Olympics in 1908, 1948 and 2012 making it the first city in the world to host the Summer Olympics three times. Various athletics events which are individualistic are viewed as popular in England. In August 2014 Mo Farah became the most successful athlete in the European Athletics Championships history. Squash England has produced many squash world number ones, and has been known to dominate the world rankings. Badminton Badminton is England's most popular racket sport. It is an accessible sport where beginners can experience success early through basic rallying, but at the top level it requires high levels of power, agility and endurance. Badminton is an Olympic sport and Great Britain achieved medal success in both Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004. The All-England Championships takes place in Birmingham every year and attracts all the top players from around the world. Golf Although originating in Scotland, England has played a major role in the development of golf, including the origins of the Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain & Ireland). Major golf tournaments held in England include the Open Championship (an English course hosting the event two years in every five) and the BMW PGA Championship, the flagship event of the European Tour. The Ryder Cup also originated in England, with the event being held on English courses numerous times. Motorsport The majority of the Formula One teams are based in England. Drivers from England have won eight Formula One World Championship drivers titles. Lewis Hamilton is the most notable current English driver,having won six championships (most recently in 2019). The British Grand Prix takes place at Silverstone, most frequently in July. Major motor racing series based in the UK include the British Formula Three Championship and the British Touring Car Championship. English drivers (most notably Richard Burns) have achieved success in the World Rally Championship. Since 2000 the British Superbike Championship has become increasingly popular, surpassing its four-wheeled rivals in terms of spectator receipts and television coverage. Britain hosts one round of the MotoGP championship at Silverstone, and one of the Superbike World Championship at Donington Park in 2018 but has previously visited Brands Hatch and Silverstone. England is commonly seen as the widely dominant country for building racing cars. In addition to Formula One successes, historic names such as Lola, March, Reynard and Chevron have supplied numerous teams. Universities offering motorsport courses always back up this claim. Between the mid-1980s to the 1990s cars built in Britain were widely dominant in CART racing and the Indianapolis 500 in the United States. Boxing England played a key role in the evolution of modern boxing, with the codification of the rules of the sport known as the Queensberry Rules in the 19th century. British professional boxing offers some of the largest purses outside the United States to a few elite professional boxers who become nationally known. British heavyweight contenders are especially popular, but most British world champions have fought in the middling weight brackets. The governing bodies of professional boxing are the British Boxing Board of Control and the British & Irish Boxing Authority. It is generally felt that British professional boxing is in decline in the early years of the 21st century. The reasons for this include: the fact that football now offers a relatively large number of sportsmen the chance to make the sort of income traditionally only available to world boxing champions, reducing the incentive for athletic youngsters to accept the greater risks of a boxing career; the acquisition of the rights to most major fights by Sky Sports, which means that fewer boxers become national figures than in the past; and the knock the sport's credibility has taken from the multiplicity of title sanctioning bodies. Amateur boxing is governed by the Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) and the equivalent bodies in the other home nations. British amateurs have only enjoyed a very modest amount of success in international competition in recent decades, partly due to the tendency for them to turn professional at an early stage. The amateur sport is in a very poor state, with dramatic declines in boxer numbers. National amateur boxing championships and international team matches, which were once highlights of the British sporting calendar, receive only limited national recognition. Mixed Martial Arts England's Michael Bisping (left) squaring off against Canada's Denis Kang (right) at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Mixed martial arts (MMA) has generally increased in popularity since being on the verge of oblivion in the early 1990s, but it has not seen anything like the popularity it has in the U.S.A duplicated in England. However, the rise of English MMA fighters have led to increased attention to the sport. In addition, Conor McGregor enjoys widespread name recognition in England, which has many residents of Irish heritage. Things slowly started to change when Michael Bisping came onto the scene and won The Ultimate Fighter 3 and earned a six-figure contract to the UFC. Bisping built UK MMA a bit quicker alongside Ross Pearson and James Wilks, the two winners of The Ultimate Fighter: United States vs. United Kingdom. Bisping coached Team UK. After that TUF season, MMA in the UK began to build. UK MMA is being pushed further with the likes of Dan Hardy, Brad Pickett, John Hathaway, Jimi Manuwa, Rosi Sexton, and Luke Barnatt. MMA was also boosted in the UK on The Ultimate Fighter: The Smashes. The show saw the UK vs Australia. It was an MMA spin-off of The Ashes. At UFC 111, in Newark, New Jersey, Nottingham's Dan Hardy fought Canada's Georges St- Pierre for the UFC Welterweight Championship on 27 March 2010, becoming the first UK fighter to fight for a UFC title in the history of the organisation. Hardy lost the fight via unanimous decision. St-Pierre took Hardy down and controlled him with effective ground and pound. St-Pierre secured a tight armbar and kimura on Hardy in rounds 1 and 4. Hardy refused to tap, however, despite the danger of his arm being broken. After a huge win in London against Anderson Silva, Michael Bisping finally got his long-awaited UFC title fight in a rematch against Luke Rockhold at UFC 199 at The Forum in Inglewood, California, who submitted Bisping at UFC Fight Night: Rockhold vs. Bisping on 7 November 2014 in Sydney, Australia with a guillotine choke in round 2. Rockhold was originally set to rematch Chris Weidman, who he took the title from at UFC 194, but, Weidman was forced to withdraw due to a neck injury. The UFC's first choice was Ronaldo Souza but 'Jacar√©' was undergoing knee sergury. Therefore, the UFC chose Bisping to face Luke Rockhold for the UFC Middleweight Championship. Despite being 37 years old, with only 2 weeks notice and being a 10/1 underdog, all it took Bisping was a left hook to wobble the Californian with another left after he waited patiently for Rockhold to get back up. Bisping landed 3 strikes after he dropped Rockhold again and referee John McCarthy stopped the fight. Michael Bisping fulfilled his destiny and realised his dream. Bisping was crowned UFC World Middleweight Champion and became the first British World Champion in UFC history. Other individual sports Other sports with loyal followings include snooker, which is popular with television companies as it fills swathes of their schedules at a very low cost, and also attracts a good number of viewers. However, its popularity has waned somewhat since 1985, when nearly a third of the British population watched the conclusion of the celebrated Dennis Taylor versus Steve Davis World Championship final even though it ended after midnight. Darts is another British-centred sport with an assured place in the attention of the English sporting public. Lawn Bowls is popular, particularly with the elderly. International competitions are often televised.  Commonwealth Games  Commonwealth Games England (CGE) is a sports governing body that leads and manages the participation of the England team at the Commonwealth Games. Major sports facilities In the early 20th century England had some of the largest sports facilities in the world, but the level of comfort and amenities they offered would be considered totally unacceptable by modern standards. After a long period of decline relative to other developed countries English facilities have made a relative improvement since the 1980s, and this is ongoing. National stadia * Twickenham (England rugby union team) has a capacity of 82,000 making it the largest stadium in the world devoted solely to the sport of rugby and it is the fifth largest stadium in Europe. * Wembley Stadium (England football team) The newly reconstructed Wembley has also been used by the Great Britain rugby league team, and for major club matches in rugby league. It can seat 90,000 people, second largest capacity in Europe. * Lord's Cricket Ground (England cricket team). Lord's is considered to be the spiritual 'home of Test Cricket' and is the home of the MCC. It has a seating capacity of 30,000 Club association football grounds English football grounds are almost always football-only facilities in which the spectators are close to the action. Since the late 1980s there has been a dramatic spurt of reconstruction and replacement of league grounds, which is ongoing, and the Premiership's facilities are among the best of any sports league. As of 2019, there are 36 all-seater club grounds in England with a capacity of 25,000 or more, and two in Scotland. The largest is Manchester United's Old Trafford, which has a capacity of approximately 75,000, plus 3 further club grounds with a capacity of greater than 60,000 (all in London). Cricket grounds English cricket grounds are smaller than the largest in some other countries, especially India and Australia, but the best of them have been modernised to a high standard, and two new international grounds have been built in recent years. The largest English cricket ground, Lord's in London, is internationally regarded as the \\"home of cricket\\". Other cricket stadiums in England include The Oval, Headingley Carnegie, Old Trafford Cricket Ground, Edgbaston and the Trent Bridge Ground. Club rugby grounds Rugby union and rugby league clubs are generally poorer than their cricket and football counterparts. Some clubs have good all seater grounds in the 10,000‚Äì25,000 capacity range; some have older grounds which are still partly terraced; and others play in council-owned joint-use stadia (e.g. the KC Stadium). Some clubs (mostly rugby union ones) rent stadia from football clubs. After the Rugby Football League stipulated that all Super League club stadia must meet minimum standards rugby league has seen a marked rise in the quality of the sports venues with many clubs re-locating to new purpose-built facilities or renovating their current grounds. Golf courses The Belfry in the English Midlands has hosted the Ryder Cup more times than any other site. Wentworth Club near London used to hold two European Tour events each season, but now hosts just one. Athletics stadiums The provision of athletics stadiums in England is very poor compared to most other developed countries. The main reason for this is that it is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track. This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds, which have not been forthcoming on a large scale. The largest athletics stadium built in the UK between the Second World War and the 2010s, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. The largest existing stadium then became the 25,000-seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. Prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics, London's largest athletics venue was Crystal Palace, which has just 15,500 permanent seats. It has since been superseded by the Olympic Stadium, now known as London Stadium, which was initially built as an 80,000-seater for the 2012 Olympics. The venue was reduced to 60,000 seats following the Games after the London organising committee accepted West Ham United's bid to take over the stadium. As part of the downsizing, movable seating was added to allow optimal configurations for both athletics and football. There are two Athletic stadiums in Birmingham, the Alexander Stadium (12,700 capacity) which is home to UK Athletics, and the National Indoor Arena (14,150) which is also used for other events. The Alexander Stadium is being expanded to a 40,000 capacity stadium in preparation for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, which are being hosted in Birmingham, with the Alexander Stadium as the main venue. Indoor arenas In England there is no indoor sport capable of attracting five-figure attendances on a regular basis, and this restricts the development of large indoor arenas. Nonetheless a number of 10,000+ seater arenas have been built in recent years and more are planned. These facilities make most of their income from pop concerts, but they occasionally stage boxing matches and other sporting events. The largest is the Manchester Evening News Arena in its eponymous city, with a capacity of over 20,000 for court events. The O2 in London (the former Millennium Dome), reopened in 2007, contains an arena that seats 17,500, but can be reconfigured to seat more than the MEN Arena and the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham which can seat 14,150. There are some specialist ice hockey and basketball arenas, but they only seat a few thousand spectators. External links *Learn about sport tournaments here! *Learn about english school sports here! Student sport The Boat Race Apart from a couple of Oxbridge events, student sport has a very low profile in England, however, the largest inter-university sports tournament in Europe, the Roses Tournament (often just called 'Roses') is contested between Lancaster University and the University of York annually. While universities have significant sports facilities, there is no system of sports scholarships. However, students who are elite standard competitors are eligible for funding from bodies such as UK Sport on the same basis as anyone else. The university most focused on sports provision is probably Loughborough University. Budding professionals in the traditionally working class team sports of football and rugby league rarely go to university. Talented youngsters in the more middle class sports of cricket and rugby union are far more likely to attend university, but their sports clubs usually play a greater role in developing their talent than their university coaches. Some sports are attempting to adapt to new conditions in which a far higher proportion of English teenagers attend university than in the past, notably cricket, which has established several university centres of excellence. School sport Sport is compulsory for all students up to the age of sixteen, but the amount of time devoted to it is often small and pupils often find fictitious excuses to avoid doing it. The leading body for physical education in the United Kingdom is the Association for Physical Education. Sportsmark is Sport England's accreditation scheme for secondary schools. The scheme recognises a school's out of hours sports provision. There are frequent complaints that state sector schools do too little to encourage sport and a healthy lifestyle. Since the 1980s it has become a clich√© to complain about sales of school playing fields for development. Sports culture is strong in independent schools in the United Kingdom, and these schools contribute disproportionately high numbers of competitors in sports which are traditionally considered 'elitist', such as cricket and rugby union. Participants of other sports, notably association football, rugby league, boxing and athletics, are much more likely to come from state schools. In addition to many of the sports already mentioned, popular sports at junior level include netball and rounders, both of which are played almost entirely by girls. However, in recent times schoolgirls have increasingly played sports which are traditionally male, especially football and cricket, but also others such as rugby.

It fields teams at all levels from U8 to Senior in Men's and Ladies Gaelic football, Hurling and Camogie. It had its previous pitch, Bredagh Park, taken off them in December 1998 but moved next door to Cherryvale Playing Fields, owned by the Belfast City Council. Bredagh is one of the few clubs in Down without a pitch to call its own but it is a flourishing and resurgent club benefiting from both a changing demographic in the Ballynafeigh area and from solid work at increased training at underage levels. In 2006, the footballers won the Down JFC and the Hurlers won Division 3 of the Ulster Club Hurling League. In 2007 the hurlers won the Down Junior Hurling Championship and Division 2 of the All County Hurling League - both for the first time. In 2008 they won Antrim League Division 4B. At underage level they won the Division 1 (14s) and Division 2 (16s)Down Hurling Championship at U14 and U16. The U14 Hurling team also won Division 1of the county league and the Division 1 Down Feile. They were also narrowly beaten in the final of the Division 2 All-Ireland Feile in Co.Clare. In 2010 the hurlers won the Down Intermediate Hurling Championship for the first time along with Antrim League Division 4A. In 2011 Bredagh Won The Down Junior Football Beating Dromara 4.10 To 0.09 in the final. 2011 also saw Bredagh Senior Hurlers compete in the Down Senior Hurling Championship for the first time in the history of the club. In 2012 Bredagh Senior Hurlers won the Down Junior Hurling Championship for the second time after re-structuring from the Down County Board saw them drop from Senior Championship to Junior. The Senior Hurlers made history in October 2012 when they won the Ulster Junior Club Hurling Championship for the first time in the club's history beating Na Magha of Derry 4-18 to 3-07 at Casement Park. The Senior Men's Footballers gained promotion to Down Division 2 in 2012. 2016 saw the Men's Footballers and men's hurlers both win their respective Intermediate Championships. The footballers achieved victory over An Riocht in Pairc Esler and the hurlers achieving victory over Ballycran in Newcastle. Also in 2016, the ladies footballers went on to win the Senior Championship wrh a victory over Castlewellen in Downpatrick.

It was amalgamated into the single Scottish Fire and Rescue Service in 2013.  Geographical Area  Tayside Fire and Rescue covers an area of 7,500 square kilometres, consisting predominantly of rural areas, but with urban centres in Dundee and Perth. The population of this area is 392,000 people. Within the service area there are two universities which increase the population of Dundee by approximately 23,000 for parts of the year. The economy has historically been based around journalism, manufacturing and sea- based industries. Whilst these are important, there has recently been an increase in research and development sectors. Tayside Fire and Rescue employs over 700 personnel. Of these 409 are operational wholetime firefighters, 236 are retained firefighters, and 24 volunteer firefighters. There are 21 members of the control room and 58 support staff. There are 24 stations located within the area. There are 4 wholetime stations, 2 wholetime/retained stations, and 15 are staffed through the retained duty system. There are also 3 stations that are staffed by volunteers. There is a fleet of 8 appliances, including urban search and rescue (USAR) equipment, and other specialist response and service delivery units and vehicles  History  On 16 May 1975, following local government reorganisation, Tayside Fire Brigade was formed from the Brigades of Angus, Perth & Kinross and Dundee. The new Brigade was now responsible for some 7,770 sq kilometres (3,000 sq miles) of area protecting a population in the region of 416,000. The Brigade was under the control of Tayside Regional Council until a further local government reorganisation in 1996, when it was placed back into the hands of Perth & Kinross, Angus and Dundee City Councils. A joint Fire Board made up of representatives from all councils was then formed to administer the Brigade. With the introduction of the Fire (Scotland) Act in 2005 and the additional responsibilities it contained, the Brigade changed its name to Tayside Fire and Rescue, to reflect the wider responsibility we now hold for rescue. From the days of tin helmets and horse-drawn fire pumps, the Fire and Rescue Service has grown and developed into a highly skilled and well equipped organisation which carries out, amongst others, the following duties: :* Community Fire Safety (Home Safety Checks. School Visits) :* Legislative Fire Safety (Offices, shops, hotels, care homes etc) :* Firefighting (From bonfires to buildings on fire) :* Mass Decontamination (After chemical spills or terrorist attacks) :* Road Traffic Emergencies (All types of vehicle collisions) :* Urban Search and Rescue (Rescue from collapsed structures) :* Hazardous Materials Incidents (Chemical spillages) :* Environmental Protection (Minimising pollution) :* Non‚ÄìFire Emergencies (Water incidents, persons trapped in machinery) =Amalgamation in 2013= Tayside Fire and Rescue Service, along with the other seven fire and rescue services across Scotland, was amalgamated into a single, new Scottish Fire and Rescue Service on 1 April 2013. This replaced the previous system of eight regional fire and rescue services across Scotland which existed since 1975. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has its headquarters in Perth.  Executive Command  Tayside Fire and Rescue was led by Chief Fire Officer Stephen Hunter and managed through two functional heads: Service Delivery and Service Support. Mr Hunter liaises closely with the members of the Tayside Fire and Rescue Board who are responsible for providing direction for the organisation. His vision to \\"To provide the highest standard of fire safety and emergency response services to the communities we serve\\" is communicated throughout the organisation using all avenues available from, newsletters, core briefs, breakfast with the Chief, intranet etc. Our Deputy Chief Fire Officer leads the Service Delivery business stream, overseeing Community Safety and Risk Management whilst driving forward the Prevention and Intervention Aims of the organisation. Service Delivery include the departments who interact frequently with the public providing them with an efficient emergency response and effective risk reduction advice. Our Assistant Chief Fire Officer leads the Service Support business stream, overseeing Technical Services, Corporate Services and Personnel Services, whilst driving forward the People and Performance Aims of the organisation. These departments provide the expertise and resources which allow the service delivery departments to meet the needs of the people in the Tayside area. The three members of the Executive Command and the five Heads of Departments form the policy making Management Team. The Management Team meet on a monthly basis when policy proposals are presented and debated before being introduced to the wider organisation Regional Fire and Rescue Services in Scotland 1975-2013 The following eight regional fire and rescue services (originally known as fire brigades) were merged on 1 April 2013, creating the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service: *Central Scotland Fire and Rescue Service *Dumfries and Galloway Fire and Rescue Service *Fife Fire and Rescue Service *Grampian Fire and Rescue Service *Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service *Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service *Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service *Tayside Fire and Rescue Service The same boundaries were also used for the eight territorial police forces, which were amalgamated into Police Scotland on 1 April 2013.

Founded in 1948, , it had revenues of nearly TL 13.7 billion. Listed on the Borsa Istanbul, its largest shareholders are members of the Sabancƒ± family. Akbank has ranked as \\"The Most Valuable Banking Brand in Turkey\\" according to the \\"Brand Finance - Banking 500, 2018\\" report for the seventh time in a row. Akbank also achieved significant success by ranking as the 126th most valuable banking brand in the report that comprises the most valuable global banking brands. History Akbank was founded in Adana, Turkey in January 1948, originally to provide financing for the cotton producers in the √áukurova region. As the majority of the bank founders were born in the city of Kayseri, the name \\"Adana-Kayseri Bankasƒ±\\" was chosen, soon to be shortened to its initials AK or Akbank. The founders were Hacƒ± √ñmer Sabancƒ±, the industrialist brothers Ahmet Sapmaz and Bekir Sapmaz and the four owners of the Adana textile business Milli Mensucat; Nuh Naci Yazgan, Nuri Has, Mustafa √ñzg√ºr and Seyit Tekin. This group had an 80% shareholding with the remaining 20% offered to investors in Adana and Istanbul. Opening with a single branch in a corner of Adana Akbank grew and developed quickly, opening its first branch in Istanbul in the district of Sirkeci on 14 July 1950, and moving its headquarters to Istanbul in 1954. The original founders ran the bank until 1962 when it was taken over by Sabancƒ± family. Rapidly increasing the number of its branches, Akbank automated all banking operations in 1963. In 1993, Akbank founded the Akbank Sanat art centre in Beyoƒülu, Istanbul. Akbank established Ak Securities in 1996, Ak Investment Fund in 1998, Ak Asset Management Company and its Private Banking Department in 2000. Akbank established Ak Pension Fund in 2003 and incorporated Ak Leasing in 2005. In February 2006, Ak Pension Fund was sold to the Aksigorta insurance company.

As of 31 December 2010, Akbank reported a consolidated net profit of TRY 3,010 million (US$1,958 million) and total consolidated assets of TRY 120,070 million (US$78,089 million). The consolidated capital adequacy ratio of Akbank, standing at approx 20% is among the highest ratios achieved in the sector. In 2010, Akbank continued to raise funds from international markets with a total of such resources reaching US$8,0 million by the end of the year. In 2013, Citigroup sold a 10.1 percent% stake in Akbank as part of a move to prepare for the Basel III rule and technical reasons related to Citibank. Following this transaction, Citigroup‚Äôs stake in Akbank was 9.9% but on 5 March 2015 Citi announced it was selling its remaining shares for $1.15 billion.

Brodie has toured extensively in the US, UK, Scandinavia, France, Germany, Switzerland and Spain, and he has performed at iconic venues such as CBGBs in New York, The Exit/In in Nashville, The Continental in Austin and The Olympia in Paris. He has a reputation as a formidable live performer with acclaimed festival appearances at Splendour in the Grass, Homebake, Big Day Out, Byron Bay Bluesfest, SXSW, Darnius Festival in Spain and the Binic Folk Blues festival in France. In addition to releasing his own albums, Brodie's songs have been recorded by other artists including two songs on Love Is Mighty Close, a Vika and Linda Bull Album. Also in 2010 Brodie appeared on the Paul Kelly produced Maurice Frawley tribute album, Long Gone Whistle ‚Äì The Songs of Maurice Frawley, performing the Frawley track, \\"Roll me\\" to a sold out audience at the Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda. Early life Born in Melbourne, Australia, Brodie was raised in a musical family, his father, a professional guitarist and singer taught Brodie the basic chords of guitar. With his brother Chris Brodie (Dallas Crane), they began playing in bands together, honing their skills of playing live to audiences around the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne before landing their first pub show whilst still in their early teens at the Richmond Club Hotel in 1990. Over the next five years, Brodie performed around Melbourne, recording his first proper Album in a student run studio at Monash University in Clayton in 1993, released on tape and sold at live shows. After a move to the inner-city in 1996, Brodie joined dirty swamp rockers, Luxedo, on bass, the line-up also including Tom Carlyon (Devastations, Standish /Carlyon, Time for Dreams) on lead guitar and vocals, Emilie Martin on violin and guitar and Jamie Coghill (The Jimmy C, The Devilrock Four) on drums, contributing to the debut LP, \\"Beauty Queen\\" and the follow up, \\"City Lights and Roadkill\\", departing in 2001 to concentrate on his solo career. Career=I'm Floatin' Mamma EP and Big Black Guitar A five track EP, I'm Floatin' Mamma was independently released in 1998; followed by debut album, Big Black Guitar in 1999. Backed by The Broken Arrows which featured his brother Chris Brodie on slide guitar, Craig Williamson (These Immortal Souls) on drums and Dan Kelly on bass, Brodie signed to EMI who re- released his debut album. Both the EP and debut album were produced by Maurice Frawley and engineered by Dave McCluney at Atlantis Studios in Melbourne.  Make Me Wanna Kill EP  In 2001, Brodie released a four track EP featuring songs recorded for his forthcoming unreleased Album, as well as some from earlier demos. \\"You make me wanna kill\\" (not included on the full length Album) was the single and a filmclip was shot in Brisbane, Australia casting Brodie as a modern day Romeo, serenading his love interest from below her window whilst she showered him (and the band) with all of his belongings. Empty Arms, Broken Hearts Brodie's second album, Empty Arms, Broken Hearts was issued in 2002 and featured vocals by You Am I's Tim Rogers, and bass by Stu Thomas (Kim Salmon & The Surrealists, Dave Graney). Containing the singles \\"Jesus, Try And Save Me\\", \\"Take A Bullet\\", and \\"Hope that we get home tonight\\", the album scored Brodie two ARIA Award nominations for Best Male and Breakthrough Artist. The album was engineered by Oz Fritz (Tom Waits) and produced by John Wooler (Iggy Pop, John Lee Hooker). In the same period, Brodie sign with French label, \\"Last Call Records\\" and tour extensively throughout France, U.K. and the U.S. Beautiful Crimes A critically acclaimed 'solo' album entitled Beautiful Crimes was released in 2005 that veered away from country into a more indie rock sound and was produced by Barry Palmer of Hunters and Collectors, releasing the two radio friendly power-pop rock anthems, \\"Wanna Shine\\" and \\"Sweetheart\\". That year also marked a triumphant return to the Big Day Out with a band formed especially for the occasion with Gareth Liddiard (The Drones, Tropical Fuck Storm) on bass, Chriso Strybosch (The Drones) on drums and Chris Brodie (Dallas Crane) on guitar. My Friend The Murderer Taking an extended break from touring with a band, Brodie spent several months playing solo shows in New York City and Austin, Texas and also travelling to Buenos Aires, Argentina and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, returning to Australia to record the independently released, My Friend The Murderer (2011). Spanning eleven tracks, the album was recorded at Headgap Studios in Melbourne, Australia by Brent \\"Sloth\\" Punshon (Adalita) and for the first time showed off Brodie's newly formed backing band, the Grieving Widows, featuring Chris Brodie (Dallas Crane/Broken Arrows) on bass and Dave Nicholls (Ian Rilen/Spencer P Jones) on drums. The Album heralded a very stripped back sound for Brodie, the sparseness allowing for the lyrics to come through strongly, in what would prove a dark meditation on the underbelly of Australian society, exploring themes of violence, domestic abuse, mental illness and suicide. \\"The sum effect is not unlike \\"Beat 'Em Up\\", the bottom- heavy, '90s Iggy Pop album that threatened to rip itself a new arsehole. Unlike that record, \\"My Friend...\\" leaves enough light to shine a pinpoint through the dark. And yes, it took a French label to put it out on deliciously thick vinyl. (The Barman, 1-94 BAR) The release of My Friend The Murderer led to a renewed interest in Europe and in 2011, Brodie signed with Beast Records in France, completing a successful 25 date European tour the following year with the Grieving Widows and bringing a whole host of new fans to his music. Deep Deep Love Brodie completed work on his fifth \\"solo\\" LP, Deep Deep Love in 2012 before a diagnosis of Hodgkins Lymphoma and subsequent treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy sidelined him for most of 2013, delaying the record release but making the single and video, Tear us down; shot and directed in one take by Dallas Crane's Dave Larkin. Deep Deep Love features minimalist backing of double bass by Dean Schulz (Suzannah Espie) Layla and Rhianna Fibbins (Sideshow Brides) on backing vocals and Grieving Widow's alumni Chris Brodie and David Nicholls on guitar and drums respectively. Run Yourself Ragged EP In June 2014, Brodie entered St Charles Recording Studio in Northcote with the Grieving Widows to record a song from their live set; a cover of Ian Rilen‚Äôs (Rose Tattoo/Love Addicts) \\"Booze to Blame\\". Three more songs of original material quickly followed, and the RUN YOURSELF RAGGED EP was borne, with a guest appearance by Spencer P Jones on the title track. A video was made for the single, \\"Booze to Blame\\" and directed by Daniel Cheek. The clip was shot on Sunday 21 September on famed inner-city booze strip, Smith St, Collingwood and follows an early morning walk-of-shame home after a big night out, and starred ten year old Hemi Dietrich as the narrator/singer. In August 2014, Brodie was invited along with Paul Kelly, Adalita and Gareth Liddiard, to take part in the \\"Living Legends Series\\" as part of the Leaps and Bounds Music Festival, honoring both Spencer P. Jones and Charlie Owen on separate nights at the Tote. Big Hearted Lovin Man: A Retrospective 1999-2014 In March 2015, Brodie released the solo acoustic sixteen track compilation, Big Hearted Lovin Man: A Retrospective 1999-2014 Recorded and mixed by acclaimed studio engineer Glen Hewer over one night in January, 2015 at Salt Studios in Melbourne, the album (awarded 4 out of 5 stars in The Age Eg) draws from Brodie‚Äôs early solo work, the twangin alt-country of the Broken Arrows through to his current incarnation in the Grieving Widows. \\"We set up a stool and a microphone on the Saturday afternoon and I proceeded to rummage through my back catalogue and recorded 20 songs straight to tape, allowing for two takes of each song, and choosing the best version - by the end of the night we had an Award winning album!\\" In April 2015, Brodie embarked on a three-month solo acoustic tour of Europe playing back to back shows at France‚Äôs famed Cinema Utopia (presenting Ted Kotcheff's Aussie cult classic film \\"Wake in Fright\\"), a three star Michelin restaurant, a dive bar in the Basque country, a Record Fair, a bookstore and finishing up with a sold out show in Paris. 2016 saw Brodie perform at the Gumball Festival in the Hunter Valley, NSW with James Thomson & The Strange Pilgrims as his backing band. After the success of their collaboration, they completed an East Coast tour of Australia called, \\"From Melbourne to Maitland\\" beginning at The Tote in Melbourne and finishing at The Junkyard in Maitland, NSW. In September of that year, Brodie embarked on another three month European Tour, \\"Booze to Blame\\", as Dan Brodie & The Grieving Widows, comprising highly regarded French musicians, Vinz Guilly (bass), Thomas Legroud (guitar) and Dav Rock (drums) playing both band and solo shows across France, Spain and Portugal.  Lost Not Found  In early 2017, Brodie returned to Melbourne to record Lost Not Found a collection of reinterpreted cover songs featuring songs by Dylan, Iggy Pop, Prince and Motorhead. The Album was well received garnering five stars from Off The Tracks' Simon Sweetman who proclaimed the record \\"a Sunday hangover for any day of the week, a loner‚Äôs gem, a startling set of back-alley takes on established classics; new life breathing in through the bones of these songs, the flesh exposed, the spirit soaked in new bar-room spirits no doubt, but something wonderful has happened here.\\" '' Chris Familton from Alt- Country bible, Post to Wire also gushed - \\"The source material here includes numerous titans of the music world...plus a trio of Brodie‚Äôs own compositions that easily hold their place amid such defining artists. Invariably Brodie invests the covers with a brooding, gothic country pall, taking them into the shadows and finding their dark corners.\\" ''''' Later in the year Brodie once more returned to Europe to perform across France, Spain, Scandinavia and Switzerland, completing the tour at Paris' legendary (and now defunct) rock n roll club, Le Feline. Whilst in Paris, a filmclip was shot for an original Brodie composition off the Album, \\"Words of a Drunken Man\\" at the famed Conservatoire Municipal Gabriel Faure Directed by Fr√©d√©ric Lema√Ætre, it portrayed an intimate portrait of Brodie alone with his piano in an empty auditorium and was nominated for numerous international film awards. In 2018, Lost Not Found was released on 12\\" Vinyl with a re-ordered tracklisting and brand new Cover Art by acclaimed Sydney artist, Jimmy Meek. Funer√°ria do Vale Funer√°ria do Vale was released on August 30, 2019 and is Brodie's 8th full length album. The Album cover and title are taken from a photo that Brodie took of a funeral home in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil during a six month stay in 2007. ‚ÄúI found the imagery so evocative (with its English translation of ‚ÄòValley of the Funeral Home‚Äô), and always hoped to use it as an Album cover. In a way I wrote the songs to fit the existing photograph, exploring themes of loss.‚Äù Recorded at Shrimp Shack Studios in Melbourne by Award- winning producer and multi-instrumentalist, Mic Hubbard (Spencer P Jones, Eagle and the Worm), Funer√°ria do Vale showcases Brodie‚Äôs musical influences to date; at times tender and haunting, at other times loose and spirited. A video for the single Un deux trois saucisson! was made in late January and filmed on location at Elwood Beach, Melbourne. Funer√°ria do Vale contains 10 new Brodie originals and follows on from his 2017 cover's collection, Lost Not Found. The Album features Danielle Golding (Jacky Winter) on opener, \\"When we turn to dust\\", \\"Drugs have gone\\" and \\"My Fallen Star\\", Chris Brodie (Dallas Crane, Dan Brodie & The Broken Arrows) on \\"You had me at hello\\" and \\"On the Outer\\", Mic Hubbard on bass and additional instrumentation and Molly Jean Morrison (The Level Spirits) on the honkytonkin' tribute to hedonism, \\"Getting fucked up again\\".

It was shown in 1983 at the London Film Festival and on Channel 4 and at the 1984 Berlin International Film Festival. According to the critic Michael Coveney: \\"The sapping, debilitating and demeaning state of unemployment, the futile sense of waste, has not been more poignantly, or poetically, expressed in any other film of the period.\\"Michael Coveney, The World according to Mike Leigh, p.174 Plot The film unfolds in brief episodes, detailing the travails of the working- class Pollock family, who live in a shabby flat in a tower block in London's East End. They are struggling to stay afloat during the recession under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's premiership. Only the nagging, put-upon mother Mavis (Pam Ferris) is working; the bitter, feckless father Frank (Jeff Robert) and the couple's two sons Colin (Tim Roth), an extremely shy young man, and Mark (Phil Daniels), his outspoken, headstrong older brother, are on the dole. Their aimless, querulous existence is contrasted with Mavis's sister Barbara (Marion Bailey) and her husband John (Alfred Molina), whose financial and social loftiness in suburban Chigwell serves as a comfortable facade for their lacklustre marriage. The boys spend their time at home, on the street, at friends' flats, in the unemployment office, and at the local pub. Mark is continually scrounging for cash and cadging drinks from his friends, among them Coxy (Gary Oldman in his screen debut), a crude, impulsive skinhead. Colin has a crush on a sweet-natured girl named Hayley (Tilly Vosburgh), but he can't bring himself to act upon it. Mark mocks his father, teases Colin by calling him \\"Kermit\\" and \\"Muppet,\\" and makes insinuations about Barbara's troubled relationship with her husband. Barbara offers Colin a job helping her redecorate her home, but when Mark shows up, Colin withdraws, refuses to do any work, and finally leaves. When he returns home, he's had his head shaved. There is no resolution to the film, simply a succession of days that present commonplace problems, amusements, conversations, and arguments.

Palmer's work in translating the Philokalia, an Eastern Orthodox spiritual text, is still recognised in modern times with the popularity of that book. Eastern Orthodox writings Palmer helped translate several Eastern Orthodox spiritual texts, the most notable being the Philokalia, a collaboration with Kallistos Ware and Philip Sherrard. They made available for the first time, in English, the bulk of that Eastern Orthodox text on the hesychasm tradition. He also translated for English readers a book on Greek poetry, The Marble Threshing Floor (1956), a study of Dionysios Solomos, Costis Palamas, Constantin Cavafis, Angelos Sikelianos, and Giorgos Seferis.Patrick Comerford. \\"Stratis the Mariner finds landfall in English George Seferis: Complete Poems, ed. Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard, Anvil Press, 296pp, 9.95 in UK.\\" The Irish Times. The Irish Times. 1995. HighBeam Research. 6 Sep 2012 . Palmer's attraction to Eastern Orthodox teachings caused him to go on a pilgrimage in 1948 to Mount Athos, Greece, the center of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and inner spirituality. A chance meeting upon his arrival at Mt. Athos resulted in a meeting with a Fr. Nikon, who became Palmer's spiritual father, or starets in the Eastern Orthodox tradition. By 1950, Palmer officially joined the Orthodox Church. Palmer first translated, with Evgeniia Kadloubovsky, two small volumes of the Philokalia from the Russian. The publisher Faber and Faber was reluctant to publish such an obscure book, but one of their directors, T. S. Eliot, convinced them to do so based on his own deep impression of the spiritual teachings in that book. Faber and Faber finally relented, expecting to lose money, but instead found that it was a commercial success. In 1971, Palmer invited Ware and Sherrard to join him in a more complete translation of the Philokalia from the original Greek. Before Palmer's death in 1984, they were able to translate and publish four of the five volumes of the Philokalia. Palmer made almost yearly pilgrimages to Mt. Athos. He wrote an article on his journeys titled The Paths of Athos, published in Eastern Churches Review in 1977. Political career He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Winchester from 1935 until his defeat at the 1945 general election by the Labour candidate George Jeger. He also played cricket for Berkshire in the Minor Counties Championship from 1925 to 1930. After losing his seat in parliament in the 1945 election, Palmer travelled to Mount Athos, which led to a deepening interest in Greek Orthodoxy. He spent much of the rest of his life working on translations of key Orthodox texts. Committees Palmer served on the Council of Reading University from 1936 who awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) in 1957 before becoming its president in 1966. He was a Forestry Commissioner between 1963 and 1965.

It stars Jai, Shiva, Premji, Aravind Akash, Nithin Sathya and newcomers Ajay Raj, Ranjith, Vijay Vasanth, Prasanna, Inigo Prabakaran, Karthik and Arun in the lead along with Vijayalakshmi and Kristine Zedek, making their acting debut as well. The film was produced by S. P. B. Charan along with J. K. Saravana, a Singapore-based award-winning producer. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Premji Amaran and Yuvan Shankar Raja and also Illayaraja respectively. The film is based on street cricket played in India, focussing on various themes as friendship, love and rivalry in a suburban area. Following its theatrical release on 27 April 2007, it received critical acclaim and emerged a surprise sleeper hit, running successfully for more than one year in theaters, whilst going on to achieve cult status in the subsequent years. The film's title is derived from the pincode for Mandaveli, a suburb of Chennai, where the story takes place. The success of the film gained the relatively unknown actors -- Jai, Shiva, Premji and Nithin Sathya, newcomers Vijayalakshmi, Vijay Vasanth and the director Venkat Prabhu popularity. Upon release, the film was dubbed into Telugu and released as Kodithe Kottalira. The film was also remade in Bengali as Le Chakka (2010), Sinhalese as Super Six (2012), and in Kannada as Bangalore 560023 (2015). A sequel for the film, Chennai 600028 II: Second Innings, has also since been released. Plot The story revolves around two local cricket league teams that compete against each other in local matches and consider each other as sworn enemies. Royapuram Rockers are on top of the chain and keep bashing the Sharks year after year. The heroes of the movie are the Sharks' team. The story begins when Raghu's (Jai) parents move from Royapuram to Visalakshi Thottam, Chennai 600 028. Raghu is a member of the Royapuram Rockers Cricket team, and a college student living with his parents. He has no choice but to move with them although he detests the area. He is not very excited at the prospect of living in the same area as his sworn enemies. Raghu is faithful to his teammates, but they ignore him because of the distance. Angered at being replaced by a new guy in the team in one of the matches, Raghu estranges himself from cricket and the Rockers. Raghu informs of Pazhani's (Nithin Sathya) sister Selvi's (Vijayalakshmi) love for Karthik (Shiva) to him. This incident initiates Raghu's friendship with a few Sharks team players and eventually gets induced into the team. Raghu practices with the Sharks to play against the Rockers in the upcoming Radio Mirchi trophy. Pazhani, who soon comes to know of his sister's and Karthik's love affair is disappointed and then there is a tiff amongst the friends. The team splits up for a while, but Karthik apologizes to Pazhani and they make up. The team is united again and they start practicing for the trophy once again. Unfortunately, Karthik gets stabbed by his brother's enemies and is rendered unfit to play the match. Pazhani replaces Karthik as the captain and the team heads for the match. Under tight pressure and with a nail biting finish, the Sharks finally defeat the Rockers in the semi-finals of the tournament. In the finals they meet their enemies , a bunch of school kids named Bad Boys-II who practice by bunking school to play cricket on the beach. The kids are really good and the Sharks know it because they have lost to them once before and that too very badly... The movie ends with the team really struggling to keep it up in the game.

He initially titled the film as Enga Area Ulla Varaadha (Don't come into our territory), but lyricist Vaali was critical of the idea, feeling that the title was \\"negative\\" sounding. Subsequently, the film was renamed as Chennai 600028, with the idea of including the area's postcode taken from the title of the American television series Beverly Hills, 90210. Venkat Prabhu felt the new title was \\"more apt and universal\\". Soundtrack The film's score was composed by Venkat Prabhu's brother, Premji Amaran, while his cousin, Yuvan Shankar Raja composed the soundtrack, which also featured two tracks that were rearranged by Premji. The soundtrack album, featuring 9 tracks, released on 19 February 2007 in India and four days later in Singapore and Malaysia, on 23 February 2007. The audio was launched at the radio station Radio Mirchi, broadcasting all the songs live, which was said to be the first time in India. The lyrics were written by 'Kavignar' Vaali and Gangai Amaran, father of Venkat Prabhu. Also, composer Yuvan Shankar Raja penned the lyrics for the song \\"Natpukullae\\", besides singing it. 19 singers had rendered their voice for the songs, including Yogi B, DJ Funky Sathiya and SilveStar, two Singaporean rappers, actor Karunas, director Venkat Prabhu and producer S. P. B. Charan. The album was both critically acclaimed and gained immense popularity upon its release, being described as, \\"excellent\\", a \\"rocking album\\" and one of the \\"aesthetic highlights\\" of the film. The songs were said to be a big hit as reportedly 25000 CDs were sold on the very first day, \\"ruling the charts\\" worldwide. The songs \\"Jalsa\\" and \\"Saroja Saman Nikalo\\" were \\"rocking the dance floors\\".  Release and reception  Chennai 600028 was released on 27 April 2007, and emerged as a major commercial success. Sify in their review stated that \\"All the guys who acted in the film are candid and have let their hair down. RJ Shiva is the surprise packet in the film. Venkat Prabhu deserves a pat on his back for making a breezy fun movie which highlights the fact that cricket in India which is a religion for many is also won through team spirit and sacrifice. So go ahead, make your matinee and enjoy the match.\\" Filmibeat reviewed it as \\"Apart from cricket there is enough space for love, friendship, sentiments and decent comedy in the script.\\" Baradwaj Rangan reviewed the film as \\"A street-cricket saga from a bunch of no-names comes out of nowhere and knocks your socks off.\\" Writing for Rediff, the review stated as \\"The movie is a result of a perfect team effort in every sense. A perfect entertainer, not to be missed.\\" The film emerged as a sleeper hit at the box office, and also emerging as the cult status, in coming years. The film's 100th day celebrations, took place on 5 August 2007 at Chennai Trade Centre, with Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan being the chief guest.

W. J. Thiersch, was a German philologist, initially a Protestant theologian, then minister in the short-lived Catholic Apostolic Church. Early life Thiersch was born in Munich, the son of well-known classicist Friedrich Thiersch, and brother of surgeon Karl Thiersch and painter Ludwig Thiersch. He studied philology at the University of Munich from 1833 to 1835, primarily under his father but also under Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Joseph G√∂rres. He switched to theology and moved to the University of Erlangen, where from 1835 to 1837 he studied under Hermann Olshausen and Gottlieb von Harless, and then to the University of T√ºbingen from 1837 to 1838, ending with a degree in theology. He was a lecturer at Erlangen from 1839, and then professor of theology at the University of Marburg from 1843. Among his early work, his 1841 monograph De Pentateuchi Versione Alexandrine (The Pentateuch Versions of Alexandria) is credited with being among the first to point out the importance of recently discovered papyri for research on the Septuagint. Conversion to the Catholic Apostolic Church As early as 1836, Thiersch had become interested in the Catholic Apostolic Church (\\"Irvingism\\"). In 1847 he converted, and in 1850 resigned his professorship to dedicate himself as a minister in that church. He lived in various cities ministering to the scattered Irvingite congregation, including Marburg, Munich, Augsburg, and Basel. He was a lecturer at Marburg from 1853 to 1858, but otherwise held no permanent positions in his later life due to his religious heterodoxy. The 1911 New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge described his life following conversion as follows: > Thiersch was a man of sincere and profound piety, of rare classical, > theological, and general culture, an enthusiastic teacher, and might have > become the successor of Neander in Berlin; but, in obedience to what he > believed to be a divine call, he sacrificed a brilliant academic career to > his religious convictions. He lived in poverty and isolation. He was lame; > but had a very striking, highly intellectual and spiritual countenance, and > an impressive voice and manner. He was the most distinguished German convert > to Irvingism. He sincerely believed that the Lord had restored the apostolic > office and the prophetic gifts of the Apostolic Church in the Irvingite > community; and, notwithstanding the apparent failure of the movement, he > adhered to it till his death.

Modern Treaty Law and Practice (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 9. Each party owes the same obligations to all other parties, except to the extent that they have stated reservations. Examples of multilateral treaties include the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Geneva Conventions, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Relationship to bilateral treaties A bilateral treaty is a treaty between two states. A bilateral treaty may become a multilateral treaty when additional new parties succeed or accede to it. Plurilateral treaties A plurilateral treaty is a special type of multilateral treaty. A plurilateral treaty is a treaty between a limited number of states with a particular interest in the subject of the treaty.Anthony Aust (2000). Modern Treaty Law and Practice (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 112. The primary difference between a plurilateral treaty and other multilateral treaties is that the availability of reservations is more limited under a plurilateral treaty. Due to the limited nature of a plurilateral treaty, the full cooperation of the parties to the treaty is required in order for the object of the treaty to be met. As a result, reservations to plurilateral treaties are not allowed without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. This principle is codified in international law by article 20(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: > When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating states and the > object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its > entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of > each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all > the parties.Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, (1969) 1155 U.N.T.S. > 331 (in force 1980).

The Bolshoy Obukhovsky Bridge, the only non-bascule bridge over the Neva River among the bridges of Saint Petersburg The Saint Petersburg Ring Road is a 142 km (88 mile) orbital freeway encircling Saint Petersburg, Russia. The city's only beltway, it is listed in the Russian road numbering system as federal public highway A-118. Construction The need for the construction of a beltway around St Petersburg was first stated in the 1965 General Development Plan of Leningrad. The western segment of the road was planned to be constructed as a causeway forming part of a proposed flood- protection dam in the Gulf of Finland. In late 1979, construction of the dam facilities commenced and by the early 1990s a two-lane road connected the northern shore of the Gulf of Finland with the city of Kronstadt on Kotlin Island. However, lack of financing in the midst of economic turmoil in Russia halted further development of both the dam and the Ring Road project in 1992. Construction of the Ring Road was resumed in 1998. The first freeway section of the Ring Road ‚Äì connecting the northern end of the dam, near Gorskaya railway station, with the northern outskirts of St Petersburg in Vyborgsky District ‚Äì was opened on 26 December 2002. By September 2006, freeway segments of the Ring Road completed the eastern bypass around St Petersburg with grade- separated junctions with the E-18/A-181 route in the northern segment, E-105/R-21 route in the eastern segment, and E-105/M-10 route in the southern segment of the road. The completed part of the Ring Road included the cable- stayed Bolshoy Obukhovsky Bridge, the only non-bascule bridge across the main branch of the Neva River. An interchange junction near the international Pulkovo Airport was opened in November 2007. By this time, construction of the Ring Road was resulting in a significant boost in land values in the vicinity of the highway and its interchanges. The south-western and western sections of the Ring Road, including the dam facilities and the intersection with the E-20/A-180 route, were gradually constructed throughout the late 2000s. The six-lane causeway across the Gulf of Finland includes bridges, trestles, man- made islands, and a tunnel under the main shipping channel. After more than two decades of construction, the completed Ring Road was officially opened on 12 August 2011 by the Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, and the Governor of St Petersburg, Valentina Matvienko, who inaugurated the dam facilities. The St. Petersburg Ring Road was notorious for the delays and budget overspending during its construction.

Early life  William was born William McConkey in Worcester, Massachusetts to Alexander and Margaret McConkey.Rice, Franklin; Worcester Births, Marriages, and Deaths, Worcester Society of Antiquity: 1894, p. 172. William moved to Pelham about 1740, settling in the eastern section of town (that later became part of the town of Prescott, one of four towns lost to make way for the giant Quabbin Reservoir). About 1743, he dropped the \\"Mc\\" from his name, appearing in records from that time as \\"Conkey\\", as did all others of that surname in the area. That same year, he was elected hogreeve, followed by public service as surveyor of highways, Fence Viewer, and Selectman.  Founding of Conkey's Tavern  William founded Conkey's Tavern in 1758Parmenter, C.O.; History of Pelham, Mass. From 1738 to 1898, Amherst: 1898, pp. 483-485. in a frontier village amidst the French and Indian War. He built the first tavern in Pelham in a remote location, one- half-mile (1 km) from any other building. Town records show licenses to be an Innholder, Retailer, and common Victual being issued beginning on 25 August 1772, putting a legal stamp on on-going activities. In 1769, tavern records show him paying ¬£1 for 1,000 nails, and in 1776 the town paid him ¬£1 for conveying provisions to Revolutionary soldiers in Watertown, some 80 miles (128 km) away. With his death in 1788, the tavern continued under his son William's management. William Jr. continued the jack-of-all-trades tradition as innkeeper, shoemaker, butcher, lumberman, and school committee member. Conkey's Tavern, located in a valley of Pelham, Massachusetts, had an vital role, not only in Massachusetts history, but also in the history of the whole country. It is famous as the home base of Shays' Rebellion, a post-Colonial uprising that greatly affected the final form of the US Constitution and the decision to authorize a strong central government. The rebellion-related discussions that happened within the tavern setting give some insight as to whether colonial taverns were typically places to momentarily escape life's cares or instead were places of informed, sophisticated debate, or both. Say \\"tavern\\" and \\"popular revolt\\" and the easily summoned image is an inebriated, overwrought rabble. A little study reveals that image to be false. > \\"‚Ä¶the selectmen were Pelham‚Äôs chief administrative officers, with a host of > responsibilities‚Ä¶They had been given these responsibilities earlier than > spring by the annual town meeting. In fact, however, they had been selected > well before the annual meeting. Men met usually every year, at conkey's > Tavern and other Pelham watering holes,and discussed who was the best one to > run the town . Here most of the politicking took place, and here was where > basic decisions were usually made. The annual town meeting, in most > instances, just ratified the results‚Ä¶. Virtually every town in western > Massachusetts had a similar setup.\\"Richards, Leonard L.; Shays's Rebellion: > The American Revolution's Final Battle, Philadelphia: 2002, p. 5. William Conkey's customers were, more often than not, his Scotch-Irish neighbors from the hardscrabble hills and hollows of Pelham. Most of these families emigrated from the English-imposed hardships of Ireland in 1718, settling in the frontier town of Worcester. The English Puritans and Congregationalists of Worcester, over the next two decades, burned the Presbyterian church, rioted, and otherwise made life uncomfortable, so that dozens of Scotch-Irish families after 1738 moved en masse to their own new community some 45 miles (72 km) farther west. The rock-strewn hills were good for lumbering and grazing, but not much else. Townsfolk did not include any idle rich or privileged gentry. Scotch-Irish families often functioned, willingly or not, as isolated picket lines when Native American war parties were on the move, as depicted in Last of the Mohicans. Certainly, Pelham residents were on the ramparts 160 miles (256 km) west at the siege of Fort William Henry and in other campaigns, just as they would later march 80 miles (128 km) to Concord, Lexington, and Bunker Hill whenever an alarm was sounded. So when Landlord Conkey served up the rum, brandy, and wine from his cellar, those raising a tankard were often hard and wary veterans. While popular accounts of Shays' Rebellion emphasize impoverished, debt-ridden farmers desperately trying to stave off foreclosures, the issues that animated the discussions and informed the petitions crafted within the tavern were much more sophisticated. Many issues led to Shays' Rebellion, but two stand out as tavern fare. With the Revolutionary War won, states began the process of writing and ratifying their own constitutions. The wealthy eastern interests in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts maneuvered adroitly to concentrate political power in their own hands while spreading the burden of taxation as regressively as they could among the common folk. The subsistence farmers of western counties comprehended, organized, and petitioned to champion concepts like \\"no taxation without representation\\" to throw off \\"destructive and tyrannical government\\". States had paid for Revolutionary War soldiers with paper notes, which veterans soon learned were worth maybe a tenth of their face value. Speculators bought the notes for pennies from de-mobilized soldiers who had to buy nails and seed in the tough economic times following the war. The speculators then convinced their friends in new state governments, controlled by like-minded merchants and bankers, to redeem the full face value of the notes. How? By taking out government debt to be repaid, of course, by higher poll and property taxes on the same average farmers and artisans of the hill towns who sold the worthless paper to the speculators in the first place. \\"Not only was the tax bite going to be heavy, then, it was biased against farm families with grown sons, and the chief beneficiaries were to be Boston speculators.\\"Richards, p.83 The speculators ultimately succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, but not without the patrons of Conkey's Tavern understanding exactly what was going on and organizing to protest these get- rich-at-our-expense schemes. Had the patrons not proclaimed themselves \\"regulators\\" in pursuit of a more representative and equitable government and taken up arms to force the issue, the Constitutional Convention and George Washington in particular would not have been swayed by the speculators' public relations scare tactics. The draft constitution would not have been quickly re-written to bring in strong central government and a standing army. A loosely federated United States, half slave owning and half not, would have had a very different history. The tavern went out of business when William Conkey, Jr. died in 1841, and the abandoned building eventually was destroyed in the 1880s. The American Museum in Bath, England bought up everything having to do with Conkey's Tavern. The museum faithfully and superbly recreated the interior main room, using the original massive stone fireplace lintel, with the neatly chiseled inscription \\"William Conkey June Ye 21st AD 1776\\". Scores of tourists tramp through the simulated tavern daily, sampling gingerbread and pausing for warmth at the well-maintained fire.

It was founded at the instigation of Mr. John Rye, a philanthropic retired medical man of Bath, Somerset and his servant Mr. Charles Gee Jones, born in Weston-super-Mare , a former Bristol pilot and landlord of the Pulteney Arms in Bath, following the tragic loss of life from the Clovelly fishing fleet in a severe storm in November 1838. Aided by Sir Jahleel Brenton, at that time governor of Greenwich Hospital, Mr. Rye succeeded in establishing the Society, and of collecting a respectable sum as a first subscription, initially by going from house to house in Bath collecting half crowns.The British Almanac - Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain) 1913 The portrait (below) of Mr. Rye and Mr. Gee Jones was painted to commemorate the founding of the Society, which now hangs in the boardroom of the Society's Headquarters in Chichester. John Rye (left) and Charles Gee Jones shown discussing the shipwreck tragedy which led to the founding of the Society. The Society's first President was Admiral Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet, who in the War of 1812 cruised Chesapeake Bay and captured and burnt Washington on 24 August 1814. The Society's first patron was Queen Victoria and it has had a royal patron ever since; today it is the Princess Royal. One of its first Vice-Presidents was Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Bt. The Society was incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1850. The Society's flag, a St George's cross with the letters SFMS in the quadrants and a number, was displayed by ships and their position reported by the coastguard to the Shipping and Mercantile Gazette in London. From 1851 until 1854 it operated lifeboats at Lytham, Rhyl, Portmadoc, Tenby, Llanelly, Teignmouth, Hornsea and Newhaven but it was subsequently agreed that it would be wiser if one organisation concentrated on rescuing lives at sea while the other helped the survivors or their bereaved families ashore, so in 1854 the Society transferred its lifeboats to the RNLI. The Society, which operates through a national network of volunteers known as Honorary Agents, deals with over 2,000 cases of need a year and is based in Chichester, West Sussex. The Society hold an annual photography competition, to raise awareness of its charity work.

It is an agreement made by negotiations between two parties, established in writing and signed by representatives of the parties. Treaties can span in substance and complexity, regarding a wide variety of matters, such as territorial boundaries, trade and commerce, political alliances, and more. The agreement is usually then ratifed by the lawmaking authority of each party or organization. Any agreement with more than two parties is a multilateral treaty. Similar to a contract, it is also called a contractual treaty. As with any other treaty, it is a written agreement that is typically formal and binding in nature.  Involved Parties  These two parties can be two nations, or two international organizations, or one nation and one international organization, or two persons. It is possible for a bilateral treaty to involve more than two parties; for example, each of the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) has seventeen parties. The parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss (\\"on the one part\\") and the EU and its member states (\\"on the other part\\"). The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally‚Äîit does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states.Keiser, Andreas (30 November 2012). \\"Swiss still prefer bilateral accords with EU\\". Swissinfo. Retrieved 9 February2013. When the two parties in a bilateral treaty are two countries bound in an international agreement, they are generally referred to as \\"state parties\\". The nature of an agreement between two state parties is subject to rules dictated by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. An agreement between a state or organization and an international organization is subjected to the rules defined by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or between International Organizations.  Treaty Form and Agreement = Enter into Force  An agreement between two parties can enter into force in two ways. The first is when both parties have met specified terms for entry in the agreement. The second way in which a treaty enters into force is when both parties decide to be mutually bound to the agreement as of a certain date. Bilateral treaties usually become active and enforced by the second option when both parties agree to uphold the agreement starting on a predetermined date.  Modern form  Most treaties follow a fairly consistent format ever since the late 19th century. A typical treaty begins with a preamble, then followed by the numbered articles which contains the substance of the agreement, and concludes with a closing protocol. The preamble typically names and describes the involved parties and what their shared objectives for the treaty are. It may also some context or summarize any underlying events that caused for the agreement to come about. A boilerplate of who the representatives are, and how they have communicated, i.e. a summary of how and why the representatives have the authroity to negotiate for their respective party. The start of the actual agreed upon terms is usually signaled by the words \\"have agreed as follows\\". The numbered articles make up the body of the treaty, divided into article headings which are typically a paragraph long. In most treaties, the articles at the end of this section will clarify how peacefully resolve disputes over the interpretations.  Examples  Note that it is not the name (an Accord, a Pact, a Convention, etc.), but the contents of an agreement between two parties that forms a bilateral treaty. Examples include the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel signed in September 1978, or the Geneva Protocol, or the Biological Weapons Convention - none which have the term 'treaty' in the name.

Hungarian law recognizes individuals' minority rights, establishes the concept of the collective rights of ethnic minorities, and states the inalienable collective right of minorities to preserve their ethnic identity. The law also permits associations, movements, and political parties of an ethnic or national character and mandates the unrestricted use of ethnic languages. To be recognized, an ethnic group must have at least 100 years' presence in the country, and its members must be citizens. The earliest migrations of Greeks to the territory of present-day Hungary (as part of the Habsburg Monarchy) were noted in the 15th and 16th centuries and consisted primarily of isolated highly educated individuals. Mass migrations did not occur until the 17th century, the largest waves being in 1718 and 1760-1770; they were primarily connected to the economic conditions of the period It is estimated that 10,000 Greeks emigrated to Hungary in the second half of the 18th century.

It forms part of the A4018. The building of Park Street started in 1761 and it was Bristol's earliest example of uniformly stepped hillside terracing. The street runs from College Green up a steep incline northwards to join Park Row near the southern apex of the Clifton Triangle. Looking up the street there is a dramatic view of the Wills Memorial Building. History The development of Park Street began in 1740 when the City Council leased land to Nathaniel Day, holder of Bullock's Park, to open a new street. Around that time, some houses were built on the north-east side of College Green, probably by James Paty the Elder. Around 1742 he was probably also involved in the development of adjacent Unity Street, where the use of stone facing and the rustication of the ground floor facades set a precedent for most of the later development in the Park Street area. In 1758 a design by George Tyndall was approved for Park Street to connect to Whiteladies Gate, one of the turnpikes. George Tully drew up plans and building started in 1761. The first phase of building finished at Great George Street around 1762. The upper part of the street was developed from about 1786 and work was suspended in the financial crisis of 1793, resumed and completed about ten years later. Much of the building throughout this period was by the firms owned by members of the Paty family, initially that of Thomas Paty, probably jointly with that of his brother James Paty the Younger. Thomas Paty's sons William and John joined his firm as partners in 1777. Developments by the Patys spread around Park Street to Great George Street, College Street, Denmark Street and Lodge Street and eventually from 1787 Charlotte Street, Berkeley Square, Berkeley Crescent and Upper Berkeley Place. A standard design by Thomas Paty was used for Park Street's houses. These had plain facades three windows wide, and as in the earlier Unity Street development they were faced in Bath Stone with a rusticated ground floor. The general conversion from housing to commercial premises since then, however, has meant the loss of the original ground floors; only No.51 retains its pediment, rustication and railings. The grander houses built c. 1762 by Thomas Paty on either side of the junction with Great George Street, in brick with stone dressings and with pediments on their George Street facades, were an exception to the generally plain style. Park Street was Bristol's earliest example of uniformly stepped terracing. Stepping would become a common approach to hillside building in Clifton, for squares as well as terraces, a different approach to that taken in the nearby city of Bath. The Philosophical Institution, now Freemasons' Hall, was built by R.S. Pope for C.R. Cockerell in 1821. A cast-iron viaduct to take the street over the natural gully between College Green and Brandon Hill was built by R.S. Pope in 1871. It is a grade II listed building. About a third of the buildings on Park Street suffered bombing on 24 November 1940 in the Bristol Blitz: 30 were destroyed, 6 burnt out and another 3 severely damaged. Nearly all though were later rebuilt and restored. During World War II Park Street was designated for white troops from the United States Army. On the evening of 15 July 1944, black soldiers entered the area and fighting broke out between about 400 soldiers. 120 Military police broke up the fighting but one was stabbed. Several soldiers were shot and one died. The city was then placed under military curfew. Park Street today Park Street is now mainly retail and leisure premises. Among the more unusual businesses are the Bristol Folk House , an arts centre, and the Bristol Guild of Applied Art . In 1974 an IRA bombing injured 20 people. In 1976 a huge gas explosion destroyed some of the buildings near the bottom of the road; most were rebuilt as replicas. Some of the furnishings from the RMS Mauretania were installed in a bar and restaurant complex at the bottom of Park Street, initially called \\"Mauretania\\", now \\"Java\\". The lounge bar was the library with mahogany panelling: above the first-class Grand Saloon with French-style gilding overlooks Frog Lane. The neon sign on the south wall still advertises the \\"Mauretania\\": installed in 1938 this was the first moving neon sign in Bristol. It is a grade II listed building. Visible from the viaduct, on the side of a building in Frogmore Street, is a controversial mural, named Well Hung Lover. by local graffiti artist Banksy. Antlers Gallery used the space at Number 2, Park Street for their exhibition Uncanny Views, which ran from 10 February - 6 March 2011.

Oudemolen was administered in the past by the municipality of Fijnaart. It originated in the confluence of three dikes namely one leading to Willemstad, the other to Klundert, and the third to Fijnaart. It is a village in the fertile farmlands of West Brabant. It developed as a typical Dutch dike village and service center to neighbouring large- and medium-scale farms providing labour, schooling, postal services, basic foods, recreational and drinking establishments, and maintenance of farming implements. In its heyday it was inhabited by as many as 500 people. These days it is a sleeping residence of families who commute between their home and workplace.

The most common delustrant is anatase titanium dioxide. Synthetic fibres such as nylon are normally extremely shiny and transparent when extruded. Adding powdered titanium dioxide causes the surface of the fibres to be rougher, reducing the sheen; at the same time, being opaque, it reduces the transparency of the fibre. To be effective as a delustrant, titanium dioxide must be powdered 0.1-1.0 ¬µm, depending on the size of the fibre, and varying amounts (up to about 2%) can be used depending on the level of lustre required.

It stars Doris Roberts as a lonely socialite who takes a group of homeless people into her home. Judy Reyes also stars as a homeless woman. The television film was directed by Mark Griffiths. Plot After the recent death of her husband and extreme loneliness because her son and especially her daughter have little time to visit her, Ruth (Doris Roberts), an elderly socialite takes an overdose of pills in an attempt to commit suicide. She is saved by Billy (Judy Reyes), a homeless woman. Although Billy is initially resistant to Ruth's attempts to befriend her, she eventually relents and accepts a place to stay in the lonely old socialite's mansion. To the dismay of Ruth's family and neighbors, several other homeless people also move in with them. Ruth works with them to better their lives and helps them find jobs and purpose in life. Eventually, her daughter finds out and tries to throw the people out because she thinks they're taking advantage of her mother. Ruth's son sees how happy his mother is, so he decides to return to the house to help her. However, the neighbors are upset and think their property values will go down because of Ruth's new occupants. They sue her and tell lies under oath in court to get the formerly homeless people thrown out. For example, they say that one of the men was urinating in their garden at 3 a.m. in the morning, yet this never happened. Although Ruth hires a good lawyer (who regularly volunteers to provide free legal advice to the homeless), she soon risks losing her case, because of Beverly Hills covenant rules; the home is regarded as a boarding house which is illegal in their residential neighborhood. In the meantime, Ruth's lawyer and Billy begin a romantic relationship, but this is stalled when Billy finds out that Ruth is going to lose her case. Billy and the others leave in the middle of the night because they love Ruth and don't want her to lose her home. Ruth finds them, however, and convinces them to come back, saying she needs them as much as they need her. As Ruth is testifying in court, she faints. Her doctor tells her that her cancer is terminally active. Her daughter realizes the error of her ways, decides to help her mother, so she works together with the lawyer Ruth had hired and creates a deal that the prosecution cannot refuse. If the prosecuting lawyer (who happens to be a condominium real estate king) suing them doesn't drop the case and sell Ruth's daughter one of his condominiums to house Ruth's friends, then Ruth will give the house to them and they will each become part owner of the house and live there permanently. Ruth wins her case and they all move into the newly purchased condominium. Ruth passes on, but not before she sees her new and old families come together to provide the halfway house for the homeless which is now called \\"Our House\\".

Inside the Army\\".Books.google.com It was first invented by the American Private Richard (Dick) Perrin, RA 11748246,Richard Perrin wrote \\"G.I. Resister\\" in September 1967. It was soon widely used to describe \\"the resistance inside the American military\\" during the Vietnam War, and up to the present as a concept for similar \\"Resistance\\" movements in other armies. The term is also sometimes projected backward historically, to earlier wars when the term did not yet exist, but the phenomenon arguably already did. Such RITA movements distinguish themselves from other components of anti-war movements, such as draft resistance or desertion, by the fact of their activists being soldiers and intending to go on being soldiers. Definition of RITA A definition of RITA was given in 1968 by PFC Terry KlugPfc Terry Klug (ret) appears in the recent (2007) version of the film: Sir ! No Sir ! . and published in the G.I. paper ACT (whose publication, as an \\"unauthorised\\" paper written by and for soldiers, was itself a major act of RITA). It was written during the Vietnam War and is still used up to the present with necessary adjustments for other countries and later wars such as the Iraq War. As can be seen from the context, \\"RITA\\" can refer for both the phenomenon of \\"Resistance inside the army\\" and a person who is a \\"Resister inside the army\\". > What is a Rita?

The above definitionpublished in ACT - The Rita's Newsletter - Vol 1, No 3 - early 1968 Western Europe edition  published in ACT, the RITA's Newsletter -ended with a direct address to US soldiers and specifically, to soldiers serving in Europe: We are more interested in acts than in words. Can you help?. The Sartre connection Those interested were invited to write to \\"J.P. Sartre, BP 130, Paris 14, France\\", and letters arrived at this address from American soldiers all over the world, including in Vietnam itself. The post office box was indeed registered in the name of the famous philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. An outspoken opponent of the American military involvement in Vietnam, Sartre agreed to render this service to the dissident American soldiers based in Paris, who were apprehensive of police interference with their mails. Over a considerable period, Sartre's secretary every morning emptied the post box and delivered the RITA mails to activists living in the Latin Quarter. Naturally, it was difficult for soldiers on active service to maintain this kind of correspondence via the official military mails, subject to official monitoring and censorship. However, the thriving black market maintained by American soldiers and deserters at the Cholon area of Saigon included a quite efficient \\"alternate postal link\\" through which \\"Ritas\\" could send and receive mail completely free of any interference by the military authorities. History of RITA=Jane Fonda and RITA According to Max Watts, an activist who was involved with RITA at Paris in the late 1960s and later during the early 1970s in Heidelberg, West GermanyIn Heidelberg, Watts worked closely with the Lawyers Military Defense Committee, a group providing free civilian counsel to US military members in courts martial. (at present based in Australia), contact with the movement had a considerable part in radicalising the positions of the well-known actress Jane Fonda.First-hand account published in \\"The Black Flag Cafe\\" and \\"GI Special\\" . Fate of F.T.A. film The F.T.A. film was commercially released around 12 July 1972. At the time Jane Fonda was in North Vietnam, under American bombs. She had been invited by the North Vietnamese government to witness American attacks - denied by the US government - on the dikes in the Red River delta. A week later, by the time Fonda returned to the US via Paris, all copies of the F.T.A. film had been \\"withdrawn\\" and apparently destroyed. It is still unclear why. According to Francine Parker, one of the directors, the Nixon White House \\"pressured the distributor\\", American Independent Films (AIF). AIF has not responded to queries on this subject. Fonda was at the world premiere of F.T.A. at the National movie theatre in Westwood Village (Los Angeles), California in July 1972. She was interviewed on local TV news by reporter Bob Banfield. \\"Dirty\\" video copies of F.T.A. circulated both in Vietnam and later, also amongst American soldiers in Iraq. Subtitles were hard to read. A \\"clean\\" copy has surfaced, and is now also available on DVD. Sequences of the \\"clean\\" F.T.A. film, with Jane Fonda as she was in 1971, have been included in the RITA film Sir! No Sir!, in which Fonda also speaks about the Iraq War. Jane Fonda has again become very active as a Frita (\\"Friend of RITAs\\") opposed to the Iraq/American war. ACT, the Rita's Newsletter ACT, the Rita's Newsletter - had an initial \\"direct press run\\" of 10,000. Vol 1 had 5 issues. By Vol 2 (2 issues) the direct press run was 25,000.

Chessell has been climbing since 1988, guiding since 1994, and has climbed and guided on all seven continents. He started out on the crags and in the gorges of National Parks of Australia, then moved on to larger mountains around the world. He is one of few Australian mountaineers to have climbed and guided Mount Everest and the first South Australian to summit. He has summited Mt Everest three times, in 2001, 2007 and 2010. His ascent in 2010 was from sea level, riding 1600km from the ocean in India. He has also guided Cho Oyu the world's 6th highest peak successfully twice and led over 60 expeditions world wide. He was also a member of the first Australian ascent of Makalu, the 5th highest peak in the world. In New Zealand he has climbed technically hard (grade six) routes and is two summits away from completing all the 3000m peaks in New Zealand. He has also climbed the Seven Summits and is one of only about a dozen guides to have led expeditions to all of them. In 2006 Chessell worked with a group of young people with cancer, known as CanTeen, guiding them to climb Mt Kilimanjaro. His favourite expedition was a sea-to-summit ascent of the highest peak in Antarctica, Mt Vinson in 2007, with fellow Australian's Rob North, Peter Weeks and Rob Jackson. He founded DCXP Mountain Journeys Pty Ltd in late 2000, which he ran for a decade guiding the seven summits including guiding Mt Everest commercially and summiting Mt Everest three times. Other destinations included the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea, which his company DCXP guided thousands of Australian trekkers over between 2003 and 2010.http://www.dcxp.com/aboutus.html About DCXP He was a member of the New Zealand Mountain Guides Association. In 2010 Chessell sold DCXP, and shifted back into the field of geology and became the managing director of the public mineral exploration company Endeavour Discoveries Ltd (2010-2016). Endeavour was based in South Australia exploring for base and precious metals such as nickel and gold in Papua New Guinea, South Australia and the Northern Territory. In 2011 he became the chairman of Endeavour Discoveries Ltd. In 2014 Chessell was founding chairman of the Himalayan Development Foundation Australia Inc (HDFA) an organisation dedicated to the helping children in a Nepal get a start in life via education.

Over its first five years of operation HDFA has delivered school rebuilds, built health posts, micro hydro electric schemes, upgraded education and livelihood programs to over 10,000 people in Nepal in three regions: Kanchenjunga, Indrawati and Sindhupalchowk delivering over A$1,000,000 in projects. In 2017 Chessell was founding director of Northern Cobalt Ltd, which is currently conducting mineral exploration for battery metals (cobalt, lithium, vanadium, copper and nickel) in Australia and North America. He currently works between the mineral exploration industry for Coolabah Group (private exploration, project generation and consulting services), Northern Cobalt Ltd, HDFA and public speaking engagements to corporates and schools.

It is the third short story published in the volume Exile and the Kingdom by Albert Camus. Plot summary The silent men are the workers at a cooper's shop. They have recently returned to work after a failed strike. When the owner's daughter has a serious, acute illness requiring an ambulance, the men do not offer any words of condolence. Where once there had been a sense of being all part of a whole, they no longer feel such for the owner who had refused to acquiesce to their demands following their strike. The owner himself is not a bad person; it is stated that he treated his men well, even offering each man five bottles of vintage wine each new year. The owner even tried to reconcile with the men, saying that if they are to increase productivity and thus bring in more revenue he will not only increase their salaries but he will do so without being prompted. Nevertheless, the men are cold, and when the owner says goodbye to everyone at the end of the day, nobody reacts. The men themselves have preserved their own sense of fraternity, however, and despite the situation with the owner and his daughter, the men are warm and humane to each other. While as a whole the men seem morally unaffected by the situation, Yvers, the protagonist, can't stop thinking about the little girl. At the end of the story, Yvers breaks his silence and confides in his wife all that has happened in the course of the day, and concludes by uttering \\"Ah! it's his own fault!\\" Motifs=The Common Fate A common theme in the works of Camus is that death is the common fate of all. From the rich to the poor, privileged to the destitute, the guilty to the innocent, the old and sometimes the young. Death is inescapable and makes all equal in the end. Just like Father Paneloux and the plague-stricken young boy in Camus' The Plague, death belittles our other problems and emphasizes man's struggle to make sense of what he has. The Silence The owner treated the men well, but he stood firm during the strike. He told them to take it or leave it, and that his offer of work is a charity. When they were back to work, the doors were closed until all of them arrived, as he was emphasizing he had the upper hand. It is explained \\"that they were not sulking, that their mouths had been closed, they had to take it or leave it, and that anger and helplessness sometimes hurt so much that you can't even cry out.\\" (Camus 406) See also *Overtime *Work‚Äìlife balance Sources *The Plague, The Fall, Exile and The Kingdom and Selected Essays (Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics) (Hardcover) by Albert Camus (Author), David Bellos (Introduction), Stuart Gilbert (Translator), Justin O'Brien (Translator) Short stories by Albert Camus 1957 short stories ","title":"The Silent Men"},{"id":"9574681","text":"WKID, \\"Froggy 95.9\\" is an FM radio station owned by Dial Broadcasting in Vevay, Indiana.

Young and starring Willem Dafoe and Edward James Olmos. The screenplay was inspired by true events, the same as the older Slovak film The Boxer and Death directed by Peter Solan. The majority of the film is set in the German Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during the Holocaust and details how the Jewish Greek boxer Salamo Arouch was forced to fight other internees to the death for the SS guards' entertainment. Prior to Triumph of the Spirit, no major feature film had ever been shot on location at Auschwitz. Plot A stevedore in Thessaloniki, Greece, Salamo Arouch's passion is boxing. Captured along with his family and fianc√© Allegra in 1943 and interned in Auschwitz, Arouch is used by his SS captors as entertainment, forced to box against fellow prisoners. He knows that if he refuses, his family will be punished; if he wins, he will be given extra rations which he can share with them; if he loses, he will be sent to the gas chamber. As his family and friends die around him, he has only his love of Allegra and his grim determination to keep her alive. The film follows the early life story of Salamo Arouch, though it takes some artistic liberties including the early introduction of wife Allegra (a pseudonym for Marta Yechiel), whom Arouch did not actually meet until after the liberation of the camp. Production Young was reluctant to make the film when he was first approached with the script, finding the topic too momentous to cover; he only agreed to direct when provided a script that focused only on one small element, \\"like a cork, bubbling on the surface of the sea.\\" The film, which positions Arouch as a witness to the horrors of the Holocaust, was shot on a budget of US$12 million. Filming with permission at the Auschwitz concentration camp, producers were able to utilize some existing structures but were also tasked with recreating a crematory given the condition of those that remain. The film also shot briefly in Israel. Boxing trainer Teddy Atlas, who played the role of Klaus Silber, was boxing consultant. Theme The title of the film is suggestive of human triumph,Baron, 90 a view to which star Dafoe subscribed, but others, including actor Olmos perceived its impact differently: \\"[W]hat does...[the film] project? The moral decay needed to survive in the camp.\\" Lawrence Baron, the author of 2005's Projecting the Holocaust Into the Present, agreed, stating that \\"the cumulative impression...undermines whatever uplifting impact its title and publicity imply.... A closer scrutiny of the movie reveals that it is not about the triumph of the spirit but rather about 'choiceless choices', to use Lawrence Langer's term for the dilemma faced by death camp inmates, who were never offered any moral alternatives to prolong their survival.\\"Baron, 90-91. Baron suggests that this message is crystallized in one scene where Arouch is set to fight his best friend Jacko, who has already been beaten by the guards, knowing that the loser will be consigned to the gas chamber; when he balks, his friend is executed on the spot.Baron, 91. Critical reception In its review, The New York Times praised the performances of Dafoe (\\"harrowingly good\\") and Robert Loggia (\\"a memorably physical performance\\"), but complained that the film overall is \\"thoroughly mundane\\", obvious and sentimental, also singling out for criticism the \\"outstandingly intrusive score\\". Also taking note of the \\"intrusive score\\", Rolling Stone found all of the cast melodramatic with the exception of Dafoe's \\"disciplined performance\\" and dismissed the film as \\"earnest but woefully misguided\\". Time Magazine noted that the film \\"is too respectful of its subject to find more in it than noble cliches\\", highlighting Young's \\"bland direction\\" and concluding that \\"[t]he film's only and considerable virtue lies in its documentation of the desperate strategies people devised to stay alive in the death camps.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that, by showcasing the fights and expecting viewers to root for Arouch, the filmmakers in effect force audiences to behave no differently from the Nazis in the story. The 2005 book Projecting the Holocaust Into the Present, though acknowledging the generally negative critical reviews, opines that \\"Young's depiction of the ethical vacuum that the Nazis devised at Auschwitz makes the movie disturbing and effective.\\"Baron, 92.

From Left to right: Sam de Wolff, Willem van Ravesteyn, Herman Gorter, David Wijnkoop, Louis de Visser, Gerrit Mannoury and Jan Ceton Social Democratic Party of the Netherlands was founded on March 14, 1909, as a breakaway from the Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party. In 1907 tensions arose within the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) between revolutionary Marxists grouped around De Tribune (The Tribune) and the leadership of the SDAP, who were more oriented towards more a revisionist ideology and a parliamentary and reformist political strategy. As Jan Ceton, Willem van Ravesteyn and David Wijnkoop and other participants in De Tribune increasingly criticized the leadership of the SDAP. At a party congress in Deventer held on February 14, 1909 the leadership of the SDAP demanded that they stop publishing De Tribune or be expelled from the party. Wijnkoop and Ceton refused and they and their supporters, including the poet Herman Gorter and the mathematician Gerrit Mannoury, left to form a breakaway party. This split was the first such split in Western European European Socialist parties, although others followed. There had already been a split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and with the break away Tesnjaki group which broke from the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party. On March 14, 1909 the dissenters founded a new party called the Social-Democratic Party (SDP). They had a membership of around 400 spread across different cities: Amsterdam (160), Rotterdam (65), The Hague (45), Leiden (56), Utrecht (25), Bussum (15). In the 1910s the SDAP paid much attention to attacking the newly formed SDP. The mobilization for the First World War, which the SDAP supported and the SDP opposed, further strengthened the differences between the parties. In the 1917 elections the SDP was still unable to win any seats. In May 1918 the Left Wing founded the journal De Internationale, uniting four opposition groups within the SDP, with groups in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague plus the Zimmerwald Left Propaganda Union. This group did not favour the parliamentarianism of the majority. In 1918 the party contested the July elections. In November became the Communist Party of the Netherlands.

Long thought to belong to an extinct subspecies of the Asian elephant named Elephas maximus rubridens, they lived in Central and Southern China before the 14th century BC. They once occurred as far north as Anyang, Henan in Northern China. The elephant is mentioned in the earliest received texts, including the Shijing, Liji, and Zuozhuan. The oracle bone script and bronzeware script glyphs for elephant are pictographic depictions of an animal with a long trunk. Their modern descendant is the regular script character Ë±° (Standard Modern Chinese, xi√†ng). In December 2011, a study by a team of scientists from China reported that the elephant living in China in ancient times (Shang and Zhou dynasties) could not have been a subspecies of the Asian elephant, as previously thought, but probably belonged to the genus Palaeoloxodon. P. namadicus were distributed across Asia, but it is unclear if the mysterious elephants of northern China were remnants of P. namadicus or a unique species of their own. This conclusion was reached after studying remains of Chinese elephant molars and tusks from the Holocene epoch, as well as examining ritual bronzes from the Shang and Zhou dynasties, which all depicted elephants with two 'fingers' on the tip of their trunk (whereas the Indian elephant only has one 'finger'). Fossil elephant experts Victoria Herridge and Adrian Lister disagree with the assignment, stating that the claimed diagnostic dental features are actually contrast artifacts, created due to the low resolution of the figures in the scientific paper, and are not evident in better quality photographs. Elephants still survived in the southwestern provinces of China after the extinction of the Chinese elephant, but they are of a different subspecies, the Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus). A native population of these elephants remains in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province.  Warfare  Elephants were used for warfare in China by a small handful of southern dynasties. The state of Chu used elephants in 506 BC against Wu by tying torches to their tails and sending them into the ranks of the enemy soldiers, but the attempt failed. In December 554 AD, the Liang dynasty used armoured war elephants, carrying towers, against Western Wei. They were defeated by a volley of arrows. The Southern Han dynasty is the only state in Chinese history to have kept a permanent corps of war elephants. These elephants were able to carry a tower with some 10 people on their backs. They were used successfully during the Han invasion of Ma Chu in 948. In 970, the Song dynasty invaded Southern Han and their crossbowmen readily routed the Han elephants on 23 January 971, during the taking of Shao. That was the last time elephants were used in Chinese warfare. Chinese armies also faced off against war elephants in Southeast Asia, such as during the Linyi-Champa Campaign (602‚Äì605) and Ming‚ÄìMong Mao War from 1366 ‚Äì 1388. In 605, Champa used elephants against the invading army of the Sui dynasty. The Sui army dug pits and lured the elephants into them and shot them with crossbows. The elephants turned back and trampled their own army. During the Mong Mao campaign, the elephants were routed by an assortment of gunpowder projectiles.

Skeletal remains of E. m. asurus have been recorded from the Middle East: Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria, from periods dating between at least 1800 BC and likely 700 BC. Due to the lack of any Late Pleistocene or early to mid Holocene record for Asian elephants in the region, it has been suggested to have been anthropogenically introduced during the Bronze Age, though this is disputed. Ancient Syrian craftsmen used the tusks of E. m. asurus to make ivory carvings. In Syria, the production of ivory items was at its maximum during the first millennium BC, when the Arameans made splendid ivory inlay for furniture. Description Syrian elephants were among the largest Asian elephant subspecies to have survived into historic times, measuring or more at the shoulder; on par with the largest reported Indian elephants. Skeletal remains show it did not differ much from the Indian subspecies, except in size. A study of mitochondrial DNA from 3500 year old remains from Gavur Lake Swamp southwest of Kahramanmara≈ü in Turkey, which represent an apparently wild population, found that they were within extant genetic variation and belonged to the Œ≤1 subclade of the major Œ≤ clade of Asian elephants, Œ≤1 being the predominant clade among Indian elephants. They carried an extremely rare mitochondrial haplotype only previously found in a single modern elephant in Thailand, the origin of the haplotype was placed between 3,700‚Äì58,700 years ago with a mean estimate of 23,500 years ago, suggesting that the population did not descend from Middle Pleistocene Elephas fossils known from the region and if it was natural it must have arrived in the region as an expansion from the core range of the Asian elephant during the Late Pleistocene or Holocene. The data was inconclusive as to whether the population had a natural or anthropogenic origin. Distribution and habitat Range of Elephas maximus asurus. In Western Asia, the elephants ranged from the mangrove forests of southern Iran, to southern Anatolia, the Syrian steppes and even extended to Israel. Ashurnasirpal II boasted of killing elephants, along with wild oxen and lions. Controversy No remains of Elephas are known from the Middle East after 200,000 years ago until 3,500 years ago. This long hiatus makes some scholars suspect that the Asian Elephants were artificial introductions to the Middle East, possibly from India, though this is difficult to prove. The extinction date is suggested to be around 700 BC, based on osteoarchaeological and historical evidence. This was possibly due to climactic shifts and changing land use during the early Iron Age Syrian elephants are frequently mentioned in Hellenistic history; the Seleucid kings, who maintained numerous war elephants, reigned in Syria during that period. These elephants are believed to be Indian elephants (E. m. indicus), which had been acquired by the Seleucid kings during their eastern expansions. Or they are believed to be population of Indian elephants in Middle East. It is attested by ancient sources such as StraboStrabo 15.2.1(9) and PolybiusPolybius 11.39 that Seleucid kings Seleucus I Nicator and Antiochus III the Great had large numbers of imported Indian elephants. Whether these \\"Indian elephants\\" were imported due to scarcity of native Syrian elephants or due to their accomplished training and domestication as war elephants remains unclear. Hannibal had a war elephant known as \\"Surus\\"; it has been suggested to mean \\"the Syrian\\". It was said by Cato to have been his best (and biggest) elephant. In that case, the elephant may have been of Seleucid stock. If it were in fact of native Syrian stock, or an imported Indian elephant, remains subject to speculation.

Life  Rahl was born in Vienna to Carl Heinrich Rahl (1779‚Äì1843), an engraver. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and won a prize at the age of 19. From there he traveled to Munich, Stuttgart, Hungary, and in 1836 to Italy. He remained in Italy from 1836 to 1843, where he in particular studied representatives of the Venetian and Roman schools of art, and painted die Auffindung von Manfreds Leiche (1836). Rahl's style, especially his views on color and perspective, were largely formed during his years in Rome. He returned after 1843 to Vienna for two years, and then led an itinerant life for the next five years, traveling through Holstein, Paris, Rome, Copenhagen, and Munich, making a living as a portrait painter. In this period he painted Manfreds Einzug in Luceria (1846), and die Christenverfolgung in den Katakomben. In 1850, he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, but for political reasons he was soon dismissed from the position. He then opened a private art school, which expanded quickly into a studio that produced monumental-scale paintings and enjoyed considerable success. Among his notable pupils were Eduard Bitterlich, August Eisenmenger, Joseph Matth√§us Aigner, K√°roly Lotz, Christian Griepenkerl, Gustav Gaul, and M√≥r Than.  Work  Rahl was commissioned by Greek philanthropist Simon Sinas to paint a number of works for the facade and vestibule of Vienna's Fleischmarkt Greek Church (Ludwig Thiersch being commissioned for the remainder of the frescoes), which was then being rebuilt by the Danish-Austrian neo-classical architect Theophil Hansen. In addition, Sinas commissioned four paintings depicting heroes of the Greek War of Independence, and a further four paintings to decorate his residence. Rahl decorated the Heinrichshof in 1861 with personifications of Art, Friendship, and Culture, and the Palais Todesco with representations from the mythology of Paris. In 1864, he painted a number of allegorical figures in the stairway of the Waffenmuseum (now part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum). In this period he also painted several frescoes: M√§dchen aus der Fremde (in a villa of Gmunden), a composition for a ballroom of Schloss Oldenburg, and a cycle from the tale of the Argonauts. Also, he painted the tympanum of the Athens Academy building, designed by Theophil Hansen in 1859 and executed by Ernst Ziller (completed in 1885), and paintings in the portico of the central building of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, designed by Christian Hansen (Theophil Hansen's brother). The central painting shows the university's founder, King Otto I of Greece, surrounded by the Muses; the left hand fresco shows Prometheus bringing fire down from Mount Olympus. In his later years he painted scenic backdrops for the New Opera (Neue Oper), which were continued after his death by his pupils. He designed the first curtain of the Hofoper in Vienna, used for performances of tragic operas. The design was after his death completed by his student Christian Griepenker, and painted by Eduard Bitterlich.Emil Pirchan, Alexander Witeschnik, and Otto Britz, 300 Jahre Wiener Operntheater: Werk und Werden (Wien: Fortuna-Verlag, 1953), reproduced opposite the title page.

No scientific evidence exists to support the idea; seismic observations and other data collected since spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon indicate that it has a thin crust, extensive mantle and small, dense core, although overall it is much less dense than Earth. The Hollow Moon concept is similar to the better-known Hollow Earth hypothesis, which was a recurring plot device in pre-spaceflight science fiction. The first discussion of a hollow Earth was by scientist Edmond Halley in 1692, while the first publication to mention a hollow Moon was not until H. G. Wells' 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon.  Introduction  The Hollow Moon hypothesis is the suggestion that the Moon is hollow, usually as a product of an alien civilization. It is often called the Spaceship Moon hypothesis, and often corresponds with beliefs in UFOs or ancient astronauts. The suggestion of a hollow moon first appeared in science fiction, when H. G. Wells wrote about a hollow moon in his 1901 book The First Men in the Moon. The concept of hollow planets was not new; Wells borrowed from earlier fictional works that described a hollow Earth, such as the 1741 novel Niels Klim's Underground Travels by Ludvig Holberg. Academic proposals for a hollow Earth pre-dated that. Edmond Halley's hypotheses, advanced in 1692, was the first one to specify an actual void in the Earth. Greek mythology, with its Hades, and early religious concepts of an underworld, such as the Christian Hell, contributed to ideas of the Earth being hollow. It is now considered to be a fringe theory.Although not described as such by the media, it is more accurately a fringe theory than a conspiracy theory. It is often described in the media as a conspiracy theory, and the concept of the Moon as a spaceship is often mentioned as one of David Icke's beliefs.  Claims and rebuttals  Speculative cutaway model of a Spaceship Moon  Vasin-Shcherbakov  In 1970, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, of what was then the Soviet Academy of Sciences, advanced a hypothesis that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings. The article was entitled \\"Is the Moon the Creation of Alien Intelligence?\\", and was published in Sputnik, the Soviet equivalent of Reader's Digest. Their hypothesis relies heavily on the suggestion that large lunar craters, generally assumed to be formed from meteor impact, are generally too shallow and have flat or even convex bottoms. They hypothesized that small meteors are making a cup-shaped depression in the rocky surface of the moon while the larger meteors are drilling through a rocky layer and hitting an armoured hull underneath. The authors reference earlier speculation by astrophysicist Iosif Shklovsky, who suggested that the Martian moon Phobos was an artificial satellite and hollow; this has since been shown to not be the case. Sceptical author Jason Colavito points out that all of their evidence is circumstantial, and that in the 1960s the atheistic Soviet Union promoted the ancient astronaut concept in an attempt to undermine the West's faith in religion.  The Moon rang like a bell  Between 1972 and 1977, seismometers installed on the Moon by the Apollo missions recorded moonquakes. The Moon was described as \\"ringing like a bell\\" during some of those quakes, specifically the shallow ones. This phrase was brought to popular attention in March 1970, in an article in Popular Science. When Apollo 12 deliberately crashed the Ascent Stage of its Lunar Module onto the Moon's surface, it was claimed that the Moon rang like a bell for an hour, leading to arguments that it must be hollow like a bell. Lunar seismology experiments since then have shown that the lunar body has shallow moonquakes that act differently from quakes on Earth, due to differences in texture, type and density of the planetary strata, but there is no evidence of any large empty space inside the body.  Density  The fact that the Moon is less dense than the Earth is advanced as support for it to be hollow. The moon's mean density is 3.3 g/cm3 whereas the Earth's is 5.5 g/cm3. One explanation of this discrepancy is that the moon may have been formed by a giant impact which ejected some of the early Earth's upper crust into its orbit. The Earth's upper mantle and crust are less dense than its core. Scientific perspective Schematic cross- section of the internal structure of the Moon Cornell University's Ask an Astronomer, run by volunteers in the Astronomy Department, answered the question \\"Can we prove that the Moon isn't hollow?\\". There, physicist Suniti Karunatillake suggests that there are at least two ways to determine the distribution of mass within a body. One involves moment of inertia parameters, the other involves seismic observations. In the case of the former, Karunatillake points out that the moment of inertia parameters indicate that the core of the moon is both dense and small, with the rest of the moon consisting of material with nearly-constant density. As for the latter, he notes that the moon is the only planetary body besides Earth on which extensive seismic observations have been made. These observations have constrained the thickness of the moon's crust, mantle and core, suggesting it could not be hollow. Mainstream scientific opinion on the internal structure of the Moon overwhelmingly supports a solid internal structure with a thin crust, an extensive mantle and a small denser core. This is based on: # Seismic observations. Besides Earth, the Moon is the only planetary body with a seismic observation network in place. Analysis of lunar seismic data have helped constrain the thickness of the crust (~45 km) and mantle, as well as the core radius (~330 km). # Moment of inertia parameters. True (physical) libration of the Moon measured via Lunar laser ranging constrains the normalized polar moment of inertia to 0.394 ¬± 0.002. This is very close to the value for a solid object with radially constant density, which would be 2/5 = 0.4 (for comparison, Earth's value is 0.33). The normalized polar moment of inertia for a hollow Moon would be close to the value 2/3 for a thin sphere. In literature * H.G. Wells, The First Men in The Moon (1901).

Maria Eugenia Aubet locates it at the site of modern M√°laga. The first colonial settlement in the area, dating from the late 8th century BC, was made by seafaring Phoenicians from Tyre, Lebanon, on an islet in the estuary of the Guadalhorce River at Cerro del Villar (the coastline of M√°laga has changed considerably since that time, as river silting and changes in river levels have filled the ancient estuary and moved the site inland). The Phoenician settlements were more densely concentrated on the coastline east of Gibraltar than they were further up the coast. Market rivalry had attracted the Greeks to Iberia, who established their own trading colonies along the northeastern coast before venturing into the Phoenician corridor. They were encouraged by the Tartessians, who may have desired to end the Phoenician economic monopoly. Herodotus mentions that around 630 BC, the Phocaeans established relations with King Arganthonios (670‚Äì550 BC) of Tartessos, who gave them money to build walls around their city. Later they founded Mainake on the M√°laga coast (Strabo. 3.4.2). Recent archaeological investigations have reopened the debate about the location of the Greek Mainake. The Massaliote Periplus places the city under Tartessian dominion on an island with a good harbour; its author emphasises that the city was on an island close to the river of the same name, and surrounded by saltwater lagoons. Geomorphological and paleo-environmental studies have shown that the Phoenician colony of Cerro del Villar, at the mouth of the Guadalhorce, was situated on an ancient island, now a rise in an alluvial flood plain west of M√°laga.Aubet 2005, p. 187 The Periplus, a merchants' guidebook which described the sea routes used by traders from Phoenicia and Tartessos, possibly dating to as early as the 6th century BC, contains the most ancient identification of Malaca as Mainake. It gives an account of a sea voyage circa 525 BC from Massalia (Marseille) along the western Mediterranean coast. The part referring to the Iberian Peninsula is preserved in the Ora Maritima (The Maritime Shores) of the Latin writer Rufus Festus Avienus, who wrote down excerpts much later, during the 4th century. Lines 425‚Äì431, which come after a description of the Pillars of Herakles (The Straits of Gibraltar), say that Mainake is close to the island of Noctiluca: In English: Greek and Phoenician colonies about 550 BC The mythical Greek colony of Mainake existed for at least two centuries. The name appears to be derived from the (). There are several ancient documents that mention its existence and discuss its intensive commercial activity. Strabo and other ancient historians placed it east of Malaka, but recent archaeological investigations suggest that the site of the 8th century BC Phoenician settlement at Cerro del Villar, less than 5 kilometres (3 miles) west of the original site of Malaka, corresponds to the location of the Greek colony. According to the ancient sources it was gradually abandoned after the battle of Alalia and the consequent collapse of the Phocaean Greek trade, which led the native inhabitants to shift their residence to the Phoenician-Punic Malaka. The Greek historian and geographer Strabo (64 BC‚Äì24 AD) says in his Geographica that in his time some thought this colony was the city of Malaca, a supposition he contradicted by pointing out that the ruins of Mainake could still be seen near Malaca and showed the regular urban plan of the Greeks, versus the haphazard Semitic layout of Malaka: The layout of ancient Malaka is unknown, but its location on a hill at the foot of Mount Gibralfaro suggests it was a more dense and irregular urban cluster than neighbouring Cerro del Villar, that is, Mainake. Traces of ancient landings there, as of a port, correspond with the description in the Periplous. The ruins mentioned by Strabo were still visible in the 1st century BC, and could only belong to a place that was already vacated in the Roman period, as occurred in Cerro del Villar but not in Malaka. The Phoenician city at Cerro del Villar lay in ruins at the beginning of the 6th century BC, when it was apparently resettled by the Phocaean Greeks.Aubet 2005, p.200 According to the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, its probable location is the hill of Cerro del Pe√±√≥n, near the mouth of river V√©lez, at the south of V√©lez Malaga.Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World - Map by Map Directory - Map 27 Hispania Carthaginiensis, Princeton University Press, 2000, , p. 446.

Its origins date from NTL and Telewest, formerly two of the UK's largest cable operators, which merged on 6 March 2006. All NTL:Telewest services were rebranded as Virgin Media in February 2007. Since the acquisition of Smallworld Cable in 2014, Virgin is the sole national cable TV provider in Great Britain.https://www.broadbandchoices.co.uk/guides/tv/cable- tv about 51% of UK households have access to Virgin's network, which is independent from BT's Openreach network.https://www.choose.co.uk/guide/virgin- media-available-in-my-area.html Virgin ranks as the UK's second-largest pay TV service, and the service is provided in conjunction with Virgin Media broadband and phone.https://www.choose.co.uk/guide/virgin-media-available-in- my-area.html As of Q3 2007, it had 3.6 million subscribers, compared to 8.2 million on its traditional rival Sky.The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report -Digital TV Q3 2007 , Ofcom. Retrieved on 23 February 2008 As of 2009, Virgin's digital cable television currently uses the Nagravision 3 conditional access system. The service was fully digitalised in 2013. Since November 2016, the service's flagship set top box is the TiVo-powered Virgin V6 Boxhttps://www.virginmedia.com/corporate/media-centre/press-releases/game- changing-virgin-tv-launch and competes with Sky Q.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/14/virgin-v6-tv-review-tv- recorder History As of 2008, Virgin Media functioned as a single company; however, it relied on its three existing infrastructures: the Langley-based NTL, Bromley-based Cable and Wireless and Knowsley-based Telewest platforms. As part of the Next Generation Television network, the infrastructure was consolidated into a single super headend at Langley in 2010, with Knowsley serving as a backup. In May 2008, Virgin Media began their \\"long term\\" region- by-region analogue television service switch off project, beginning with Coventry and Glasgow. In areas where analogue transmission will be turned off but no digital replacement introduced customers will be offered Virgin's off- network services, with the company looking at developing a television-over-DSL service for areas outside its cable network. Analogue subscribers in areas where digital cable services are already available will be offered transfers to new packages. The firm signalled that it wants to use the capacity to provide faster broadband internet. On 11 September 2009, Cisco Systems announced a deal to support Virgin Media's Internet Protocol TV distribution platform and upgrade its legacy digital TV infrastructure. Virgin Media deployed Cisco Digital Video Headend technology in all of its regional and central headends, across its national fibre optic network. The TV platform will be capable of delivering advanced services to more than 12.6 million UK homes. The infrastructure helped Virgin Media to reduce operating expenses, support the rollout of new conditional-access security services, and accelerate the introduction of new standard and high-definition services. A Virgin Media spokesman later clarified that the plan \\"isn't quite announcing the 'launch of IPTV services'. The agreement with Cisco is to help enhance our existing TV platform, which broadcasts content over DVB-C and then our VoD service runs on IP.\\" On 24 November 2009, Virgin Media entered into a strategic partnership with TiVo. Under the mutually exclusive agreement, TiVo developed a converged television and broadband interactive interface to power Virgin Media's next generation, high definition set-top boxes. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. TiVo became the exclusive provider of middleware and user interface software for Virgin Media's next generation set top boxes. Virgin Media became the exclusive distributor of TiVo services and technology in the United Kingdom. Virgin Media will pay TiVo monthly fees, which commenced upon delivery of its first set-top box, which are guaranteed and increase over time. The agreement has a multi-year term with additional limited renewal rights granted to Virgin. The agreement created a mutually exclusive distribution arrangement under which TiVo will develop software for DVR set top box platforms and non-DVR set-top boxes that will be deployed in the future by Virgin in the United Kingdom. Virgin Media will promote the product and has exclusive rights to use the TiVo brand and technology in the United Kingdom. As part of the agreement, Virgin Media and TiVo entered into a mutual covenant not to assert with regards to each party's intellectual property. Investment bank Lazard Capital Markets estimated the hookup as a \\"$48 million deal\\" for TiVo. Virgin Media is to maintain its current Liberate middleware provided by SeaChange International through until at least January 2011. In 2014 Virgin Media bought Smallworld Cable, a regional cable company.https://www.virginmedia.com/corporate/media-centre/press- releases/virgin-media-acquires-smallworld-fibre As a result Virgin Media is now the only cable company in the UK apart from WightFibre which operates on the Isle of Wight. Availability=Non-digital areas The BT Group owned (but Virgin Media leased) Milton Keynes franchise which was analogue-only was switched off in November 2013. BT's Openreach division selected Milton Keynes for a large scale fibre-to-the-premises trial (as opposed to fibre-to-the- cabinet in other parts of the UK). It remains to be seen what impact, if any, this will have on the viability of the Virgin Media leasing arrangement of the analogue HFC network there, which, uniquely, is believed to pass through BT infrastructure ‚Äì not wholly VM's. The leasing arrangement dates back to 1999 and was mandated by the European Union in response to competition concerns surrounding BT's Cable TV interests in Milton Keynes and Westminster. Virgin Media completely withdrew its services in Westminster on 31 January 2012, after being unable to upgrade the network and deliver their digital services at a reasonable cost. The Milton Keynes cable network, which has a significant number of users due to technical satellite and aerial reception issues down to local geography, does not suffer the same 'conservation' area rules as the Borough of Westminster. Milton Keynes remained analogue-only until the end of 2013, at which point the network was shut down due to a contractual breakdown with BT, the owners of the network in Milton Keynes. During 2009 digital upgrade work began on the last Virgin Media owned analogue-only areas in Bolton, Slough and West London as well as parts of Leicester, Northern Ireland and Southampton, with most areas completed between 2010 and 2011. In these areas Virgin Media had only offered customers analogue cable television. Non-cabled areas For customers in non-cabled areas, Virgin Media offered a branded set-top box for the Freeview digital terrestrial television service, called \\"Free TV\\", until December 2009 when it was discontinued. The set-top box was free to any customer taking the Bundle One subscription package or for an addition fee to other customers, up to five additional set-top boxes were available per account. The next phase of this service was to be a combined IPTV and digital terrestrial television service similar to BT Vision and TalkTalk TV. Virgin Media signed an agreement with Cable & Wireless to become the unbundled local loop (LLU) network provider, providing access to 4 million homes outside of the Virgin Media cable franchise network and would include linear pay broadcast channels and video on demand. This was originally scheduled to be released during 2008 but was delayed and scaled back as Virgin Media concentrated on improving its cable broadband proposition instead of focusing on competing with Sky in the premium television market. As of 2010, no further developments have been announced and the plans appear to have been abandoned. Products and services Virgin TV carries around 301 digital television and radio channels, including a mixture of subscription, premium subscription and pay-per-view channels. HD services and PVR Telewest (one of Virgin Media's predecessors) became the first UK broadcaster to offer HDTV, launching its service in December 2005; several months earlier than that of its chief competitor, Sky. An HD-enabled set-top box is required to view HDTV. Virgin TV branded its original high-definition (HD) Digital Video Recorder (PVR) service as V+. The service uses a PVR set-top box, with three tuners and a 160 GB hard disk for up to 80 hours' recording. The presence of three tuners means that V+ can record two channels at the same time while viewers watch a third. This contrasts with most other PVR systems such as Sky+, which supports only two tuners. In December 2010 a 1 TB TiVo HD PVR from Cisco was released, with a 500 GB model released in May 2011. From late 2011, Samsung Electronics will join Cisco as a second supplier of TiVo STBs for Virgin Media. Virgin also offer a Cisco V HD Box, for a fixed upgrade fee from their standard set-top box with no additional monthly subscription fee. The V (HD) and V+ boxes are now obsolete and no longer supported. Newer TiVo-based boxes are the only supported devices for Virgin TV nowadays. The newest V6 box is very fast and multi-functional, however, it only supports a HDMI-equipped TV set (the SCART port is disabled and not supported) and requires a valid Virgin Media broadband service connection to the box. If these conditions are not met, only the older TiVo box can be used which has an operational SCART connector and an internal communication modem which removes a need for a broadband connection. =HD channels= At the product launch of Telewest's TVDrive on 1 December 2005, the only HD channels available were BBC HD and ITV HD trial channels. ITV HD was removed from the network after the completion of the trial on 30 November 2006. On 1 December 2007, BBC HD was transformed into a full service. During 2009, Virgin launched FX HD, MTVNHD, National Geographic HD, Channel 4 HD, ESPN HD and Living HD. Living HD represented the first HD channel to be made exclusively available to Virgin TV. In 2010, Media added E4 HD, Syfy HD, Discovery HD, Eurosport HD, ITV HD, STV HD, Channel 5 HD, Film4 HD, ten Sky Movies HD channels, Sky Sports HD1 and HD2, Sky1 HD, Comedy Central HD, UTV HD and BBC One HD. Both Film4 HD and UTV HD are exclusive to Virgin TV. In 2011, Virgin Media added Sky Arts 1 HD and 2 HD, Eurosport 3D, Sky Movies Classics HD, Dave HD and Watch HD. In 2012, Virgin Media added Eurosport 3D, Alibi HD, British Eurosport HD, the BBC's 24 Olympic HD channels and Channel 4's 3 Paralympic channels. In 2013, Virgin Media added Cartoon Network HD, TCM HD, British Eurosport 2 HD, ITV2 HD, ITV3 HD, ITV4 HD, BBC Two HD, TLC HD, NHK World HD, Animal Planet HD, BBC Red Button HD, MTV HD, Nickelodeon HD, BT Sport 1 HD, BT Sport 2 HD and More4 HD. On demand Virgin TV ranks as the UK's largest provider of on-demand content, with over 3 million video on demand (VoD) customers and over 6,500 hours of programming. The company brands its VOD service as \\"On Demand\\". In contrast to the Sky On Demand system from Sky, Virgin Media offers a \\"true\\" VOD system, allowing customers to stream programmes whenever they want to watch them from servers at the customer's local head end. As the broadcaster automatically stores content on Virgin Media servers, this removes the need to pre-record many programmes. Users can search through a large library of programmes (called \\"TV Choice\\") from content providers including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Discovery Networks, National Geographic, CBS Paramount, Buena Vista, Alliance Atlantis, Warner Bros., Viacom (MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon), Current TV, BabyTV, PictureBox Movies, NBC Universal and BSkyB; and watch them when they want to. Subscribers to Virgin Media's premier television package, Size: XL, have the content included in their subscription, while other customers can pay ¬£5 per month for unlimited access, or can utilise pay-per-view. In addition, Virgin Media offers a \\"Catch-up\\" service, which includes a free 7-day \\"watch-again\\" feature for selected television programmes broadcast by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. The service also offers over 500 films (service-branded \\"FilmFlex\\"), and more than 8000 music-videos. On 12 July 2007 the music videos became free for all XL customers.Diginews.name Additionally, it was revealed that one third of BBC television programmes viewed on its iPlayer service are accessed through Virgin Media's on Demand service and that 50% of all Virgin Media customers \\"regularly\\" use on Demand services. On 25 November 2009, Virgin Media added dynamic advertising using SeaChange International's AdPulse system. Ads will appear in thirty second pre-roll and post-roll ads which will be matched to the programme being watched. In January 2010, Virgin Media launched Virgin Media Music, offering over 3,500 videos to watch completely free. Virgin Media confirmed it would be launching a rival to both the BBC iPlayer and Sky Player by the end of 2010, with subscribers accessing content both online and through their mobile devices. On 26 April 2010, Virgin Media announced the launch of its first online movies service: Virgin Media Online Movies. All rentals will offer unlimited streamed views for 48 hours so viewers can pause, rewind and watch again, plus the film can be watched wherever the account holder logs on. Virgin Media Online Movies is powered by FilmFlex Movies Ltd., the service is delivered over the web using Microsoft Silverlight and will initially present movies in standard definition. A HD version of the service is in testing, though there is no word on when it might become available. On 29 July 2010, Virgin Media announced the beta launch of Virgin Media Player, an online and mobile TV player. Hundreds of hours of content for the beta trial were made available from ITV plc, Living, Disney, Cartoon Network, National Geographic, Discovery and MTV Networks Europe. The beta trial is open to Virgin Media's XL TV customers who also have a broadband connection with the company. Virgin Media brought more content to Virgin Media Player as the company built towards full launch later in the year. Virgin Mobile pay monthly customers are able to access an hour of Virgin Media Player every day, at no extra charge. Virgin Media Player on mobile launched with 4oD content which was joined by MTV Snax, MTV Music, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. A full launch for Virgin Media Player happened in late October 2010 on both computers and mobiles, with the latter charging additional fees for each hour or part hour of access on an escalating price scale, and availability initially only over 3G not Wi-Fi. A facility allowing customers to watch a programme on one device, pause it and then continue viewing from exactly the same point via another device expected to be added in mid-2011. On 7 September 2012, Virgin Media announced the launch of Virgin TV Anywhere, a new service that will enable Virgin TV customers to watch live TV channels and on-demand content via the internet through their computer or iOS device, similar to Sky Go. The service was launched two months later on 7 November 2012, replacing Virgin Media Player.. =HD on demand= At the product launch of Telewest's TVDrive on 1 December 2005, their Teleport service included a modest selection of on demand HD content including episodes of BBC nature documentaries Pride, The Blue Planet and Wild Weather, pay-per-view episodes of Lost and Desperate Housewives from Channel 4, a small selection of documentaries from the History Channel, Metropolitan Opera Live in HD's The Magic Flute and pay-per-view films from FilmFlex. On 8 October 2007, Virgin Media announced that they had struck a deal with Channel 4 that enables them to offer a selection of Channel 4 programming in HD via their TV on demand service. On 8 January 2009, it was announced that ITV Player would be added to Virgin Media's digital cable TV service. A selection of ITV's High Definition programming was supposed to be made available on demand as part of the deal. 12 March 2010, it was announced that some of ITV HD's content will be available on demand via ITV Net Player on Virgin Media's TV platform. On 16 April 2009, the BBC announced that they would offer HD content through BBC iPlayer, with a Virgin Media spokesperson adding \\"We're working closely with the BBC to make this service available on our platform as soon as possible.\\" HD content, including Robin Hood, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and Later... with Jools Holland, became available on 1 May 2009. On 29 June 2009, Virgin Media announced that from July the PictureBox movie service would be made available to Virgin Media's 3.6 million TV subscribers providing a broad selection of 28 films at any given time, with seven new titles being added to the line-up each Friday. Most of the PictureBox films are available in HD and many will not yet have been seen on free-to-air television in the UK. It marks the PictureBox's first UK platform to present films in HD. On 17 September 2009, Virgin Media announced an agreement with Disney, securing the rights for three TV channels (Disney Channel, Disney XD and Playhouse Disney), TV on demand content including HD programming and on demand content to be made available online. The deal also includes the rights for Virgin Media to air Disney XD and on demand content from Disney XD via the mobile. On 10 February 2010, Virgin announced that Discovery Networks would make HD on demand content available, such as Deadliest Catch and Miami Ink, during Spring 2010 as part of a deal to add Discovery HD. On 15 March 2010, Virgin Media and NBC Universal Global Networks announced that they would also look to make HD content available on demand where possible, as part of the deal to add Sci Fi HD. On 5 August 2010, Virgin Media announced that popular Comedy Central HD programmes available on demand from 1 September 2010. HBO content such as The Sopranos were removed on 14 October 2010, following HBO's exclusive deal with Sky, which led to the creation of Sky Atlantic. On 25 October 2010, Virgin Media announced a deal with NBC Universal Television Distribution for the video-on-demand rights in the UK to a broad selection of NBC Universal series. Under the terms of the agreement, these titles will be offered as new content across Virgin Media's three entertainment platforms; TV, online and mobile. From 1 December, Virgin Media customers were able to access past seasons of shows such as House, Heroes, The Office and 30 Rock, in HD through TV on Demand. On 11 November 2010, Virgin Media announced a multiscreen deal with Channel Five to bring programming from all of Five's linear TV channels to its TV, online and mobile video on demand platforms, with some shows also available in HD. The service has access to video on demand: current HD providers include BBC, FilmFlex, Fox, History, National Geographic Channel and PictureBox programming. Notable content includes Planet Earth and Dexter. 3D All of Virgin Media's HD set-top boxes are 3D compatible. Virgin Media had displayed a V+ in their Oxford Street store using polarised glasses and trialled over a private video on demand network using a HD stream interlaced with two pictures in 2009. In March 2010, during the Ideal Home Show at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Virgin Media showcased a reel of 3D content ‚Äì including sport and video games ‚Äì as a taste of its plans for 3D television. Virgin confirmed plans to start offering 3D content to subscribers via its on-demand platform rather than launching a static channel. The demo used active glasses but Virgin Media said that its 3D service would also support passive glasses. On 28 September 2010, Virgin Media announced the launch of 3D Movies on Demand ‚Äì the first commercially available 3D TV service in the UK. All Virgin Media TV customers, with either a V HD, V+ or TiVo box, 3D TV and glasses, are able to experience 3D Movies on Demand. The launch of 3D Movies on Demand, powered by FilmFlex, initially featured StreetDance 3D, Garfield's Pet Force 3D, A Christmas Carol 3D, Step Up 3D and Despicable Me 3D. Virgin Media also announced an exclusive 3D TV partnership with Samsung Electronics which would see Samsung 3D TVs featured in Virgin Media stores as well as other joint 3D showcases and marketing opportunities. Virgin Media also committed to investing in producing original 3D content. \\"We can confirm we're looking at producing original content in 3D, it makes sense for us to look at things like live music with the Virgin Media V Festival,\\" said Cindy Rose, executive director of digital entertainment at Virgin Media. Going on to explain that movies in 3D would remain available on a paid-for basis, but Virgin Media customers would be able to access other 3D content, such as TV shows, for free. She confirmed that the company has already secured the rights of a couple of TV programmes to be shown in 3D, but could not name them yet. Between 22 May and 5 June 2011, Eurosport 3D was broadcast exclusively on Virgin Media for the 2011 French Open. Selected 3D matches were also available on demand. The channel will return on 27 May 2012, to cover the 2012 French Open and 2012 Summer Olympics.

Shot in 16 mm black and white by long-time Wenders collaborator Robby M√ºller, the movie exhibited many of Wenders' later trademark themes of aimless searching, running from invisible demons, and persistent wandering toward an indeterminate goal. In this case the journey is that of protagonist Hans (Zischler) after he is released from prison. Searching through seedy West German streets and bars, he finally winds up visiting an old friend in Berlin.

The Brewing Division is based next to the M23, and the other Divisions are located in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, where about 330 people are employed. History=Formation In 1946 the Institute of Brewing recommended the setting up of an experimental research station, the Brewing Industry Research Foundation, with a full-time Director of Research and in 1947 Dr J Masson Gulland (Professor of Organic Chemistry, the University of Nottingham) was appointed to that position. Sadly Dr Masson Gulland was killed in a train crash before taking up his position and hence Sir Ian Heilbron (Imperial College London) agreed to become the second Director of Research at the new Brewing Industry Research Foundation (BIRF)in 1949. Research building In 1948 Lyttel Hall, Nutfield in Surrey was purchased and the main Hall was converted into laboratories, the squash court into a pilot brewery and other new buildings were developed as a workshops and conference facilities. In 1951 the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip formally opened the site. BIRF later became The Brewing Research Foundation, BRF International, Brewing Research International and today is simply known as BRI. Research scope Initially the BIRF focused on fundamental and applied research for the malting and brewing industries of the UK. Its staff made useful contributions in the areas of barley germination and yeast physiology. Since that time its role has evolved to become more service orientated offering analysis, food safety and information packages to an international client base. Brewers Patents Ltd The control of Brewing Patents Ltd was transferred in 1976 from the Brewers' Society to the Brewing Research Foundation. Important Brewing Scientist Training Ground Many young scientists of the Brewing Industry found initial employment at this Foundation to become important contributors elsewhere in the Brewing and allied industries. Merger In October 2008, Campden BRI was formed by the merger of Brewing Research International with Campden & Chorleywood Food Research Association (CCFRA) of Chipping Campden, which was formed in 1919 and is the largest membership-based food research organisation in the world. In the 1920s it devised the Campden Solution, which was later commercialised as the Campden Tablet. Functions Its services are used by the vast majority of the world's brewing companies.

Set in Rome between 27 May and 7 June AD 74, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the Vestal Virgins lottery that is a key plot device. Plot summary When a frightened child approaches Marcus Didius Falco with a plea for help, he does not believe her. One quarrel with the family does not mean that a relation is trying to kill her. Beset by his own family troubles, his new responsibilities as Procurator of the Sacred Poultry, and the continuing search for a new partner, he decides to send her home. However, he almost immediately regrets it. Gaia Laelia comes from a pre- eminent Roman family with a long history of key religious positions. Gaia, herself, is considered the most likely candidate for election to the office of Vestal Virgin. When she disappears, Falco is officially asked to investigate. Meanwhile, Helena's brother Aelianus has problems of his own. In an attempt to restart his political career - stalled by his younger brother's elopement with his wealthy fiancee - he tries to gain election to the Arval Brethren. During the night-time ceremonies, however, Aelianus stumbles across the body of one of the Brethren with his throat cut as if he had been sacrificed. Unable to bring in the Vigiles, Falco is forced to search the house of Gaia Laelia alone, aware that time is running out for finding her before the lottery takes place, or even alive.

Featuring free and legal MP3 downloads, radio streams, and many full album streams, at its peak it amassed content from more than 400 independent labels and represented a diverse array of artists helping them to further awareness and stimulate tour and album revenue. History The roots of the site took place in San Francisco in 1998. Original co-founders Aaron Newton, Scott Bilby, and Justin Sinkovich created the site utilizing Newton and Bilby's Web and technology background and Sinkovich's music industry experience. The three co-founders wanted a name that properly reflected their idea. They also wanted a name related to San Francisco, the epicenter, as well as music, or sound, or tone, tonic. They settled on the combination of two words: epi-tonic, the center of sound. Epitonic.com was born.Resurrecting The Center of Sound Epitonic, Retrieved August 1, 2011. Epitonic was one of the first free mp3 download sites, and the first one to focus on independent music. Epitonic provided an online space where users could easily find new songs from up-and-coming artists. The site also allowed users to download tracks free of charge, or create a 'black box' of their favorites and stream them through their web- browsers resulting in a streaming radio platform. Epitonic was an iconic part of the music industry as it found its digital roots in the 1990s and hosted tracks from indie artists like Animal Collective, Built to Spill, Burd Early, Dismemberment Plan, as well as mellow, melodic instrumental bands such as Pele, Dianogah, and Six Parts Seven. Electronic music was also one of the most popular genres on the site, representing artists such as Bent Halos, Delerium, Carl Cox, and BT. Like many of the big websites of the 1990s and early 2000s, Epitonic raised a lot of money and spent it just as quickly. When the dot-com bubble burst found itself in trouble. In 2003 the site was acquired by Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures and ran alongside Palm's other brands including Rykodisc, Manga, RES, and sputnik7. In 2004 Palm shut the doors on Epitonic.com to focus on other brands. In 2006 Palm partnered with a company called Echospin and attempted to relaunch the site with no success. Another company, Audiotube purchased the rights to Epitonic and also failed to restart the site. Relaunch In 2010, after six years of inactivity, original co- founder Justin Sinkovich announced that he would be relaunching Epitonic as manager and principal owner. Sinkovich also began a fundraising campaign using online fundraising site Kickstarter. Sinkovich raised over $5000 in start-up funds from nearly 100 people.

Early life The son of a teacher and vice-principal, Klar attended school in L√∂rrach, and in 1972 graduated from a school in Ettlingen. He went on to study history and philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, and became, for a while, a member of a young democratic movement.

Tagesanzeiger, 12 January 2007 Militancy Around 1976, Klar joined the RAF and soon became a leading member of the second generation. Klar took part in the attempted kidnapping/murder of J√ºrgen Ponto. He received Stasi training in explosives and handling an RPG-7, and with three other RAF members shot an RPG-7 at the Mercedes limousine of U.S. General Frederick J. Kroesen in Heidelberg on 15 September 1981. In November 1982 he was arrested at an arms depot in Friedrichsruh. Similarly to Brigitte Mohnhaupt, he was given a collective sentence for all the major RAF crimes since 1977. These included: *The April 1977 murder of Siegfried Buback, his driver and his bodyguard *The July 1977 murder of J√ºrgen Ponto *The kidnap and murder of Hanns Martin Schleyer and the murder of his driver and three bodyguards He was also charged with: *Attempted murder of a Swiss border guard and a motorist in Riehen, January 1977 *Attempted rocket attack on the offices of the federal prosecutor, in August 1977 *A Zurich bank raid, murder of a bystander, and attempted murder of a policeman, in November 1979 *An assassination attempt on U.S. General Frederick Kroesen using an RPG-7 anti-tank rocket, on 15 September 1981 Imprisonment Klar was imprisoned from 1982 to December 2008. In early 2007 he petitioned Bundespr√§sident Horst K√∂hler to be pardoned but was denied. He may have damaged his chance at a pardon by making anti-capitalist comments in January 2007, but he was released on 19 December 2008 after serving over 26 years of his life sentence. Klar showed no remorse for his crimes. Families of RAF victims, as well as politicians, were outraged. J√ºrgen Vietor, co-pilot of Lufthansa Flight 181, sent a letter of protest to the President of Germany and returned his Federal Cross of Merit.

It comprises one aspect of brand management. Brand engagement will impact brand attachment and has a positive influence on customer purchase intentions. External Brand engagement between a brand and its consumers/potential consumers is a key objective of a brand marketing effort. In general, the ways a brand connects to its consumer is via a range of \\"touchpoints\\"‚Äîthat is, a sequence or list of potential ways the brand makes contact with the individual. Examples include retail environments, advertising, word of mouth, online, and the product itself. Internal (\\"close stakeholder\\") There are two broad areas where brand engagement is relevant within an organization (employees and close stakeholders such as franchise staff, call centers, suppliers or intermediaries). The first area is ensuring that the employer brand promised to employees is delivered upon once employees join the firm. If the employee experience is not what is promised, this could result in increased employee turnover and/or decreased performance. The second area is ensuring employees and close stakeholders of an organization completely understand the organization's brand, and what it stands for‚Äîand to make sure that their activities on a day-to-day basis are contributing to expressing that brand through the customer experience. In general, this requires an ongoing effort on the part of the organization to ensure that its employees and close stakeholders understand what the brand is promising to its customers, and to help all employees clearly understand how their actions and behaviors, on a day-to-day basis, either support or undermine the effort. This often raises the issue of the value of investment in \\"brand engagement\\". It is a discretionary expense on the part of the organization. Proponents of brand engagement would argue that this is an investment‚Äîthat is, the benefits to the organization outweigh the cost of the program. Within any organization there is competition for resources, so there is a significant need to demonstrate return on investment in employee engagement/internal communications. While it is generally accepted that it is important for internal communications professionals to demonstrate the value this function delivers to the organization, it is difficult to place a discrete figure on this contribution. Best practice in internal communications generally adheres to certain principles: * Understanding the stakeholder (audiences) * Knowing what messages and information is appropriate for each audience * Ensuring that there is a feedback mechanism in place so communication is a dialogue * Measuring effectiveness * Enhancing participation and collaboration. An aspect of internal brand engagement is brand orientation which refers to \\"the degree to which the organization values brands and its practices are oriented towards building brand capabilities.\\" Thought leaders are increasingly placing employee engagement at the forefront of the fight for greater authenticity in the workplace, increased employee satisfaction and ultimately greater retention and improved customer service. They are passionate about the link to bottom line benefits and strongly advocate working on brands from the inside out. There are a range of experts and service providers who have created offers to bring the brand to life‚Äîall agree that the employee side of the equation is far more important than has been historically acknowledged. The measurement angle Much internal communication and employee engagement practice is based on measurement of effectiveness or business contribution. The key elements in creating a model of employee engagement is the measurement of \\"engagement drivers\\"‚Äîthat is, what are the factors or combinations of factors which affect productivity and commitment and can be monitored and addressed through people, process or technology changes? Many of the ‚Äúengagement drivers‚Äù currently in use internally are HR focused, and in many cases do not delve deeply into the employee‚Äôs role in delivering the brand/customer experience as a distinct element. Example Probably the most compelling example of this is the service-profit chain. The first real case study of this appeared in \\"The Service Profit Chain\\" (the so-called Sears Model, Harvard Business Review, 1997). This statistical model tracks increases in employee ‚Äúengagement drivers‚Äù to correlated increases in customer satisfaction and loyalty, and then correlates this to increases in total shareholder return (TSR), revenue and other financial performance measures. Since the service-profit chain emerged, it‚Äôs been developed, and criticized, but the general consensus is that employee engagement can contribute roughly 20% to an organization‚Äôs TSR (various Vivaldi, Watson Wyatt, Towers Perrin studies 2004, 2005, 2006). Collaboration and connectivity vs. content management While some organizations are realizing the benefits of collaboration and work flow online, there appears to be significant focus on publishing and managing content, generally via content management systems. There is an emerging school of thought that organizational perspectives on technology are frequently misaligned with the actual requirements and desires of the users of the technology. That is, the nature (or intention) of a technology may not always determine the nature of its use ‚Äì the telephone, for example, was originally intended as a broadcast medium . Its designers were focused on delivering content, while its users sought ‚Äì and still value ‚Äì connectivity(1). The social media phenomenon presents emerging evidence that this quest for connectivity is rapidly becoming a core focus of communication technology within organizations. This potentially creates a disconnect with more traditional content-driven models of internal communication‚Äîdelivering (or making easily available) the right content at the right time to the right people using the right media. Therefore, there could be a great deal of potential within organisations, using their existing technologies, to derive cultural and performance benefits from re-thinking how they communicate, make decisions and work virtually.

It is widespread in the eastern part of the USA (from Texas and Florida to Maine) and Minnesota, Canada (southern Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador), and on the coasts of the Arctic Ocean, where it grows in sandy areas such as dunes and savannas. Description The leaves are palmately compound with 7‚Äì11 leaflets arranged radially. Their stalks are numerous, erect, striated, and slightly pubescent. The leaflets are obovate, with a blunted apex or pointed spear, and sparsely pubescent. Petioles are longer than leaflets; stipules are very small. The inflorescence is long, sparsely flowered, sometimes almost verticillate. Flowers color can be white, blue, purple, or pink, but are most often blue or bluish purple. The calyx is silky, without bractlets; its upper labium with a protuberant basis, is integral or weakly emarginate, the lower one is integral, almost twice longer than upper. Floral bracts are styliform, shorter than the calyx, early falling. The corolla is three times longer than the calyx. The vexillum is shorter than the wings. The carina is weakly ciliate. Pods are yellow-grayish-brown, with straight lines, necklace-shaped, short and closely hirsute, easy shattered, with 5‚Äì6 seeds. Seed is oval with a light hilum. Lupinus perennis is commonly mistaken for Lupinus polyphyllus (large-leaved lupine), which is commonly planted along roadsides. Lupinus polyphyllus is not native to eastern North America, but has naturalized in areas in the upper Midwest and New England. Lupinus polyphyllus has 11‚Äì17 leaflets that can reach in length while Lupinus perennis has 7‚Äì11 leaflets which only reach around in length. Ecology Lupinus perennis (blue flower) and Caltha palustris shown in a plate from Studies of Plant Life in Canada (1906) Lupinus perennis is used as foodplants by the caterpillars of several lepidoptera. Among these are the clouded sulphur, eastern tailed blue, gray hairstreak, silvery blue, wild indigo duskywing, frosted elfin (Callophrys irus), the eastern Persius duskywing (Erynnis persius persius), and the rare and endangered Karner blue (Plebejus melissa samuelis), whose caterpillars feed only on the lupine leaves. Leaves that have been fed on by Karner blues have distinctive transparent areas where the larvae have selectively eaten only the green, fleshy parts. Conservation The lupine has been declining in number and range since the Industrial Revolution. It is estimated that it has declined in number by about 90% since 1900. This decline has in turn been deemed one of the primary causes of the decline of the Karner blue butterfly. The main threats to Lupinus perennis are thought to be habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and poor management. Currently it is considered \\"rare\\" in Pennsylvania, a species of special concern in Rhode Island], threatened in Iowa, Maryland, and New Hampshire; it is endangered in Vermont, and is extirpated (locally extinct) in Maine. Human development has eliminated a large portion of its viable habitat. Remaining habitat is often fragmented, which is problematic for the lupine because it limits the range over which it can reproduce. Viable lupine habitat is often difficult to maintain because it flourishes after fires and other forms of disturbance. One reason this occurs is that lupine seed coats are so tough that only pressure changes due to rapid heating or abrasion are strong enough to allow water to penetrate and start germination. Moreover, fires, feeding by large ungulates, and mowing can improve habitat quality for established lupines by changing soil quality, vegetative structure, and leaf litter depth.

It was introduced on September in 1999 at the Frankfurt Auto Show. During the 2000 Paris Auto Show a convertible variant of the Z9 was debuted. It was designed by Chris Bangle, who was promoted to Director of BMW Group Design. Much of the styling found on E63 6 series is derived from the Z9. Interior design A large, 8.8-inch monitor in the center of the dashboard displays all the information the driver needs, apart from the speedometer and tachometer, which are conventional analog instruments. The monitor is positioned within the driver's field of vision, allowing it to be viewed while focusing attention on the road ahead. Controls are operated with a single large, multifunction knob located between the front seats. The control (called the Intuitive Interaction Concept) consists of a combination rotary and push button for selecting functions. Confirmation of the selected mode is displayed on the dash mounted screen. Several hundred functions can be controlled with this device. The concept of operating the Z9, which BMW calls Intuitive Interaction Concept, allows the driver to easily activate functions while driving without the need to constantly examine and manipulate conventional controls. It was an early prototype of the series production iDrive, introduced in 2001 on the BMW 7 Series (E65). The Z9 has only a starter button and light switch on the dashboard. An electronic key is used to activate the driver's controls. Then, a simple starter button starts the engine. The instrument panel folds out when prompted. Classic, circular dials provide feedback to the driver. Drive or reverse gears can be engaged with a dash mounted lever. The Steptronic transmission can also be operated with steering wheel mounted buttons. These buttons can be used for manually shifting gears. The Z9 featured the V8 turbo- diesel from the BMW 7 Series (E38) 740d model. Exterior design The Z9 Gran Turismo Concept car features the long hood and short rear deck that have become hallmarks of BMW sport coupe design. The ‚Äúface‚Äù of the Z9 incorporated trademark BMW design elements, such as the dual round headlights flanking the central kidney grille. Large wheels, 20-inch front and 21 inch rear, provided a hint of the performance capability of the Z9. Front and rear turn signals featured neon light technology, while rear lights incorporated light-emitting diodes (LED). One of the most striking features of the Z9 is the gull wing door, though unusually conventional doors are also fitted into the gull wings, allowing the doors to function in both ways. The full-length gull wing doors can be opened automatically at the press of a button on the electronic key. Depressing the button on the remote control will both open and close a door. The Z9 did not make it into production, but many of its innovations did. Engine The Z9 featured a V8 turbo diesel BMW M67, from the BMW 7 Series (E38) 740d model. The 3.9 liter V-8 is a common rail, direct injection unit. Maximum power was at the time an impressive 245 hp and it produced 413 lb ft torque (560 Nm). Torque is maintained constantly between 1750 and 2500 rpm to give high performance even at the low end of the rev range. Choosing a diesel engine to power a large sports coupe like the Z9 is a testament to BMW's confidence in the refinement and performance characteristics of the 3.9 liter V-8.

He was born at Lugo. He taught at the University of Paris, where he carried out a disputation with Meister Eckhart in 1303. He was expelled from Paris as a papal supporter, in the dispute with Philip IV of France. He came across the younger Duns Scotus and supported him, appointing him regent master of the Franciscans there in 1304. Dispute with Meister Eckhart The origin of Gonsalvus's dispute with Eckhart has to do with the relative superiority of the will to that of the intellect in knowing God. Gonsalvus held that the will was superior since, through it, God is known as he actually is whereas the intellect only knows the image of God in the mind. Eckhart believed that the intellect was superior to the will in this regard since through it, God can be known without any of the human qualities with which the will invests its image of him.

Set in Rome between July and August AD 74, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to both the poetry that leads Falco to the Chrysippus scriptorum and to the bank that is the Chrysippus family's other business. Plot summary When Marcus Didius Falco gives a poetry reading for family and friends, things get a little out of hand. The event is taken over by Aurelius Chrysippus, a wealthy Greek banker and patron to a group of struggling writers, who subsequently offers to publish Falco's work, which Falco turns down as being a raw deal. Unfortunately, soon afterwards Chrysippus is brutally murdered, with part of a broken scroll jammed up his nose, and due to his presence at Chrysippus' scriptorium Falco is implicated in his death and forced by his friend Petronius Longus, the enquiry chief of the vigiles, to investigate. The result is a trawl through the literary and financial worlds of Ancient Rome, as Falco delves deep into Chrysippus' personal life and business history. Falco's investigations reveal that the deceased Chrysippus (Greek: \\"Golden Horse\\") was owner of the Golden Horse Bank, and many potential suspects are turned up, including disgruntled writers employed by Chrysippus‚Äô scriptorium, a shipper Pisarchus who has fallen on hard times, as well as his family: Chrisyppus' widow Vibia, his ex-wife Lysa and his son Diomedes. Meanwhile, things get worse: one of the suspected writers, Avienus, is found dead and Falco and his friend Petronius are also attacked, although they manage to survive and kill the assassin. To add insult to injury, Falco also faces problems with his own family: his estranged father Geminius has problems coping with the death of his mistress, Flora, and Falco's nemesis Anacrites is slowly ingratiating himself with Falco's own mother, persuading her to place her savings with his own at the Golden Horse Bank -- which, unfortunately for the two and Falco, goes insolvent. Falco initially suspects Pisarchus because Pisarchus has recently gone into insolvency, but soon discounts that motive as being insufficient for murder after consulting his banker and his father for advice. Running out of time and options, Falco plays a desperate gambit -- bring together Chrysippus' family and his associates who are directly implicated in the murders at a conference at the Chrysippus home for questioning, along with Helena and the vigiles, who have been assisting Falco so far. Eventually, the murderer is identified and it's none other than Diomedes, identified by his accidentally revealing knowledge of how Chrysippus was found dead, and with further corroborating evidence collected during investigation or provided by witnesses at the time of the crime. The novel ends on an ominous tone, with Diomedes being sentenced to a gruesome death, and Falco brooding over tensions between his family and Anacrites, who has tried to woo Maia but was spurned by her.

It was released in April 2002, and is currently available in South Korea and China. The English version of the game, Fantasy Masters International, was released on November 27, 2007. The international version can be played in any country worldwide, excluding Korea and China. History Early Open Beta test of Fantasy Masters began in April, 2002. As the first online trading card games in Korea, popularity has quickly taken its toll by enthusiasts. It was officially released on January, 2003 as semi-free NTCG game. Game play Fantasy Masters cards of various types and colors. From left to right, top to bottom, Land, Unit, Item, and Spell cards are shown here. ¬© Zeonix, Inc. Images used with permission. Games are played either one vs one or two vs two. When both players are ready, the game starts. The game screen is divided in three sections: battle area in which the battle takes place, info area where a player can check the opponent's status and yours, and the chat area. Players take their turns (or phases) to summon their cards in order to prepare for Battle Phase. In order to summon any cards, players must have enough souls to summon, which can be acquired mainly by Land cards on player's backfield. Most Land cards do not require souls to play them. All Spells and Units on the front field engage in combat in the Battle Phase, and remaining cards come back to the preparation phase, and repeat until one of them wins the game. The first player to deplete the opponent's Life or Deck by 0 wins the game. If both players' Life or Deck have reached 0 at the same time, offending player takes the win. Playing the game is entirely free. Coins One unique aspects of the game is the coin system. For every battle between units, each player flips up to 5 coins. Depending on how many heads are flipped, a unit's stats (AP/DP/HP) change accordingly, creating drastic changes in battle outcomes. Constructing Deck A deck is made up of 50 cards, with at least one Land card included. It is the core part of the game, and at least one complete deck is required to play the game. A free starter deck is given to all players when their account is first made. Decks can be edited within the server. There are four types of card in Fantasy Masters: Land, Unit, Item, and Spell. Generally, Lands generate souls, Units attack other player's Units or Life/Deck, Items reinforce Units' power, and Spells do various effect to win the battle. *Land: The Land card is the main source of energy. A player can summon unit, item and spell cards using the souls produced by land cards. You can put up to 10 land cards on the land field. *Unit: Unit card is called on the front field and confronts the enemies. It attacks enemy deck directly if there is no enemy unit on the field. On April 16, 2008, a new update from Korean FM has introduced Race and Affiliation system to further distinguish thousands of unit. *Item: Item cards can be put on units on the front field. *Spell: Spell cards are summoned on the front field. A spell card is put upside down on the field so the opponent won't know what it is. The card is flipped when the battle starts. The spell of lower level acts first. If the spells of both sides are of the same level, the attacker's spell hits first. Collecting cards Collecting cards is one of main elements of Fantasy Masters. There are 8 regular ways to collect cards in the Korean version, and many limitations are imposed on players in order to maintain economies of the game. Occasionally players can get free cards from the event held by Zeonix. Ordinarily, cards can be collected from Card Market, Booster Market, Trade, Album, Upgrade, Card Mix, Deck Market, and Auction. Rarity of cards are set by 12 grades. From least to the most, they are: Free, Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legend, while rarity of Basic, Trade, Upgrade, Unique, Special, Prize, and Event grades varies with individual cards. Currently the Korean version has published over 6,700 cards, while English version quickly catching up with over 1,300 published cards. Elements Fantasy Masters consists of seven different elements: Dark, Fire, Water, Green, Metal, Earth, and Light. Event and Legend cards are considered as Light. *Dark: They use their own blood to amplify the damage they give to the enemy. Zombies, Skeletons, Ghosts, Spirits, Deaths, Cursed, and Vampires are the recurring theme of Dark. Most Dark units have negative coins on their HP that is offset by stronger AP or higher HP than other characteristics. Many Dark spells can affect both players' units with favors on Dark side when used at the right moment. A lot of Dark spells associate with Graveyard. They are the color of black. *Fire: The most aggressive army but relatively weak in defense. Demons, Devils, Evildoers, Goblins, Blood, Hell, and Fanatics are the recurring theme of Fire. Most Fire units have negative coins on their DP that is offset by the strongest AP in all characteristics. Fire spells generally do either amplifying friendly units' AP, or direct damage to opponent's units. They are the color of red. *Water: Defense oriented army which is still dreadful with its illusion, confusion, maneuvering skills. Ice, Sea Monsters, Mermaids, Lizard men, Penguins, and Pirates are the recurring theme of Water. Water units generally have higher DP than others while have much weaker AP. Water spells consists of manipulating and weakening opponent's units into demise. They are the color of blue. *Green: They get stronger and fearless when they pack. Elves, Fairies, Druids, Wolves, Treants, Frogs, and Insects are the recurring theme of Green. Many green units and spells heavily favor Beastly type units while Magical and Armed units support them. They are the color of green. *Metal: They represent human empire always ready to conquer, with the help of their advanced weapons and chariots. Humans, Iron, Soldiers, and altered beasts are the recurring theme of Metal. They are the only faction to have high level items that can ridiculously strengthen even the weakest units. Metal spells heavily favor Armed units and Item-equipped units. They are the color of silver. *Earth: The rugged fighters of this army are generally strong. Their strength is reinforced by spells and items. Sand, Giants, Dwarfs, Ettins, Desert, and Stones are the recurring theme of Earth. Earth units are well balanced that greatly depend on coins. Many Earth spells associate with Time. They are the color brown. *Light: Heavenly beings gathered up for earthly combat. They can bless and protect their own units.

Once King Zhou had unleashed a certain edict to create a large pit of spiders and snakes as to feed the seventy-one remaining maidens for holding on to their original Queen, Jiao Ge would decide it best to discuss the issue with Prince Huang Feihu. Once the maidens began to be thrown into the pit, Jiao Ge would immediately present himself before King Zhou and wished for an answer. During Jiao Ge's anger, he would continuously blabber on at the king that killing his own people is equivalent to that of slicing of your own arms and legs. Once the king's anger was well exploded, he ordered that Jiao Ge would be thrown into the pit as well. These would be the last words of Jiao Ge before throwing himself over the Star- Picking Belvedere, \\"You no good bird-brain! Your name will be stinking with cruelty for thousands of years!\\" Thus immediately following this, other random officials would watch in horror as another loyal official killed himself for the sake of his kingdom.

It is native to eastern Canada (Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick) and much of the eastern half of the United States (from southeastern Oklahoma east to eastern South Dakota and north to Maine and Minnesota).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesBiota of North America ProgramFlora of North America v 26 p 550, Galearis spectabilis  Description  Galearis spectabilis can be found in mesic deciduous woodlands in the eastern United States. G. spectabilis begins growth in spring, producing one or two oval, fleshy basal leaves from a rhizome, which persist throughout summer. Flower stalks arise on stems with three to twelve flowers blooming in April to May.Galearis spectabilis MissouriBotanicalGarden.org Accessed 26 April 2016. The flowers are hooded and the namesake of the plant due to the showy, typically bicolored lavender and white flowers. The lavender hood is formed from three fused sepals. Two petals are tucked inside the hood and the labellum (third petal) is longer and white. Plants are slow-growing and form clumps over time via crown offshoots from the rhizome. Pollination of the flower is conducted by long-tongued Bombus, as well as other bees, butterflies, and moths. Besides it alluring colors, G. spectabilis flowers also provide pollinators a nectar reward which collects at the base of the spur. G. spectabilis is typically found on hillsides which may be rocky, damp and near seeps growing under a canopy of deciduous trees in half to deep shade. Plants have also been reported to be found thriving living just about a floodplain, again under a deciduous canopy. Plants are rarely seen in full sun. There are two color variants: G. spectabilis f. gordinierii has an all- white flower, while G. spectabilis f. willeyi has an entirely pink flower.

In 1425, the English captured and hung all the occupants of the castle. The castle was then occupied by Aymon de Massy. In 1432, the English conquered the area and dismantled the castle. After the war, the domain of Maurepas returned to the family of Chevreuse, but the castle remained a ruin. Today, only the keep, which is high, remains on a low motte. A farm leans on the ruins. The keep has been listed by the French Ministry of Culture as a monument historique since 1926.

LSD1 is a flavin-dependent monoamine oxidase, which can demethylate mono- and di-methylated lysines, specifically histone 3, lysines 4 and 9 (H3K4 and H3K9). This enzyme can have roles critical in embryogenesis and tissue-specific differentiation, as well as oocyte growth. KDM1A was the first histone demethylase to be discovered though more than 30 have been described.  Structure  This gene encodes a nuclear protein containing a SWIRM domain, a FAD-binding motif, and an amine oxidase domain. This protein is a component of several histone deacetylase complexes, though it silences genes by functioning as a histone demethylase.  Function  LSD1 (lysine- specific demethylase 1), also known as KDM1, is the first of several protein lysine demethylases discovered. Through a FAD-dependent oxidative reaction, LSD1 specifically removes histone H3K4me2 to H3K4me1 or H3K4me0. When forming a complex with androgen receptor (and possibly other nuclear hormone receptors), LSD1 changes its substrates to H3K9me2. It's now known LSD1 complex mediates a coordinated histone modification switch through enzymatic activities as well as histone modification readers in the complex. Function of KDM1A gene can be effectively examined by siRNA knockdown based on an independent validation.  Interactions  KDM1A has many different binding partners, which may be necessary for its demethylation activity. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), GFI1B was definitively demonstrated to maintain an interaction with KDM1A that is necessary for the proliferation of the disease.  Clinical significance  KDM1A appears to play an important role in the epigenetic \\"reprogramming\\" that occurs when sperm and egg come together to make a zygote. Deletion of the gene for KDM1A can have effects on the growth and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. Deletion in mouse embryos is lethal; embryos do not progress beyond Day 7.5. KDM1A is also thought to play a role in cancer, as poorer outcomes can be correlated with higher expression of this gene. Therefore, the inhibition of KDM1A may be a possible treatment for cancer.  Mutations  De novo mutations to KDM1A have been reported in three patients, each with developmental delays believed to be attributable in part to the mutations. All documented mutations are missense substitutions. One of the affected families has created a public website in order to identify further cases.

This Nisshin Maru was sunk by the submarine in Balabac Strait, Borneo on May 16, 1944. *Nisshin Maru No. 2 (17,579 grt) built by Taiyo Gyogyo, was commissioned in 1937 and was damaged on February 7, 1943 by two torpedoes fired from . One Japanese historian reports that it was then towed and scrapped south of Ishigaki Island on April 16, 1943, while an American source reports that the vessel was sunk on May 6, 1944 by three torpedoes fired from the submarine . General Douglas MacArthur, as military governor of Japan in 1945, encouraged the now defeated Japan to continue whaling in order to provide a cheap source of meat to its starving people, and to supply millions of dollars in oil for the United States and Europe. The Japanese whaling industry quickly recovered as MacArthur authorized the commission of two converted T2 tankers as whaling factory ships (Hashidate MaruIJN Hashidate Maru: Tabular Record of Movement. Imperial Japanese Navy Page (2008) and Nisshin Maru No. 1), to once again hunt whales in the Antarctic and elsewhere. *Nisshin Maru No. 1 (11,803 tons) was originally a standard T2 oil tanker built in the United States during WWII. It was reconstructed by Taiyo Gyogyo in 1945 and commissioned as a Japanese whaling factory in 1946. Nisshin Maru No. 1 was commissioned until the 1950/51 season. After mooring for three years, she reemerged as the factory Kinjo Maru (11,051 tons) and worked from 1954 to 1964. *Nisshin Maru (16,777 tons) was a new whaling factory ship constructed in 1951. It was commissioned in the 1951/52 season to replace Nisshin Maru No. 1 that was being refitted. Nisshin Maru stopped her activity as a whaling factory from the 1969/70 season. After being decommissioned from the whaling business, it worked as an oil tanker supplying fuel oil for fishing vessels on the high seas, and was then sold to the People's Republic of China in April 1973. *Nisshin Maru No. 2 In 1957, Taiyo Gyogoy purchased Abraham Larsen (23,326 tons) from the Republic of South Africa, fitted it out and renamed it Nisshin Maru No. 2 (27,035 tons). Nisshin Maru No.2 was the first ship to be decommissioned as a whaling factory from the beginning of the 1965/66 season, and worked thereafter as the mother ship of a fish meal factory in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. *Nisshin Maru No. 3 The ship was built in 1947 by Gotaverken Cityvarvet of Sweden and was originally named Kosmos III (18,047 tons).NISSHIN MARU NO.3 ‚Äì 5253494 ‚Äì WHALE FACTORY.

This incident took place within the New Zealand Search and Rescue Region. One crew member was killed in the fire. Citing environmental concerns, specifically the disabled ship's proximity to Cape Adare, Antarctica and the world's largest Adelie penguin rookery, New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter joined international citizens' groups in urgently requesting that the ship be towed away. Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR), which used to administer the ship with the Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha, declined offers of a tow from the Greenpeace ship , which had been nearby and monitoring the situation since February 17. On February 28, the ICR released a statement on its decision to cut short its Antarctic whale hunt for 2006/07 due to unrecoverable equipment, and Nisshin Maru departed for Japan.  Other incidents  Nisshin Maru and Greenpeace's collided in December 1999 and in January 2006. In 2006 both ships claimed to have been rammed by the other, and the ICR posted video footage to support its version of the incident. Greenpeace responded that the waves emanating from Arctic Sunrise in the video support Greenpeace's contention that its vessel had its engines in reverse; Greenpeace also claimed the location of cloud formations in the background of the ICR video indicate Nisshin Maru was turning into the Greenpeace ship at the time of collision. Sea Shepherd Conservation Society claimed its president Paul Watson was shot by someone aboard Nisshin Maru during a confrontation with the off Antarctica in 2008. He was wearing a bulletproof vest and was uninjured. An ICR spokesman acknowledged that seven flashbangs were thrown, but stated that \\"no gunshots of any kind\\" were fired. In March 2011, Nisshin Maru returned early from operations in the Southern Ocean and immediately began assisting in disaster relief efforts following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, transporting food, fuel, and other supplies to areas devastated by the catastrophe. In February 2013, Nisshin Maru was involved in a multiple-ship collision, colliding with the Sea Shepherd vessels Steve Irwin, , and , as well as the whaler's refueling ship, Sun Laurel. Bob Barker was damaged and issued a mayday. Sun Laurels lifeboats were also damaged due to the collision.  IMO regulations  Additional regulations from the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) took effect on August 1, 2011 prohibiting ships using heavy oil fuel below 60 degrees south to prevent pollution. The IMO Guidelines For Ships Operating In Ice-Covered Waters also establishes requirements for a double-hull strengthened against ice-related damage. Nisshin Maru did not meet the IMO standards.  In popular culture  Nisshin Maru is featured in the video game Ship Simulator Extremes, along with Kyo Maru # 1 and the Greenpeace vessel Esperanza with its outboard inflatable boats and RIBs. Matthew Barney filmed Drawing Restraint 9 on Nisshin Maru in 2005, as it made its annual journey to Antarctica.

The play is a political satire, written as historical drama. It is based on the life of Nana Phadnavis (1741‚Äì1800), one of the prominent ministers in the court of the Peshwa of Pune and Ghashiram Kotwal, the police chief of the city. Its theme is how men in power give rise to ideologies to serve their purposes, and later destroy them when they become useless. It was first performed on 16 December 1972, by the Progressive Dramatic Association in Pune. Jabbar Patel's production of the play in 1973 is considered a classic in Modern Indian Theatre. Ghasiram Kotwal play at Bharat Bhavan Bhopal History Tendulkar based his play on a 1863 story by author-historian Moroba Kanhoba who tossed together history and fiction to write Ghashiram Kotwal and saw it as something of a simple morality play.' The first performance of this play was at Bharat Natya Mandir in Pune on 16 December 1972. The play initially generated a huge controversy, but has been considered a success in the following years. The play was staged at different venues during a tour of Western Europe in 1980. In 1986, the play toured cities in US and Canada.In 1989, the group took the play on a tour of east European countries of Soviet union, East Germany, Hungary, and Yugoslavia.'‡§ò‡§æ‡§∂‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ' ‡§Ü‡§®‡§Ç‡§¶‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ by Anand Modak ' Synopsis The play begins with an invocation to lord Ganesha. Then the Brahmins of Pune introduce themselves and we can see the morally corrupt state of affairs in Pune. Nana Phadnavis who is the Diwan (Chief Secretary) of Pune is also corrupt and visits the lavani dancer. Ghashiram is working with the lavani dancer. Ghashiram being a Brahmin goes to collect alms at the Peshwa's festival the next day. However he is ill-treated there and is charged with pick-pocketing and imprisoned for the offence. He then decides to take revenge. So the play continues on to reach the next part of this play. Ghashiram barters his own daughter to get the post of Kotwal (police chief) of Pune from Nana. Having got the post he begins to enforce strict rules in the city. He starts asking for permits for everything and starts throwing people in jail for the smallest offences. In the meantime, Ghashiram's daughter becomes pregnant by Nana, and dies during childbirth. The situation goes out of hand when a few brahmins visitors to the city are put in the jail, and die from suffocation due inadequate ventilation in their custody. The Brahmin of Pune then complain to the Peshwa. The Peshwa summons Nana who orders Ghashiram to be killed in the most inhumane way possible. Style The play is notable for the use of the \\"Tamasha\\" form in Marathi folk theatre. Singing and dancing are used here to good effect. \\"Abhangas\\" (devotional songs) are mixed with \\"Lavnis\\" (love songs).

Hence it was temporarily banned in the state. Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi, also a Brahmin, was in the forefront of the anti-Ghasiram agitation in Mumbai, and the party stopped the staging of the play in the metropolis in 1971-72. The play was based on historical facts. Ghashiram was a North Indian Brahmin, a resident of Aurangabad, who was appointed as the Police prefect of Poona on 8 February 1777 and continued to hold officer till his death which took place on 31 August 1791 under violent circumstances. He had earned Nana's confidence by his faithful service during the critical times that followed the Peshwa Narayan Rao's murder. He enjoyed the full trust of Nana Phadnavis and his administration was notoriously worse than that of his predecessors. He was the man who had been appointed to watch the movements and plans of Raghunath Rao and his family and he reported to Nana whatever suited his purpose. He had under him a large body of unscrupulous spies, everyone possessing ample means of harassing people in consequence of which the word Ghashiram has become a permanent synonym for oppression and tyranny. The rule of Ghashiram was cruel and tyrannical. However, there is no historical evidence to support the portrayal of Nana Phadnavis as depicted in the play. The controversy also unfortunately undermines the crucial contribution made by Nana Phadnavis towards India's freedom movement. Film adaptation The play was adapted into a Marathi film, Ghashiram Kotwal (1976), which was the debut film of actor Om Puri. The main characters were played by Prakash Belawadi and Mohan Agashe. The film's screenplay was written by Vijay Tendulkar. The film was directed by K. Hariharan and Mani Kaul in cooperation with 16 graduates of the FTII.

Set in Ancient Rome between Autumn AD 75 and Spring AD 76, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the role of accusers in bringing the various cases to trial during the course of the story. Plot summary Fresh from his trip to Britannia, Marcus Didius Falco needs to re- establish himself back in Rome. A minor role in the trial of a senator entangles him in the machinations of two lawyers: Silus Italicus and Paccius Africanus, both ex-consuls with notorious reputations. The senator is convicted, but then dies, apparently by suicide. Silius hires Falco and his young associates ‚Äì Aelianus and Justinus ‚Äì to prove that it was murder, not an attempt to protect his heirs from further legal action. However, probing this tangle of upper-class secrets leads to fresh prosecutions. Falco finds himself in the role of advocate, exposing himself to powerful elements in Roman law. If he offends the wrong people, it might lead to charges he has not bargained for and ruin his family financially.

The film was released by 20th Century Fox on March 15, 1974. The novel was remade as The Water Is Wide (2006 film), a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie starring Jeff Hephner and Alfre Woodard.  Plot  The story follows a young teacher, Pat Conroy, in 1969 assigned to isolated \\"Yamacraw Island\\" (Daufuskie Island) off the coast of South Carolina and populated mostly by poor black families. He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \\"Conrack\\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the remaining grades, five through eight. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He explains that when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \\"what death would sound like\\". He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \\"the river.\\" As a result, he's fired. As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge. As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  Cast Production This film was shot in and around Brunswick, Georgia and used pupils from C.B. Greer Elementary school as the cast of students.https://www.twilighttimemovies.com/news/georgia-on-their-mind/ Reception=Box office On a budget of $2.37 million, Conrack grossed $2 million in the United States and Canada. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 73% based on 11 reviews, with an average score of 6.08/10. Nora Sayre of The New York Times wrote that \\"despite Mr. Voight's skill, the teacher's character never jells ...

Variety. February 20, 1974. 14. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it as \\"an undeniably tender film full of affecting moments, genuine tension, and much good will.

Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"'Comrack' has Voight's commanding characterization as its center, and those kids, and a strong visual sense throughout. And in its warm concern for human values, it is beyond question a welcome alternative to the hard-edge melodramas which have been conspicuous in recent times. The disappointment is that to achieve a sentimental optimism, it is felt necessary to create a world which, however real it looks and sounds, turns out to be make-believe at its center.\\"Champlin, Charles (March 10, 1974). \\"Madness Motivates in 'Conrack'\\".

John Raisbeck of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"With its lingering long shots Conrack is a constant visual delight; but for all its craftsman-like virtues, it seems a conscious turning aside from the complexities of modern cinema to the simpler alternatives of yesteryear. Indeed, with underpriveleged white children instead of black and Greer Garson substituting for Jon Voight, the film might have been made all of thirty years ago.\\" Release It has never been released on DVD though it remains available through other means, such as VHS as well as online streaming.

It was built under the Baj Basanta dynasty. The area has 72 old temples, which are edifices to the kings of the Pala Dynasty. They portray various scenes from Hindu mythology including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Maluti is known for the annual sacrifice of over 100 goats on Kali Puja, besides one buffalo and a sheep. Animal activist groups have often strongly looked down at this activity. Today Maluti is endangered by insufficient management of the old temples, and threatened by natural disasters. Maluti Temple terracotta works Demographics According to census of 2011; the total number of Houses in Maluti is 325, and the total population is 1469 (male=761, female=708). The total number of children aged 0-6 is 163 (male=93,female=70). 363 people (male=189, female=174) belong to Schedule Castes, and 52 (male=23, female=29) to Schedule Tribes. Maluti village has higher literacy rate compared to Jharkhand overall. In 2011, literacy rate of Maluti village was 75.42% compared to 66.41% in Jharkhand. In Maluti Male literacy stands at 81.29%, while the female literacy rate was 69.28%.https://www.census2011.co.in/data/village/371073-maluti-jharkhand.html History Maluti village came into limelight in fifteenth century as the capital of nankar raj (tax-free kingdom). The kingdom was awarded to one Basanta Roy of villag Katigram by Sultan Alauddin Hussan Shah of Gau·∏ça (1495‚Äì1525). Son of a poor Brahmin Basanta managed to catch the pet hawk of the sultan and gave it back to the sultan. In lieu of the hawk (Baj), Basanta was given the kingdom. Hence, the king was called Raja Baj Basanta. The capital of Baj Basanta dynasty was in Damra. Later it was shifted to Maluti. The royal family was very pious. Basanta became a king in lieu of a baj (hawk) by the help of a Dandi Sanyasi of Sumeru Math, Kashi may be true to a great extent because the word Baj has been pre-fixed with the name of Basanta to commemorate the event. The name Baj Basanta is comparatively prominent because it can be found both in local history and government records. Swamiji, the head of Sumeru Math,https://zeenews.india.com/exclusive/adi-shankara-his-life- andamp-mutts_2033.html Varanasi, was the preceptor of Basanta. Since then the head of Sumeru Math who is called Rajguru becomes the preceptor of descendants of king Baj Banata. Even today Rajguru from Sumeru Math Varanasi spends sometime at Maluti every year. How Maluti ‚Äî the capital of Baj Basanta dynasty ‚Äî turn out to be a 'temple city' is also an interesting story. Instead of constructing palaces, the Rajas built temples. The dynasty was broken into parts (tarafs) but each taraf kept building temples, competing with the others. In the end, it turned out be a unique temple village. Inscriptions in Proto-Bengali on the temples show they were named after women. In another opinion the name of the village Maluti probably comes from Mallahati of Malla Kings of Bankura, Vishnupur had suzerainty over this area. That point of time this area ruled by Malla kings of Bankura was Damin-i-koh ( present pakur in north. Burdwan in the east, Midnapore in south and some portion of Chota Nagpur Plateau in west) This vast land was called Mallabhum. The village might have been named in those days by prefixing 'Malla' in relevance with royal dynasty. Around 1857, Swami Bamdev (or Sadhak Bamakhyapa), one of Bengal‚Äôs greatest spiritual leaders, came here to be a priest but failed because he couldn‚Äôt memorise Sanskrit mantras. He was made to cook food for the puja. During his 18-month stay in Maluti, Bamakhyapa used to spend most of his time at Mauliskshya temple. Here he was first blessed. Then, he moved to Tarapith. His trident is still preserved at Maluti. But Maluti, may not be in this name, existed long before being the kingdom of the tax-exempted capital of Baj Basanta dynasty. It was once revered as a great seat of learning. Mention of Maluti ‚Äî known as Gupta Kashi in ancient times ‚Äî is found as early as the Shunga dynasty (185 BC - 75 BC), whose founder was Pushyamitra Shunga (185 BC - 151 BC). It was at Maluti that the king of Pataliputra performed Ashvamedh Yajna. Later Vajrayani Buddhists, followers of Tantrik rituals, settled here. So, Mauliksha Maa is the most ancient idol ever found in Maluti. It is said that Adi Shankaracharya, on his way to Varanasi, had stopped over at Maluti. And it is here that he launched his mission against Buddhism. Some historians say Maluti is the first place where the Vedic upheaval started. Dandiswami of Varanasi's Sumeru Math still comes here once a year as part of the ritual that began with Adi Shankaracharya. The Pre-History Some pre-historic stone tools found in the river bed of Chila confirm that Maluti used to be inhabited by our pre-historic fore-fathers, though the area was never excavated. The river Chila is flowing at the edge of the village and marks the boundary of Jharkhand and West Bengal. The river originated from Banspahari, a highland in the Dumka district and meet with Dwarka River in Bengal. Stone tools and primitive weapons are found on the river bed at different place. The stone- tools found in the area are hand-axes, scrappers and blades. Plenty of waste materials are also found scattered everywhere on the river bed. These tools belonged to transit period from Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age. The working edge is scattered and is still sharp. Neolithic or Chaleolithic specimens are not found in the village or its vicinity as yet. According to archeologist Prof. Subrata Chakravorty of Visva-Bharati University, the tools belonged to Paleolithic period. Prof. Subrata Chakravorty divided the tools into two broader categories Acheulian and Middle Paleolithic. Some Mesolithic artefacts also are available in the site. Prof. Chakravorty detailed the Acheulian finds discovered from Chila, classification of such tools collected from the site and raw materials used to make those tools. Acheulian found at Maluti Sadarghaton Chila, the river that flows in Birbhum ‚Äì Jharkhand border land. Acheulian finds discovered from three localities one of them fossiliferous include hand axes, cleavers, choppers, scrappers and unqualified wastes, flakes, cores and chips are made of raw materials ‚Äî traps, basalts, quartzites, charts, jasper. The assemblage of Maluti Sadarghat Acheulian sites show preponderance of various other tools such as retouched flakes, side scrappers, end scrappers, point borers and sundry light duty tools. The tools bearing area extends from a point called Sadarghat to an up-stream point named Shirali. The distance between the two points is only a kilometer. The archeological remains of late medieval period inside the village Maluti and availability of pre-historic stone tools from the outskirt have made this village a treasure trove of archeology. Temples of Maluti Temples in Maluti, Jharkhand Today, an important priority of the village Maluti is maintaining its 72 ancient temples. It is alleged that the king of Nankar state originally constructed 108 temples, but later generations could not maintain such a huge number of monuments, and most were left uncared for. With the passing of time, as many as 36 monuments deteriorated and finally crumbled completely. In a 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage, Global Heritage Fund identified Maluti's Temples as one of 12 worldwide sites nearest (\\"On the Verge\\") of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management as primary cause. With regards to the temples' architecture, it is noticed that in the existing temples no particular style, like Nagara, Vesar or Dravida, have been followed. The specialist artisans who were obviously from Bengal had given shape to numerous designs while constructing these temples. Their designs have been assigned to five categories. The main temple of Maluti site is Ma Mauliksha Temple, which is the main deity of royal family of Baj Basanta Ray and Guardian Goddess of Maluti. Interestingly this goddess is not found in Hindu scripture but is found in Vajrayana Buddhism as the Goddess PƒÅndora. Gradually the Buddhist influence of this region tempers down and become a Goddess of Hindu tantra.

The rank was also briefly used by the Royal Air Force for a year and a half, from its creation to August 1919. In the British Army, a major general is the customary rank for the appointment of division commander. In the Royal Marines, the rank of major general is held by the Commandant General. A major general is senior to a brigadier but subordinate to lieutenant general. The rank has a NATO rank code of OF-7, equivalent to a rear admiral in the Royal Navy or an air vice-marshal in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many Commonwealth countries. The rank insignia is the star (or 'pip') of the Order of the Bath, over a crossed sword and baton. In terms of orthography, compound ranks were invariably hyphenated, prior to about 1980. Nowadays the rank is almost equally invariably non-hyphenated. When written as a title, especially before a person's name, both words of the rank are always capitalised, whether using the \\"traditional\\" hyphenated style of, say, the two World Wars, or the modern un-hyphenated style. When used as common nouns, they might be written in lower-case: \\"Major-General Montgomery was one of several major-generals to be promoted at this time.\\" British Army usage In the British Army, a division is commanded by a major general. However, other appointments may also be held by major generals. For example, the Commandant of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is a major general. Until around the 1980s, the heads of each branch of service, such as the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Artillery and the Corps of Infantry, were major- generals. Other, administrative, commands were also appointments for a major- general. In addition, in wartime, the senior officer of the Royal Army Chaplains Department, the Chaplain-General, and similar appointments, were accorded 'the relative precedence' - that is to say the equivalence rather than the full powers and authority - of the rank of major-general. Royal Marines usage The Commandant General Royal Marines has held the rank of major general since 1996, when the post was downgraded from lieutenant general. As in the British Army, a Royal Marine major general ranks below lieutenant general and above brigadier. Royal Air Force usage From its foundation on 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force (RAF) briefly maintained the rank of major-general. The service was a wartime amalgamation of the Army's Royal Flying Corps and the Navy's Royal Naval Air Service, so the Third Service ranks were a compromise between these two traditions. The insignia of the rank was derived from that of a Royal Navy rear-admiral and featured a broad gold stripe on the cuff below one narrow gold stripe. The two stripes were surmounted by an eagle (volant and affronty) under a king's crown. The RAF replaced the rank of major-general with the rank of air vice- marshal on 1 August 1919. Despite the short duration, the significance of the RAF to modern warfare was indicated by the number of senior officers who did wear the rank of major-general in the RAF: *Edward Ashmore *Sefton Brancker *George Cayley *Edward Ellington *Philip Game *The Honorable Sir Frederick Gordon *Frederick Heath-Caldwell *John Higgins *Mark Kerr *Charles Lambe *Charles Longcroft *Godfrey Paine *Geoffrey Salmond *John Salmond *Ernest Swinton *Frederick Sykes *Hugh Trenchard See also *British and U.S. military ranks compared *British Army Other Ranks rank insignia *British Army officer rank insignia NotesReferences External links  *British Army Website Military ranks of the British Army Military ranks of the Royal Marines Former military ranks of the Royal Air Force ","title":"Major-general (United Kingdom)"},{"id":"9575912","text":"Trine Bakke (born 11 January 1975 in Trondheim) is a retired Norwegian alpine skier.

A revised version was included in New Arabian Nights (1882).\\"Stevenson published The Pavilion on the Links in the Cornhill Magazine, in the issues for September and October 1880; two years later, in 1882, he included it in his New Arabian Nights. There is one glaring difference between the two editions: in the first, the story appears as a letter and testament which an old father, as death closes in, leaves for his sons in order to reveal a family secret to them: namely, how he met their mother, who is already dead. In the rest of the text the narrator addresses the readers with the vocative, 'my dear sons', calls the heroine, 'your mother', 'your dear mother', 'the mother of my sons' and call the sinister character, her father, 'your grandfather.' The second version, in book form, goes straight into narration from the first sentence: 'I was a great solitary when I was young'; the heroine is called 'my wife' or by her name, Clara, and the old man is called 'her father' or Huddlestone. This shift usually means a completely different style, indeed a completely different kind of story; instead the corrections are minimal: the excision of the preamble, of the address to the sons, and of the more grief-stricken references to the mother. Everything else remains exactly the same.\\" ‚Äî Calvino, Italo (1999). Why Read the Classics? New York: Pantheon Books, p. 171.

Rolandus, the last Bishop of Roselle, became the first Bishop of Grosseto. The transfer, however, did not proceed without incident. Some of the Canons of the cathedral of Roselle decided to stay in their accustomed home, and therefore demanded an apportionment of the Chapter's property with the Canons who had migrated to Grosseto. The dispute finally was submitted to Rome. On 23 December 1143, Pope Clement III wrote to the Provost and Chapter of Grosseto, ordering that the property and rights (to the tithe, and to death duties, for example) should be divided between the two groups; that the Canons in Roselle should elect their own Prior; but that they owed obedience to the bishop of Grosseto and due reverence to the Chapter of Grosseto.Kehr III, p. 260, no. 9. Ronzani, \\"¬´Prima della ¬´cattedrale¬ª\\". pp. 27-28. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.

Through his enthusiasm, dedication and influence he persuaded the Government and the Welwyn Garden City Development Corporation to establish a Trust for professional artists in Welwyn Garden City, England. It was formally inaugurated by Countess Mountbatten on 29 May 1957. Early years Image:Digswell-house.jpg Digswell House, a decayed Regency mansion with cottages and outbuildings on the edge of Welwyn Garden City, was the first home of the Trust. The house was leased to the Trust to provide accommodation and studios for artists at a modest rent. The first artists moved in at the end of 1957 and over the next 27 years nearly 150 were accommodated there. Some, including Michael Andrews, Ralph Brown, John Brunsdon, James Butler, Peter Collingwood, Hans Coper, Lol Coxhill, Elizabeth Fritsch and John W Mills have become internationally famous. Many other distinguished people including - Henry Moore, Herbert Read, and Roland Penrose, supported the Trust by becoming Trustees or in other important ways. In the early 1980s the Trust was financially unable to continue at Digswell House which was sold for refurbishment and was divided into a number of separate apartments.  1980s to present day  Attimore Hall Barn, a restored 17th century listed building in the Panshangar area of Welwyn Garden City, had been leased in 1979 by the Trust as additional studio space. The Barn became the Trust's base from 1984 until April 2006. English Partnerships had by then taken control of the barn planning to convert it to housing. They worked with the Trust to design a new purpose-built studio building on the site of the former forge in Digswell, on which a 25-year lease was taken in April 2006. In 1993 the Stevenage Borough Council leased the Fairlands Valley Farmhouse to the Trust nearly doubling the available studio space. In 2012, with the support of Letchworth Heritage Foundation, the Trust opened its third studio premises in Fenners Building, Openshaw Way, Letchworth. The new building brings the number of artists supported by the Trust to 45 in 2015.

Set in Ostia Antica during AD 76, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the \\"holiday\\" taken by Infamia, gossip columnist of the Daily Gazette. Plot summary A long and complicated case awaits Falco and Lucius Petronius Longinus (or Petro' for short) on the streets of the port town of Ostia, accompanied by Maia, Helena and Falco's daughters -- Albia, Julia and Favonia. Petro' is on the lookout for Balbinus Florius, a dangerous mobster last seen in Britain, while Falco is on the lookout for a missing gossip columnist named Diocles, an Imperial freedman known by the pen name of \\"Infamia\\" (Latin: \\"scandal\\", \\"calumny\\"). A young boy named Zeno approaches Petro', and tells him that \\"his mother won't wake up\\". Zeno's mother is found unconscious and drooling, and Maia is sent to nurse her - only to end up with a black eye when the woman, Pullia, wakes up. When asked why he told them, Zeno replies to Petro' that his uncle Lygon told Zeno that \\"the vigiles would want to know\\" if Pullia wouldn't wake up. Infamia's colleagues Mutatus and Holconius say that Diocles is gifted but dissolute, and believe that he is playing truant, but Falco suspects otherwise. Continuing on the Infamia case, Falco calls on Diocles' landlady, who admits that she has no idea where he has gone to. Falco bribes one of her slaves, Titus, to hand over Diocles' possessions, which but for one note tablet marked with the name \\"Damagoras\\" and another engraved with a strange grid-shaped pattern, hand no conclusive leads to Falco. Much to Falco's chargrin, the one man in all of Ostia who seems ready to talk about Damagoras and who he is turns out to be none other than Falco's brother-in-law Gaius Baebius, whom Falco loathes greatly. Gaius leads Falco to a large estate up north near Portus, where they are assaulted and confined (and Gaius belatedly tells Falco that Damagoras is rumoured to have been a pirate), and brought out later to meet its ostensibly prosperous owner. Damagoras surprisingly treats them hospitably in the opulent surroundings of his villa, and reveals that he was born in Cilicia (a region in Asia Minor notorious for piracy) but when questioned by Falco about being a pirate, Damagoras instantly denies being one or being connected with them, saying he is a \\"retired sea captain\\" who contacted Deiocles to \\"write his memoirs\\". Falco is not convinced by Damagoras, however, and decides that Damagoras needs to be inspected more closely. Back in Ostia, the local vigiles chief, Brunnus, suggests that Falco talk to an expert on piracy -- a naval officer named Caninus. Caninus, once drunk, however arouses Falco's suspicion: Caninus is a naval attach√© who is supposed to be attached with the Imperial fleet at Ravenna on the Adriatic: if so, then what is he doing on the wrong side of the Italian peninsula? Meanwhile, Aulus comes back to Falco with news -- the wife to the owner of Aulus' ship to Athens, Aline, has been kidnapped. Falco discovers more clues about the kidnapping racket in Ostia, and discovers that the kidnappers' go-between for contacting hostages' relatives is a cross- dressing man known as \\"The Illyrian\\". Seeking more help, Falco returns to Rome on two errands -- the first is Marcus Rubella, Petro's tribune, to inform him of the kidnappings going on in Ostia. The second is to speak to Holconius and Mutatus, but they are out. Nevertheless, a slave in the columnists' office tells Falco the reason Deiocles went back to Ostia - to see his aunt Vestina. En route, Falco meets his father Favonius, who tells Falco that he knows Damagoras as a business partner. Falco's father also reveals that Aline wasn't the first victim -- previously, a young girl named Rhodope had also been abducted. Speaking to Rhodope, Helena manages to discover that she was seduced by one of her former captors, named Theopompus. Back in Ostia, Falco tries to locate Vestina, but discovers that she died in a fire almost a year ago, and that Deiocles would normally stay with her. Falco's sleuthwork also reveal a darker side to law enforcement in Ostia -- the vigiles are seen as heavy- handed and not trustworthy, and so fire fighting and security work is done mostly by members of the local builders' guild, headed by a rich building contractor named Privatus. When Rubella's Sixth Vigiles Cohort arrives in Ostia to take over from the Fourth Cohort of Brunnus, Privatus has his men attempt to intimidate the vigiles at the handing-over ceremony. Naturally, Falco asks Privatus about the whereabouts of Diocles, and notes Privatus' seeming disquiet, implying that Privatus is somehow involved with Diocles' disappearance. More note tablets by Diocles turn up, proving that he had contact with someone who had engaged in piracy, mentioning the name of Lygon -- Zeno's uncle, and possibly one of Damagoras' henchmen. Falco decides that he needs to question Damagoras again, but once more, Damagoras flatly denies anything to do with piracy or the abductions on the quays. At the same time, Falco and Helena manage to meet Falco's uncle Fulvius, whom Falco has not see for twenty years. More trouble is in store for Falco, however: Theopompus elopes with Rhodope in Ostia, but is soon murdered -- ostensibly by jealous colleagues and the wealthy but hapless Posidonius is forced to cough up for Theopompus' wake. Suddenly, Holconius and Mutatus arrive in Ostia, with what seems to be a large chest full of cash in order to ransom back Diocles on Helena's advice. This causes her to have a heated argument with Falco, but he backs down in the end and following Helena's plan, he asks the vigiles to trail the scribes, but the scribes are assaulted by unknown assailants who take the ransom money, and the vigiles lose the trail. Dejected and disgusted, Falco goes for a walk and bumps into Caninus, who tries to convince Falco that his uncle Fulvius is \\"the Illyrian\\", but Falco doesn't believe him and tells Caninus to leave Fulvius alone. Much later, however, Falco catches sight of the alleged kidnappers with the ransom chest, and tails them to a military dock, where they are planning to board a liburna, but is spotted and attacked. Falco, outnumbered, is defeated in the ensuing scuffle and realises that Caninus is connected with the pirates operating in Ostia. Now taken prisoner, Falco discovers that he is on board a pirate ship and confronts her Illyrian captain Cotys. Cotys and his crew taunt Falco and force him to climb down a ladder into the water, but when they discover that the scribes' chest is actually full if pebbles, Cotys cuts the ladder off in anger, dropping Falco overboard. By a twist of fate, Falco is rescued by his father and his father's porter Gornia. It turns out that Geminus has been smuggling goods into Ostia from offshore, possibly with help from Fulvius. Once back, Falco hastily returns into town to attend Theopomous' wake, presided over by Rhodope. As usual, things get out of hand once Rhodope identifies a suspect for Theopomous' death at his wake, sparking a gang war which results in a three- way melee between the Illyrians, Cilicians and the vigiles. Falco, his family as well as Petro' manage to rescue Rhodope from the fight and take refuge in a mausoleum, where she finally reveals that during her captivity she was drugged (possibly by Pullia) and held in a sacrificial vault in a temple. After being rescued along with Petro and the rest, Falco follows Mutatus into a temple to Cybele to meet with Diocles' supposed captors, where he bumps into Fulvius, who reveals that he works for the Navy as an intelligence gatherer, and that he has been watching Caninus, who is the actual \\"Illyrian\\" -- this is soon proven when they hear Caninus demanding the ransom money from Mutatus, before killing him. Caninus is shortly afterwards detained by the vigiles, never to be seen again. But what of Diocles? Damagoras finally breaks his silence and offers Falco information in return for Diocles' note tablets. Damagoras asserts that he and Diocles were indeed working on publishing the old sea dog's memoirs, but Diocles was depressed at having lost his aunt in the fire. Damagoras also warns Falco that Diocles might have blamed Privatus for Vestina's death, and the building guild then had Diocles murdered to silence him. Falco finally figures out what the strange grid pattern in Deiocles' possession was -- it's a map, and shows that Diocles may have been working on the old vigiles station prior to disappearing. The vigiles send for a diver to look for Diocles in a cistern under the vigiles house, and confirm Damagoras' story, when they find a human corpse weighed down deep in it.

A pneumatic saw itself as escaping the doom of the material world via the transcendent knowledge of Sophia's Divine Spark within the soul. In the New Testament a contrast is made between the psychikoi and the pneumatikoi, in the former of whom the mere animal soul predominates, the latter exhibiting the working of a higher spiritual nature (; ; compare also ). In the Valentinian system this contrast is sharpened, and is made to depend on an original difference of nature between the two classes of men, a mythical theory being devised which professed to account for the origin of the different elements in men's nature; the psychic element being something higher and better than the mere material element, but immeasurably inferior to the pneumatic. It may well be believed that in the language of the Gnostic sects, the \\"pneumatici\\" are \\"spiritual men who have attained to the perfect knowledge of God, and been initiated into these mysteries by Achamoth\\" herself (Adv. Haer. I. 6, 1), ordinary Christians being branded as \\"psychici.\\" Such was also the use made of the latter word by Tertullian, who in his latest works, written after his Montanism had involved him in complete separation from the church, habitually uses the word Psychici to designate those from whom he had separated. Descriptive term in religious studies In the academic study of religion and mysticism more generally, pneumatic has been used as a classification term to define similar trends in wider contexts. For example, Joseph G. Weiss describes \\"A Circle of Pneumatics in Pre-Hasidism\\",Chapter in Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism, Joseph Weiss, Littman Library in the context of Jewish mysticism. Here the pneumatic group have minor prophetic powers (\\"Ruah Ha-qodesh\\" in Jewish parlance), such as revealing the sins of their fellows. However they decide to renounce use of this, probably in response to communal suspicion in the wake of the Sabbatean Kabbalistic heresy. The Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, seeks recognition in the group, but is initially hindered by his lower status as a Baal Shem exorcist.

During his six-year tenure with the Phillies, Betts was an ordinary pitcher at best, compiling 18 wins against 27 losses, and a 4.40 ERA. He spent 1926 in the low minors, and then was out of baseball for the next five years. Returning to the big leagues in 1932 with the Boston Braves, at the age of 35 Betts unexpectedly became one of the National League's best pitchers. He finished the season 13-11 with a 2.80 ERA, which was the third best ERA in the NL. He also did well in 1933, going 11-11 with a 2.79 ERA, which again put him in the top 10 of pitchers who qualified for the ERA crown. His ERA went up to 4.06 in 1934, but his won-loss record was the best of his career at 17-10. His career ended the following year, going 2-9 for the woeful 1935 Boston Braves, often identified as one of the worst major league baseball teams of all time. In 10 seasons Betts had a 61‚Äì68 win‚Äìloss record, 307 games, 125 games started, 53 complete games, 8 shutouts, 128 games finished, 16 saves, innings pitched, 1,581 hits allowed, 716 runs allowed, 596 earned runs allowed, 83 home runs allowed, 321 walks, 323 strikeouts, and a 3.93 ERA. He threw a fastball, a curveball, and a screwball. In 1980, Betts was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame. He died in his hometown at the age of 90.

Until 1459, the diocese was immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy), and its bishops attended the Roman synods. In 1459, Pope Pius II made Siena a metropolitan archbishopric.Kehr Italia pontificia III, p. 198. History From September 1407 to January 1408, Siena played host to the papal Court of Pope Gregory XII of the Roman Obedience. In 1423, Siena was host to what was announced as a general council of the Church. Such meetings had been mandated by the Council of Constance, and, though Pope Martin V was most reluctant to have another council like Pisa or Constance, he authorized the assembly to meet in Pavia in the Spring of 1423. On 22 June, however, alleging the presence of the pestilence in Pavia, the Pope transferred the council to Siena. On 21 July 1423 the Council reopened in Siena, though there was only one general session, on 8 November. Work continued until the papal legates dissolved the council on 26 February 1424, though the papal bull of dissolution was not published until 12 March.Carl Joseph Hefele, Histoire des conciles Vol. VII, part 1 (Paris: Letouzey 1916), pp. 610-645, at p. 619, 622. On 22 April 1459, Pope Pius II issued the bull \\"Triumphans Pastor\\", in which he raised the diocese of Siena to metropolitan status, and assigned to it as suffragans the dioceses of Soano, Chiusi, Massa, and Grosseto.: \\"Necnon filias nostras praedictas Suanensem, Clusinensem et Grossetanensem et Massanensem Ecclesias, cum suis civitatibus et dioecesibus, iuribus el pertinentiis universis, Ecclesiae Seuensi et arcbiepiscopis praefatis, tamquam illorum metropolitanis et de eorum provincia....\\" Consolidation The Second Vatican Council, in order to ensure that all Catholics received proper spiritual attention, decreed the reorganization of the diocesan structure of Italy and the consolidation of small and struggling dioceses.In its decree Christus Dominus, section 22, it stated: \\"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. For this reason, obviously, the territory of each diocese should be continuous.\\" In 1980, the diocese of Montalcino claimed a Catholic population of 24,500 persons. Colle di Val d'Elsa had slightly over 60,000. On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. This made the combining of Montalcino and Colle di Val d'Elsa under one bishop infeasible. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Montalcino and Colle be merged with the diocese of Siena, into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Archidioecesis Senensis-Collensis-Ilcinensis. The seat of the diocese was to be in Siena, and the cathedral of Siena was to serve as the cathedral of the merged dioceses. The cathedrals in Montepulciano and Colle were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Siena, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Montepulciano and of Colle.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1987), pp. 783-786. Synods A provincial synod was an irregularly summoned meeting of the Metropolitan Archbishop of an ecclesiastical province with his suffragan bishops and other prelates, for the purpose of legislating for and reforming the collection of dioceses which belonged to the synod. A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.

Cardinal Francesco Maria Tarugi (1597‚Äì1607), Archbishop of Siena, presided over a provincial synod in Siena in 1599, and published the decrees of the assembly. Archbishop Giuseppe Mancini (1824‚Äì1855) held a provincial synod in Siena from 30 June to 7 July 1850. The sessions were attended by four suffragan bishops (Massa e Populonia, Sovana e Pitigliano, Grosseto, and Chiusi e Pienza) as well as two bishops directly dependent upon the Holy See (Arezzo, Montepulciano). The decrees of the synod were published.

It is best known for the ancient south Arabian city of Sumhuram built on the eastern bank. The area represents a popular tourist spot within Oman and is a major breeding ground for birds. The fortified city of Sumhuram was founded as an outpost for the kingdom of Hadhramaut (Hadramautic ê©¢ê©≥ê©ßê©£ê©•ê©© ) at the end of the first century BC, initially it was founded primarily with defensive function then developed later into a city in the first century AD. The foundation of the city by the king of Hardamaut is closely associated with rising importance of sea trade at the end of the first century BC between the Mediterranean and India. In this period, the Hadrami kingdom was economically and politically dependent on its ability to control the coastal region. History Inscriptions at Khor Rori report that the town of Sumhuram (Hadramautic: s1mhrm), was founded on royal initiative and settled by Hadhrami emigrants. The Dhofar region was the main source of frankincense in the ancient period, and it seems likely that the foundation of the settlement by the Hadhramaut was in part motivated by wish to control the production of this valuable commodity. Most scholars identify Khor Rori with the frankincense exporting port of Moscha Limen mentioned in this region in the first century CE merchants guide, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The discovery of Khor Rori / Sumhuram is credited to the English explorer James Theodore Bent, with his wife Mabel, who identified the site during their travels in the region in January 1895. The Bents published their discovery of Khor Rori (Abyssapolis) in Chapter XXI of their work Southern Arabia (London 1900). The site has been excavated by the American Foundation for the Study of Man (AFSM) in the early 1950s and by the Italian Mission to Oman (IMTO) since 1994. The excavations have uncovered the ground plan of the settlement and has attested maritime contacts with the ·∏§a·∏ëramite homeland, India and the Mediterranean. It was inscribed in 2000, along with other sites along the Incense Route in Oman, as part of the World Heritage site \\"Land of Frankincense\\". In 1908, J.G. Lorimer recorded Rakhyut in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, noting its location as the eastern extremity of Dhofar proper. He wrote: Other contexts Some Mormons believe that this is the \\"land Bountiful\\" where Nephi from the Book of Mormon stayed during his travels from Jerusalem (First Nephi, chapter 17).Potter, George and Wellington, Richard.

This act protects sensitive patron information from anyone wishing to obtain it, including a law enforcement or government official, unless a court order is issued and presented.A Review of the Illinois Library Records Confidentiality Act. Michael P. Ragen. Illinois Libraries (Online) 84 no3 1-58 Summer 2002. Major sections of the Act The three major subsections of the Act are presented below: *(a) The registration and circulation records of a library are confidential information. No person shall publish or make any information contained in such records available to the public unless: [exceptions given] *(b) This Section does not prevent a library from publishing or making available to the public reasonable statistical reports regarding library registration and book circulation where those reports are presented so that no individual is identified therein. *(c) For the purpose of this Section, (i) \\"library\\" means any public library or library of an educational, historical or eleemosynary institution, organization or society; (ii) \\"registration records\\" includes any information a library requires a person to provide in order for that person to become eligible to borrow books and other materials and (iii) \\"circulation records\\" includes all information identifying the individual borrowing particular books or materials. Rationale for the Act The rationale behind this piece of legislation begins with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, in so far as the privacy of library records is thought to be an appendage to freedom of speech. There have been numerous attempts through the years by individuals and institutions to gain the sensitive information on a patron's library card, such as law enforcement looking for the identity of someone conducting research on a particular topic, or a professor wanting to review the circulation records of a student accused of plagiarism. Furthermore, it is thought that if patrons cannot be assured that their information is confidential, it produces a \\"chilling effect\\" on a patron's desire for information.Lord, Catherine: Defending Access with Confidence: A Practical Workshop on Intellectual Freedom,American Library Association, 2005 Similar state laws It is worth noting that while forty-eight states and the District of Columbia have confidentiality laws relating to libraries, no two are exactly alike. And for each state, including Illinois, many revisions and additions to this Act have been debated. For example, Illinois has no provision in its Library Records Confidentiality Act that would allow a parent to review the circulation records of their child. However, many state laws do. This is one topic that will continue to be debated at the state level. Future considerations It has also been suggested that section (c)(iii) of the Act needs to be updated to reflect the modern library. The phrase \\"particular books or materials\\" may now need to be expanded to reflect the usage of websites, databases, program attendance, etc. See also * Library Awareness Program References Library law United States state privacy legislation 1984 in law Illinois statutes 1984 in Illinois ","title":"Illinois Library Records Confidentiality Act"},{"id":"9576171","text":"Yeshivat Sha'alvim is a hesder yeshiva, a kollel and a yeshiva high school for boys, located in Kibbutz Sha'alvim .  History  Yeshivat Sha'alvim was founded in 1961 by Rabbi Meir Schlesinger, the rabbi of Kibbutz Sha'alvim. The yeshiva, like the kibbutz, was originally affiliated with Poalei Agudat Yisrael (\\"Agudat Israel Workers\\"), whose ideology can be described as somewhere between that of Agudat Israel and that of the Mizrachi. Rabbi Schlesinger served as the rosh yeshiva for over 30 years. For over 20 years, the highest class was taught by Rabbi Shimon Zelaznik, a student of Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer of Etz Chaim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. A weekly shiur klali (general lecture) was delivered by Rabbi Yitzchak Dzimtrovski, one of the foremost students of Rabbi Shmuel Rozovsky at Ponevezh yeshiva and maggid shiur [lecturer] at Yeshivat Kol Yaakov in Jerusalem. The first mashgiach was Rabbi Yitzchak Gittelman who had been a student of Rabbi Yeruchom Levovitz, Mashgiach at Mir yeshiva. A subsequent mashgiach was Rabbi Moshe Yechiel Tzuriel (Weiss), a prolific author. The period between c. 1970-c. 1985, during which time these rabbis served at Yeshivat Sha'alvim, may be regarded as the yeshiva's golden age. The current heads of the yeshiva (see below) all studied at Yeshivat Sha'alvim during this period. In the early-to-mid-1990s many of the yeshiva's original rabbis began to retire and their positions were filled by graduates of the yeshiva and of other, more strictly Religious Zionist yeshivas. This change coincided with the demise of the Poalei Agudat Yisrael movement and with the growing divide between the National Religious and Haredi movements in Israel. In the following years the yeshiva grew significantly and became the center of a large and flourishing educational campus which includes a kollel (for rabbanut and dayanut), a teachers college, a yeshiva high-school for boys, an ulpana high school for girls, an elementary school and a Talmud Torah. In the early 1990s a National Religious yishuv named Nof Ayalon was built around the Sha'alvim educational campus. Over 400 families live in the yishuv including many graduates of the yeshiva. Graduates of the yeshiva have founded Hesder yeshivas in Karnei Shomron and in Sderot. In recent years the yeshiva has also opened a post-high-school seminary for girls from the United States and other countries, in Jerusalem. Today, the yeshiva is headed by Rabbi Michael Yammer, son of Prof. Max Jammer; the kollel is headed by Rabbi Gidon Binyamin, Rabbi of Nof Ayalon; and the Mashgiach is Rabbi Aryeh Ben Ya'akov, all of whom are former students of the Yeshiva. Other senior rabbis include: (1) Rabbi Moshe Ganz, a former Rosh Kollel at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav and a close personal student of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook. (2) Rabbi Yoel Amital, a graduate of Yeshivat Har Etzion and a close personal student of his father Rabbi Yehuda Amital, (3) Dayan Batat. The Yeshiva reopened their Kollel for Dayanus in 2016.  Overseas program  Yeshivat Sha'alvim has a program for students from the United States and other countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Belgium, Hungary, South Africa or Australia. This program was headed for many years by Rabbi Mallen Galinsky and is headed today by Rabbi Ari Waxman and assisted by Rabbi Aryeh Leibowitz. In recent years the program has grown significantly and over 100 students attend it annually. In the year 2004, Sha'alvim opened a women's division of its overseas program. Sha'alvim for Women is located in Jerusalem and is headed by Rabbi Yamin Goldsmith, an alumnus of the Yeshiva. Approximately 80 young women attend the program annually and another 15 return for a second year of study.  Philosophy  Yeshivat Sha'alvim has had some affinity for the Torah im Derekh Eretz philosophy of German Jewry. Both founding rosh yeshiva Rabbi Schlesinger and former rosh yeshiva Rabbi Yaakovson studied in the Kol Torah yeshiva founded by Rabbi Dr. Yechiel Michel Schlesinger, Rabbi Schlesinger's uncle (headed subsequently, for many years, by Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, of whom they were both students). Both Rabbi Schlesinger and Rabbi Yaakovson are scions of prominent German-Jewish families. Rabbi Schlesinger is the son of Dr. Falk Schlesinger, former director of Sha'arey Tzedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. Other ties to German Jewry, include the phenomenon that many of the students, particularly in the high school, are associated with the German-Jewish founded youth movement Ezra (formerly affiliated with Poalei Agudat Israel). In addition, in 2006 Yeshivat Sha'alvim assumed the control of the Isaac Breuer Institute (also formerly affiliated with Poalei Agudat Israel, founded in memory of the movement's German-Jewish ideologue of that name), which issues the scholarly quarterly HaMa'ayan.  Alumni  Notable alumni of Yeshivat Shaalvim include: *Rabbi David Fendel, rosh yeshiva of the hesder yeshiva in Sderot. *Rabbi David Hirsch, Rosh Yeshiva at Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, an affiliate of Yeshiva University *Rabbi Yona Reiss former dean of Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary *Rabbi Yehuda Turetsky *Rabbi Yitzie Klapper *Rabbi Shalom Rosner *Rabbi Gershon Turetsky, Head of the Beit Midrash at Shaalvim for Women *Rabbi Dovid Kupchik, Principal of the HAFTR Middle School *Levi Cooper *Jon Levisohn  Former Staff  *Rabbi Yechezkel Yaakovson, Former Rosh Yeshiva *Rabbi Aryeh Hendler, Former Deputy Rosh Yeshiva *Rabbi Moshe Yechiel Tzuriel (Weiss), Former Mashgiach *Rabbi Avraham Avidan, Former Rosh Yeshiva *Rabbi Meir Schlesinger, Founder and Former Rosh Yeshiva *Rabbi Shimon Zelaznik *Rabbi Yitzchak Dzimtrovski *Rabbi Yitzchak Gittelman *Rabbi Mallen Galinsky References External links *Yeshiva website (Hebrew version) *Yeshiva website (English version) *Photo of the dais at the Yeshiva's opening Sha'alvim Educational institutions established in 1961 1961 establishments in Israel ","title":"Yeshivat Sha'alvim"},{"id":"9576188","text":"Lene L√∏seth (born 26 November 1986 in √Ölesund) is a Norwegian alpine skier who races for Spjelkavik IL.

History=Imperial China The leaders of the baos were given authority to maintain local order, collect taxes, and organize civil projects. The idea of the system was that it would diminish the government's reliance on mercenaries, and that it would instead assign responsibility of law enforcement to these civil societies. Baojia regulations were issued centrally in 1548, during the Ming dynasty, but the system was not mandatory. Rather, the regulations were more like guidelines for officials who wished to deploy the system in their counties. During Ming dynasty, there was also lijia system to gather taxes, which coincided with baojia. During the Qing dynasty, the baojia system was expanded across all of China. However, Ju Dongzu has written that the system was \\"on the whole ineffective\\" during this time, and \\"remained a formality\\" for several centuries after its introduction. Being primarily the system of self-defense, in 1885, baojia was extended to cover tax collection. This resulted in power abuses and local unrest. Modern China The baojia system has continued to resonate with Chinese citizens during the 20th century. During the boycott of Japanese products that occurred during the May Fourth Movement in 1919, students modeled their resistance on the baojia system. Ten people swore a collective oath to boycott Japanese products, and to make sure that the other nine members of their group upheld their oath. Each member of the group was to attempt to convert nine outsiders to the cause, forming ten groups of ten, which could come together as a group of one hundred. Finally, ten groups of one hundred could meet to form a one thousand person brigade. As with the traditional baojia system, one member of each group of ten became leader of the group. Although no functional group of one thousand ever existed, there is evidence that the ten person groups played an important role in carrying out the boycott. During the later Republic of China era, Chiang Kai-shek pressed for the reintroduction of the baojia system. He Yingqin argued that the baojia system could be used as the basis for the switch from a mercenary to a compulsory military service. The system had some success, but there was great difficulty in finding qualified and willing baozhang, as the position was unpaid. The Japanese also revived the baojia (in Japanese, Tonarigumi) system in Manchukuo on December 22, 1933. In this case, the system's primary purpose was to monitor and control the Chinese citizens. The government instituted a lianzuo punishment system, in which crimes committed by one family in a pai would result in punishment for all ten families in that pai. This gave the paizhang a large incentives to monitor the other families in his pai. The Tonarihumi system was also a self-defense unit and an operational mutual responsibility and surveillance organization. This system lasted until 1937, when the all-out war being waged in East Asia forced the Japanese government to consider more direct and centralized control schemes. On December 1, 1937, a new district and village government system was announced. Taiwan under Japanese rule In Taiwan under Japanese rule, the baojia system inherited from the Qing government was adapted into the Hoko system. The system was an effective mechanism in producing domestic stability and social order for the Japanese government. Structure The structure of the baojia system changed over time. In Wang Anshi's original system, its basic unit was the bao (watch), which consisted of ten families. However, during the Ming dynasty, this ten family unit was instead labeled a jia (tithing), and ten jia (or one hundred families) made a bao. Each jia possessed a placard that rotated among the families. The family holding it at a given time was the jiazhang, or tithing captain. Similarly, the captain of the bao was the baozhang.Brook, 37. There was a great deal of regional variation in the system. In some areas, jia had as few as four families or as many as thirteen. Some Jiangnan counties added an intermediary unit called the dang (compact). This unit consisted of thirty families and had a corresponding dangzhang. During the Qing dynasty, the system's structure changed again. Ten households made up one pai, ten pai constituted one jia, and every ten jia formed a bao. Studies by Philip Huang and Wang Fuming of Baodi County in northeastern Hebei province (now Baodi District, Tianjin) have shown that the lowest quasi-official was the xiangbao, who oversaw about twenty villages and was intended to act as a buffer between the people and the government.Li, 42. When the system was reimplemented in the Republic of China, the structure remained essentially the same, with the exception of the introduction of the lianbao (associated bao), a group of several bao at the district level.

Tuctuc Ltd was an auto rickshaw operator in Brighton, England. It operated for just over a year from the summer of 2006 until late 2007, but opposition from taxi operators and licence breaches \\"made the service unworkable\\" and the vehicles were withdrawn. In 2009 they were used again for weekend sightseeing tours of the city. History The company was started in 2005 by Dominic Ponniah, a British-Asian who got the idea after a business trip in India. Tuctuc Ltd started off with 12 Bajaj Retros in various livery designs, including the Union Jack, a strawberry, Swiss cheese and Burberry check. Ponniah imported the vehicles from India and added some features such as anti-roll bars, seatbelts and rudimentary weather protection. The three-wheeled vehicles had a maximum speed of and ran on compressed natural gas, for which a filling station was provided at Brighton Marina. Ponniah applied for a passenger bus licence to run services on fixed routes between Brighton Marina, central Brighton and central Hove. Brighton and Hove City Council granted the company a licence to operate in October 2005; it was the first licensed auto rickshaw service established outside Asia. After a formal launch at Brighton Racecourse on 6 July 2006, the vehicles began running later that month for the summer season, charging a flat rate of ¬£2.50 for any journey between Brighton railway station, Hove and Brighton Marina. In the same month, Ponniah stated that he intended to import another 12 vehicles in order to start similar operations in London and elsewhere in the United Kingdom: Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh were planned to follow London, where services were expected to start in May 2007. The company immediately faced \\"stiff opposition\\" from taxi drivers. A body representing 1,500 drivers in the city attempted to take legal action against Tuctuc Ltd, initially citing increased congestion and claiming that the vehicles were unsafe, then stating that the service was not operating to a timetable as required by the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981. An investigation by the Traffic commissioner in October 2006 found that the company was failing to operate to its timetables 50% of the time, and the following month levied a fine of ¬£16,500 (reduced on appeal to ¬£8,000) for breaching its passenger bus licence terms. The timetable was then amended, but Ponniah stated this made the operation \\"unworkable\\" and withdrew the service for the winter season. This resulted in another enquiry by the Traffic commissioner, who investigated whether the company's licence had been breached again by ceasing operations without giving a statutory notice period. Another setback occurred in September 2006 when the Burberry-themed rickshaw, known as the \\"Chavrolet\\" and \\"voted the most popular design by the public\\", had to be redesigned after Burberry threatened legal action over trademark infringement. Ponniah announced a revised service in April 2007. Instead of operating along fixed routes to specific destinations, the vehicles would offer pre-booked journeys anywhere in the city, using a different type of public service vehicle licence. Permission was granted to operate up to 30 vehicles, and Ponniah purchased 10 new vehicles with a larger capacity (up to six passengers rather than three). Some of the original three-seater auto rickshaws were retained and stayed in service alongside the six-seaters. The new service began on 23 May 2007, but in January 2008 operations ceased permanently and the Traffic commissioner imposed another fine and revoked the company's licence because of further breaches. No auto rickshaws have run in the city since then, except for a period during the summer of 2008 when some vehicles were used on sightseeing tours of Brighton's tourist attractions.

The park contains statues of Conrad Weiser and of Shikellamy, an Onondaga chief who befriended Weiser and helped him keep the peace on the frontier of colonial Pennsylvania. The Friends of the Conrad Weiser Homestead assist in operating the programs. The house was built in 1729 of native limestone. It was expanded several times over the years but it does include an original single room with fireplace and bake oven and a second room that Weiser added to his home in 1750. The home is decorated with many of the furnishings and household tools that were most common during the frontier era. A family cemetery behind the house is the final resting place of Weiser, his wife Anna and many friendly Indian Chiefs. The life of Conrad Weiser=Early years Conrad Weiser was born in 1696 in the small village of Affst√§tt in Herrenberg, in the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg (now part of Germany), where his father (also John Conrad Weiser), as a member of the W√ºrttemberg Blue Dragoons, was stationed. Soon after Conrad's birth, his father received a discharge from the Blue Dragoons and moved back to the family ancestral home of Gross Aspach. Fever claimed the life of his mother, Anna Magdalena, in 1709 after war, pestilence, and an unusually cold and long winter ravaged the lands. Wallace notes that Conrad Weiser (senior) wrote for his children, \\"Buried beside Her Ancestors, she was a god-fearing woman and much loved by Her neighbors. Her motto was Jesus I live for thee, I die for thee, thine am I in life and death.\\" His family moved to the frontier town of Schoharie, New York by 1710 at the expense of Queen Anne. There the German immigrants were placed into indentured servitude, as per a signed agreement, to burn tar to pay for the journey. When he was only 16, Weiser's father agreed to a chief's proposal for him to live with the Mohawks in the upper Schoharie Valley. During his stay with them in the winter and spring of 1712-1713, Weiser endured hardships of cold, hunger and homesickness, but he learned a great deal about the Mohawk language and the customs of the Iroquois. Conrad Weiser returned to his own people towards the end of July 1713. On November 22, 1720, at the age of 24, he married a young German girl, Anna Eve Feck. In 1723 the couple followed the Susquehanna River south and settled their young family on a farm in Tulpehocken near present-day Reading, Pennsylvania. The couple had fourteen children, but only seven reached adulthood. Service to Pennsylvania right Weiser's colonial service began in 1731. The Iroquois sent Shikellamy, an Oneida chief, as an emissary to other tribes and the British. Shikellamy lived on the Susquehanna River at Shamokin village, near present-day Sunbury, Pennsylvania and Shikellamy State Park. An oral tradition holds that Weiser met Shikellamy while hunting. In any case, the two became friends. When Shikellamy traveled to Philadelphia for a council with the Province of Pennsylvania, he brought Weiser with him. The Iroquois trusted him and considered him an adopted son of the Mohawks. Weiser impressed the Pennsylvania governor and council, which thereafter relied heavily on his services. Weiser also interpreted in a follow-up council in Philadelphia in August, 1732. During the treaty in Philadelphia of 1736, Shikellamy, Weiser and the Pennsylvanians negotiated a deed whereby the Iroquois sold the land drained by the Delaware River and south of the Blue Mountains. Since the Iroquois had never until then laid claim to this land, this purchase represented a significant swing in Pennsylvanian policy toward the Native Americans. William Penn had never taken sides in disputes between tribes, but by this purchase, the Pennsylvanians were favoring the Iroquois over the Lenape. Along with the Walking Purchase of the following year, his treaty exacerbated Pennsylvania-Lenape relations. The results of this policy shift would help induce the Lenape to side with the French during the French and Indian Wars, which would result in many colonial deaths. It did, however, help induce the Iroquois to continue to side with the British over the French. During the winter of 1737, Weiser attempted to broker a peace between southern tribes and the Iroquois. Having survived high snow, freezing temperatures and starvation rations during the six-week journey to the Iroquois capital of Onondaga, he managed to convince the Iroquois not to send any war parties in the spring, but he failed to convince them to send emissaries to parlay with the southern tribes. Impressed with his fortitude in the pursuit of peace, the Iroquois named Weiser \\"Tarachiawagon\\", or \\"Holder of the Heavens.\\" Spill-over violence from a war between the Iroquois and southern tribes such as the Catawba would have drawn first Virginia, and then Pennsylvania, into conflict with the Iroquois. Therefore, this peace-brokering had a profound effect on Native American/colonial relations. In 1742, he interpreted at a treaty with the Iroquois at Philadelphia, at which time they were paid for the land purchased in 1736. During this council, the Onondaga chief Canasatego castigated the Lenape for engaging in land sales, and ordered them to remove their settlements to either the Wyoming Valley or Shamokin village. This accelerated the Lenape migration to the Ohio Valley, which had begun as early as the 1720s. There, they would be positioned to trade with the French, and launch raids as far east as the Susquehanna River during the French and Indian Wars. In 1744, Weiser acted as the interpreter for the Treaty of Lancaster, between representatives of the Iroquois and the colonies of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. During the final day of the treaty, on 1744-07-04, Canasatego, the Onondaga chief, spoke of the Iroquois concepts of political unity: \\"Our wise forefathers established Union and Amity between the Five Nations. This has made us formidable; this has given us great Weight and Authority with our neighboring Nations. We are a powerful Confederacy; and by your observing the same methods, our wise forefathers have taken, you will acquire such Strength and power. Therefore whatever befalls you, never fall out with one another.\\" Benjamin Franklin printed this speech, which influenced American concepts of political unity. Significantly, after the Treaty of Lancaster, both Virginia and Pennsylvania acted as if the Iroquois had sold them the rights to the Ohio Valley, but the Iroquois did not believe they had done so. In 1748, Pennsylvania sent Conrad Weiser to Logstown, a council and trade village on the Ohio River. Here he held council with chiefs representing 10 tribes, including Lenape and Shawnee, and the Iroquois. He arrived at a treaty of friendship between Pennsylvania and these tribes. Threatened by this development and the continued activity of British traders in the Ohio valley, the French redoubled their diplomatic efforts and began to build a string of forts, culminating in Fort Duquesne at present-day Pittsburgh, in 1754. In 1750, he traveled again to Onondaga, he found the political dynamics in the Six Nations had shifted. Canasatego, always pro-British, had died. Several Iroquois tribes were leaning toward the French, although the Mohawks remained pro-British. Early in the summer of 1754, on the eve of the French and Indian War, Weiser was a member of a Pennsylvania delegation to Albany. London had invoked the meeting, hoping to win assurances of Iroquois support in the looming war with the French. Present were representatives of the Iroquois and seven colonies. Because of divisions within both the British and Native American ranks, the council did not result in the treaty of support that the crown desired. Instead, each colony made the best deal it could with individual Iroquois leaders. Weiser was able to negotiate one of the more successful, in which some lower-level chiefs deeded to the colony most of the land remaining in present-day Pennsylvania, including the southwestern part, still claimed by Virginia. Signature of Conrad Weiser. In 1756, Weiser was appointed along with Ben Franklin to construct a series of forts between the Delaware River and the Susquehana River. In the fall of 1758, Weiser attended a council at Easton. Representation included leaders from Pennsylvania, the Iroquois and other Native American tribes. Weiser helped smooth over the tense meeting. With the Treaty of Easton, the tribes in the Ohio Valley agreed to abandon the French. This collapse of Native American support was a factor in the French decision to demolish Fort Duquesne and withdraw from the Forks of the Ohio. Throughout this decades-long career, Weiser's knowledge of Native American languages and culture made him a key player in treaty negotiations, land purchases, and the formulation of Pennsylvania's policies towards Native Americans. Because of his early experiences with the Iroquois, Weiser was inclined to be sympathetic to their interpretation of events, as opposed to the Lenape or the Shawnee. This may have exacerbated Pennsylvanian- Lenape/Shawnee relations, with bloody consequences in the French and Indian Wars. Nevertheless, for many years, he helped to keep the powerful Iroquois, or Six Nations, allied with the British as opposed to the French. This important service contributed to the continued survival of the British colonies and the eventual victory of the British over the French in the French and Indian Wars. Conrad Weiser Homestead The Conrad Weiser Homestead is a Pennsylvania state historic site located in Womelsdorf, Berks County, Pennsylvania which interprets the life of Conrad Weiser. Weiser was an 18th- century German immigrant who served as an Indian interpreter and who helped coordinate Pennsylvania's Indian policy. He played a major role in the history of colonial Pennsylvania. The Conrad Weiser Homestead is located on Rt. 422, within easy driving distance of Philadelphia, Lancaster, Hershey and Harrisburg. The Conrad Weiser Homestead includes period buildings, and a new orientation exhibit, on a Olmsted-designed landscaped park. Conrad Weiser‚Äôs historical contributions to Pennsylvania simply cannot be overlooked. Weiser was predominantly responsible for negotiating every major treaty between the colonial settlers in Pennsylvania and the Iroquois Nations from 1731 until 1758. In addition to serving as one of the most knowledgeable and successful liaisons between the Indian and the colonist, Weiser was chiefly responsible for both the settlement of the town of Reading, Pennsylvania and the establishment of Berks County. Finally, in 1755, Weiser organized a local militia to quell Indian uprisings during the American phase of the Seven Years' War, and was appointed Colonel of the First Battalion of the Pennsylvania Regiment a year later. Exempting some Berks County locals and various individuals with genealogical ties to this man, few are conscious about the relevance, let alone the existence, of Conrad Weiser. Weiser was born in Astaat, Germany in 1696. His family migrated to America in 1710, settling in New York State. It was in this vicinity where he initially gained contact with the Iroquois Nations. At the age of fifteen he voluntarily decided to live amidst the Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois. Conrad attained significant knowledge of not only the language but also the customs and traditions of the Mohawk tribe, which proved invaluable later in his career. For example, Weiser was one of the few Indian/Colonial interpreters who comprehended the overwhelming significance of the use of Wampum in conducting matters of diplomacy with the Iroquois. Weiser moved to the Tulpehocken area in Pennsylvania in 1729, erecting a house upon a farmstead that would eventually contain of land. Weiser‚Äôs knowledge of the Iroquois was immediately employed, as an Oneida Iroquois, Shikellamy, enlisted Weiser‚Äôs abilities as a diplomat to negotiate a series of land ownership treaties between the Pennsylvania colonists and the Indians. Weiser was able to maintain fairly stable relations between the Pennsylvania government and the Iroquois Nation during the 1730s and 1740s. Weiser‚Äôs success in mediating Indian/Colonial politics established a tremendous ethos of credibility in the eyes of the Pennsylvania Government. Weiser was appointed Lancaster County Magistrate in 1741, thrusting him into his first ‚Äúofficial‚Äù role in colonial government. He continued to negotiate territorial matters with the Indians in this position. Then in 1748, Weiser was named one of the commissioners of the town of Reading, in which he bought a plot of land and built a second house. Weiser made several journeys to New York and Central Pennsylvania to attend to matters of Iroquois diplomacy. However, by 1752, Weiser had grown rather exhausted in negotiating with the Indians, and decided to attend to local affairs. Weiser desired to establish a separate county from Lancaster in which the town of Reading would be located. His wish was granted, as the county of Berks was created in 1752. Additionally, Weiser was appointed the county‚Äôs first justice of the peace. The American segment of the Seven Years' War erupted in 1754. An incident in 1755 known as the ‚ÄúPenn‚Äôs Creek Massacre‚Äù left several colonials dead and many others missing in the wake of Indian attacks in northern Pennsylvania. In response to this uprising, Weiser was placed in charge of a local militia in the Tulpehocken region. Then in 1756, Weiser was appointed Colonel of the First Pennsylvania Regiment. Until 1758, he spent most of his time riding between Forts Northkill, Lebanon, and Henry in Berks County as well as other forts under his charge. Weiser conducted his final substantial contribution to Indian/Colonial diplomacy in 1758, negotiating the Treaty of Easton, which concluded the vast majority of Indian insurrection in the eastern third of Pennsylvania. He retired to his house in Reading after completion of this treaty and expired in 1760. Weiser‚Äôs body currently resides in a family burial plot to the west of what was believed to have been his house in the Tulpehocken area. Other careers Between 1734 and 1741, Weiser became a follower of Conrad Beissel, a German Seventh Day Baptist preacher. For six years, he lived at the monastic settlement, Ephrata Cloister, in the Ephrata Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His wife lived there only a few months before returning to their farm. Weiser would visit her frequently enough, however, to father four more children. In addition, he took leaves of absence for diplomatic duties, such as those in 1736 and 1737. Weiser left the cloister in 1741 after becoming disenchanted with the leadership of Beissel and returned to the Lutheran faith of his father. In addition, he followed a mixed career as a farmer, land owner and speculator, tanner, and merchant. He created the plan for the city of Reading in 1748, was a key figure in the creation of Berks County in 1752 and served as its Justice of the Peace until 1760. Conrad was also teacher and a lay minister of the Lutheran Church, and founded Trinity Church in Reading. In 1756, during the French and Indian War, the Lenape began with raids into central Pennsylvania. As Pennsylvania organized a militia, Conrad was made a Lt. Colonel. Working with Benjamin Franklin, he planned and established a series of forts between the Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers. When General Forbes evicted the French from Fort Duquesne in 1758, the threat subsided. Possible museum closure In 2008, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC), proposed to close this and several other historic properties because of a budget deficit and relatively few paying visitors.Planning Our Future: Sustainability Committee Final Report Funding was cut in 2009, and several buildings closed.

Biography After receiving his degree at the University of Berlin in 1863, he became an assistant to pathologist Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs (1819‚Äì1885). Afterwards he was the head of medical clinics in Dorpat (1869‚Äì1871), Bern (1871‚Äì1872), K√∂nigsberg (1872‚Äì1888), and Strasbourg, where he also taught at the Imperial University (1888‚Äì1904). Naunyn is remembered for his work in experimental pathology, particularly metabolic pathology; also referred to as xenobiotic metabolism. It was during the time he spent working at Frerich's clinic in Berlin that he became interested in the metabolic pathology regarding the liver, pancreas and other internal organs. In his studies of the fermentation processes of the stomach, he noticed the \\"contra-fermentation\\" properties of benzene. He discovered that the human organism excreted phenol after it had received benzene. With physician Otto Schultzen (1837‚Äì1875) he discovered that benzene- derived hydrocarbons in the body had the ability to perform chemistry that was not possible for chemists to achieve in a conventional laboratory. With pharmacologist Oswald Schmiedeberg (1838‚Äì1921) and pathologist Edwin Klebs (1834‚Äì1913) he founded Archiv f√ºr experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie (now published as Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology), and in 1896 with surgeon Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850‚Äì1905) he founded Mitteilungen aus dem Grenzgebieten der Medizin und Chirurgie. A famous student of Naunyn's was Otto Loewi (1873‚Äì1961), who was the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1936. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. II of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. Cholelithiasis and diabetes research Naunyn made contributions in his research of cholelithiasis and diabetes. He published an important treatise on diabetes titled Der Diabetes Melitus (1898), and his Klinik der Cholelithiasis was translated into English by Archibald Garrod (1857‚Äì1936) as \\"A treatise on cholelithiasis\\" (1896).WorldCat Search A treatise on cholelithiasis With Oskar Minkowski (1858‚Äì1931), he theorized that bile pigment formation was a function of liver cells alone, however this theory was later disproved by John William McNee in 1913.

Early life and career Winneke was born on 20 October 1908 to the descendants of German immigrants to Victoria. His father, Henry Christian Winneke, was a judge of the County Court of Victoria. Winneke was educated at Ballarat Grammar School, Scotch College and the University of Melbourne, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1929 and a Master of Laws in 1930. He was a hockey player while at university, and was awarded a University Blue as well as playing in an Australian Universities team. From 1930 to 1932, he also held a lieutenant's commission in the Melbourne University Rifles. After doing articles at the solicitors firm Gair & Brahe, he was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 1 May 1931 and called to the Victorian Bar on 30 July 1931. He read as a pupil of Wilfred Fullagar, who was later a judge of the High Court of Australia. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Winneke was commissioned a flying officer (temporary flight lieutenant) in the Citizen Air Force, the reserve component of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), on 9 October 1939. He was subsequently promoted to temporary squadron leader on 12 February 1940, to wing commander on 1 October 1941, and to group captain a month later, when he was appointed Director of Personnel Services. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944. Post-war career Following the end of the Second World War, Winneke left the RAAF returned to practice at the Victorian Bar. He developed a large general practice, and was described by Sir John Young (his successor as Chief Justice) as \\"a very sound lawyer with a clear and penetrating mind\\", and a \\"clear and powerful advocate\\",\\"Obituary\\", [1986] Victorian Reports, pp xi‚Äìxii. He was appointed a Kings Counsel in 1949, Senior Counsel for the Attorney-General and Crown prosecutor in January 1950 before being appointed Solicitor-General for the State of Victoria in 1951, the first non-minister to be appointed. His appointment was the start of the transformation of Solicitors-General in Australia to a quasi-independent statutory office. As Solicitor-General he regularly prosecuted in important Criminal trials, and also appeared for the State of Victoria in Constitutional cases in the High Court of Australia and the Privy Council. While Solicitor- General, he provided robust advice to the Victorian Government and refused to be swayed by political considerations. In 1962 he appeared for the government in the High Court, opposing any further delay to the execution of Robert Tait, who had been convicted of murder. He told the court that Tait would be executed the following day, but the government would comply with an order of the court, if it was made. The High Court then made an order delaying the execution.. Chief justice and governor Winneke was appointed as Chief Justice of Victoria in 1964. According to Sir John Young, he was \\"a model of fairness\\", who delivered judgments which \\"were models of clarity and learning\\". He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria in 1972. In 1974, he retired from office as Chief Justice and became the Governor of Victoria, an office which he occupied with \\"great distinction\\" until 1982. He was knighted in 1957, created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1966, a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1977 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1982. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne in 1978 and Monash University in 1980. Don Chipp said that Winneke had told him in 1971 that the convicted murderer Leith Ratten was innocent. In 1981, when Ratten had yet to be released, Chipp said Winneke denied the conversation had taken place. Later a member of the Supreme Court at the time of Ratten's trial told Tom Molomby that Winneke had wanted to remove the jury from the trial. Such a move would require a belief that the evidence would not support a guilty verdict. Personal life Winneke was married twice, first to Nancy Wilkinson in 1933 by whom he had two sons, John and Michael. Following his first wife's death in 1983, in 1984 he married Ellis Faul, who survived him. His son, John Winneke, was also a judge on the Supreme Court of Victoria, being President of the Court of Appeal from its inception in 1995 until his retirement in 2005. Winneke was a keen golfer and follower of Australian Rules Football, being at one time the number one ticket holder of Hawthorn Football Club.

It is administered by the prefecture- level city of Tonghua and is the southernmost county-level division in the province. Ji'an has an area of and a population of approximately 230,000. The city was given its current status in 1988. Ji'an is separated from Manpo, Chagang Province, North Korea by the Yalu River; it has an international border running . History Archaeological excavations in the Ji'an area have unearthed several Yemaek sites along the Amnok River and its tributary the Hunjiang, which belong to the regional Neolithic and Bronze ages. After the fall of Wiman Joseon to the Han dynasty in 108 BCE, Ji'an was part of Goguryeo County under the administration of Xuantu Commandery. In 3 CE, the second ruler of Goguryeo, King Yuri, moved the state's capital to Gungnae (modern Ji'an) and established the mountain fortress Hwando nearby to defend it. Hwando was sacked by Wei State in 244 CE during the Goguryeo‚ÄìWei War. In 342 CE, Hwando was destroyed and thousands of people captured by the Murong Xianbei, after which Goguryeo focussed on expanding south and east. In 427 CE, the eleventh ruler of Goguryeo, King Jangsu, moved the capital to Pyongyang, which saw Gungnae relegated to subsidiary capital status. The Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom, located in Ji'an and Huanren Manchu Autonomous County, Liaoning, have been listed as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ji'an is also dubbed as a \\"Little Jiangnan\\" of Jilin due to its scenery. Geography and climate Ji'an has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dwa), with long, very cold winters, and very warm, humid summers. Monthly average temperatures range from in January to in July, and the annual mean is .

As in many Isherwood novels, the main character is caught in a contest between his personal egoism and the needs of friends and lovers. The composer Nicholas Maw's 1988 orchestral composition The World in the Evening acknowledges Isherwood's novel as supplying the title for the piece, but there is no other narrative connection.https://issuu.com/fm_fortissimo/docs/nicholas_maw_brochure Structure The novel is narrated in the first person by the protagonist, Stephen Monk, whose experiences are broken into three sections: An End, Letters and Life, and A Beginning. Monk frequently experiences flashbacks triggered by other characters or by the letters of his deceased wife, Elizabeth.

Tech support nerd and comic-book fan Norman Neale discovers that suave co- worker Victor Ventura has telekinetic powers. Neale trains Ventura with the intention of creating a super-hero, but Ventura has other uses for his powers in mind. Character histories Norman Neale: Norman lives a dull life in a small apartment. He works as a computer technician in a large corporation to pay the bills and on the side he works at his favorite comic book store in exchange for free comic books. He also refuses to let Chuck pay him in cash. When he discovers that Victor has superpowers, his first reaction is that Victor could become a superhero. However, Norman discovers too late that Victor becomes the opposite and that it's up to him to stop Victor. Norman seems attracted to Andrea, but is too shy to talk to her. Victor Ventura: Victor works for Richmond Financial, the same corporation as Norman, handling the company's accounts along with Carson. He is a favorite of the boss and has his eyes on an executive position. Victor has had telekinetic powers since he was twelve, though very limited in range. It appears Victor starts his training with sincere purposes. However, it is revealed that he is just a money-hungry businessman who, in the end, turns evil, using his powers to steal money. Andrea Hicks: A receptionist for Richmond Financial. She is attracted to Victor, though he does not notice her. She blames her dead-end position on her gender, a claim that is seemingly true, based on the character of her boss. She is willing to manipulate those around her to get what she wants. Though, in the end she returns to help Norman defeat Victor. Chuck: Chuck runs Excalibur Comics. He has a wife and a son. His business has nearly tripled since he let Norman post his store on the internet, but he cannot convince Norman to take his share in the profits. He offers sage advice without realizing it and believes himself to be an expert on what you should and should not do when writing a comic book. Carson Fleming: A manipulative trader who uses a fake project to try to bed women. His death is what initially drives Victor to work on his powers. Mr. Richmond: CEO of Richmond Financial who plays favorites with Victor, largely it seems for his softball skills. Plot summary Norman Neale and his best friend Chuck have an ongoing debate on the subject of \\"what single superpower would you choose?\\" Then, one day, Norman notices Victor Ventura, a successful trader at Richmond financial, the company he works for. While the two are both getting coffee, Norman accidentally drops a mug. Victor amazingly catches the mug in midair. Though impressed, Norman dismisses it as good reflexes. Later, Mr. Richmond, company CEO, asks Norman to videotape Victor at the company softball game. He notices that as Victor is about to hit the ball, the video momentarily displays static interference, and begins to suspect Victor has Telekinesis. Norman confirms his theory with a small trap, but Victor catches Norman watching and threatens to have him fired if he doesn't back off. Victor knows he has powers, but also fears that if they become public he would be institutionalized and studied. Norman consults Chuck on what to do, and after an initial misunderstanding, Norman lets Chuck continue to believe that Victor is a comic book character of Norman's creation. Chuck suggests training Victor and Norman agrees, but again Victor refuses to go along with it. Meanwhile, Victor's competition, Carson Fleming, introduces the secretary, Andrea Hicks, into a secret project of his. He claims that once he is finished the project and presents it to Mr. Richmond they will both be rewarded. One night Carson and Victor go out drinking. On their way home, Carson slips on a curb and falls into the path of a car. Victor tries to use his powers to save Carson, but isn't strong enough. Carson is run over and killed. Victor returns to Norman and agrees to let him train him. Norman sets about training Victor, increasing his range and strength. The two also discover his weakness; Alcohol causes his concentration to diminish severely, drastically reducing his powers. Norman ends the training by making Victor save him from the same situation he lost Carson in. He then offers to make Victor \\"Victory Man\\", a real life superhero. Victor, mad at Norman for what he pulled, calls him delusional and tells him to go. Later that day, however, Victor decides to treat Norman to one night of crime fighting as payment for the training. The pair run into a gang of street thugs, who threaten them. Victor quickly defeats them with his powers, but then begins to force two of the toughs to do humiliating things to each other. Norman begs Victor to stop and they both leave. Norman tells Chuck that he has given up on Victor, because he has no compassion left. Chuck tells him that he shouldn't give up on his comic-book, because now he has a \\"killer villain\\". Realizing this may be true, he quickly leaves to find Victor. At the same time Andrea shows up at Victor's house, telling Victor that she still wants in on Carson's project. Victor reveals that there was never any project and that it was all a scheme, created by Victor for Carson, to get girls. An argument ensues, but is cut short by the arrival of Norman. As he enters, Andrea is not there, and Norman informs Victor he wants out of the partnership. He also accidentally reveals Chuck as his confidant. Norman leaves and then Andrea is shown to be paralyzed and hidden in the closet. He gets information on chuck from her and heads out to find him. Just after closing time, Victor breaks into Chuck's comic book store and kills Chuck. Victor breaks into Norman's house and demands that Norman help him steal money from Richmond Financial. The two break into the corporate building after dark. Victor reveals that Andrea is being help captive and threatens to hurt her if Norman doesn't continue to help. Before he begins hacking the company computer, he suggests they have an alcoholic drink. Norman only drinks a little, but while waiting a long time for Norman to do his work (Norman was actually stalling), Victor drinks nearly the rest of the bottle. Norman waits until Victor has passed out before going into the men's bathroom, where he takes off his suit to reveal that he is wearing the Victory Man costume. Norman releases Andrea and tells her to run. Then he tapes Victor to a rolling chair and rolls him to the elevator. While waiting for the elevator, Victor comes to, but isn't focused enough to use his powers. Norman reveals that he put sleeping pills into the scotch and that he's turning Victor in. As they talk, Victor regains his focus and attempts to push Norman down the elevator shaft. Before Victor can finish Norman off, however, Andrea returns and knocks him out with a fire extinguisher Norman is interrogated by the police. Norman tries to warn them of Victor's powers, but they refuse to believe it. As a result, Victor breaks free of his hand-cuffs, kills the guard and escapes.

He received a formal education in commerce, after which he took several art courses and, in 1980, he founded Pinguino, for which he created the character Ronnie Fumoso, based on material that was written by Daniele Brolli. His first professional work was his illustration of Brolli's Alan Hassad series, which was published in Italian Orient Express comics magazine in 1980. Since then, he has created numerous other characters, has created advertising art, and has been featured in Penthouse Comix and many other well-known publications . Although some of his work is executed as simple line drawings that he sometimes colors, others‚Äîespecially, his pinups‚Äîare realistic, fully detailed illustrations or paintings. One of his few non-erotic works is the critically acclaimed graphic novel L'inverno di Diego (Diego's Winter) about partisans in Italy during World War II. In 2017 he teamed up with Korero Press to produce a monograph of his work titled Mondo Erotica. Casa HowHard His works include Casa HowHard, which tells anecdotes about the sexual adventures of an apartment full of transsexual residents. Everyone in the building, including the janitor, is a transsexual, who has a feminine face, breasts, a womanly derri√®re, and male genitals. Readers seem either to appreciate the art and to enjoy the stories or to find the former too simple and the latter too silly. The comic book is introduced by Moebius, who suggests that its characters exhibit a ‚Äúguiltless innocence,‚Äù which creates a sense of fun rather than of debauchery. Casa HowHard was followed with 4 sequels: Casa HowHard 2, Casa HowHard 3, Casa HowHard 4 and Casa HowHard 5. Bayba: the 110 BJ‚Äôs Baldazzini has also written and illustrated Bayba: the 110 BJ‚Äôs, in which the title character, a nymphomaniac transsexual sex slave who lives to please men, transforms herself from a slender youth with a boyish figure into a well-endowed, womanly transsexual by applying a high-tech hormonal cr√®me to her chest and then sets out on a self- imposed mission to satisfy as many men as she can by any means possible. Other than their genitals, her partners are seldom shown and rarely speak. When their faces are shown, they have the appearance of anthropomorphic pigs. Bayba undergoes a sex-change operation and then enters the Ultimate Bitch contest, the cash prize for the winning of which is large enough that it would allow her to acquire her ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù to select her own sexual companions. To win, a contestant must break the previously established record by sexually satisfying 110 men in a single day by performing fellatio on them. However, she does not limit herself only to this method of satisfying her partners, and the comic book contains several scenes that have BDSM themes. Other works Baldazzini has also written and illustrated other erotic comic books, some of which feature transsexual characters, including pinups and such titles as: * Beba * Chiara Rosenberg * Ombre D‚ÄôAmore * Risvegli * Shedom * Stella Norris * Sweet Suzy * Trans/EST * Who Killed Betty * 31-12-1999 Selected bibliography=English editions * Mondo Erotica, 2017, Korero Press * Hurricane (with Lorena Canossa), 1991, Catalan Communications * Casa HowHard, 2001, NBM * She- Dom, The Awakening of Clara Rosenberg (with Celestino Pes), 2002, Eros Comix * Casa HowHard 3, 2004, NBM * Bayba - The 110bg‚Äôs, 2005, NBM * Beba ‚Äì Red Domina, 2006, NBM * Casa HowHard 4, 2007, NBM * Lady Brown, 2008, NBM * Casa HowHard 5, 2010, NBM References *Mondo Erotica: The Art of Roberto Baldazzini, Korero Press, 2017, External links * http://www.baldazzini.it/ * http://lambiek.net/artists/b/baldazzini_r.htm 1958 births Living people Italian erotic artists Italian comics artists Fetish artists ","title":"Roberto Baldazzini"},{"id":"9576451","text":"Anthony George \\"Charlie\\" Faulkner (born 27 February 1941, in Newport, Wales)Charlie Faulkner player profile ESPN is a Welsh former rugby union footballer who played in the 1970s and later a rugby coach.

Brigadier is the superior rank to colonel, but subordinate to major-general. It corresponds to the rank of brigadier general in many other nations. The rank has a NATO rank code of OF-6, placing it equivalent to the Royal Navy commodore and the Royal Air Force air commodore ranks and the brigadier general (1-star general) rank of the United States military and numerous other NATO nations. Insignia The rank insignia for a brigadier is a St Edward's Crown over three \\"pips\\" (\\"Bath\\" stars). The rank insignia for a brigadier- general was crossed sword and baton. Usage Brigadier was originally an appointment conferred on colonels (as commodore was an appointment conferred on naval captains) rather than a substantive rank. However, from 1 November 1947 it became a substantive rank in the British Army.\\"Rank of Brigadier\\", The Times, 24 March 1948 The Royal Marines, however, retained it as an acting rank until 1997, when both commodore and brigadier became substantive ranks.Debrett's Historical rank of brigadier general Rank insignia (until 1921) Brigadier-general was formerly a rank or appointment in the British Army and Royal Marines, and briefly in the Royal Air Force. It first appeared in the army in the reign of James II, but did not exist in the Royal Marines until 1913.Senior RM Officers - Promotion , London Gazette In the 1740s, the substantive rank of brigadier-general was suppressed, and thereafter brigadier-general was a temporary appointment only, bestowed on a colonel or lieutenant-colonel (or on a colonel commandant in the Royal Marines) for the duration of a specific command (similar to a commodore). The appointment was abolished in both the Army and the Marines in 1921, being replaced in the Army by the appointments of colonel-commandant (which already existed as a rank in the Marines) and colonel on the staff. These appointments, although reflecting its modern role in the British Army as a senior colonel rather than a junior general, were not well received and were both replaced with brigadier in both the Army and the Marines (although not replacing the substantive rank of colonel commandant in the latter) in 1928.\\"New Army Rank of Brigadier\\", The Times, 23 December 1927 From the formation of the Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918 until 31 July 1919, it used the appointment of brigadier-general. This was superseded by the rank of air commodore on the following day. The rank insignia for appointment of the brigadier-general was a crossed sword and baton; the insignia for higher grades of general consist of this device, with the addition of a star (major general), crown (lieutenant general), or both (\\"full\\" general). Brigadier is the highest field officer rank (hence the absence of the word \\"general\\"), whereas brigadier-general was the lowest general officer \\"rank\\". However, the two ranks are considered equal. Junior officer rank Historically, brigadier and sub-brigadier were the junior officer ranks in the Troops of Horse Guards. This corresponded to French practice, where a brigadier was the cavalry equivalent of a corporal. To reflect the status of the Horse Guards as Household Troops, brigadiers ranked with lieutenants and sub-brigadiers with cornets in other cavalry regiments. When the Horse Guards were disbanded in 1788, the brigadiers and sub- brigadiers of the 1st and 2nd Troops became lieutenants and cornets in the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Life Guards, respectively.

Contents  The text opens with the Shanti hymn prelude, or the peace chant, found in many manuscripts of Sanskrit texts.  Ganesha as the supreme reality  The first verse of the Upanishad proper asserts that Ganesha is the Supreme principle and all pervading metaphysical absolute reality called Brahman in Hinduism. Ganesha is asserted by the text as identical to Om, the Brahman, the Atman or soul, and as the visible manifestation of the Vedic idea Tat tvam asi (you are that) found in the sixth chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad, in a manner similar to Shiva in Shaiva Upanishads, Vishnu in Vaishnava Upanishads, Devi in Shakti Upanishads. > Homage to Lord . '. Reverence to . You are indeed the visible \\"That Thou > Art\\" [tattvamasi]. You indeed produce the universe. You indeed sustain it. > You indeed destroy it. You indeed are the all pervading reality. You are the > manifestation of the eternal self (Brahman).Translation by Courtright (1985) > p. 253 Chinmayananda translates this verse as follows: > (O Lord Ganapati!) You alone are the visible manifestation of the Essence of > the words \\"That thou art\\". You alone are the Doer. You alone are the Creator > and the Sustainer (of the universe). You alone are the Destroyer. Verily You > alone are all this - \\"idam sarvam\\" - in the creation, because You are > Brahman. You are the Eternal Atman in bodily form.\\"Chinmayananda (1985) p. > 125. In Chinmayananda's numbering system this is upamantra 1.  Identification with other deities and with Om  Ganesha is same as Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, all deities, the universe and the Om. Ganesha, asserts the text, is the Absolute, as well the same soul is each of every living being. > You are BrahmƒÅ, Vi≈ü≈Üu, and Rudra [≈öiva]. You are Agni, VƒÅyu, and S≈´rya. You > are Chandrama.

You are Brahman. > You are (the three worlds) Bhuloka, Antariksha-loka, and Swargaloka. You are > Om. (that is to say, You are all this).Chinmayananda (1987) p. 127. In > Chinmayananda's numbering system this is upamantra 8. The verses state Ganesha to be all that is spiritual, the satcitananda, all words, all four levels of speech, all knowledge, all consciousness, the source of all universe, the universe now, that in which the universe will someday be dissolved, the three Gu·πáas of Samkhya philosophy and what is beyond, all states of being, the truth, the oneness, the contentment, the inner bliss.

In > Chinmayananda's numbering system this is part of upamantra 7. This text provides a detailed description of Ganesha's bija mantra ' (Sanskrit: ; ). When this mantra is written using simplified transliteration methods that do not include diacritical marks to represent nasal sounds, it is written as \\"gam\\". This bija mantra is also used in the Ganesha Purana which is generally dated as preceding the Ganapati Atharvasirsa. Courtright translates the passage as follows: > Having uttered the first letter of the word ', ga, then I utter the nasal > sound ' which follows and appears beautifully like the crescent moon. This > is your form. The ga forms the initial letter, the a forms the middle letter > and the ' forms the final letter. To utter this sound [i.e., '] is to utter > all sounds together.Chinmayananda (1987) p. 127.

Gayatri mantra The text includes a Gayatri mantra in verse 8, with Ganesha as the source of inspiration for meditation and knowledge, in Nrichad Gayatri poetic meter. This, states John Grimes, distills the highest human spiritual aspiration. The tooth and trunk in the Ganesha-Gayatri mantra, adds Grimes, embodies symbolism for philosophical and spiritual truths, channeling the attention to physical, intellectual and intuitional self-realization. Colophon The text asserts its own status as an upanishad in its final line, which reads \\"Thus, the \\"; ).This is verse 29 in the Chinmayananda variant.

It forms part of FirstGroup, a company operating transport services across the British Isles and in North America. The company operates within the area covered by Metro, a public body responsible for helping to co-ordinate public transport services in the West Yorkshire area. History First Calderdale & Huddersfield is an amalgamation of First Halifax (formerly First Calderline) and First Huddersfield. The company of today originally formed part of the Yorkshire Rider company in the 1980s and 1990s, which operated most of the services in the West Yorkshire area. The company was formed in 1986 at the time of deregulation with the town suffix at the end of the name, Calderdale was Yorkshire Rider Halifax, Kirklees was Yorkshire Rider Huddersfield. Yorkshire Rider continued operation of services until 1994 when the company was purchased by Badgerline Group, who merged with Grampian Regional Transport in 1995 to form the First Group. The services were renamed Rider Halifax and Rider Huddersfield in 1995 then renamed again the same year, with Rider Halifax changed to Calderline and would also incorporate the Todmorden operation of Yorkshire Rider and Rider Huddersfield changed to Kingfisher. In 1996, the First logo started to appear on services and Calderline and Kingfisher were given their own individual livery, changing from the green and white of Yorkshire Rider. Although Kingfisher would keep green as its main colour, Calderline changed to a white and blue livery. In 1998, the First prefix was adopted to the names of the companies, with Calderline becoming First Calderline and Kingfisher becoming First Kingfisher Huddersfield before being shortened to First Huddersfield. At the turn of the century, the livery of the two companies changed to incorporate First Group's standard livery now seen on the majority of First services in the country. First Calderline renamed itself again in the 2000s as First Halifax before the decision to merge the operation of the First services in West Yorkshire to be called First West Yorkshire, which would consist of First Bradford, First Leeds and First Calderdale & Huddersfield. In 2008, First Huddersfield repainted one of their Alexander Royale's, 30843, in a commemorative livery to celebrate 125 years of buses in Huddersfield. Service A First Calderdale and Huddersfield bus in 'Halifax' branding seen followed by a First Leeds bus on the Headrow in Leeds in 2018. Bus in the 'Halifax' livery First Calderdale & Huddersfield operates services mainly in the Calderdale and Huddersfield areas but also run services into Bradford, Leeds, Wakefield, Burnley, Rochdale, Oldham and Manchester. The services operate from depots in Halifax, Huddersfield and Todmorden, while the 184 service, which operates in the Huddersfield area, is operated from First Greater Manchester's Oldham depot. Service Changes Service run by First Calderdale & Huddersfield will mainly change during Metro's pre-designated dates. There are 6 dates during the year in which buses may change. They are in the final weekend of January, the 3rd weekend of April, the final weekend of July, the 1st weekend of September, the final weekend of October and the 1st or 2nd weekend of December. Occasionally, some services may change outside of these dates but the majority of changes will take place in any of the 6 dates mentioned. The changes are listed around 3 weeks in advance on their website In 2009 it was reported that First along with K-Line Travel and Huddersfield Bus Company will cut services in the Huddersfield area due to the economic downturn. Services to or via: Ashenhurst, Bradford, Clayton West, Dalton, Deighton, Denby Dale, Dewsbury, Halifax, Holmfirth, Kirkheaton, Lepton, Lindley, Lowerhouses, Meltham, Newsome, Quarmby, Slaithwaite and Wakefield will be affected. Overground In the last few years, First has introduced Overground services on services with a frequent daytime service. The Overground is now a prominent fixture on all First bus companies in the UK and is based on the London Underground network with each service having its own colour line. First Calderdale & Huddersfield have more than one Overground route with the same colour, although, to avoid confusion, the Overground is split into two sections, one for the Halifax area and one for the Huddersfield area. The 503 service forms the Orange Line in both areas. HolmfirthCONNECTION From 29 October 2006, buses running between Huddersfield and Holmfirth were re-branded as part of the HolmfirthCONNECTION. This was a service that was run in partnership with First Calderdale & Huddersfield and First TransPennine Express. It was designed to provide a direct bus to train link for passengers travelling from the Holme Valley on the bus to Huddersfield railway station to connect with trains to Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester on TransPennine Express services. Buses 309-316 had their timetables changed and their terminus in Huddersfield moved from the bus station (buses still serve the bus station on journeys towards Holmfirth) to the railway station. The timetable changed to co- ordinate with the trains and included the introduction of a couple of late night journeys between Huddersfield and Holmfirth running after midnight. These service are currently the 314 and X11. Passengers are able to buy tickets on the bus as normal when travelling between the Holme Valley and Huddersfield but were also able to buy tickets on the bus for their train journey as well. The tickets can be bought to be used on the day or for a week. The weekly ticket provides unlimited travel for that week on First buses in the Calderdale and Kirklees areas and on the trains from Huddersfield to Leeds, Dewsbury or Manchester. The offer is an attractive one for people living in the Holme Valley as Holmfirth doesn't have a railway station and their connections to the trains at Huddersfield railway station is made easier as passengers are able to walk off the bus, into the railway station and onto the train without having to queue up for another ticket. This offer is that train travel is restricted to TransPennine Express services and is not valid on any Northern Rail services running along the same routes. The other is that the offer is only available for passengers travelling from the Holme Valley and is not available for people starting their journey on TransPennine Express services from Dewsbury, Leeds or Manchester. In December 2007, First made several changes to its HolmfirthCONNECTION services, withdrawing the 309, 310 and 311 services, extending the daytime 312 service and the 314 service to Holme, extending the 316 service to Parkhead and re-routing the 313 service via Thongsbridge to Holmfirth before continuing to Hepworth. Three express services were introduced, the X10 from Holme to Huddersfield, plus one journey each from the X13 from Hepworth to Huddersfield and the X11 from Parkhead to Huddersfield, both running one journey each. The changes were originally proposed for October 2007 but was delayed following complaints from local residents who were unhappy with some of the changes, especially the 313 service as Jackson Bridge would be left unserved by First. This led to a protest outside Holmfirth bus station. Following consultation with First and Metro, First agreed to provide some buses to run via Jackson Bridge and introduce some peak time express journeys. Also as some compensation, First offered free travel to all passengers of services 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, X10, X13 and X16 on its first weekday service, on 10 December 2007. HolmfirthCONNECTION services underwent changes again in July 2008, with the Monday-Saturday daytime service on service 312 and all journeys on service 315 withdrawn and replaced by new service 308. More changes took place in April 2009, with the 308 terminating at Holmfirth instead of Parkhead, the 314 re- routed between Holmfirth and Holme, the 316 serving Parkhead instead of Holme and the X10 and X16 services replaced by a new X11 service, while in July 2009, all 313A journeys were re-numbered 313. HolmfirthCONNECTION services underwent further changes in April 2013 following the Holme Valley Bus Review. All HolmfirthCONNECTION services now only serve Huddersfield bus station and not the Railway station. Service 313 was withdrawn and replaced by new service 310 which runs identical to the old 313 except not serving Thongsbridge, but instead sticking to the main road (Woodhead Road) between Honley Bridge and Holmfirth. There were also changes to route 308. Instead of turning right to Holmfirth at the end of New Road, the 308 now turns left and runs past Holme Valley Hospital, right down Miry Lane (Thongsbridge), Springwood Road and then right onto New Mill Road, Station Road to Holmfirth bus station. This provides Thongsbridge with an hourly bus service to Huddersfield and Holmfirth. Routes 314 and 316 have remained unchanged. Service 312 was withdrawn which operated on evenings and Sundays which combined the 308 and 316 services. Instead service 308 now delivers an evening and Sunday service to Honley Bradshaw Road. The weekday morning peak time service X13 was withdrawn. MelthamCONNECTION From 27 July 2008, buses running between Huddersfield, Netherton, Marten Nest and Meltham are to be re-branded as part of the MelthamCONNECTION. It is based on the HolmfirthCONNECTION services that was introduced in 2006 to services running between the Holme Valley and Huddersfield. It is designed to provide a direct bus to rail link for passengers travelling from Meltham, Marten Nest and Netherton on the bus to Huddersfield railway station to connect with services to Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester on TransPennine Express services. Buses 321, 323 and 324 will have their timetables changed but unlike the HolmfirthCONNECTION, their terminus in Huddersfield will stay at the bus station and not serve the railway station in Huddersfield. Passengers are able to buy tickets on the bus as normal when travelling to Huddersfield but were also able to buy tickets on the bus for their train journey as well. The tickets can be bought to be used on the day or for a week. The weekly ticket provides unlimited travel for that week on First buses in the Calderdale and Huddersfield areas and on the services from Huddersfield to Leeds, Dewsbury or Manchester. The offer is an attractive one for people living in the Meltham and Netherton areas as they don't have a railway station and their connections to the rail services at Huddersfield railway station is made easier as passengers are able to walk off the bus, into the railway station and onto the rail network without having to queue up for another ticket.

Penguin Great Ideas is a series of largely non-fiction books published by Penguin Books. Titles contained within this series are considered to be world-changing, influential and inspirational. Topics covered include philosophy, politics, science and war. The texts for the series have been extracted from previously published Penguin Classics and Penguin Modern Classics titles and purged of all editorial apparatus, making them appear as standalone texts. The concept of repurposed extracts was inspired by an earlier Penguin series produced in the mid-1990s, the Penguin's 60 Classics, which were extracts of classic texts published in a small book format at the time of Penguin's 60th anniversary. The typographic cover designs of the series have been highly praised, winning prizes such as a D&AD; award in 2005.https://www.dandad.org/awards/professional/2005/editorial- book-design/14646/great-ideas/ The overall series is divided into six series of twenty books, each about one hundred and twenty pages long. Most books contain a notable essay, often by a very well known writer. Some of these are slightly shortened. The third series features additional works by the previous series' most popular writers: Albert Camus, Sigmund Freud, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, George Orwell and John Ruskin. The fourth series includes a third essay by Orwell, and additional works by Michel de Montaigne, Arthur Schopenhauer, Karl Marx and Virginia Woolf. The fifth series was announced as the last in 2010, but after a decade long hiatus a new sixth series is set for release on 24 September 2020. Series six is notable for including a more diverse group of authors. The mission statement of series one to five was: \\"GREAT IDEAS. Throughout history, some books have changed the world.

Star Warped is a farcical 2005 spoof novel by British writer Adam Roberts, based on the six Star Wars films. Roberts has previously parodied the works of J.R.R. Tolkien in The Soddit and The Sellamillion. Plot synopsis The story takes place in the production order of the films, rather than the chronological order, starting with episodes 4-6 and ending with episodes 1-3. The bulk of the story concentrates on the character of Luke Seespotrun as he joins the Rebelend in their struggle against the nefarious forces of the Imperial Empire of the Imperium, trying to prevent them from enslaving the entire galaxy. Due to page restrictions the last three episodes are heavily abbreviated with Episode II being only three chapters and Episode III only one chapter long. The Chapters *Episode IV: A Nude Hope *Episode V: The Empire Strides around in Black *Episode VI: Return of the Son of Jobbi Rides Again *Episode I: The Fans-of-Tron Menace *Episode II: Attack of the Clich√©s *Episode III: Revenge of the Return of the Son of Psmyth Rides Again: the Next Generation - The Early Years Characters *Luke Seespotrun is based on Luke Skywalker. He is brought up on the desert world of Tatuonweiner by his nudist Swedish Uncle Sven and Aunt Svenessa. He suffers from acne. *Princess Leper is based on Princess Leia, and suffers from leprosy. *Old Bony Knobbli / Wobbli Bent Knobbli is based on Obi- Wan. He suffers from arthritis. *C3U-œÄP-HOL-8RA, pronounced \\"See-thru- peephole-bra\\" and often abbreviated as \\"C3\\", is based on C-3PO. *RC-DU¬≤, pronounced Arcee Doodoo, is a human-phobic motile commode based on R2-D2,. *Hand Someman is based on Han Solo. He had both of his lungs shot and replaced by artificial ones during the progress of the first episode. *Masticate tobacco is based on Chewbacca. Being a Woozie, he sleeps six months out of the seven-month year of the Woozies. He finally awakes at the end of Episode VI. *Jane Seespotrun / Dark Father is based on Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader. His mother's name was Dick. In episodes 4-6 he is an urging but a hopelessly bad stand-up comedian, but otherwise true to his origins. *The Emperor / Dark Charlie is based largely on Charles Chaplin's popular character, The Tramp. His voice is lost during Episode III and he is forced to speak with a black sheet of re-writable plastic (in the fashion of silent films). *Yodella is based on Yoda. Rather similar to the original character except he yodels his lessons and wears lederhosen.

It was built by Bull, an early settler of the region, sometime in the 1780s. Bull and his son William IV, on returning home from serving with Gen. George Washington's campaign against the British, had been impressed with the buildings of Baltimore and other Atlantic seaports visited during his military service. The name \\"Brick Castle\\" is shared among a few early brick homes constructed in the area around the same time. Bull, himself a stonemason by trade, decided upon arriving home to build a brick homestead. He is also known for having constructed Gen. Washington's headquarters at Newburgh, NY.

Ostensibly the brick kilns were built on site, but remains have to yet to be recovered. A New York State Historical Register sign on the site states that the building was constructed \\"for a price of $800.00.\\" This statement has never been verified, nor what construction costs it actually covered. The original homestead was a timber cabin with stone foundations. No portions of the original structure are visible. William Bull's descendants were dairy farmers, and the property was maintained as a dairy farm until 1964. Only one other historic structure, an 1830s carriage house, remains on the property. The other outbuildings were destroyed in by fire in 1964. Six generations of the family have lived there, and it remains a private residence for Bull's descendants today. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 25, 1986.

Their first album (the only official release), Rapture, Ye Minions!, was released on Global Symphonic Records on February 14th, 2001. While touring, the band recorded a second session and put out the 8-song tour EP, That's Familiar!, which was only distributed at shows. The band had another unofficial release called Here We Come that included the songs from That's Familiar! and three more, including a new version of \\"Bad Robots\\" from Rapture, Ye Minions! After recording That's Familiar! and Here We Come, Brooklyn Cannon left the band. This caused Steve Simard to move from drums to guitar, and Jeff Allport was brought in as a replacement drummer. Scott Henderson of Sea Of Shit Studios recorded both albums. The band used much of his equipment, and he played a vital role in the sound and whole recording process. He also played with the band, playing guitar for many shows due to Dan's inability to play due to an injury. Atlas Strategic later had plans to put out their next release Ghetto Purchase on a larger label. It was rumored that an album deal with Sub Pop Records was in the works; however, the band broke up in 2002 before any album deals were ever made. Dan Boeckner now co-fronts Wolf Parade. He was also in the duo The Handsome Furs with wife, Alexei Perry. Both of these bands are currently signed to Sub Pop Records. Brooklyn Cannon is now in a band based in Montreal called Total Bummer. Johnny Pollard continued to play with Dave Wenger in Daddy's Hands until Dave's death in November 2006. Johnny is currently planning on starting a band called The Lords Of Discipline.

It is named in honour of Herbert E. Balch who was famous for his exploration of the Caves of the Mendip Hills. The cave was broken into by quarry blasting in November 1961. Much of the cave has since been quarried away and by the end of the 1960s, major sections were destroyed. An exploration in December 1961 found a series of decorated rifts, mainly of sparkling flowstone, with a grotto fillet with pure white stalactites and pillars and a set of \\"organ pipes\\" about wide and high. A further visit in January 1962 explored the fourth chamber which is richly ornamented with white and cream flowstone, several narrow curtains, and miscellaneous white stalactites, and the fifth and sixth chambers with multiple Stalagmite formations. In the subsequent years continued blasting from the quarry breached the central chambers of the cave destroying some of passages, with rockfalls destroying many of the remaining formations, and rendering other sections of the cave inaccessible. Stabilisation work at the end of the quarry's life resulted in the destruction of a further of passage, including the original entrance series and Great Chamber.

It is part of the municipality of Eijsden-Margraten and situated southeast of the municipality of Maastricht, to which it is bordering. Gronsveld was a separate municipality until 1982, when it was merged with Eijsden. The municipality also included Rijckholt, Eckelrade, Heugem (now part of Maastricht) and Honthem. The derivation of the name is uncertain, although it is commonly accepted to be quite literally referring to its evergreen pastures, and indeed the village is favourably situated at the foot of the Margraten Plateau which retains water in its bedrock. This provides for a constant gentle irrigation, and the lush clay soil carried here by the Meuse River is excellent for growing fruit trees. History Gronsveld used to be an autonomous county until the end of the ancienne regime at the closing of the 18th century and was part of the imperial circle of Westphalia. Its first and most famous count was Josse Maximilaan van Gronsveld n√© van Bronckhorst who fought in the Thirty Years' War and invented the Gronsfeld cipher, a substitution cipher. The lords, barons and counts of Gronsfeld had the right to mint their own coins which were frequently banned from circulation elsewhere because of their insufficient weight and/or alloy. Folklore Gronsveld has a rich tradition when it comes to folklore. The local marching band Koninklijke Harmonie van Gronsveld est. 1835 and the Koninklijke Schutterij St. Sebastianus (= historic 'army') est. 1619 are the most well known parts of this. Also, every year the village celebrates the traditional bronck, which dates back to the Middle Ages when the people of the village would honour God in order to get a good harvest. The village is then ruled by a king and his queen. Every four years (most recent occurrence 2004) this position is 'battled' for. Who will be king is determined on Pentecost Monday by a contest where the candidates take turns shooting a wooden bird atop a long pole on the church square. Whoever manages to shoot the bird down will be king. Two weeks after Pentecost the actual celebrations start. During these three days (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) the king and his army make their way through the whole village clearing road blocks (put there as a reminder of the problems they ran into in the old days) along the way. On Sunday there is also a mass and procession through the village. Two weeks after these celebrations, the king and queen treat the whole village to a so-called 'koffietafel' (literally: coffee table). Which includes drinks and the traditional limburgish pastry vlaai. Sights Historic buildings in Gronsveld include the castle and the church built in the 18th century. Another landmark of the village is the Savelsbos, a protected hillside forest. ReferencesExternal links * Map of the former municipality, around 1868.

Brunswick Terrace, on Hove seafront, viewed from Hove Lawns Typical entrance hallway to a Brunswick house converted to flats Brunswick Town is an area in Hove, in the city of Brighton and Hove, England. It is best known for the Regency architecture of the Brunswick estate. History Originally, the area had been part of Wick Farm. Then in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, nearby Brighton had become very fashionable, especially amongst the top tier of British society. The Kemp Town estate there had been a success, and so in 1824 architect Charles Busby entered into an agreement to build houses on land lying at the extreme east of Hove, adjacent to Brighton -- land which belonged to Thomas Read Kemp, creator of Kemp Town.Brunswick Town, by Judy Middleton, 2001. The name \\"Brunswick\\" was presumably taken from House of Brunswick, a term sometimes used for the House of Hanover, the name of the British royal family at the time. Brunswick Town was built as a collaborative project between the architect C A Busby and the landowner Reverend Thomas Scutt (also a clergyman). Construction started in 1824. The first houses were completed by 1826. September in fact. Busby designed Brunswick Town as a long row of terraced houses facing the sea. In the middle point of this sea-facing terrace was a central square, which stretched back. This square was named Brunswick Square. The terraced houses, in Brunswick Terrace and in Brunswick Square, were built for the upper classes, they were designed as 'first class' housing. Beyond these houses were second classes houses in streets such as Waterloo Street. Facilities including a market were provided. The market, opened in 1828, was funded by Busby himself but was not a success and was converted to a riding school in the 1840s. It is now a theatre. In the late 1990s the top of Brunswick Square, where it meets busy Western Road, was closed to motor traffic, changing the nature of the square from a through route to a strictly residential area. At the extreme eastern edge of Brunswick Terrace, on the border of Hove and Brighton, the bluntly modernist Embassy Court apartment block was refurbished in the mid-2000s. When originally envisaged in the 1930s, this lone block was imagined as the beginning of a transformation of the entire seafront, which would have entailed the obliteration of Brunswick Terrace. By the late 1940s Brunswick Square itself had become so run-down that the Council was considering wholesale demolition and redevelopment with modern housing. The basement of 10 Brunswick Square.

He was the first Speaker of the New Zealand Legislative Council. Early life Swainson was born in Lancaster, England on 25 April 1809 and educated in Lancaster Grammar School. His legal education was in Middle Temple and he was called to the bar in 1838. HMS Tyne He worked in conveyancing for only a few years, and with this relatively little experience was appointed to be Attorney-General of New Zealand in 1841. The ship HMS Tyne left England taking Swainson and two other prominent figures in the future of New Zealand law, the Hon Sir William Martin, who was to become the first Chief Justice, and Thomas Outhwaite, who was to become Registrar of the Supreme Court in Auckland, to New Zealand. On the ship the three men began to draft \\"in simple, concise and intelligible language\\" a new system of laws which they planned to be ideal for the new colony of New Zealand.1966 New Zealand Encyclopaedia entry on SWAINSON, William, 1809‚Äì1884 Legal and political activities The Treaty of Waitangi Within six months of their arrival in New Zealand on 25 September 1841, 19 enactments had been passed creating the basis of governance in the new colony. Swainson frequently defended the interests of the MƒÅoris on the issue of land claims from settlers, notably over disputes concerning the Treaty of Waitangi, which had been signed in 1840. George Grey became governor in November 1845. Swainson, Martin and Grey together formulated components of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. Swainson remained Attorney-General until 7 May 1856 when responsible government began in New Zealand. He was replaced as Attorney- General by Frederick Whitaker. Swainson was appointed to the subsequent New Zealand Legislative Council (the upper house) on 26 May 1853 and became its first Speaker, from 16 May 1854. He remained in this position for over a year, to 8 August 1855, when he was also replaced by Frederick Whitaker. Swainson remained a member of the Legislative Council until 18 October 1867 when he was disqualified for absence. Relations with Maori Governor Hobson had earlier declared British sovereignty over the North Island. On 21 May 1840 concerned that the French might do so, he declared sovereignty by right of discovery over the South Island and Stewart Island. This was despite the Treaty of Waitangi not being signed by all Maori chiefs in these areas. At an Executive Council meeting, 29 December 1842, Swainson said that those parts of New Zealand where Maori chiefs refused to sign the Treaty or had not been asked to sign were not British territory. Willoughby Shortland, the Colonial Secretary for New Zealand, who was also at the meeting, asked Swainson to prepare a paper about this. Swainson said it was possible that English law and Maori customary law might coexist. Lord Edward Stanley, Secretary of the Colonies, was angry with the paper when it arrived in England. Stanley's Undersecretary, James Stephen, said that although the declaration of sovereignty might be an unjust breach of faith, it should stand. arrived in Auckland on 25 September 1841 and Swainson bought of land at Judges Bay, Parnell at Taurarua in Auckland. He then erected his pre-fabricated house there which he had brought with him on the Tyne. A hospital which treated Maori was erected nearby. A Maori man, Mohi Horowhenua te Puatau, was a patient there. Mohi's wife and child died and Mohi was employed by Swainson as a boatman and handyman. Mohi was to accompany Swainson from then on for the rest of Swainson's life, including at Wellington synod meetings and in a canoe trip around Waiheke Island, where Mohi's hap≈´ was and his wife buried. In 1880 Mohi lived in a whare (a Maori house) east of Swainson's house. Swaison described Mohi in his will as his \\"old friend\\". When Mohi was on his deathbed in 1890 Isa Outhwaite, the daughter of Thomas Outhwaite, Swainson's old friend and Court Registrar, was at the bedside. Governor Grey had visited Mohi daily during his last days and Grey led Mohi's funeral procession. In the words of Swainson's biographer, John Stacpoole, Mohi was buried \\"no more than a leap away from Swainson's grave.\\" Swainson died a bachelor in Auckland, on 1 December 1884. Ecclesiastical activities Bishop Selwyn approached him to help create the basis of an independent church, tied to the Church of England, by drafting its constitution, although the church never became the established religion. In 1866 Swainson became chancellor of the Anglican Diocese of Auckland.

The newly formed municipality is called Gulpen-Wittem. The town itself derives its name from the river Gulp, which runs straight through the centre of the village and characterises the townscape. There is a Romanesque tower in the old cemetery, which dates from the 11th Century and is the only still existing part of a mediaeval village church. Considering its construction (its walls are up to 2 metres thick) and its location, it probably also served as defence tower, where the local villagers could go in case of danger. The former rectory, which leans against the tower, dates from 1732. It is now being let as luxurious group accommodation. The current Neo- Romanesque St.Petrus church dates from 1924 and was designed by Casper Franssen. A former monastery that was built in 1932 after a design by Alphons Boosten is being used as town hall. The village is home to the Gulpener Brewery. Every year in June, a walking tour of 70 kilometres is organised that is called the Nacht van Gulpen (Night of Gulpen). A little over a thousand people participate in this event each year.

He had been East Norfolk's MP since he was first elected as a Liberal at the 1929 general election, when he gained the seat from the Conservatives. He joined the breakaway National Liberals in 1931, and at the following General election was not opposed by the Conservatives.  Previous Result  Candidates  Only two candidates contested the by-election: Frank Medlicott for the National Liberals, and Norman Tillett for the Labour Party. Medlicott was a 36-year-old London solicitor who had not contested an election since standing for the Liberal party at Acton in 1929. Tillett was a Norwich solicitor, whose great-grandfather and uncle were both Liberal MPs for Norwich. Tillett had fought the seat at the last General Election. A number of local Conservatives who were unhappy about supporting Medlicott tried to get an Independent Conservative candidate to stand. For a while, it seemed as if James F. Wright, the Secretary of the Norfolk Farmers Union would run as an Independent Conservative, but by close of nominations, there were just the two candidates.  Result  Medlicott held the seat for the National Liberals, with a reduced but still substantial majority.

He was head of the Borjigin clan. Campaigns Khabul Khan entered history as a result of his clashes with the Jurchens, a people who lived in Manchuria who later established the Jin dynasty in 1115, and gradually took control over Manchuria. In alliance with the Chinese Song dynasty, they attacked the Liao dynasty, and by 1122 had captured a significant portion of Liao territory. In 1135, Khabul Khan was invited to the court of the Emperor Taizong of Jin, where he famously pulled the emperor‚Äôs beard. The Jin army pursued him into southern Mongolia, but Khabul eluded capture and returned with a larger army to pillage the Jin dynasty.Erich Haenisch, Die Geheime Geschichte der Mongolen, Leipzig 1948, p.7 (=section 52) When the Jin army then entered Mongolia with the intention of conquering the territories ruled by the Emperor Dezong of Liao, the founder of the Qara Khitai, or Western Liao dynasty, it was Khabul Khan who put together a Mongol confederation and led the successful effort to repel this invasion. The confederation was called the Khamag Mongol (or \\"Whole Mongol\\") and consisted of the four core clans: Khiyad, Taichuud, Jalairs, and Jirukhen. It is ‚Äúsometimes‚Ä¶considered a predecessor state‚Äù of Genghis Khan‚Äôs empire. When the Jurchen accepted their defeat, they recognized Khabul Khan, in 1146 or 1147, as the paramount ruler of the Mongols, although they still ‚Äúofficially considered him their vassal.‚Äù Khabul Khan has been described as having ‚Äúexpanded his Mongol tribe and achieved incredible triumph in suppressing the Tatar tribes,‚Äù an accomplishment in which he was aided by his son Yasukai. His activities during his reign marked the first attempts to politically unify the Mongols. Though Khabul Khan had 7 sons, he nominated Ambaghai, a son of Sengun Bilge from Taichuud clan, as his successor. Descendants and legacy Khabul Khan had seven sons, the oldest being Okin-barkhakh and the second oldest Bartan the Valiant. Bartan, in turn, fathered Yesugei, the father of Genghis Khan. The Khabul Khan‚Äôs third son was Mongler, who fathered Buri the wrestler. Khabul is considered important today because of his establishment of the Mongol state.

He is regarded as a martyr of the anti- Fascist struggle of the Slovene population in the Slovene Littoral region during Italian rule.  Biography  Bratu≈æ was born in a Slovene-speaking family in the town of Gorizia, then the center of the Austro-Hungarian County of Gorizia and Gradisca. He was educated in the town's Slovene schools and chose a career in music. After the Slovene Littoral and the adjacent regions of Inner Carniola were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy under the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920, Bratu≈æ remained loyal to his Slovene origins and resisted the forced Italianization of the region, which was populated by a Slovene majority. Initially, he taught singing and was a choirmaster in the village of ≈†martno in the Gorizia Hills north of Gorizia, and later in a small seminary in Gorizia. In 1929, he was imprisoned for a short time by the Fascist authorities due to his Slovene patriotism. In 1930, he was appointed coordinator of church choirs in the Gorizia region by the archbishop of Gorizia, Franƒçi≈°ek Borgia Sedej. He led the only choirs in Slovene allowed by authorities in the Gorizia region (in the Gorizia Hills, Vipava Valley, Soƒça Valley, and upper Karst Plateau). On December 27, 1936, a group of Fascists kidnapped Bratu≈æ in Piedimonte del Calvario (now a suburb of Gorizia) immediately after the Mass, where he had been conducting a choir. He was taken to a nearby building, where he was brutally beaten and forced to drink castor oil mixed with gasoline and motor oil. He was unable to recover from this poisoning, and he died a month and a half later in the Gorizia central hospital. A few days before his death, his supporters gathered beneath the hospital window, sang a Slovene song, and then fled before the authorities could arrest them. Thus Lojze Bratu≈æ soon became a symbol of Fascist persecution of Slovenes in the Julian March. During his life, Bratu≈æ set several poems to music and arranged them for choirs. Today a Slovene mixed choir from Gorizia and a Slovene cultural center in Gorizia bear his name. He was married to the poet Ljubka ≈†orli.

Singer is also the founder and CEO of NML Capital Limited, a Cayman Islands company. Singer's philanthropic activities include financial support for LGBTQ rights. He has provided funding to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, is a strong opponent of raising taxes for the wealthiest 1% of taxpayers and opposes aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. Singer is active in Republican Party politics and Singer and others affiliated with Elliott Management are collectively \\"the top source of contributions\\" to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Fortune magazine described Singer as one of the \\"smartest and toughest money managers\\" in the hedge fund industry. A number of sources have branded him a \\"vulture capitalist\\", largely on account of his role at EMC, which has been called a vulture fund. He has been criticized for ruining the town of Sidney, Nebraska by forcing Cabela's to merge with Bass Pro Shops. The Independent has described him as \\"a pioneer in the business of buying up sovereign bonds on the cheap, and then going after countries for unpaid debts.\\" In 1996 Singer began using the strategy of purchasing sovereign debt from nations in or near default‚Äîsuch as Argentina, and Peru‚Äîthrough his NML Capital Limited and Republic of the Congo through Kensington International Inc. Singer's practice of purchasing distressed debt from companies and sovereign states and pursuing full payment through the courts has led to criticism.Spat between Samsung and NYC Hedge Fund takes nasty detour into Jew-baiting, The Observer (07/2015) Singer and EMC defend their model as \\"a fight against charlatans who refuse to play by the market's rules\\", and supporters of the practice have said it \\"help[s] keep kleptocratic governments in check.\\" Early life Singer was born in 1944, and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey in a Jewish family,Guttman, Nathan. \\"Paul Singer, the GOP‚Äôs 'Anti-Adelson', Makes His Move\\", The Forward, February 2, 2016. Accessed August 19, 2017. \\"Singer grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey, one of three children in a Jewish family.\\" one of three children of a Manhattan pharmacist and a homemaker. He obtained his B.S. in psychology from the University of Rochester in 1966 and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1969. In 1974 Singer went to work as an attorney in the real estate division of the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Career=Elliott Management In 1977, with a convertible arbitrage \\"winning formula,\\" Singer left law to create his own investment company. He founded the hedge fund Elliott Associates L.P. with US$1.3 million in seed capital from various friends and family members. According to The Telegraph in 2011, Elliott is \\"one of the oldest hedge funds on Wall Street.\\" Singer is also the founder and CEO of NML Capital Limited, a Cayman Islands-based offshore unit of Elliott Management Corporation. According to Fortune, Elliott has been involved \\"in most of the big post-crash restructurings.\\" In 2009 The Guardian reported that Singer \\"through a brilliantly complex financial manoeuvre, took control of Delphi Automotive, the sole supplier of most of the auto parts needed by General Motors and Chrysler.\\" Ultimately, the US Treasury paid Elliott Management \\"$12.9 billion in cash and subsidies from the US Treasury's auto bailout fund.\\" In December 2011 Elliott Associates sued Vietnam's state-owned shipbuilder Vinashin in the UK for defaulting the year before on a US$600 million syndicated loan. In February 2014 Elliott controlled $23 billion (¬£19 billion) of funds and was the ninth largest investor on Wall Street. In June 2015 Elliott was an active activist investor with Citrix Systems, pushing for various changes. In May 2014 the French Financial Markets Regulator fined Elliott a record ‚Ç¨14 million ($22 million) for insider trading, a ruling which the company appealed. In a long-standing dispute between Singer and members of the Lee family over a merger between Samsung and Cheil Industries, in 2015 Samsung published numerous cartoons of Singer as an anthropomorphic vulture on its corporate website. The cartoons were denounced by Singer and others as antisemitic. Samsung responded several days later denouncing antisemitism, and pulled the images from their website. Forbes rated Singer's net worth as $2.1 billion in 2015 and $2.2 billion in 2016. As of November 2015 Elliott Management Corporation oversees Elliott Associates and Elliott International Limited, which together have more than $27 billion in assets under management in a \\"multi-strategy fund.\\" The corporation includes a private equity division. Termed a \\"specialist in activism in technology companies\\" by the Wall Street Journal in June 2015, Elliott Management's varied portfolio also includes a prominent tech component. The company pursued \\"more than 40 campaigns aimed at tech companies\\" between 2004 and 2015, according to Reuters. in 2018, Elliott Management took control of Italian football club A.C. Milan. On February 1, 2020, several weeks before many Americans had heard of COVID-19, Singer wrote a memo to his employees about preparing for the possibility of being quarantined for at least a month due to the virus. Sovereign debt In 1996 Elliott bought defaulted Peruvian debt for $11.4 million. Elliott won a $58 million judgment and Peru had to repay the sum in full under the pari passu rule. When former president of Peru Alberto Fujimori was attempting to flee the country due to human rights abuses and corruption, Singer confiscated his jet and offered to let him leave the country in exchange for the $58 million payment from the treasury. Fujimori accepted. In the 1990s the Kensington International division of EMC purchased US$30 million (¬£18m) of \\"Congolese sovereign debt... allegedly for less than $20m.\\" Kensington subsequently spent years trying to be paid in full through the courts. In 2008 Kensington and the Republic of Congo settled for an undisclosed amount. After Argentina defaulted on its debt in 2002, the Elliott-owned company NML Capital Limited refused to accept the Argentine offer to pay less than 30 cents per dollar of debt. Elliott sued Argentina for the debt's value, and the lower UK courts found that Argentina had state immunity. Elliott successfully appealed the case to the UK Supreme Court, which ruled that Elliott had the right to attempt to seize Argentine property in the United Kingdom, and on October 2, 2012, Singer arranged for a Ghanaian Court order to detain an Argentine naval vessel in a Ghanaian port in an effort to force Argentina to pay the debt, but was rebuffed when the seizure was barred by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.Ed Stocker, \\"Argentina welcomes home ship held in Ghana by US 'vulture fund'\\", The Independent, January 9, 2013 In February 2013 the U.S. appeals court heard Argentina's appeal in the case of its default and debt to NML. In March 2013 Argentina offered a new plan, which was dismissed first by the lower courts and then the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on August 23, 2013, and then again in June 2014 in the U.S. Supreme Court. In March 2014 NML Capital unsuccessfully attempted to satisfy court awards by suing SpaceX, seeking the rights to two satellite-launch contracts bought by Argentina valued at $113 million. In early 2016 US courts ruled that Argentina must make full payments to holdout bondholders by February 29. In February 2016 Argentina reached an agreement with Singer.Daniel Pollack: \\"El acuerdo se termina si el pago no se hace antes del 14 de abril\\" Singer has been called a vulture capitalist because of Elliott Management Corporation's investments in distressed debt. Business and investment model According to Fortune, Singer focused from early times \\"on distressed assets,\\" buying up bankrupt firms' debt and acquiring \\"a reputation for strong-arming his way to profit.\\" Fortune noted in 2012 that losses sustained early in Singer's career led to a \\"risk aversion that still guides his investing today. Thanks to his caution, by 2012 Elliott had \\"only two down years\\" since 1977, rising \\"4.2% in 2011, a year in which most hedge funds lost money.\\" Describing him as \\"one of the smartest and toughest money managers in the business\\", the article further notes that his firm \\"is so influential that fear of its tactics helped shape the current 2012 Greek debt restructuring.\\" Elliott was termed by The Independent as \\"a pioneer in the business of buying up sovereign bonds on the cheap, and then going after countries for unpaid debts.\\" Singer describes his business model as \\"a fight against charlatans who refuse to play by the market's rules,\\" and in 2013 Singer told Alpha Magazine that \\"we've made the point over and over again that sovereigns that could pay their debts and choose not to may be attempting to save some money but are harming their people and their economies by making investing in their countries more risky and more problematic and by discouraging foreign investment.\\" In response, The Washington Post wrote in 2014 that \\"in Singer's view, he isn't just forcing indebted companies and countries to pay up. He's trying to create a world where distressed debt doesn't exist. Depending on your own views, that makes Singer an activist investor, or a 'vulture capitalist.'\\" Philanthropy Singer signed The Giving Pledge, which signals a commitment by individuals to donate more than half of their wealth within their lifetime to address society's \\"most difficult moral and economic challenges.\\" Singer founded the Paul E. Singer Family Foundation, which supports charitable causes including the Harvard Graduate School of Education Singer Prize for Excellence in Secondary Teaching, VH1 Save The Music Foundation, the Food Bank For New York City, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund, the American Unity Fund, the New York City Police Foundation, MarineParents.com, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and the Melanoma Research Alliance. Singer and The Paul E. Singer Family Foundation are behind The Philos Project, a pro-Israel Christian organization. In 2016 Singer partnered with the Museum of the Bible to fund Passages Israel, a program to take college students to Israel. He is a \\"longtime supporter of hawkish pro-Israel causes\\" and a major funder of the conservative think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. In November 2018, after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the Paul E. Singer Family Foundation announced it would donate $1 million to upgrade security at Jewish institutions in New York. The funds will be given to the United Jewish Appeal ‚Äì Federation of New York, which will then distribute them as needed to individual synagogues, day schools, and community centers for safety reviews and enhanced precautions. Singer also serves on the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School and the board of directors of Commentary Magazine. Political activity Singer is an active participant in Republican Party politics. He is a \\"self-proclaimed conservative libertarian\\". According to The New York Times, he supports \\"like-minded candidates who often share his distaste for what they view as governmental over-meddling in the financial industry.\\" Singer has contributed more than $1 million to the political efforts of the Koch brothers. In 2014, Singer led a group of major Republican donors to form the American Opportunity Alliance, a group that brings together wealthy Republican donors who share Singer's support for LGBTQ rights, immigration reform and Israel. During the 2016 Presidential election campaign Singer supported Marco Rubio and donated a million dollars in March to the Our Principles PAC, a PAC attempting to derail Donald Trump's election campaign. He also started the American Unity PAC. He supported Trump's inaugural committee with $1 million together with 25 other billionaires. Singer was a major contributor to George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. On March 14, 2008, Singer hosted a Republican National Committee luncheon in his home for 70 guests that raised $1.4 million for Bush. Bush appointed Singer to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008. In 2007 Singer was one of Rudolph Giuliani's most important fundraisers in Giuliani's bid for the Republican presidential nomination. In 2007, Singer led a financial industry fund-raising effort for Giuliani, first as regional finance chair and later as senior policy adviser. Singer lent Giuliani his private jet. That same year, Singer at $175,000 was the sole contributor to a campaign to support a petition drive for a proposed California initiative to apportion the state's 55 electoral votes by congressional district. At least 19 of the state's 53 congressional districts were expected to vote for a GOP presidential candidate, enough to change the national results in a close election.Andrew Malcolm, \\"Giuliani fundraiser was mystery initiative backer\\", Los Angeles Times, November 28, 2007 Singer was one of the largest donors of the 2010 midterm election cycle, contributing more than $4 million to support Republican candidates. In 2011 Singer donated $1 million to Restore Our Future, a Super PAC created to support Mitt Romney in the 2012 U.S. Presidential election. In 2013, Singer gave $100,000 to the Club for Growth, a 501(c)4 organization that supports Tea Party candidates. He has also donated millions of dollars to organizations that advocate for a strong military and for supporting Israel. In 2012 Singer founded the nonprofit Start-up Nation Central, an NGO aimed at developing collaboration between Israel's tech sector and outside investors. Singer has invested around $20 million into Start-Up Nation Central, which is based in Tel Aviv. Singer is a member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a non-governmental, nonpartisan research organization. He is chairman of the board of trustees for the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank in New York City, and on the board of directors of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a political lobbying group in the United States that promotes Jewish Republicans. He also served on the board of directors for the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. In 2016 Singer invested $500,000 in a PAC supporting John Faso, a Congressional candidate in New York's 19th congressional district opposing progressive candidate and Wall Street critic Zephyr Teachout. Teachout responded to the donation by challenging Singer to come to the district and debate her. The same year, Singer supported Senator Marco Rubio in the presidential primary. As of September 2019, Singer had not donated to Trump's reelection campaign. LGBTQ rights As well as contributing to private initiatives, Singer also actively seeks to persuade other Republicans to support gay marriage. He has joined other Wall Street executives in support of LGBT equality and stated that same-sex marriage promotes \\"family stability\\" and that in a time when \\"the institution of marriage in America has utterly collapsed,\\" the fact that gay couples want to marry \\"is kind of a lovely thing and a cool thing and a wonderful thing.\\" Singer, whose son Andrew married his husband Corey Morris in a same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2009, has also financially supported the legalization of gay marriage in New York and Maryland. In 2011 this advocacy included supporting legislation allowing same-sex marriage in the state of New York. In 2012 Singer provided $1 million to start a Political Action Committee named American Unity PAC. According to the New York Times, the PAC's \\"sole mission will be to encourage Republican candidates to support same-sex marriage, in part by helping them to feel financially shielded from any blowback from well-funded groups that oppose it.\\" In 2014 Singer urged Republicans to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This bill requires workplace protections to extend to the LGBT community. As of June 2014 Singer had donated an estimated $10 million to the gay rights movement. Singer also funded the American Unity Fund. In 2015 Singer, Tim Gill and Daniel Loeb helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States. The Washington Free Beacon According to an October 27, 2017, article in The New York Times, the initial sponsor of anti-Trump opposition research conducted by the controversial Washington D.C. firm Fusion GPS was The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political journalism website that is \\"funded in large part\\" by Singer. Writings and commentary Singer has written columns in the Wall Street Journal. In 2009 he wrote \\"Free-Marketeers Should Welcome Some Regulation,\\" a column in which he argued that \\"It's true that monetary policy was too lax for too long, and the government encouraged lending to people who were unlikely to repay their loans. But this crisis was primarily caused by managements and individuals throughout the financial system who exercised extremely poor judgement. The private sector, not the public sector, is where the biggest mistakes were made.\\" Among other topics, he has written against raising taxes for the wealthiest taxpayers (\\"the 1%\\") and aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. At a September 2006 financial conference in New York City, Singer delivered a speech called \\"Complexity Made Simple,\\" advising that the purchase of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) was a serious mistake, and anticipating the downturn of the housing market by nearly a year before the $770 billion taxpayer-funded bailout. Hedge fund manager Jim Chanos said in an August 2009 radio interview that he and Singer had met with G7 finance ministers in 2007 to warn them that the global financial system was increasingly unstable and approaching a catastrophe, with banks on the verge of sinking the global economy. The pair argued that decisive action was called for, but Chanos claims they were met with indifference. Personal life In 2015 Singer was 327th on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans, 1006th among the world's billionaires, and the 16th highest earning hedge fund manager. He has two sons, Andrew and Gordon. After Andrew came out as gay, \\"[I reacted] with fear and nervousness, I worried about the health aspects ... grandfatherhood\\", Singer said. But he eventually became a steadfast supporter of gay rights. In 2012 he launched the American Unity PAC, which aims to persuade fellow conservatives to support same-sex marriage. He has actively supported same-sex marriage campaigns and makes large donations to LGBT groups. Singer lives on New York City's Upper West Side and has a house in Aspen, Colorado. He began studying classical piano at the age of 10, and forms part of a family band, together with \\"one of his sons on guitar, the other on drums\\", and \\"his son- in-law on saxophone.\\" He enjoys Led Zeppelin and has played onstage with Meat Loaf. He is a fan of Arsenal F.C.  Honors  In 2017, Singer received an honorary doctorate from the University of Rochester.

Originally christened on April 5, 1879 as Ricardo Benjamin Jacobs, he later changed his name, once by reversing the order of his first and middle name, and then in some records by anglicizing the name Ricardo to Richard. His mother was the accomplished and well-educated daughter of a noted French merchant in Valpara√≠so. At the time of his birth, his father was the American vice-consul to Peru. A businessman with many interests in the United States, including mining, his father also was engaged in mining in several countries in South America and he published the Imprenta Americana and a semi- weekly newspaper, El Tumbes. When the War of the Pacific broke out between Chile and the united forces of Bolivia and Peru, his family moved to Oakland, California, the state where his father had resided previously and retained business interests. They soon moved to Tucson, Arizona. In 1880, his father opened the Jacobs Assay Office (still in operation by his descendants). During the 1880s through the 1890s, Washington M. Jacobs managed varied mining interests, and was elected Justice of the Peace of the Tucson Precinct of Pima County in 1887, serving for two years. Benjamin Jacobs grew up in multi- cultural Tucson and learned the basics of chemistry in his father's assay and chemical laboratory. He also worked in the family mining businesses in Arizona and Mexico, one of which at Ajo, Arizona later became a major copper producer. After his father's death in 1899, Benjamin Jacobs relocated his mother and younger sisters to Oakland, where nearby, he attended and briefly taught chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Education and major contributions He obtained his Ph.D. in chemistry and concentrated upon what now would be called biochemistry, studying food and nutrition. He developed the process for enrichment of milled grains, cereals, and flours--establishing the standards for the processes and overseeing their application among the producers of the products. Enriched flours of refined grains and cereals now are common in the diets of humans. He also identified the nutritional characteristics of foods eaten in the daily diet of humans, and discovered the chemical processes that were entailed in the transformation of raw materials into foods through preparation and cooking. Providing useful guidelines, he described methods to retain as much of the nutrition in foods as possible during the growing, processing, cooking, and serving of food. Professional career Before Jacobs was twenty-seven years old, he had established a successful scientific laboratory in San Francisco and was conducting his own research, when on April 18, 1906, his laboratory was destroyed during the earthquake and the resulting fires that created one of the nation's greatest disasters and destroyed many parts of the city. His equipment and all records of his research were lost. Relocating to Washington, D.C., Benjamin R. Jacobs joined the federal agency, the Bureau of Chemistry (now the Food and Drug Administration, [FDA]) of the United States Department of Agriculture, with which he had a long association. Some of his work was under the auspices of in the Food Control Laboratory of the department. His first experiments and publication dealt with the adulteration of flour and the enforcement of stricter controls on industry under the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. He also worked with one of the first women chemists in the department, Hannah L. Wessling. During this time with the government he also participated in the Distribution Division of the United States Food Administration, which was formed to deal with daunting issues regarding food distribution during World War I. He participated for a great portion of the time of the existence of the division, through to the withdrawal of the principal license regulations. He traveled the country and into Canada as an investigator for Herbert C. Hoover's Federal Food Administration. In 1917 a federal war-time food control act was passed when crop failures in Europe laid the burden of feeding the populations of both continents, the British Isles, and the armies of the allies‚Äîupon the United States. This effort intervened in the supply and demand process that always had functioned in the marketplace for food, both in the supply process and in the profits taken, to assure that both civilians and the armed forces had enough food to survive the famine that was threatening to develop, even establishing a rationing system and the control of prices. Two draft registration cards for him are presented on ancestry.com, where he lists his name as Benjamin Richard Jacobs. The first is dated September 12, 1918 for World War I and the second is for World War II, but it bears no date. Among the personal notes about members of what is now the American Chemical Society, in the November 1920 issue of the Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, is an announcement that Jacobs was leaving the federal government. He re-established his own laboratories, the National Cereal Products Laboratory, with facilities in Washington, D.C. and Manhattan. The address of the Manhattan facility is listed on his WWII draft registration as 156 Chambers Street. He remained as a consultant, however, to the Bureau of Chemistry throughout his lifetime. Jacobs also was retained throughout the rest of his life by C.F. Mueller Company to oversee the nutritional enrichment of their macaroni, noodles, and pasta products as they developed the nationally distributed brand that is still a recognized leader in the food industry. Benjamin R. Jacobs was a member of the American Chemical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who often presented reports about his research before their members in national and regional meetings and he was a frequent contributor to their scientific journals, Science and the Journal of the American Chemical Society. His research also was reported in other scientific publications of the day, such as the American Food Journal, and he served as the president of the National Noodle and Macaroni Association of America. Personal information Gravestone of Benjamin R. Jacobs and Margaret Connell Jacobs at Arlington National Cemetery His daughters, Irene (1905 - ) and Millicent (1907 - ), were born to his first wife, Sarah, who died when the children were young. After raising his daughters as a single father, he married Margaret Ann Connell of Washington, D.C., who was assistant to Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American Federation of Labor. In order to have his new wife travel worldwide with him as he did for enjoyment as well as for his professional activities, according to her niece, Marie Connell, he wanted Margaret to resign her work. Reluctant to give up her professional career, she required that he would have to pay her salary, with annual increases, for the rest of her life‚Äîtotally above any household or joint expenses. They maintained residences at the historic landmark, the Kennedy-Warren in Washington, D.C., in the historic College Park section of Orlando, Florida, in Essex Fells in New Jersey, and in Kennebunkport, Maine. At the age of eighty-three, Jacobs died in Orlando, Florida. Following services at Gawler's Funeral Home in Washington, D.C., he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery and was honored as a veteran with his rank being identified as, captain. His wife, Margaret Connell Jacobs, was buried with him a decade later in 1973, also dying at the age of eighty-three.

He first appeared in Superman Vol. 2, #58 (August 1991) and was created by Dan Jurgens. Publication history The executive director of Project Cadmus, the post- crisis version of Jack Kirby's DNA Project, Westfield was revealed to be in charge of the project in issue #58 of Superman. An unscrupulous director ironically hired for his ethics, he appeared in issues of Superman, Superman: The Man of Steel, Adventures of Superman and volume three of Superboy. A noteworthy story was his plan on creating a clone to take Superman's place during multiple issues of the Funeral For A Friend storyline after The Death of Superman event. This led to the debut of Superboy (Kon-El) in the following Reign of the Supermen! crossover event. Fictional character biography=Project: Bloodhound After a career in the United States military as a soldier, Paul Westfield became the Executive Director of Project Cadmus, a secret government agency based outside of Metropolis. When the Guardian, head of security at Cadmus, fought the vigilante Gangbuster (who was revealed to be an entranced Superman),Adventures Of Superman #450 (1989)Superman Vol. 2, #27 (1989) he reported his encounter to Westfield. Westfield felt that Superman was a potential threat to Earth and in response to Guardian's report, he began the early phase of a counter measure he devised called Project: Bloodhound and monitored Superman for months. After incidents involving the Krypton Man, Westfield was convinced that Superman's mental state was deteriorating and sends the \\"dogs\\" of the project - Mac, Blood, and Tracker - to capture him. While captured, Superman's mind was probed by the DNA Alien Dubbilex and his thoughts were transferred to a computer. After Superman was rescued by the Hairies, advanced humanoid creations of Cadmus, Westfield, Guardian, and Dubbilex learned from the probe that Superman reluctantly killed three Kryptonians (General Zod, Zaora, and Quex-Ul) who killed every being on a pocket universe Earth.Superman Vol. 2, #22 (1988) The computer and files were destroyed by the Guardian, who was behind Superman's rescue along with Dubbilex, but Westfield still had information on Superman in his head and believed that he had enough evidence for a congressional report against him.

Westfield relented.Superman Vol. 2, #58 (1991) Death and return of Superman Westfield wanted Cadmus to create a cloned replacement for the fallen Superman. Lex Luthor (posing as his own son in a clone body) and his security force Team Luthor intervened with the planned retrieval of Superman's body by federal authority. A team of Cadmus troops, accompanied by Westfield, steals Superman's body from the tomb. At Project Cadmus, the original plan to clone Superman via a DNA sample was unsuccessful as all cloning techniques were proven useless on his Kryptonian body. Superman's body was given an electron capillary scan by the other directors of Cadmus and the results along with educated guesswork created data stored on a disc that contained an approximation of Superman's genetic code. Westfield wanted to create the clone of Superman immediately and sends Auron, a cybernetic super-soldier cloned from The Guardian and created by Westfield's secret genetic engineering team, to retrieve the disk by force via the code word \\"Sanction Blue\\". Before Westfield could obtain the disk, the clones of the original Newsboy Legion convinced Auron that he was just like the original Guardian based on having a link with him via his DNA. He rebels against Westfield and departs with the digital DNA disk to protect Superman's legacy.Adventures Of Superman #499 (1993)Legacy of Superman #1 (1993) After the refusal of the other directors to make a new scan and the retrieval of Superman's body by Lois Lane, Supergirl, and Lex Luthor (who actively tried to stop any effort to resurrect Superman by cloning), Westfield and his secret team of scientists genetically altered a human clone to look like Superman and made the clone to be the closest human equivalent to a Kryptonian as they could based on their research. Carl Packard, the project head of Auron's creation, was the project head for the clone's creation and was given full authority to explore whatever methods to create the clone while Westfield provided him with the DNA cellstock. After twelve failed attempts, the thirteenth clone known as Experiment 13 was grown from a single cell to a teenage boy in less than a week. The clone was given implanted memories and underwent an artificial maturation process to match the age of the original Superman. During the maturation, the clone was to be programmed with command words like Auron to be under Westfield's control, but the clone's mind refused all mental programming.Adventures of Superman #500/4 ~ Superboy Vol. 3, #0 (June, 1993) The clone escaped from Cadmus due to the actions of the Newsboy Legion clones. He became the fourth \\"Superman\\" claiming to be Superman resurrected and refused to be called \\"Superboy\\". Following Reign of the Supermen!, Superboy reveals on television that he was a result of Cadmus' DNA experiments and that Cadmus was after him after Westfield secretly sent \\"Payback DNAliens\\" to capture Superboy. He later sends the Guardian and the clone returned to Cadmus with Superman & the Guardian. Superboy learned from the scientists of Project Cadmus that he was created from only human DNA and was genetically engineered to both look like Superman and mimic his major powers by a telekinetic field. After learning the truth, Superboy agreed to let Superman have the rights to the name \\"Superman\\", trademark and symbol while Superman agreed to let him use the \\"Superboy\\" name. Superboy decides to go on a world tour to establish his new name and Project Cadmus assigns Dubbilex to chaperone Superboy.Adventures of Superman #506 (1993) Battle for Metropolis In the \\"Battle of Metropolis\\" story arc, a clone plague erupts into open warfare in the streets of Metropolis between Westfield's Project Cadmus and Lex Luthor's Lexcorp when Lex Luthor contracts the clone virus and accuses Project Cadmus of infecting him. The Underworlders, exiled creations of Cadmus led by Clawster, took advantage of the conflict between the two forces to attack Cadmus troops and innocent civilians. Westfield tries to exterminate the Underworlders with a missile aimed at the heart of Metropolis, but the missile was destroyed by Superman. Dabney Donovan, the creator of the Underworlders and the true mastermind behind the clone virus, murders Westfield and cuts off Westfield's ear as a trophy. As a result of the conflict, the Project Cadmus facility was destroyed, but in reality Cadmus went underground and used the destruction as a cover.Superman Vol 2 #90 (June, 1994)Adventures of Superman #513 (June, 1994) After a restructuring of Project Cadmus, his replacement Mickey Cannon would become the sole director of Project Cadmus with all other directors removed. Legacy It was revealed that Superboy's cellstock, preserved by Carl Packard at the ruins of the former Cadmus facility, was on file at Cadmus' computer database. Superboy was a cellular match to a director and only the head of security or the Executive Director had full access to their cellblocks. It is later revealed to Superboy, Carl Packard, and the directors of Cadmus that Superboy was created from the cellstock of Paul Westfield. Westfield revealed via a recorded message to his superiors that he secretly provided his own genetic material based on his belief that the clone would follow Westfield's own thinking as Auron did with the Guardian.Superboy Vol. 3, Annual #2 Westfield's preserved cellstock proved to be unusable when Superboy's DNA was unraveling and Roxy Leech, one of Superboy's closest friends, became his new DNA pattern during the \\"Meltdown\\" arc in volume three of Superboy.Superboy Vol. 3, #41 During the \\"Hypertension\\" story arc of the Superboy series, a Superboy from another Hypertime reality was grown to full age to become Superman, but later became Black Zero in the midst of anti-clone sentiment. Black Zero conquered his world and the Paul Westfield of his universe, considered a father figure to him, was placed in charge. Black Zero \\"rescued\\" other worlds in which he felt that clones were being oppressed and left the conquered world's version of Paul Westfield in charge of the clones of that world. One of the Westfields was personally responsible for the death of his alternate reality's Superboy with the latter surviving long enough to warn the mainstream reality's Superboy of Black Zero. Due to that Westfield jumping into a Hyperium reactor later in the story, he and all alternate reality versions of Paul Westfield were simultaneously erased from existence.Superboy Vol. 3, #63 Amanda Spence, an agent of the criminal group known as the Agenda that cloned Superboy and created Match, was revealed to be the daughter of Paul Westfield. In retaliation for losing her father, whom she admired, Spence killed Superboy's love Tana Moon.Superboy Vol. 3, #70-75 (2000) Retcon In volume three of Teen Titans by writer Geoff Johns, Paul Westfield was retconned into a scientist of Cadmus Labs who was responsible for the process that created Superboy. Superboy was also changed from a 100% human clone to a hybrid of Superman's Kryptonian DNA and Lex Luthor's human DNA. Other retcons include Luthor and Cadmus working together instead of being enemies, files with Superboy's DNA on record as being from Superman and Luthor, and the knowledge of Westfield's DNA being known information.Teen Titans Vol 3 #1 (Aug, 2003) In other media=Radio Paul Westfield appears in the BBC radio drama adaptation of \\"The Death of Superman\\", \\"Funeral For a Friend\\", and \\"Reign of the Supermen!\\" storylines.

Located in the Upper Silesia historical region, it is the administrative seat of Gmina Dobrodzie≈Ñ Both names in Polish and German mean \\"Good day\\". Dobrodzie≈Ñ is an archaic variant of standard Polish Dzie≈Ñ Dobry, while Guttentag is an archaic variant of standard German Guten Tag. History Historic churches of Dobrodzie≈Ñ: the Saint Valentine church in the foreground and the Saint Mary church in the background The area is documented as part of the Upper Silesian Duchy of Opole of the fragmented Kingdom of Poland, since about 1163 under the rule of Duke Boles≈Çaw I the Tall. The name Dobrosin was first recorded in a 1279 deed; the name varied throughout the centuries (Dobradin, Dobrodzen, Dobrodzin, Dobrydzie≈Ñ etc.). It was granted town rights according to Magdeburg law in 1374 by Duke Vladislaus II of Opole, who then vested it with various privileges in 1384. It remained under the rule of the local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty, although as a fief of the Bohemian Crown from 1327, until the dissolution of the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz in 1532, when it was incorporated into the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia, as part of which it was owned by the Posadowski, Jarocki, Blacha and Blankowski noble families. The first mention of the German name Guttentag occurred in 1636, as a literal translation of the original Polish name.Heinrich Adamy, Die Schlesischen Ortsnamen ihre entstechung und bedeutung, 1888, p. 3 (in German) In 1645 along with the former Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz it returned to Poland under the House of Vasa, and in 1666 it passed to Bohemia again. Upon the First Silesian War, in 1742, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia according to the Treaty of Breslau. Incorporated into the Prussian Province of Silesia, it became part of the German Empire in 1871. Despite Germanisation policies, the town has retained its Polish character and its population was predominantly Catholic.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom II, Warszawa, 1881, p. 81-82 (in Polish) In the Catholic church, Polish sermons took place weekly, German ones every month. Small Protestant and Jewish minorities also lived in the town. The town suffered a fire in 1846. After World War I, in the Upper Silesia plebiscite in March 1921, 79.5% of the citizens came out in favour of a continuance in Germany, and while most parts of the Lubliniec district were reintegrated with the re-established Polish Republic, Dobrodzie≈Ñ, as Guttentag, remained in the Prussian Province of Upper Silesia and ended up very close to the new German‚ÄìPolish border. In May 1921 it was still captured by Polish insurgents during the Third Silesian Uprising, however it remained part of Germany after 1922. Several Polish organizations and enterprises operated in the town in the interbellum, including the Union of Poles in Germany, a Polish scout troop and the Polish Bank Ludowy (\\"People's Bank\\"). Polish activists were persecuted since 1937.Miros≈Çaw Cyga≈Ñski, Hitlerowskie prze≈õladowania przyw√≥dc√≥w i aktywu ZwiƒÖzk√≥w Polak√≥w w Niemczech w latach 1939 - 1945, \\"PrzeglƒÖd Zachodni\\", nr 4, 1984, p. 24 (in Polish) In the months before the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, the houses of Polish activists and Polish institutions and enterprises were the target of numerous attacks, anonymous threatening letters were sent to Poles, while the police refused protection.Polak w Niemczech, 6, 1939, p. 27-28, 30-35 (in Polish) After the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the assets of the Polish bank were confiscated by the German state.Cyga≈Ñski, Op. cit.. p. 33 Jews, most of whom supported Germany against Poland in the 1921 plebiscite, were also persecuted by the Germans in the 1930s, resulting in their emigration to the west. The synagogue was dismantled by the Germans. In 1945, as part of Potsdam Agreement by the Allied victors after World War II, the town became part of the Republic of Poland and the historic name Dobrodzie≈Ñ was restored. Up till then the town had a mostly Protestant population, but after the expulsion of most of the German inhabitants, it was resettled with mainly Catholic Poles, many of whom were expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, in particular from Barszczowice.

Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills. History Early hydraulic cements, such as those of James Parker, James Frost and Joseph Aspdin were relatively soft and readily ground by the primitive technology of the day, using flat millstones. The emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult, because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material. Because of this, cement continued to be ground very coarsely (typically 20% over 100 Œºm particle diameter) until better grinding technology became available. Besides producing un-reactive cement with slow strength growth, this exacerbated the problem of unsoundness. This late, disruptive expansion is caused by hydration of large particles of calcium oxide. Fine grinding lessens this effect, and early cements had to be stored for several months to give the calcium oxide time to hydrate before it was fit for sale. From 1885 onward, the development of specialized steel led to the development of new forms of grinding equipment, and from this point onward, the typical fineness of cement began a steady rise. The progressive reduction in the proportion of larger, un-reactive cement particles has been partially responsible for the fourfold increase in the strength of Portland cement during the twentieth century.P. C. Hewlett (Ed)Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete: 4th Ed, Arnold, 1998, , p 12 The recent history of the technology has been mainly concerned with reducing the energy consumption of the grinding process. Materials ground Portland clinker is the main constituent of most cements. In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add a certain amount of water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. \\"Blended cements\\" and Masonry cements may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. Blastfurnace slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration. They include 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, triethanolamine and lignosulfonates. Temperature control Heat generated in the grinding process causes gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) to lose water, forming bassanite (CaSO4.0.2-0.7H2O) or Œ≥-anhydrite (CaSO4.~0.05H2O). The latter minerals are rapidly soluble, and about 2% of these in cement is needed to control tricalcium aluminate hydration. If more than this amount forms, crystallization of gypsum on their re-hydration causes \\"false set\\" - a sudden thickening of the cement mix a few minutes after mixing, which thins out on re-mixing. High milling temperature causes this. On the other hand, if milling temperature is too low, insufficient rapidly soluble sulfate is available and this causes \\"flash set\\" - an irreversible stiffening of the mix. Obtaining the optimum amount of rapidly soluble sulfate requires milling with a mill exit temperature within a few degrees of 115 ¬∞C. Where the milling system is too hot, some manufacturers use 2.5% gypsum and the remaining calcium sulfate as natural Œ±-anhydrite (CaSO4). Complete dehydration of this mixture yields the optimum 2% Œ≥-anhydrite. In the case of some efficient modern mills, insufficient heat is generated. This is corrected by recirculating part of the hot exhaust air to the mill inlet. Ball Mills Ball Mill Layout A Ball mill is a horizontal cylinder partly filled with steel balls (or occasionally other shapes) that rotates on its axis, imparting a tumbling and cascading action to the balls. Material fed through the mill is crushed by impact and ground by attrition between the balls. The grinding media are usually made of high-chromium steel. The smaller grades are occasionally cylindrical (\\"pebs\\") rather than spherical. There exists a speed of rotation (the \\"critical speed\\") at which the contents of the mill would simply ride over the roof of the mill due to centrifugal action. The critical speed (rpm) is given by: nC = 42.29/, where d is the internal diameter in metres. Ball mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed, so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm. The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size - mills including a roller press are mostly single-chambered), allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media. Large balls are used at the inlet, to crush clinker nodules (which can be over 25 mm in diameter). Ball diameter here is in the range 60‚Äì80 mm. In a two- chamber mill, the media in the second chamber are typically in the range 15‚Äì40 mm, although media down to 5 mm are sometimes encountered. As a general rule, the size of media has to match the size of material being ground: large media can't produce the ultra-fine particles required in the finished cement, but small media can't break large clinker particles. Mills with as many as four chambers, allowing a tight segregation of media sizes, were once used, but this is now becoming rare. Alternatives to multi-chamber mills are: * pairs of mills, run in tandem, charged with different-sized media. * use of alternative technology (see Roll-presses below) to crush the clinker prior to fine- grinding in a ball mill. A current of air is passed through the mill. This helps keep the mill cool, and sweeps out evaporated moisture which would otherwise cause hydration and disrupt material flow. The dusty exhaust air is cleaned, usually with bag filters. Typical mill/separator circuit Closed- circuit systems The efficiency of the early stages of grinding in a ball mill is much greater than that for formation of ultra-fine particles, so ball mills operate most efficiently by making a coarse product, the fine fractions of this then being separated, and the coarse part being returned to the mill inlet. The proportion of the mill-exit material returned to the inlet may vary from 10-30% when ordinary cement is being ground, to 85-95% for extremely fine cement products. It is important for system efficiency that the minimum amount of material of finished-product fineness is returned to the inlet. Modern separators are capable of making a very precise size \\"cut\\" and contribute significantly to the reduction of energy consumption, and have the additional advantage that they cool both the product and the returned material, thus minimizing overheating. Efficient closed-circuit systems, because of their tight particle size control, lead to cements with relatively narrow particle size distributions (i.e. for a given mean particle size, they have fewer large and small particles). This is of advantage in that it maximizes the strength- production potential the clinker, because large particles are inert. As a rule of thumb, only the outer 7 Œºm \\"skin\\" of each particle hydrates in concrete, so any particle over 14 Œºm diameter always leaves an un-reacted core. However, the lack of ultra-fine particles can be a disadvantage. These particles normally pack the spaces between the larger particles in a cement paste, and if absent the deficit is made up with extra water, leading to lower strength. This can be remedied by including 5% calcium carbonate in the cement: this soft mineral produces adequate ultra-fines on the first pass through the mill. Typical mill power consumption for various degrees of fineness. Actual values vary according to mill system efficiency and clinker hardness. Energy consumption and outputClinker hardness The hardness of clinker is important for the energy cost of the grinding process. It depends both on the clinker's mineral composition and its thermal history. The easiest-ground clinker mineral is alite, so high-alite clinkers reduce grinding costs, although they are more expensive to make in the kiln. The toughest mineral is belite, because it is harder, and is somewhat plastic, so that crystals tend to flatten rather than shatter when impacted in the mill. The mode of burning of the clinker is also important. Clinker rapidly burned at the minimum temperature for combination, then rapidly cooled, contains small, defective crystals that grind easily. These crystals are usually also optimal for reactivity. On the other hand, long burning at excess temperature, and slow cooling, lead to large, well-formed crystals that are hard to grind and un- reactive. The effect of such a clinker can be to double milling costs. Roller mills These have been used for many years for the less exacting raw-milling process, but recently roller mills, in combination with high- efficiency separators, have been used for cement grinding. The grinding action employs much greater stress on the material than in a ball mill, and is therefore more efficient. Energy consumption is typically half that of a ball mill. However, the narrowness of the particle size distribution of the cement is problematic, and the process has yet to receive wide acceptance. High- pressure roll presses These consist of a pair of rollers set 8‚Äì30 mm apart and counter-rotating with surface speed around 0.9 - 1.8 m.s‚àí1. The bearings of the rollers are designed to deliver a pressure of 50 MPa or more. The bed of material drawn between the rollers emerges as a slab-like agglomeration of highly fractured particles. The energy efficiency of this process is comparatively high. Systems have been designed, including a de-agglomerator and separator, that will deliver material of cement fineness. However, particle size distribution is again a problem, and roll presses are now increasingly popular as a \\"pre-grind\\" process, with the cement finished in a single chamber ball mill. This gives good cement performance, and reduces energy consumption by 20-40% compared with a standard ball mill system. Capacity of cement mills The cement mills on a cement plant are usually sized for a clinker consumption considerably greater than the output of the plant's kilns. This is for two reasons: * The mills are sized to cope with peaks in market demand for cement. In temperate countries, the summer demand for cement is usually much higher than that in winter. Excess clinker produced in winter goes into storage in readiness for summer demand peaks. For this reason, plants with highly seasonal demand usually have very large clinker stores. * Cement milling is the largest user of electric power on a cement plant, and because they can easily be started and stopped, it often pays to operate cement mills only during \\"off-peak\\" periods when cheaper power is available. This is also favourable for electricity producers, who can negotiate power prices with major users in order to balance their generating capacity over 24 hours. More sophisticated arrangements such as \\"power shedding\\" are often employed. This consists of the cement manufacturer shutting down the plant at short notice when the power supplier expects a critical demand peak, in return for favourable prices. Clearly, plenty of excess cement milling capacity is needed in order to \\"catch up\\" after such interruptions. Control of product quality In addition to control of temperature (mentioned above), the main requirement is to obtain a consistent fineness of the product. From the earliest times, fineness was measured by sieving the cement. As cements have become finer, the use of sieves is less applicable, but the amount retained on a 45 Œºm sieve is still measured, usually by air-jet sieving or wet-sieving. The amount passing this sieve (typically 95% in modern general-purpose cements) is related to the overall strength-development potential of the cement, because the larger particles are essentially unreactive. The main measure of fineness today is specific surface. Because cement particles react with water at their surface, the specific surface area is directly related to the cement's initial reactivity. By adjusting the fineness of grind, the manufacture can produce a range of products from a single clinker. Tight control of fineness is necessary in order to obtain cement with the desired consistent day-to-day performance, so round-the-clock measurements are made on the cement as it is produced, and mill feed-rates and separator settings are adjusted to maintain constant specific surface. A more comprehensive picture of fineness is given by particle size analysis, yielding a measure of the amount of each size range present, from sub-micrometer upwards. This used to be mainly a research tool, but with the advent of cheap, industrialized laser-diffraction analyzers, its use for routine control is becoming more frequent. This may take the form of a desk-top analyzer fed with automatically gathered samples in a robotized laboratory, or, increasingly commonly, instruments attached directly to the output ducts of the mill. In either case, the results can be fed directly into the mill control system, allowing complete automation of fineness control. In addition to fineness, added materials in the cement must be controlled. In the case of gypsum addition, the material used is frequently of variable quality, and it is normal practise to measure the sulfate content of the cement regularly, typically by x-ray fluorescence, using the results to adjust the gypsum feed rate. Again, this process is often completely automated. Similar measurement and control protocols are applied to other materials added, such as limestone, slag and fly-ash.

Twenty-one victims died as a result. The event contributed to the passage of the Pharmacy Act 1868 in the United Kingdom and legislation regulating the adulteration of foodstuffs. Background William Hardaker, known to locals as \\"Humbug Billy\\", sold sweets from a stall in the Greenmarket in central Bradford (now the site of Bradford's Arndale Centre). Hardaker purchased his supplies from Joseph Neal, who made the sweets (or \\"lozenges\\") on Stone Street a few hundred yards to the north. The lozenges in question were peppermint humbugs, made of peppermint oil incorporated into a base of sugar and gum. However, sugar was expensive (6¬Ωd per ) and so Neal would substitute powdered gypsum (¬Ωd per ) ‚Äî known as \\"daff\\" ‚Äî for some of the required sugar. The adulteration of foodstuffs with cheaper substances was common at the time and the adulterators used obscure nicknames (\\"daff\\", \\"multum\\", \\"flash\\", \\"stuff\\") to hide the practice. Accidental poisoning On the occasion in question, Neal sent James Archer, a lodger who lived at his house, to collect daff for Hardaker's humbugs from druggist Charles Hodgson. Hodgson's pharmacy was away at Baildon Bridge in Shipley. Hodgson was at his pharmacy, but did not serve Archer owing to illness and so his requests were seen to by his young assistant, William Goddard. Goddard asked Hodgson where the daff was, and was told that it was in a cask in a corner of the attic. However, rather than daff, Goddard sold Archer of arsenic trioxide. The mistake remained undetected even during manufacture of the sweets by James Appleton, an \\"experienced sweetmaker\\" employed by Neal, though Appleton did observe that the finished product looked different from the usual humbugs. Appleton was suffering symptoms of illness during the sweet-making process and was ill for several days afterwards with vomiting and pain in his hands and arms, but did not realise it was caused by poison. of lozenges were sold to Hardaker who also noticed the sweets looked unusual and used this to obtain a discount from Neal. Like Appleton, Hardaker, as one of the first to taste the sweets, also promptly became ill. Arsenic trioxide is a white, crystalline powder that closely resembles sugar. It has no odour or taste. Regardless, Hardaker sold of the sweets from his market stall that night ‚Äì reportedly at a price of 1¬Ωd for . Of those who purchased and ate the sweets, 21 people died with a further 200 or so becoming severely ill with arsenic poisoning within a day or so. Consequences Originally the first deaths‚Äîthose of two children‚Äîwere thought to be owing to cholera, a major problem in Britain at the time. The growing number of casualties soon showed that the purchase of lozenges from Hardaker's stall was the cause, and from there the trail led to Neal and Hodgson. Goddard was arrested and stood before magistrates in the court house in Bradford on 1 November with Hodgson and Neal later committed for trial with Goddard on a charge of manslaughter. Dr John Bell identified arsenic as the cause, and this was confirmed by Felix Rimmington, a prominent chemist and druggist and analytical chemist. Rimmington estimated that each humbug contained between of arsenic, though a contemporary account suggests , with being a lethal dose. Thus, each lozenge would have contained enough arsenic to kill two people, and enough distributed by Hardaker in total to kill 2,000. The prosecution against Goddard and Neal was later withdrawn and Hodgson was acquitted when the case was considered at York Assizes on 21 December 1858. The tragedy and resulting public outcry was a major contributing factor to The Pharmacy Act 1868 which recognized the chemist and druggist as the custodian and seller of named poisons (as medicine was then formally known). The requirement for record keeping and the requirement to obtain the signature of the purchaser is currently upheld under the Poisons Act 1972 for \\"non-medicinal\\" poisons. W. E. Gladstone's ministry of 1868‚Äì1874 also brought in legislation regulating the adulteration of foodstuffs as a result of the events.

The squad was also featured in its sequel, The Phantom Blooper, albeit with most of its members changed. Stanley Kubrick depicted the squad in his 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. The Short-Timers Corporal/Sergeant/Private James T. 'Joker' Davis: The protagonist and narrator of the book, Joker is sent on a mission to join the Lusthog Squad (which is being run by Cowboy then) at Phu Bai along with Lance Corporal Compton ('Rafter Man'). Promoted from Corporal to Sergeant before starting this mission, Joker survives an encounter with a female sniper in the Citadel and mercy-kills her before returning with his report. Not long afterward, he incurs the wrath of a colonel for wearing an unauthorized peace sign button on his uniform; as a result, Joker is assigned to the squad as a fireteam leader. During a mission in the jungle where a sniper lures the team one by one to an ambush, Cowboy promotes him to squad leader before running into the trap to kill three wounded squad members. Cowboy's hand is blown away before he can kill himself, so Joker shoots him through the eye and leads the team away. In The Phantom Blooper, the reader learns that Joker has been demoted to Private for failing to recover the body. Lance Corporal 'Rafter Man' Compton: A 'New Guy' taking pictures for Joker's articles, Rafter Man is constantly shocked by the horrors of war as he travels with Joker to team up with Cowboy. His nickname comes from an incident at an enlisted men's club in which he climbed up into the rafters for a better view of the stage, then fell onto the table of a visiting general. He kills the female sniper in the Citadel, which greatly excites him, but after seeing his reflection in glass he is disturbed. While returning to Da Nang, the still-shocked Rafter Man is run over by a tank, cutting him in half. Sergeant John 'Cowboy' Rucker/Sergeant Robert 'Cowboy' Evans: Cowboy is Joker's oldest and best friend. The two meet during recruit training at Parris Island, where Cowboy laughs at Joker's jokes. Later on in 1968, Cowboy is the leader of the Lusthog Squad. After being wounded at the Citadel by the female sniper, he leaves Animal Mother temporarily in command. In the jungle, Cowboy sacrifices himself by shooting all his dying men so that nobody else will run into the trap to save them. Before he can kill himself, though, the sniper shoots the pistol out of his hand and wounds him repeatedly. Joker then shoots him, having been given command of the squad. His last words are an ambiguous rant: \\"I NEVER LIKED YOU, JOKER. I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WERE FUNNY--\\". Joker takes Cowboy's pearl-grey Stetson hat as a souvenir, wearing it and carrying it with him throughout The Phantom Blooper. Cowboy presents himself as being from Dallas, but Joker learns in this second book that he had actually lived in Kansas. Animal Mother: A former platoon sergeant, Animal Mother was demoted to Private after he gave the finger to a colonel. Described as monstrous and giant, he carries an M60 machine gun at all times and wears an ammunition belt across his chest \\"like a big Mexican bandit.\\" He is a rapist and shows no mercy to anyone. Nonetheless, he remains loyal to all Marines and is willing to sacrifice himself for them. Animal Mother joined the Marines after he was arrested on an auto theft charge and offered the choice of enlistment or a prison sentence. In the jungle encounter with the sniper, Animal Mother nearly shoots Joker, with whom he shares bitter friction, but then obeys him after Cowboy gives him command of the squad. In The Phantom Blooper, Joker learns that Animal Mother was captured by the Viet Cong, but escaped from a POW camp and is back on active duty with the Marines. Alice: Also nicknamed \\"Midnight Buccaneer\\", \\"Ace of Spades\\" and \\"Jungle Bunny\\" by Cowboy, Animal Mother and Joker, respectively. As the \\"point man\\" of the squad, he walks in front of all others and is keen on sensing danger and noticing booby-traps. He has also a foot fetish: he believes in voodoo and cuts off his kills' feet with his machete, carrying them in a blue shopping bag. The \\"Alice\\" nickname stems from the fact that his favorite record album is Alice's Restaurant by Arlo Guthrie. He is the first to step into the jungle ambush (because Cowboy hurried him), and is mercy-killed by Cowboy after being wounded multiple times. Donlon: The radioman of Lusthog Squad, he is portrayed as somewhat sensitive (crying over the dead). Donlon can be something of a nuisance, since he insists on doing his job as a radioman during the hairiest of situations. He is nearly killed by the sniper in the jungle; the bullet smashes his radio before he is pulled away by Joker. In The Phantom Blooper, Joker finds him living in California, studying political science at UCLA and protesting the war. The two attend an anti-war demonstration that is forcefully broken up by the police, resulting in Donlon losing an eye. His first name is given as \\"Tom\\" in The Short-Timers, and as \\"Bob\\" in The Phantom Blooper. Doc Jay: The corpsman of the team, Doc Jay claims to have \\"magic hands\\" and, if it were up to him, would stay in Vietnam forever to help out even the dead. Doc Jay goes after Alice during the jungle ambush, and he is shot by the sniper as well. He then performs a tracheotomy on the fallen New Guy, and is subsequently mercy-killed by Cowboy. Referred to as \\"Doc J-for- Joint\\" in The Phantom Blooper. Crazy Earl: The squad leader before Cowboy, he is a frail, sick man who, during Joker's blackout at the Citadel, goes crazy and starts shooting at the enemy with a BB gun. He is killed during this frenzy, and Cowboy takes the lead after him. T.H.E. Rock: Rock is nicknamed thus due to a small quartz rock he wears around his neck, allegedly for identifying him in case he should die in battle. He does die at the Citadel, shot in the head by the female sniper. The squad then takes on a personal vendetta on the sniper and kills her. Lt. Robert M. \\"Mr. Shortround\\" Bayer III: Commander of the platoon that includes this squad, Bayer came by his nickname due to his small stature. He welcomes Joker and Rafter Man into the squad and is killed by a friendly grenade (Animal Mother's) during the Citadel attack, while trying to rescue a fallen Marine. Lance Corporal Stutten: Stutten is a fireteam leader and sides with Animal Mother during the jungle ambush, disregarding Joker's orders. Private Henry \\"New Guy\\" Parker: The newest member of the squad when the jungle ambush occurs, he \\"goes John Wayne\\" and tries to rescue Doc Jay and Alice, whereupon he himself is shot in the neck and mercy-killed by Cowboy after receiving a tracheotomy from Doc Jay. Out of the above members of the original Lusthog Squad, the only ones to survive the novel are Joker, having been promoted to sergeant and squad leader, along with Animal Mother (who takes the point), Donlon the radioman, and Lance Corporal Stutten. Several other members are mentioned only in passing; some of these recur in The Phantom Blooper. Differences from movie adaptation *The last two thirds of the book are merged into the last end of the movie adaptation; thus, many of the events and fates of the characters are redistributed. There is only one \\"sniper showdown\\" in the movie, and Alice (renamed Eightball) and Doc Jay fall victims of it. Cowboy, instead of sacrificing himself and mercy-killing them, is shot through the back by the sniper while calling for backup. After Rafter Man and Joker kill the sniper, the movie ends, whereas in the book Rafter Man is run over and split in half by a tank. Likewise, Crazy Earl does not die from a booby-trapped toy, but rather goes crazy and is killed during his frenzy. T.H.E. Rock survives in the movie, whereas he is shot in the head by the first sniper in the book. *Shortround, Stutten, and Parker do not appear in the film, replaced by the original characters of Lieutenant Walter \\"Touchdown\\" Schinowski, Sergeant Murphy (a cameo by Stanley Kubrick), and Handjob. Touchdown and Handjob are killed in an ambush upon entering Hu·∫ø, while Murphy survives.

The Sendai Domain was based at Aoba Castle in Mutsu Province, in the modern city of Sendai, located in the T≈çhoku region of the island of Honshu. The Sendai Domain was ruled for its existence by the tozama daimy≈ç of the Date, and under the 'kokudaka system its income rating at 625,000 koku was the third-largest domain in Japan after the Satsuma Domain and Kaga Domain. The Sendai Domain was geographically the largest domain in northern Japan with its mostly-contiguous holdings covering most of southern Mutsu Province, including all of present-day Miyagi Prefecture, parts of southern Iwate Prefecture and northeastern Fukushima Prefecture. The Sendai Domain was the focal member of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei against the Meiji Restoration during the Boshin War. The Sendai Domain was dissolved in the abolition of the han system in 1871 by the Meiji government. Foundation The Sendai domain was founded in the closing years of the 16th century. When Date Masamune presented himself to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was undertaking the Odawara Campaign, he was granted the former fiefs of the Kasai ËëõË•ø and ≈åsaki Â§ßÂ¥é families, in return for his hereditary lands of Yonezawa Á±≥Ê≤¢, Aizu ‰ºöÊ¥•, and Send≈ç ‰ªôÈÅì.‰ªôÂè∞Ëó© Upon entry into his new fief, Masamune took up residence in Iwadeyama Castle, and then started construction on Sendai Castle. The name of Sendai at this time was written ÂçÉ‰ª£, however, Masamune changed it to ‰ªôËá∫ (Later changed to the current ‰ªôÂè∞Ôºâ(\\"hermit's platform,\\" presumably alluding to Chinese mysticism). During the Sekigahara Campaign, the Date clan had been promised an increase in formal domain income to one million koku; however, as they were fighting with the Uesugi clan for their old lands in the Date district, this did not come to pass. It has been estimated that the Sendai Domain's jitsudaka, or true income level, may have been somewhere between one and two million koku. A relief sculpture on the base of Masamune's equestrian statue in Sendai Castle commemorates his entry into the city, which was then a small village.

However, some retainers had their personal landholdings scattered throughout the domain's territory, as it was largely contiguous. Their presence provided a secondary, more local level of supervision. Certain of the higher-ranked retainers of Sendai even separated from the main domain and founded their own territories. Mizusawa Domain was one such short-lived subdomain. The Ichinoseki Domain, ruled by the Tamura family, was another subdomain, and survived to the end of the Edo period. Retainer ranks and military structure There were eleven main ranks into which the retainers of the Sendai domain were divided. ‰ªôÂè∞Ëó©ÂÆ∂Ëá£Âõ£ # Ichimon ‰∏ÄÈñÄ: blood relations of the Date clan. Held prestige but no actual political or administrative role. ‰ªôÂè∞Ëó©ÂÆ∂Ëá£Âõ£ # Ikka ‰∏ÄÂÆ∂: The families who ran much of the high- level day-to-day affairs of the Date clan. # Jun ikka Ê∫ñ‰∏ÄÂÆ∂: Families who had lost their heads or had been incapacitated due to internal strife in the Date clan. # Ichizoku ‰∏ÄÊóè: Fudai (long-standing) retainers of the Date clan. # Shukur≈ç ÂÆøÂä¥: Hereditary bugy≈ç (magistrates). ‰ªôÂè∞Ëó©ÂÆ∂Ëá£Âõ£ # Chakuza ÁùÄÂ∫ß: Retainers who had the right to report to the castle and present the lord with a sword and stirrups for new year's celebrations, and in return receive a cup of sake from the lord. This rank was founded after Date Masamune's tenure as lord. # Tachi- j≈ç Â§™ÂàÄ‰∏ä: Retainers who had the right to present the lord with a sword at new year's festivities, and in return received a cup of sake from the lord. This was a rank founded after Masamune's tenure. # Meshidashi Âè¨Âá∫: Retainers who had the right to appear at the domainal new year's festivities. As with chakuza and tachi-j≈ç, this rank was founded after Masamune's time. ‰ªôÂè∞Ëó©ÂÆ∂Ëá£Âõ£ # Heishi Âπ≥Â£´ and ≈åbanshi Â§ßÁï™Â£´: The main body of Sendai's fighting force, the rank was organized in Date Masamune's time and revived during the tenure of the fourth daimyo Tsunamura. One kumi ÁµÑ (unit) consisted of 360 men, and the domain had 10 such units, setting their number at 3600. # Kumi-shi ÁµÑÂ£´: The men under the heishi and ≈çbanshi. Footmen, tea instructors, hawking assistants, entourage members, among others, all came from this category. ‰ªôÂè∞Ëó©ÂÆ∂Ëá£Âõ£ # Sotsu Âçí: Foot soldiers, coolies, lesser menials, and so on. Education The domain's school was known as the Y≈çkend≈ç È§äË≥¢Â†Ç.A picture of the still extant main gate of Y≈çkend≈ç can be seen here A medical school was established in Sendai in 1822.Goodman, Grant Kohn. (2000). Japan and the Dutch, 1600-1853, p. 160. Boshin War In 1868, the Sendai Domain did not have forces active in the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi; however, it did have a liaison office in Kyoto which kept track of the developing situation. It was approached several times by the nascent imperial government with requests to assist in subduing Aizu. Sendai did provide some cooperation to the new government, and accepted its envoys, under Kuj≈ç Michitaka, that spring. However, Date Yoshikuni, the daimy≈ç of Sendai, opposed the harshness shown against Aizu, saying that it was like \\"a sentence being passed on one who never had a trial\\".Samuel Pellman Boyer, M.D. Naval Surgeon: Revolt in Japan, 1868‚Äì1869. Edited by James A. Barnes and Elinor Barnes. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1963, p. 48ff. Despite its efforts at negotiating on behalf of Aizu, Sendai was largely cooperative with the Kyoto government for much of the spring of 1868. This came to an end in May 1868, when Sendai men discovered that the Ch≈çsh≈´ officer Sera Sh≈´z≈ç (who had accompanied the imperial delegation) had written a slanderous letter indicating a desire to describe \\"all in the north to be enemies,\\" and to ask for reinforcements to subdue the entire region by armed force.:See this page (in Japanese) for a transcription of Sera's letter: http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/ytsubu/theme13g.htm Naturally, the Sendai men were outraged that they too were to be punished despite their cooperation. A group of these men killed Sera, and pushed ahead with Sendai sponsorship of a northern coalition of domains. This became the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. After Boshin The Sendai domain was punished for its actions against the imperial army in the Boshin War, though not as severely as Aizu. Sendai's holdings were reduced; it was also made the center of the new government's operations in the north. Shiroishi Castle was also taken from Sendai, and given to the Nanbu clan which had been newly moved from Morioka Castle. As with all others, the Sendai domain was abolished in 1871, by the haihan chiken order.

Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia (Salt Lake City, utah: Deseret news Press, 1936) vol. 4, p. 717. ) was an early Latter Day Saint leader born in Rockingham, Vermont. Roundy was the second oldest (59) member of Brigham Young's Company, which arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, and was one of the advance party which arrived in the valley ahead of the main party in order to start planting crops. He was one of the three men who, on July 23, 1847, were the first Mormon pioneers recorded to plow soil in what became Utah. He is also mentioned in and was a bodyguard of Joseph Smith. He was a bishop in Winter Quarters, Nebraska, a member of the first High Council organized in the Salt Lake Valley, again a bishop in Salt Lake City, a senator in the first legislature of the provisional State of Deseret. Role during Mormon expulsion from Missouri Roundy played a very important part in the removal of the Latter Day Saints from Missouri. So much of the Mormons' property had been either destroyed or taken over by mobocrats that a number of destitute refugees found it impossible to move themselves and families to safety. The timing of the expulsion during the winter of 1838-39 also greatly aggravated conditions, but the more fortunate promised to assist those in need. Quoting from a meeting held at Far West on January 29, 1839: Roundy was the ninth to sign the covenant, which bound the signers to give freely of all their \\"available property, to be disposed of by a committee who shall be appointed for the purpose of providing means for the removing from this State of the poor and destitute who shall be considered worthy, till there shall not be one left who desires to remove from the State.\\" Accordingly, a committee composed of Roundy and six others directed the removal of the exiles, and provided means of conveyance, food, clothing, and temporary shelters for the destitute. Nauvoo Years (1839‚Äì46) After their removal from Missouri, the majority of Latter Day Saints fled to Western Illinois, eventually concentrating at Commerce (renamed Nauvoo), Hancock County, Illinois. Although the Latter Day Saints were only in Hancock County for seven years, it provided a home where they experienced many changes and developments. During this time period Roundy was active in both civil and ecclesiastical affairs. Roundy was a member of the Nauvoo Police force beginning in 1843.The Church Historian's Press, People of the Time (http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/reference: accessed 1 February 2013), \\"Roundy, Shadrach.\\" He was also one of twelve men on the Board of Control for the Nauvoo Agricultural and Mechanical (or Manufacturing) Association. Roundy protected Joseph Smith on at least two occasions. Once, while a group of men led by William Law tried to enter the Smith home Roundy held them back with his cane. On another occasion he accompanied Smith to Monmouth, Illinois, for a trial.Everett Ellsworth Roundy, The Roundy Family in America: From the Sixteen-Hundreds (Dedham, Massachusetts: n.p., 1942), 222-223. Roundy helped prepare the Red Brick Store for some of the first endowments performed in Nauvoo. Shortly before the exodus from Nauvoo, Roundy was assigned to explore California (apparently the plan was never carried out) as an option for settlement in the West opposed to the Great Basin.Juanita Brooks, editor, On the Mormon Frontier: The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‚Äì1861 (Salt Lake City, Utah: University of Utah Press, 1964), 80. Latter life in Utah Roundy was bishop of the 16th Ward in Salt Lake City from 1849 until 1856. Roundy died in Salt Lake City.

Blackcomb Peak is a mountain located east of Whistler, British Columbia that forms the boundary between the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort and Garibaldi Provincial Park. Like Whistler Mountain, it is located on the edge of Garibaldi Provincial Park and the ski lifts are often used to access the park, particularly for the Spearhead Traverse. Several skiing runs are established on the mountain, with Whistler Village at the base of the mountain on the side facing Whistler Mountain, and Blackcomb Village on the face opposite. The 2010 Winter Olympics sliding sports took place on its slopes, with the Whistler Sliding Centre located on it. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Blackcomb Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Blackcomb Peak Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Blackcomb Peak.

They currently produce nylon and steel stringed guitars, craviola, viola caipira, cavaquinho, mandolin, violins, electric guitars and basses and some accessories such as guitar tuners and guitar strings.  Craviola  The Craviola, created by Giannini with Brazilian musician Paulinho Nogueira is one of the most notable guitars made by Giannini due to its unique shape and sound identity. It gained widespread visibility after it was used by Led Zeppelin's guitarist Jimmy Page. From September 1971 to June 1972, Page used a 12-string craviola, model GWSCRA12-P, mostly in Zeppelin's performances of \\"Tangerine\\", which was also first recorded using the same craviola. Page received two craviolas (one with six strings and the other, by his request, with twelve) from Giannini itself as gifts, while visiting his NGO at Rio de Janeiro. The Craviola also received an electric version with Wilkinson pickups. The guitar's wiring has one 3-position key for each of the pickups, which allow them to work with one coil, the other one, both as a humbucker or both separately as single coils, giving a wide range of possible timbres, aside from the regular 3-position key for alternating between both pickups.

Function  TSC1 functions as a co- chaperone which inhibits the ATPase activity of the chaperone Hsp90 (heat shock protein-90) and decelerates its chaperone cycle. Tsc1 functions as a facilitator of Hsp90 in chaperoning the kinase and non-kinase clients including Tsc2, therefore preventing their ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. TSC1, TSC2 and TBC1D7 is a multi-protein complex also known as the TSC complex. This complex negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling by functioning as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase Rheb, an essential activator of mTORC1. The TSC complex has been implicated as a tumor suppressor.  Clinical significance  Defects in this gene can cause tuberous sclerosis, due to a functional impairment of the TSC complex.

Bell cittern by Joachim Tielke in the V&A; Museum, London, UK. Joachim Tielke (14 October 1641 ‚Äì 19 January 1719) was a German maker of musical instruments. He was born in K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad), Duchy of Prussia a fief of Kingdom of Poland, and died in Hamburg. A publication was dedicated to him by G√ºnther Hellwig. Hellwig lists the total number of 139 instruments still existing of Tielke's oeuvre, with lutes, angelicas, theorboes, bell citterns (Ger Hamburger Cithrinchen), guitars, pochettes, violins, viole d'amore without sympathetic strings, barytons, viole da gamba, and bows. The publications of 2011 and 2020 omit few instruments and the bows as unauthetic, but new findings raise the total number of instruments and fragments from the Tielke workshop to 174. More recent research shows that all theorboes were originally either lutes with bent-back pegboxes or are modifications of angelicas. The bows have shown to be non-authentic. On the other hand, nearly thirty instruments not known to Hellwig have come up, among them the fragment of a baryton, a cello, more viols, guitars, lutes. Tielke's existing oeuvre is therefore one of the most comprehensive and by number close to that of Stradivari and the other great Italian makers. Tielke's instruments are famous not only for their marquetry and carved heards but also for their tonal qualities. A much-debated question is that of the contribution Tielke himself made to the instruments signed with his name. The examination of his work leads to the idea that he engaged outside craftsmen and artists for the supply of carvings and marquetry, possibly even complete instruments.

The film starred Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi, Amol Palekar, Soni Razdan and Pankaj Kapoor. The film became notable for actors Amol Palekar, Soni Razdan and Shabana Azmi portraying fictional versions of themselves. Plot Soni Razdan is a budding actress. Naseeruddin Shah is a military man. Amol Palekar is an established actor. Shabana Azmi is a fellow actress. Ajit Vachani is a film producer and Pankaj Kapoor is his mentally unstable brother. Sushma Seth plays Mrs. Bhal, a retired actress now doing character roles and pushing her reluctant daughter into the film industry to obtain fame and fortune. The filming unit enters Pahalgam in Kashmir for their next film. Razdan mysteriously commits suicide. The police are about to call it an open and shut case when Shah enters the scene. He pretends to be a special officer sent to investigate the case, but subsequently his cover is blown. The police come to arrest him just as he about to accuse Mrs Bhal of Razdan's murder as he had found Razdan's missing earring hidden under Mrs Bhal's mattress in her hotel room. Shah then reveals his true identity as Razdan's estranged brother and states that some days before the \\"suicide\\", Razdan had sent him a letter that she had gotten the lead role for a prestigious project. As such, he refuses to believe that she committed suicide. The crew accept that Razdan had indeed got the coveted role, but they are less enthusiastic about co-operating now with the police and investigation of her murder. The only person who believes that Razdan was murdered is Azmi, who heard Razdan practising her lines until late at night. Azmi realises that Razdan was portraying a village girl who spoke no English, but that she had started shouting something in English before she became silent. She agrees to help Shah catch the culprit, and they join forces but more murders happen - first with Mrs Bhal is killed and then the male housekeeper. Eventually, all clues point to Vachchani, who confesses that his brother Kapoor killed Razdan in a rage when she spurned his advances. Vachchani confesses that he was just covering for him, because his brother was mentally ill. Kapoor goes on a shooting spree, killing Vachchani in the process. It seems like the mystery has been solved but Shah realizes two things : 1] Kapoor's revolver had already been emptied before he \\"shot\\" his brother dead. 2] Vachchani had posted a mysterious letter to his lawyer. Azmi knows where the actual gun used to kill Vachchani is but finds it missing from the props and costumes box. Who is behind all these murders? Release and Distribution As the film had an unconventional plot, no distributor bought it. Chopra showed the film to many persons but no one was interested in releasing it. After more than a year, he decided to distribute it himself. He rented Regal cinema hall in Colaba, Bombay and showed the film there.

His father was the manager of Anzeagi Conservatorion for music in Petach Tikva. As a teenager, he was already a prominent rock drummer and percussionist. Early on, Tamir started producing Israel's first thrash metal records in his basement studio but also began working with Sephardic Eastern singers of Greek and Turkish origin in a highly ornamented style that is Middle Eastern in nature. Tamir moved to the United States in 1995 and joined the band Izabo. In 1996, Tamir joined the internationally acclaimed band Firewater as a drummer and producer. With Firewater, he toured the world and made three albums, two of which he produced. Tamir founded Vibromonk Records with Dan Shatzky, which has become an important music production studio in New York City. Since then Tamir has produced albums with exceptional artists from around the world, and has helped create a unique musical palette. As a member of the instrumental trio Big Lazy, he released The Big Apple's Creme de la Cr√®me, called \\"primeval, lurid, mournful, frantic, pretty, dissonant, stark, lush\\" by The Village Voice and \\"elegantly gritty stunningly beautiful music\\" by The New Yorker. Big Lazy has written music for various films, and toured with The White Stripes, John Spencer Blues Explosion, Reverent Horton Heat, Tom Tom Club and Firewater. In 2002, Tamir launched an electro/gypsy/punk project called J.U.F., with Ori Kaplan and members of Gogol Bordello. The band created a new music scene in New York City, making remixes for Gypsy labels in Europe and DJing. The band Balkan Beat Box is a progression of this style of music, taking a worldly approach to the music of their ancestors and evolving it to not only include the region of the world that they emigrated from, but they also to incorporate the musical styles from their parents' and grandparents' birthplaces. In 2007, Muskat opened Vibromonk East in Tel Aviv, where he produces records for artists from around the globe.

She wrote two memoirs about her father, dealing with Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, the attack by Khionia Guseva and the murder. A third one, The Man Behind the Myth, was published in 1977 in association with Patte Barham. In her three memoirs, the veracity of which has been questioned,van der Meiden, p. 84.Fuhrmann, p. x she painted an almost saintly picture of her father, insisting that most of the negative stories were based on slander and the misinterpretation of facts by his enemies. Early life Rasputin with his children Matryona (or Maria) Rasputin was born in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, Tobolsk Governorate, on 26 March 1898, and baptized the next day. Some people believe she was born in 1899; that year is also on her tombstone, but since 1990 the archives in Russia opened up and more information became available for researchers. In September 1910Douglas Smith (2016) Rasputin, pp. 170, 182. she went to Kazan (perhaps the Kazan Gymnasium) and then came to St. Petersburg, where her first name was changed to Maria to better fit with her social aspirations.Alexander, Robert, Rasputin's Daughter, Penguin Books, 2006, , pp. 297‚Äì98 Rasputin had brought Maria and her younger sister Varvara (Barbara) to live with him in the capital with the hope of turning them into \\"little ladies.\\"Edvard Radzinsky, The Rasputin File, Doubleday, 2000, , p. 201. After being refused at the Smolny Institute,Fuhrmann, p. 134. they attended Steblin- Kamensky private preparatory school in October 1913. Her father Tsarskoe train station near. He lived in this 5-room apartment from May 1914 with a housemaid, her niece and his two daughters. What little is known about Rasputin's childhood was passed down by Maria.Rasputin. Maria expressed her ideas about their surname; Rasputin. According to her, he was never a monk, but a starets. (As he was not an elder he would be referred to as a pilgrim.) For Maria, her father's healing practices on Tsarevich Alexei were based on magnetism.Rasputin, p. 33. According to Maria, Grigory did \\"look into\\" the Khlysti's ideas.Moynahan, p. 37.

Paris 1923; Matrena Rasputina, Memoirs of The Daughter, Moscow 2001. Rasputin, p. 12. Maria and her mother accompanied their father to hospital in Tyumen. Seven weeks later, Rasputin left the hospital and returned to St Petersburg. According to Maria her father started to drink dessert wines.Rasputin, p. 88. Maria was briefly engaged during World War I to a Georgian officer named Pankhadze. Pankhadze had avoided being sent to the war front due to Rasputin's intervention and was doing his military service with the reserve battalions in Petrograd.Radzinsky, The Rasputin File, p. 385 Maria liked to visit the opera and the Ciniselli Circus. On 17 December 1916, Rasputin was lured to the Moika Palace for a house warming party organized by Felix Yusupov, whom Rasputin called \\"The Little One\\".Radzinsky, The Rasputin File, pp. 452‚Äì54 Yusupov had visited Rasputin regularly in the past few weeks or months.Maria Rasputin, p. 13 The following day, the two sisters reported their father missing to Anna Vyrubova. Traces of blood were detected on the parapet of the Bolshoy Petrovsky bridge, as well as one of Rasputin's galoshes, stuck between the bridge pile. Maria and her sister affirmed the boot belonged to their father.Radzinsky, The Rasputin File, pp. 452‚Äì54 Maria asserts that after the attack by Guseva, her father suffered from hyperacidity and avoided anything with sugar.Rasputin, pp. 12, 71, 111. She and her father's former secretary, Simanotvich, doubted he was poisoned at all.A. Simanotwitsch (1928) Rasputin. Der allm√§chtige Bauer. p. 37Radzinsky (2000), p. 477. It is Maria who mentioned the homosexual advances of Felix Yusupov towards her father. According to her he was murdered when this was denied. Fuhrmann does not believe Yusupov found Rasputin attractive.Fuhrmann, p. 204. It is not clear whether Rasputin's two daughters were present at Rasputin's burial in Vyrubova's garden, next to the Alexander Palace and the surrounding park, although Maria claimed she was.Rasputin, p. 16Fuhrmann, p. 222 The two sisters were invited in the Alexandra palace to play with the four grand duchesses, quite often referred to as OTMA; meanwhile, Maria and her sister had moved into a smaller apartment, owned by her French teacher. They each received an allowance of 50,000 rubles. In April 1917, their mother returned to Pokrovskoye. The next day the two sisters were locked up in the Tauride Palace and questioned. Boris Soloviev succeeded in gaining their release. Life following the Revolution Maria Rasputin being interviewed by a journalist from the Spanish magazine Estampa in 1930. Rasputin had persuaded Maria to marry Boris Soloviev, the charismatic son of Nikolai Soloviev, the Treasurer of the Holy Synod and one of her father's admirers. Boris Soloviev, a graduate of a school of mysticism, quickly emerged as Rasputin's successor after the murder. Boris, who had studied Madame Blavatsky's theosophy,Moe, p. 628. and hypnotism, attended meetings at which Rasputin's followers attempted to communicate with the dead through prayer meetings and s√©ances.Robert K. Massie, Nicholas and Alexandra, Dell Publishing Co., 1967, , p. 487 Maria also attended the meetings, but later wrote in her diary that she could not understand why her father kept telling her to \\"love Boris\\" when the group spoke to him at the s√©ances. She said she did not like Boris at all.Massie, p. 487 Boris was no more enthusiastic about Maria. In his own diary, he wrote that his wife was not even useful for sexual relations, because there were so many women who had bodies he found more attractive than hers.Radzinsky, Edvard, The Last Tsar, Doubleday, 1992, , p. 230 In September 1917, Boris received jewels from the Tsarina to help arrange for their escape,Moe, pp. 628‚Äì29. but according to Radzinsky, he kept the funds for himself. Nonetheless, she married Boris on October 5, 1917 in the chapel of the Tauride Palace. After the fall of the Russian Provisional Government the situation got worse. In spring 1918, the couple fled to her mother.Fuhrmann, p. 233. They lived in Pokrovskoye Tyumen and Tobolsk. Boris and her brother Dmitry turned in the officers who had come to Ekaterinburg to plan the escape of the Romanovs. Boris lost the money he had obtained from the jewels during the Russian Civil War that followed.Radzinsky, The Rasputin File, pp. 493‚Äì94 Boris defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Boris also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses for the benefit of the families he had defrauded.Occleshaw, Michael, The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor, Orion Publishing Group Ltd., 1993, p. 47 (For more information on the betrayal and jewels see the account of Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden.) Exile Maria Rasputina as a circus performer in 1932. Boris and Maria escaped to Vladivostok, where they lived for almost a year. Boris was arrested by the White Army and sent to Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai. Also Maria was questioned by Nikolai Sokolov about the Romanov jewels, which had disappeared. The White √©migr√©s were detained by the revolutionaries. After Tatyana (1920‚Äì2009) was born they left by ship for Ceylon, Suez, Trieste and Prague, where the couple opened a Russian restaurant, but business was slow. Then she was invited to work in Vienna. Their second daughter Maria (1922‚Äì1976) was born in Baden, Austria. Maria took dancing lessons in Berlin and stayed with Aron Simanovich, her father's former \\"bookkeeper\\". They settled in Montmartre, Paris, where Boris worked in a soap factory, as night porter, car-washer and for Waterman pens; they lived at Avenue Jean Jaur√®s. He died of tuberculosis in July 1926 in H√¥pital Cochin. Maria was offered a job as a cabaret dancer because of her name. She took more dancing lessons to support their two young daughters and invited her sister Varvara to come to Paris, but she died in Moscow. After Felix Yusupov published his memoir (in 1928) detailing the death of her father, Maria sued Yussupov and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia in a Paris court for damages of $800,000. She condemned both men as murderers and said any decent person would be disgusted by the ferocity of Rasputin's killing.King, Greg, The Man Who Killed Rasputin, Carol Publishing Group, 1995, , p. 232 Maria's claim was dismissed. The French court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over a political killing that took place in Russia.King, p. 233Fuhrmann, p. 236Moe, p. 630. Maria published the first of three memoirs about Rasputin in 1929: The Real Rasputin. In 1929, she worked at Busch Circus, where she had to dance to \\"the tragedy of my father's life and death, and be brought face-to-face on the stage with actors who were impersonating him and his murderers. Every time I have to confront my father on the stage a pang of poignant memory shoots through my heart, and I could break down and weep.\\" In 1932, Rasputin, My Father was published. In January 1933, she performed in Cirque d'hiver with a pony act. In December 1934 Maria was in London. In 1935 she found work in the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, based in Peru, Indiana. The circus toured America and Maria acted one season as a lion tamer, with Maria billed as \\"the daughter of the famous mad monk whose feats in Russia astonished the world.\\"Massie, p. 526 She was mauled by a bear in May 1935 but stayed with the circus until it reached Miami, Florida, where she quit before it ceased operations. In 1938, her two daughters were denied entry to the US. Maria was ordered to leave the country within 90 days, but then, in March 1940, she married Gregory Bernadsky, a childhood friend and former White Russian Army officer, in Miami. In 1946, they divorced and she became a U.S. citizen. In 1947 the youngest of her daughters married in Paris to (1897‚Äì1985), minister plenipotentiary in Greece, Chile, Israel and the Dutch ambassador to Cuba. She began work as a riveter, either in Miami or in a San Pedro, Los Angeles, California shipyard during World War II. Maria worked in defense plants until 1955 when she was forced to retire because of her age. After that, she supported herself by working in hospitals, giving Russian lessons, and babysitting for friends. In 1968, Maria claimed to be psychic and said Pat Nixon had come to her in a dream. At one point, she said she recognized Anna Anderson as Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, a claim she would later recant. Maria had two pet dogs, whom she called Youssou and Pov after Felix Yussupov.King, p. 277 During the last years of her life, she lived in Los Angeles, living on Social Security benefits. Her home was in Silver Lake, an area of Los Angeles with Russian √©migr√©s. Maria is buried in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery. Legacy Maria told her grandchildren that her father taught her to be generous, even in times when she was in need herself. Rasputin said she should never leave home with empty pockets, but should always have something to give to the poor. Her granddaughter Laurence Huot-Solovieff, the daughter of Maria's daughter Tatyana, recalled in 2005 that according to Maria, their infamous great- grandfather was a \\"simple man with a big heart and strong spiritual power, who loved Russia, God, and the Tsar.\\" See also *Nicholas and Alexandra: An Intimate Account of the Last of the Romanovs and the Fall of Imperial Russia NotesReferences * Alexander, Robert.

The Edward Youde Aviary was opened to the public in September 1992 and managed by the Urban Council. The aviary, largest in Southeast Asia, is named after the late Sir Edward Youde, The Governor of Hong Kong from 1982 to 1986. The valley is bounded by an east-facing slope fully covered with natural vegetation and a west-facing slope previously occupied by a barracks. It has a highest point of and a lowest point of above the valley floor. This walk-through aviary features a collection of 600 birds representing 80 species indigenous to Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and New Guinea. Ground dwelling birds including pheasants, partridges, pigeons and thrushes. Great argus pheasants proclaim their presence by ringing territorial calls and give one of the most elaborate courtship displays in the bird world. The entrance to the aviary consists of a small rectangular building. This building holds on display different types of eggs. Waterfowl lake The waterfowl lake linked with Edward Youde Aviary by an inner lake is landscaped to form a swamp to accommodate different species of waterfowl. Some attractive species found in the waterfowl lake are the Australian pelican, great white pelican and radjah shelduck. Caged display area right Some of the characteristic birds cannot be housed in the main aviary. Large hornbills predate smaller birds, they can only be seen in the three smaller display cages. Three displays let visitors view at a close range. Two cages house the white-crested hornbill and the great pied hornbill, while the other holds various species of birds of the Malesian region. Outdoor learning activities During the school term, park staff will conduct educational programmes for school children. Staff will also arrange guided tours for groups.

Exosomes are membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are produced in the endosomal compartment of most eukaryotic cells. The multivesicular body (MVB) is an endosome defined by intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that bud inward into the endosomal lumen. If the MVB fuses with the cell surface (the plasma membrane), these ILVs are released as exosomes. In multicellular organisms, exosomes and other EVs were discovered in biological fluids including blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid. Importantly, exosomes were also identified within the tissue matrix, coined Matrix-Bound Nanovesicles (MBV). They are also released in vitro by cultured cells into their growth medium. Since the size of exosomes is limited by that of the parent MVB, exosomes are generally thought to be smaller than most other EVs, from about 30 to 150 nanometres (nm) in diameter: around the same size as many lipoproteins but much smaller than cells. Compared with EVs in general, it is unclear whether exosomes have unique characteristics or functions or can be separated or distinguished effectively from other EVs. EVs including exosomes carry markers of cells of origin and have specialized functions in physiological processes, from coagulation and intercellular signalling to waste management. Consequently, there is a growing interest in clinical applications of EVs as biomarkers and therapies alike, prompting establishment of an International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) and a scientific journal devoted to EVs, the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles.  Background  Exosomes were first discovered in the maturing mammalian reticulocyte (immature red blood cell) by Stahl and group in 1983 and Johnstone and group in 1983 further termed 'exosomes' by Johnstone and group in 1987. Exosomes were shown to participate in selective removal of many plasma membrane proteins as the reticulocyte becomes a mature red blood cell (erythrocyte). In the reticulocyte, as in most mammalian cells, portions of the plasma membrane are regularly internalized as endosomes, with 50 to 180% of the plasma membrane being recycled every hour. In turn, parts of the membranes of some endosomes are subsequently internalized as smaller vesicles. Such endosomes are called multivesicular bodies because of their appearance, with many small vesicles, (ILVs or \\"intralumenal endosomal vesicles\\"), inside the larger body. The ILVs become exosomes if the MVB merges with the cell membrane, releasing the internal vesicles into the extracellular space. Exosomes contain various molecular constituents of their cell of origin, including proteins and RNA. Although the exosomal protein composition varies with the cell and tissue of origin, most exosomes contain an evolutionarily-conserved common set of protein molecules. The protein content of a single exosome, given certain assumptions of protein size and configuration, and packing parameters, can be about 20,000 molecules.Maguire, Greg (2016) Exosomes: smart nanospheres for drug delivery naturally produced by stem cells. In: Fabrication and Self Assembly of Nanobiomaterials. Elsevier pp. 179-209. The cargo of mRNA and miRNA in exosomes was first discovered at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. In that study, the differences in cellular and exosomal mRNA and miRNA content was described, as well as the functionality of the exosomal mRNA cargo. Exosomes have also been shown to carry double-stranded DNA. Exosomes can transfer molecules from one cell to another via membrane vesicle trafficking, thereby influencing the immune system, such as dendritic cells and B cells, and may play a functional role in mediating adaptive immune responses to pathogens and tumors. Therefore, scientists who are actively researching the role that exosomes may play in cell-to-cell signaling, often hypothesize that delivery of their cargo RNA molecules can explain biological effects. For example, mRNA in exosomes has been suggested to affect protein production in the recipient cell. However, another study has suggested that miRNAs in exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are predominantly pre- and not mature miRNAs. Because the authors of this study did not find RNA-induced silencing complex-associated proteins in these exosomes, they suggested that only the pre-miRNAs, but not the mature miRNAs in MSC exosomes, have the potential to be biologically active in the recipient cells. Multiple mechanisms have been reported to be involved in loading miRNAs into exosomes, including specific motifs in the miRNA sequences, interactions with lncRNAs localized to the exosomes, interactions with RBPs, and post-translational modifications of Ago. Conversely, exosome production and content may be influenced by molecular signals received by the cell of origin. As evidence for this hypothesis, tumor cells exposed to hypoxia secrete exosomes with enhanced angiogenic and metastatic potential, suggesting that tumor cells adapt to a hypoxic microenvironment by secreting exosomes to stimulate angiogenesis or facilitate metastasis to more favorable environment.  Terminology  Evolving consensus in the field is that the term \\"exosome\\" should be applied strictly to an EV of endosomal origin. Since it can be difficult to prove such an origin after an EV has left the cell, variations on the term \\"extracellular vesicle\\" are often appropriate instead.  Research  Exosomes from red blood cells contain the transferrin receptor that is absent in mature erythrocytes. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes express MHC I, MHC II, and costimulatory molecules and have been proven to be able to induce and enhance antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo. In addition, the first exosome-based cancer vaccination platforms are being explored in early clinical trials. Exosomes can also be released into urine by the kidneys, and their detection might serve as a diagnostic tool. Urinary exosomes may be useful as treatment response markers in prostate cancer. Exosomes secreted from tumour cells can deliver signals to surrounding cells and have been shown to regulate myofibroblast differentiation. In melanoma, tumor-derived vesicles can enter lymphatics and interact with subcapsular sinus macrophages and B cells in lymph nodes. A recent investigation showed that exosome release positively correlates with the invasiveness of ovarian cancer. Exosomes released from tumors into the blood may also have diagnostic potential. Exosomes are remarkably stable in bodily fluids strengthening their utility as reservoirs for disease biomarkers. Patient blood samples stored in biorepositories can be used for biomarker analysis as colorectal cancer cell- derived exosomes spiked into blood plasma could be recovered after 90 days of storage at various temperatures. In malignancies such as cancer, the regulatory circuit that guards exosome homeostasis is co-opted to promote cancer cell survival and metastasis. Urinary exosomes have also proven to be useful in the detection of many pathologies, such as genitourinary cancers and mineralocorticoid hypertension, through their protein and miRNA cargo.\\" With neurodegenerative disorders, exosomes appear to play a role in the spread of alpha-synuclein, and are being actively investigated as a tool to both monitor disease progression as well as a potential vehicle for delivery of drug and stem cell based therapy. An online open access database containing genomic information for exosome content has been developed to catalyze research development within the field.  Exosomes and intercellular communication  Scientists are actively researching the role that exosomes may play in cell- to-cell signaling, hypothesizing that because exosomes can merge with and release their contents into cells that are distant from their cell of origin (see membrane vesicle trafficking), they may influence processes in the recipient cell. For example, RNA that is shuttled from one cell to another, known as \\"exosomal shuttle RNA,\\" could potentially affect protein production in the recipient cell. By transferring molecules from one cell to another, exosomes from certain cells of the immune system, such as dendritic cells and B cells, may play a functional role in mediating adaptive immune responses to pathogens and tumors. Conversely, exosome production and content may be influenced by molecular signals received by the cell of origin. As evidence for this hypothesis, tumor cells exposed to hypoxia secrete exosomes with enhanced angiogenic and metastatic potential, suggesting that tumor cells adapt to a hypoxic microenvironment by secreting exosomes to stimulate angiogenesis or facilitate metastasis to more favorable environment. It has recently been shown that exosomal protein content may change during the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A study hypothesized that intercellular communication of tumor exosomes could mediate further regions of metastasis for cancer. Hypothetically, exosomes can plant tumor information, such as tainted RNA, into new cells to prepare for cancer to travel to that organ for metastasis. The study found that tumor exosomal communication has the ability to mediate metastasis to different organs. Furthermore, even when tumor cells have a disadvantage for replicating, the information planted at these new regions, organs, can aid in the expansion of organ specific metastasis. Exosomes carry cargo, which can augment innate immune responses. For example, exosomes derived from Salmonella enterica-infected macrophages but not exosomes from uninfected cells stimulate naive macrophages and dendritic cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Œ±, RANTES, IL-1ra, MIP-2, CXCL1, MCP-1, sICAM-1, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. Proinflammatory effects of exosomes are partially attributed to lipopolysaccharide, which is encapsulated within exosomes.  Exosome biogenesis, secretion, and uptake = Exosomes biogenesis  Exosome formation starts with the invagination of the multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) or late endosomes to generate intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). There are various proposed mechanisms for formation of MVBs, vesicle budding, and sorting. The most studied and well known is the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) dependent pathway. ESCRT machinery mediates the ubiquitinated pathway consisting of protein complexes; ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III, and associated ATPase Vps4. ESCRT 0 recognizes and retains ubiquitinated proteins marked for packaging in the late endosomal membrane. ESCRT I/II recognizes the ESCRT 0 and starts creating involution of the membrane into the MVB. ESCRTIII forms a spiral shaped structure constricting the neck. ATPase VPS4 protein drives the membrane scission. Syndecan-syntenin-ALIX exosome biogenesis pathway are one of the ESCRT- independent or non-canonical pathways for exosome biogenesis.  Exosome secretion  The MVBs once formed are trafficked to the internal side of the plasma membrane. These MVBs are transported to the plasma membrane leading to fusion. Many studies have shown that MVBs having higher cholesterol content fuse with the plasma membrane thus releasing exosomes. The Rab proteins especially Rab 7 attached to the MVB recognizes its effector receptor. The SNARE complex (soluble N- ethylmaleimide- sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor) from the MVB and the plasma membrane interacts and mediates fusion.  Exosome uptake  Specific targeting by exosomes is an active area of research. The exact mechanisms of exosome targeting is limited to a few general mechanisms like docking of the exosomes with specific proteins, sugars, and lipid, or micropinocytosis. The internalized exosomes are targeted to the endosomes which release their content in the recipient cell.  Sorting and packaging of cargoes in exosomes  Exosomes contain different cargoes; proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. These cargoes are specifically sorted and packaged into exosomes. The contents packaged into exosomes are cell type specific and also influenced by cellular conditions. Exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) and proteins are sorted and packaged in exosomes. Villarroya-Beltri and colleagues identified a conserved GGAG specific motif, EXOmotif, in the miRNA packaged in the exosomes which was absent in the cytosolic miRNA (CLmiRNA), which binds to sumoylated heterogeneous nuclear riboprotein (hnRNP) A2B1 for exosome specific miRNA packaging Proteins are packaged in ESCRT, tertraspanins, lipid- dependent mechanisms. Exosomes are enriched in cholesterol, spingomyelin, saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatyletanolamine as compared to the plasma membrane of the cell.  Isolation  The isolation and detection of exosomes has proven to be complicated. Due to the complexity of body fluids, physical separation of exosomes from cells and similar-sized particles is challenging. Isolation of exosomes using differential ultracentrifugation results in co-isolation of protein and other contaminants and incomplete separation of vesicles from lipoproteins. Combining ultracentrifugation with micro-filtration or a gradient can improve purity. Single step isolation of extracellular vesicles by size-exclusion chromatography has been demonstrated to provide greater efficiency for recovering intact vesicles over centrifugation, although a size-based technique alone will not be able to distinguish exosomes from other vesicle types. To isolate a pure population of exosomes a combination of techniques is necessary, based on both physical (e.g. size, density) and biochemical parameters (e.g. presence/absence of certain proteins involved in their biogenesis). The use of reference materials such as trackable recombinant EV will assist in mitigating technical variation introduced during sample preparation and analysis. Often, functional as well as antigenic assays are applied to derive useful information from multiple exosomes. Well-known examples of assays to detect proteins in total populations of exosomes are mass spectrometry and Western blot. However, a limitation of these methods is that contaminants may be present that affect the information obtained from such assays. Preferably, information is derived from single exosomes. Relevant properties of exosomes to detect include size, density, morphology, composition, and zeta potential.  Detection  Since the diameter of exosomes is typically below 100 nm and because they have a low refractive index, exosomes are below the detection range of many currently used techniques. A number of miniaturized systems, exploiting nanotechnology and microfluidics, have been developed to expedite exosome analyses. These new systems include a microNMR device, a nanoplasmonic chip, and a magneto- electrochemical sensor for protein profiling; and an integrated fluidic cartridge for RNA detection. Flow cytometry is an optical method to detect exosomes in suspension. Nevertheless, the applicability of flow cytometry to detect single exosomes is still inadequate due to limited sensitivity and potential measurement artifacts such as swarm detection. Other methods to detect single exosomes are atomic force microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, Raman microspectroscopy, tunable resistive pulse sensing, and transmission electron microscopy.  Bioinformatics analysis  Exosomes contain RNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites that is reflective of the cell type of origin. As exosomes contain numerous proteins, RNA and lipids, large scale analysis including proteomics and transcriptomics is often performed. Currently, to analyse these data, non-commercial tools such as FunRich can be used to identify over-represented groups of molecules. With the advent of Next generation sequencing technologies, the research on exosomes have been accelerated in not only cancer but various diseases. Recently, bioinformatics based analysis of RNA-Seq data of exosomes extracted from Trypanosoma cruzi has showed the association of these extracellular vesicles with various important gene products that strengthens the probability of finding biomarkers for Chagas disease.  Therapeutics and carriers of drugs  Increasingly, exosomes are being recognized as potential therapeutics as they have the ability to elicit potent cellular responses in vitro and in vivo.Yeo, R. W. Y., & Lim, S. K. (2016). Exosomes and their Therapeutic Applications. In ADVANCES IN PHARMACEUTICAL CELL THERAPY: Principles of Cell-Based Biopharmaceuticals (pp. 477-501). Exosomes mediate regenerative outcomes in injury and disease that recapitulate observed bioactivity of stem cell populations. Mesenchymal stem cell exosomes were found to activate several signaling pathways important in wound healing (Akt, ERK, and STAT3), bone fracture repair and participates in the regulation of immune-mediated responses and inflammatory diseases. They induce the expression of a number of growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), nerve growth factor (NGF), and stromal-derived growth factor-1 (SDF1)). Exosomes secreted by human circulating fibrocytes, a population of mesenchymal progenitors involved in normal wound healing via paracrine signaling, exhibited in-vitro proangiogenic properties, activated diabetic dermal fibroblasts, induced the migration and proliferation of diabetic keratinocytes, and accelerated wound closure in diabetic mice in vivo. Important components of the exosomal cargo were heat shock protein-90Œ±, total and activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, proangiogenic (miR-126, miR-130a, miR-132) and anti-inflammatory (miR124a, miR-125b) microRNAs, and a microRNA regulating collagen deposition (miR-21). Researchers have also found that exosomes released from oral keratinocytes can accelerate wound healing, even when human exosomes were applied to rat wounds. Exosomes can be considered a promising carrier for effective delivery of small interfering RNA due to their existence in body's endogenous system and high tolerance. Patient-derived exosomes have been employed as a novel cancer immunotherapy in several clinical trials. Exosomes offer distinct advantages that uniquely position them as highly effective drug carriers. Askenase, Philip W., Artificial nanoparticles are not as good as the real thing, Outlook, Nature, June 17, 2020 Composed of cellular membranes with multiple adhesive proteins on their surface, exosomes are known to specialize in cell‚Äìcell communications and provide an exclusive approach for the delivery of various therapeutic agents to target cells. For example, researchers used exosomes as a vehicle for the delivery of cancer drug paclitaxel. They placed the drug inside exosomes derived from white blood cells, which were then injected into mice with drug-resistant lung cancer. Importantly, incorporation of paclitaxel into exosomes increased cytotoxicity more than 50 times as a result of nearly complete co-localization of airway-delivered exosomes with lung cancer cells.

The canal supplied Japan's first public hydroelectric power generator, which served from 1895 to provide electricity for Kyoto's trams. In 1996 the canal was designated a Historic Site. As of 2008, the waterway is not used so much to generate electricity, but rather for water supply, fire-fighting and irrigation purposes. Facilities Biwako Incline around 1940 Biwako Incline in April 2005. The waterway runs from the vicinity of Mii-dera in ≈åtsu, Shiga to its terminus near Nanzen-ji in Kyoto through tunnels under the mountains. Between the two cities, the canal has two routes, the and the . Due to the 36 meter difference in elevation between the upstream dam and its terminus, an inclined plane was built, which allowed boats to travel on land via the use of a flat car on which they were placed. Operation of the track gauge incline ceased in 1948, but part of its structure has been preserved and is now a tourist attraction, famous for its ornamental cherry trees. History Biwa Canal and inclined railroad for hoisting the boats Following the Meiji Restoration and the subsequent transfer of the capital to Tokyo, the city of Kyoto suffered a decrease in population and industrial activity. In order to make up for this problem, the third Prefectural Governor of Kyoto, , ordered and supervised the construction of the Biwa Lake Canal, devised to facilitate water and passenger transportation, its use in industry and the generation of electricity. Minami Ichirobe, who had worked with van Doorn on the Asaka Canal, was commissioned to conduct a preliminary survey. Construction work for the first canal (which went up to the confluence point between ≈åtsu and the Kamo River) began in 1885 and finished five years later in 1890. The whole enterprise was estimated at 1,250,000 silver dollars, paid for by the central government (one quarter), the Meiji Emperor (one third), and local taxes. In order to inspect the construction works, --the project's chief engineer--was called in from the United States, where he had stayed for the duration of the year of 1888. It was during this visit, and after consulting with North American engineers, that the idea of building a power station, fashioned after the Aspen hydroelectric plant, was put in practice after his return to Japan in 1889--previously the plan contemplated only the use of water wheels. The station was operational in 1891. In order to make use of the power generated, construction of what was to become Japan's first streetcar railroad, the , began in 1895. In 1894 the Kamo River Waterway-- started in 1892--was completed, uniting Kamo River and Fushimi ward. Due to an increasing demand for tap water and electricity, plans were made for the construction of the second route (Canal No. 2), which started in 1908 and finished in 1912. A water treatment plant was also erected in Kyoto. Following the development of the railway and the road, the role of the canal as a means of transportation was over by the 1940s. Museum Lake Biwa Canal Museum of Kyoto In August 1989 the was established to commemorate the centenary of the opening. The museum reopened after renovation in 2009.
