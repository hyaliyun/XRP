They are an advocate for intersex human rights and against nonconsensual intersex medical interventions. Early life and education Pagonis was born in 1986 in Chicago, Illinois, and has Mexican and Greek ancestry. As a child, Pagonis, who is queer and nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, was diagnosed with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). They were not told of this condition, but instead were raised as a girl, told that they had ovarian cancer (when they in fact had no ovaries, but internal testes), and subjected to a series of surgeries to alter their genitalia. They learned about intersex traits during their freshman year in college, while attending a lecture at DePaul University. They subsequently accessed their own medical records, and learned the truth about their condition. In 2020, they learned that their AIS diagnosis was incorrect and that they have another intersex variation, as their low levels of estrogen and osteopenia might have indicated. Pagonis graduated from DePaul with bachelor's and master's degrees in women and gender studies. Activism Pagonis joined the advocacy organization interACT a few years after discovering they were intersex. They became the leadership coordinator of the youth program at interACT. In 2013, Pagonis testified with Mauro Cabral, Natasha Jim√©nez and Paula Sandrine Machado before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights about the medical interventions they were subjected to as an intersex child. They were also featured in the 2012 documentary Intersexion. In 2014, Pagonis created a documentary of their own, The Son They Never Had: Growing Up Intersex, which they tour around the country, advocating against nonconsensual \\"corrective surgeries\\". This work was published in a bioethics journal, Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics. The Son They Never Had was also shown at the Leeds Queer Film Festival in the UK in March 2017. In 2015, Pagonis created the hashtag campaign #intersexstories for Intersex Awareness Day. The campaign attracted a huge following, with many intersex people sharing their stories. Pagonis also appeared in a BuzzFeed video about intersex bodies, identities and experiences. Pagonis is a writer for Everyday Feminism, where they have addressed subjects including anti-black racism in the intersex community, interviewing Sean Saifa Wall and Lynnell Stephani Long , and debate over the inclusion of intersex people in the LGBTQA acronym. Pagonis appeared in a 2016 episode of the television series Transparent. They lobbied for the part when meeting show creator Jill Soloway at a White House awards ceremony. Pagonis appeared on the cover of the January 2017 National Geographic \\"Gender Revolution\\" issue. They were one of the intersex activists who wrote in expressing concern that being intersex was defined by the magazine as a disorder. National Geographic responded to reader pressure by updating the definition in the online issue. In June 2017, Pagonis appeared in a video for Teen Vogue alongside fellow intersex advocates Emily Quinn and Hanne Gaby Odiele, explaining what it means to be intersex. Awards and recognition Pagonis was one of nine LGBT artists honored as an Obama White House Champion of Change in 2015. They were also one of \\"30 Under 30\\" honored by the Windy City Times in 2013.

It has the subtitle Schauspiel nach den Heimkehr-Ges√§ngen der Odyssee, meaning \\"play after the homecoming songs from the Odyssey\\". It tells the story of how Odysseus, the Greek hero from the Trojan War, returns after 20 years to his court in Ithaca, where he massacres the suitors of his wife Penelope to recreate order. Production history The play premiered on 17 July 1996 at the Munich Kammerspiele, directed by Dieter Dorn. It was produced for the Deutsches Theater in Berlin by Thomas Langhoff the following year. Reception Several critics, including Wolfgang H√∂bel of Der Spiegel and Rolf Michaelis of Die Zeit, speculated whether the play was related to a passage from Strau√ü' heavily debated essay \\"Anschwellender Bocksgesang\\", about how \\"blood sacrifice\\" is the means by which a nation imposes its moral laws, and whether the play thereby has an anti-democratic message. Roland Koberg of the Berliner Zeitung was skeptical of such an interpretation and wrote that the play easily can be interpreted as a \\"peace text\\", as the gods who incite the violence are condemned for it. H√∂bel, who reviewed the Munich performance, criticized Dorn's portrayal of the suitors in punk rock style, as it did not make them appear as serious threats to \\"manners, law and state\\", and made it incomprehensible \\"why Odysseus specifically has to pierce their chests, instead of simply pulling their ears\\". Koberg reviewed the Berlin performance, and wrote that Langhoff's version was \\"somewhat wiser\\", with the suitors portrayed as a \\"stylized counter-chorus\\".

From 1990 until 1993, Maybon was more of a regular in the Rabbitohs' team. In his six-year stint with the Rabbitohs, Maybon played 78 games and scored 107 points. In 1994, after failing to secure an adequate contract with South Sydney (who were in financial trouble at the time and could only offer him a reduced salary), he moved to the St. George Dragons and played with them until the end of the 1995 season. His departure from the Rabbitohs caused significant controversy within the club with many ordinary members of the club extremely disappointed with the decision to release him.

Besides being recognized as one of the \\"What's in Your Wallet?\\" Capital One Vikings, he has also appeared in more Super Bowl commercials for more different companies than anyone else in history. In 2013, he was part of the team that won the Doritos \\"Crash the Super Bowl\\" contest, when he appeared wearing a wedding dress. Outside of hundreds of commercials, notable characters on TV and in feature films include Harold \\"Big\\" Johnson on Grimm, Tiny on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Moses on Battles BC, and Joseph of Nazareth in XL. He has also made appearances on children's shows such shows as Nickelodeon's Henry Danger and Disney's Just Roll with It. Other appearances include roles on Jimmy Kimmel Live, TNT's Animal Kingdom, and the television series Lethal Weapon. Early life Cereghino was born in Milwaukie, Oregon, on April 24, 1979, where his family has run a farm since 1908. His father, Robert \\"Bobby\\" Cereghino, was a farmer and a home builder, and his mother Nancy is an elementary and special ed teacher. He graduated from high school as a multi-sport athlete, playing football and baseball, wrestling, and setting a school record in the mile run while running track and cross country. After graduation, he briefly lived in Nashville to start a singing career before moving to Los Angeles in 2000. His first movie role was in the 1995 film Mr. Holland's Opus, where he was included in the graduation scene because he had the proper shoes on for the period piece. His high school football experience would later aid him in his performance as one of the stunt doubles doing tackles in The Longest Yard. Writing career Cereghino has published several screenplays, twelve novels, and a non-fiction collection of short stories. In 2015, his novel 116* Days With Dad was published by Black Hill Press. The novel is loosely based on his experience as a commercial fisherman on an Alaskan fishing vessel. Recalling the experience, Cereghino said, \\"I went to Alaska, and it turned into a great story. At first, I thought it was the worst job in the world. You have no time off, and you spend 18 to 22 hours a day waist deep in fish blood and guts. Then when you get on shore there are all these bears, and you stink like fish.\\" Later in 2015, his novel Kiki's Angel was published by CreateSpace. An earlier publication of Cereghino's eleventh novel, A Time To Lie, has been his best seller to date and was also published by CreateSpace. He has been a contributing author to the Chicken Soup for the Soul book series since 2004. His work appeared in Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul IV, and his story Christmas Cheer was rated as one of the top 101 Chicken Soup for the Soul stories of all time. Songwriting and acting careers Cereghino plays nine instruments and has penned hundreds of songs. Singing has allowed him to travel most of the world, performing in gigs on every continent, near or at the North and South Pole, and at dozens of countries around the world. He often appears as a musical guest on Kato Kaelin's show. He once broke his foot while doing a stunt on the show Operation Repo but continued to film the remainder of the episode. The scene ended up being made into the opening credits for the show and could be seen at the start of every episode. He appeared in Justin Timberlake's music video Can't Stop the Feeling, where he plays the dancing mechanic. This was not Cereghino's first professional dancing gig, as he had been hired to dance for a series of commercials to promote the National Pumpkin Chucking competition some years earlier.

It is one of New York Times' Notable Books of the Year. As of 2016, a film of Layover is in production. The novel focuses on the theme of maternal grief. Description After her young son is killed in a car accident and her husband, a surgeon, admits during sex to having had an affair, the protagonist Claire Newbold ‚Äì a successful medical sales representative in her early forties ‚Äì fails to return home from a business trip. She drifts, staying in hotel rooms without paying, obsessively swimming in their pools and becoming adept at evading both hotel security and her husband's calls. She starts to have sex with a series of strangers, including a youth in his late teens and his father, constructs lies in which her son is still alive, and begins to descend into madness. The novel is written in the first person, with a narrator who is not always reliable. Writing and publication Layover has been described by the author and literary agent Donald Maass as Zeidner's \\"breakout novel\\". It is her fourth novel, published a decade after her third; Zeidner spent five years writing it, stating that she wanted to create \\"a smart, middle-aged woman, a grownup\\". As in some of her other novels, including Customs (1981) and Love Bomb (2012), the protagonist is close to Zeidner's own age at the time of writing. Zeidner characterized the plot in 2016 as a \\"woman kind of losing her mind after the loss of her son\\" and her attempts to \\"find a way back to her marriage and to herself\\". She said that the book focuses on \\"how women lose it\\", and highlighted that \\"women keep better control of the things they have to do.\\" Despite the serious subject matter, Zeidner intended the novel to be \\"entertaining\\". She stated in a 2012 interview that \\"tragicomedy is what interests me\\" and that all her writing attempts > to bring humor to bear on subjects that are usually straight-faced and > earnest. I did that with my first novel, which was about a homeless person, > and my second, which was about date rape, and have just kept it going, > because I truly believe that there's truth in irony, in complexity of tone. She reported researching medical conditions that might underlie the protagonist's behavioral change, as well as how hotel security operates. The novel has been translated into several languages including Dutch, French, German and Hebrew. Reviews and critical analysis Reviewers Joanne Kaufman and Betsy Kline liken the novel to other fiction of the 1990s in which a woman leaves her life and family behind, including Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years (1995), Kathryn Harrison's Exposure (1993) and the short story \\"Crocodile Tears\\" by A. S. Byatt (anthologized in 1998). The novelist Karen Karbo, reviewing the novel in The New York Times, writes: > With '\\"Layover,\\" Zeidner joins the ranks of Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood > and Fay Weldon, all of whom have written in the women-spiraling-into-madness > genre. But Claire is something new. Unlike would-be female nut cases from an > earlier time, she doesn't set off on her journey needing to shuck her good- > wife persona. She highlights the appropriateness of the name \\"Newbold\\", and considers that the novel \\"really begins to soar\\" after Claire seduces the teenager, adding: > There are few aspects of a novel more compelling than watching the writer go > out on a limb, wondering how dare she. Claire's odyssey of lust, seduction, > desire, control ... never veers from what we think of as classic male acting > out, which forces us to examine why we would more easily accept such > behavior in a bereaved father than in a bereaved mother. The review focuses on the novel's treatment of grief, which Karbo describes as \\"wise and shrewd\\", and highlights the way in which Claire fails to grieve in an acceptable fashion. Karbo praises the novel's handling of the sexuality of a woman in her forties, and highlights the fact that Claire's journey is not \\"a simple sexual one\\". The academics Caroline Field Levander and Matthew Pratt Guterl quote this comment from Karbo, adding that the novel is about \\"a self in desperate need\\". They identify Claire as a \\"modern-day Erica Jong\\", and highlight the role of the hotel setting, which \\"facilitates transgressive feminine performance and female sexuality\\". In a review for the Chicago Tribune, Kaufman writes: \\"The considerable strength of \\"Layover\\" can be measured in the willingness of readers to give Claire the rights and privileges and emotional rope they'd probably withhold from others.\\" She considers the novel to have \\"a terrific, unforced edginess and power‚Äîit's no accident that author Lisa Zeidner is a poet. And there are moments when she simply rips out your heart and hands it to you.\\" She criticises \\"some questionable plot points and some stretches of self-indulgence.\\" The Publishers Weekly review praises the novel's unusual approach to the theme of long-term grief, and states that in addition to the \\"titillating‚Äîand sometimes funny\\" sex scenes it presents a sharply satirical view of society, that deconstructs those men whose work supplies \\"a false sense of aggrandizement\\" as well as their female partners. Bonnie Johnston, reviewing the novel for Booklist, praises its fresh and unmelodramatic exploration of the protagonist's angst. A review in Library Journal recommends the novel, describing Claire's course as \\"oddly appealing, even familiar to any reader caught in the absurd quests demanded by midlife.\\" The New Yorker review states: \\"Zeidner's writing is like her heroine: taut, intelligent, and seductive.\\" Betsy Kline, in a review for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, writes that Layover \\"dares to poke holes in the surface of polite grief and allow an intelligent women free rein of a consuming pain, descending to levels of larceny and lust that are both chilling and, at times, exhilarating to behold.\\" Martin Wilson, in a review for The Austin Chronicle, praises the novel's \\"humor, wisdom, and poignancy\\" and its \\"compelling, sometimes hilarious\\" narrator; he states that a strength of the work is its emphasis on the notion that redemptive endings require effort and might not always be achievable. He criticises the characters as sometimes appearing overly scripted. In an analysis of why the novel succeeded, Maass writes that > Zeidner dug deep, and as a result Claire Newbold achieves a kind of > Everywoman depth and power. Emotional appeal, a rare-but-credible decision > to drop out and the conflict inherent in a married woman plunging into a > mind-numbing, soul-freeing bout of sex all combine to make a breakout > premise. Poetic and honest writing then turn that premise into a breakout > novel. In an online review for Metapsychology Online, Christian Perring points out that > Claire works through her problem by getting laid. Presumably the pun in the > title is intentional, and it even occurred to me that there's \\"lover\\" in > \\"layover\\". Given the well-crafted and deliberate writing with many layers of > meaning, it's unlikely that there are any accidents in the choice of words, > especially the title. Awards Layover was selected as one of New York Times' Notable Books of the Year for 1999. Film adaptation In April 2016, it was announced that a film of the novel is in production, adapted and directed by Toni Kalem, which is to star Pen√©lope Cruz. Kalem stated in a September 2016 interview that the film setting had been updated from 1999 ‚Äì in particular, by updating the communications technology used ‚Äì to avoid transforming it into \\"a period piece\\".

Transvaal Scottish influence In July 1946, the first intake of post war recruits into the 3rd Battalion Transvaal Scottish Regiment were reformed as the 7th Medium Regiment SAA (3 t.s.) with its headquarters in Benoni. The first officer commanding was Commandant A.H. Guy. The members continued to wear Transvaal Scottish buttons and shoulder titles but now wore artillery cap badges and collar badges. The regiment was equipped with two eight-gun batteries of 5.5 inch guns. This 7 Medium Regiment was disbanded on 28 February 1960. Rebirth of 7 Medium Regiment With the reorganization of the Artillery Corps in 1974, it was decided to once again establish a medium regiment and this became the 7 Medium Regiment SAA (fd), a Citizen Force unit with its headquarters once again in Benoni.

Cunningham joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of the First World War. He participated in the Gallipoli Campaign and served on the Western Front. An experienced soldier in the Territorial Force, after the war he held a series of senior command positions while working as a solicitor. During the Second World War he commanded what would become the Pacific Section of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force, which was responsible for the defence of Fiji until he was discharged from the military after becoming ill. He was prominent in the legal profession, working as a crown prosecutor in Wellington both before and after the Second World War and also served a term as the President of the New Zealand Law Society. Knighted for his work in the law, he died in 1959. Early life William Henry Cunningham was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 24 September 1883, the son of Elizabeth Harriet (later Mrs Brown) and William Henry Cunningham. He received his education at Wanganui Collegiate School and then, after studying law, became a solicitor in 1907. He was a barrister by 1912, practicing law in Wanganui. First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Cunningham volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), which was being raised for service overseas. An experienced soldier in the Territorial Force, he was assigned to the Wellington Battalion with the rank of major. He served during the Gallipoli Campaign and on 8 August 1915, when the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel William George Malone, was killed during the Battle of Chunuk Bair, Cunningham briefly took command before he was wounded. Evacuated to England for medical treatment, he was mentioned in despatches for his services while at Gallipoli. When the New Zealand Division was formed in February 1916, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed commander of 2nd Battalion, Wellington Infantry Regiment. Apart from periods of illness, he led the battalion for most of its service on the Western Front until November 1917 when he was hospitalised. In early 1918, he took command of the reserve battalion of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. During the Spring Offensive, he resumed command of the 2nd Battalion and led it until the end of the war. During the course of the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (for the handling of his battalion during the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette), mentioned in despatches four times and received the Russian Order of St Stanislas (3rd Class with Swords). Interwar period After the war, Cunningham returned in New Zealand in January 1919 aboard the steamer Ruahine, as officer commanding the 700 troops of the NZEF also travelling home. Discharged from the NZEF, he went back to his legal practice but retained an interest in the military by continuing his service with the Territorial Force, in which he commanded the Wellington West Coast Regiment. In 1925, he was made commander of the Hawke‚Äôs Bay Regiment and then in 1929, he was promoted to colonel and took over the 2nd Infantry Brigade. Prior to this, he wrote several chapters of the history of the Wellington Infantry Regiment which was published in 1928. His appointment as a brigade commander coincided with a move to Wellington to establish a legal partnership, Luke, Cunningham and Clere, with his brother-in-law and another lawyer. He became prominent in the legal profession in Wellington, serving on the council of the Wellington District Law Society, including a term as its president. A year after taking his brigade command, he was appointed an honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor-General, Lord Bledisloe. In 1935, Cunningham gave up his command of 2nd Infantry Brigade and was placed on the reserve of officers. In recognition of his military service, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and this was gazetted on 31 May 1935. The following year, he was appointed a crown prosecutor in Wellington. Second World War Since 1938, the Crown Colony of Fiji had been recognised as being the most likely objective for the Japanese Empire should it engage in offensive operations in the South Pacific. If it came under Japanese control, New Zealand's security would be threatened. In early 1940, Cunningham was recalled from the reserve of officers and, with the rank of colonel, in July he was dispatched to Fiji, accompanying Major General John Duigan, the Chief of General Staff, on an inspection trip of the island's defences. It had been earlier proposed by the New Zealand Government that a brigade group of around 2,900 personnel be raised to supplement Fiji's defences. Cunningham was selected to command this formation, designated 8th Brigade. Duigan returned to New Zealand once the inspection tour was completed while Cunningham remained in Fiji dealing with logistical issues in preparation for the arrival of 8th Brigade. Promoted to brigadier, he faced several difficulties in his new command which was insufficient to cover the approximately 250 islands that made up Fiji. Cunningham opted to focus his defences around the port and airfield on the main island of Viti Levu. However, these two facilities were some 150 miles from each other, meaning he had to split his brigade into two. He laid down plans for defensive facilities but these were often delayed pending approval from New Zealand. Furthermore, many of the men of the brigade group were old and unfit while the equipment and uniforms available were of substandard quality. In November 1941, Cunningham was appointed commandant of the Fiji Defence Force which included the land forces not only in Fiji, but also Tonga and Fanning Island. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Fijian Territorial Force also came under his jurisdiction and brought the total manpower of his command to nearly 5,000 personnel. Following the entry of Japan into the Second World War, the Fiji garrison was increased in January 1942 with the arrival of the 14th Brigade. This brought the total strength of the garrison on Fiji to 7,600 personnel. Cunningham was promoted to major general and became overall commander of all New Zealand personnel in Fiji, which was designated Pacific Section, 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), while command of 8th Brigade was passed to Brigadier Leonard Goss. The progress of Japan's advance in Malaya and elsewhere in the Pacific now raised real fears that Fiji would be attacked in February. However, by this stage Cunningham had become ill with dysentery and was hospitalised. Later that month he was returned to New Zealand due to his poor health. Major General Owen Mead took over command of the Pacific Section, 2NZEF. Later life Discharged from the military, Cunningham returned to his duties as the crown prosecutor in Wellington. He was also heavily involved in the Wellington Returned Services Association, serving a term as its president. He was president of the New Zealand Law Society from 1950 to 1954 and was knighted for his services to the legal profession in the 1955 New Year Honours. Having retired two years previously, he died on 20 April 1959 and was buried in Karori Cemetery in Wellington.

History The original 14 Field Regiment 14 Field Regiment was initially formed in Bethlehem in the Orange Free State in 1962 with only one Battery, namely 143 Battery with an intake from Commando Regiments for their basic and individual training on the G1 and G2 guns with additional basic training on smaller weapons such as the 60 and 81mm mortars as well as .50-calibre machine guns. During October 1967, 14 Field Regiment was relocated to Potchefstroom where it was disbanded on 7 November 1967 and its structures incorporated into 4 Artillery Regiment. Its operational Battery at Walvis Bay was renamed 43 Battery Walvis Bay. Rebirth of 14 Field Regiment On 13 May 1974 the unit was however reactivated and renamed to 14 Field Artillery Regiment and located outside Potchefstroom in September 1974. New requirements The SADF was interested in the 120mm mortar system and the activation of an airborne artillery battery. There was also an emphasis on obtaining 155mm guns.

The album was released on 5 February 2013 via Blue Note to a critical success, receiving an average score of 86/100 from 11 reviewers on Metacritic, which indicates \\"universal acclaim\\". Background Without a Net is Shorter‚Äôs first album for Blue Note Records in 43 years after Odyssey of Iska released in 1971. The album contains eight quartet tracks from its European tour in late 2011, including six original compositions, plus a 23-minute centrepiece \\"Pegasus\\" supported by the woodwind and brass ensemble Imani Winds. The composition \\"Orbits\\" is a new version of the Miles Davis Quintet‚Äôs 1967 song of the same name. For \\"Orbits\\" the album won 2014 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo. The quartet also included the title song from the 1933 musical film Flying Down to Rio. Reception Will Layman of PopMatters wrote \\"Wayne Shorter and his quartet are not just a good or great jazz group, they are a single voice of one the best American musicians we‚Äôve had in the last 50 years. This is a musician who is far from in his valedictory years. Wayne Shorter seems, only now, to be saying all that has had to say. And Without a Net out to get a superb listening. It‚Äôs the shape of where jazz has been and where it is today.\\" Chris Barton of The Los Angeles Times stated \\"the album is a sprawling, relentlessly inventive listen that nods toward Shorter‚Äôs rich legacy as a true musical giant, even while pointing toward an undeniable truth that, even at 80 years old, he isn‚Äôt finished exploring yet.\\" Rob Shepherd of PostGenre noted, \\"While the performances by the saxophonist and his long- standing quartet ... are extraordinary, it is really the compositions which come to the fore. Throughout, they reconstruct an eclectic complication of songs ranging from new tunes to longstanding originals including those once played with Miles‚Äô Second Great Quintet or Weather Report. Like with the rest of Shorter‚Äôs scores, even the oldest of these is made to sound not just new and contemporary but, at times, futuristic.\\"Rob Shepherd‚Äôs Favorite Jazz Albums of the 2010s.

Bombing of Darwin MV Neptuna explodes at Stokes Hill Wharf in 1942 Darwin was bombed by the Japanese Imperial Navy on 19 February 1942. Four Japanese aircraft carriers launched 188 aircraft during the morning led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida targeting ships in Darwin Harbour as well as the town's port facilities. The Japanese raiders arrived over Darwin at 9:58 am. HMAS Gunbar was the first ship to be attacked, being strafed by several Zero fighters. At about this time, the town's air raid sirens were belatedly sounded. The Japanese bombers then conducted dive bombing and level bombing attacks on the ships in Darwin Harbour. These attacks lasted for 30 minutes and resulted in the sinking of three warships and six merchant vessels, damaging another ten ships. The ships sunk were the USS Peary, HMAS Mavie, , (which exploded while docked at Darwin's main wharf), , , . The oil tanker Karalee and the coal storage hulk Kelat sank later. At least 21 labourers working on the wharf were killed when it was bombed. On their way back to the carriers, some Japanese aircraft passed over the Florence D. and Don Isidro, which enabled planning for an afternoon strike which sank both freighters. Salvage operation MV British Motorist, salvaged in Darwin Harbour By the late 1950s, seven large wrecks remained in Darwin Harbour, an impediment to shipping and port development. After numerous attempts to find a contractor, a Japanese company, the Fujita Salvage Company successfully secured the tender and obtained the rights to the wartime wrecks, many from Darwin salvage expert Carl Atkinson. Ryogo Fujita and his crew of 120 workers arrived in Darwin on 21 July 1959. The first ship they raised from the ocean floor was a transporter, the MV British Motorist. The ship became the living quarters for Fujita's workers who were initially not permitted on Australian soil so soon after World War 2. They were not permitted to work in Darwin if they had any involvement in the Japanese war efforts. They salvaged seven wrecks over two years including MV Neptuna, USAT Meigs and the USS Peary. Fujita also salvaged other metal materials from across the Darwin region the guns at East Point in Darwin. A Japanese diver, Hayashi Sanzo died during the operation, when his air line became detached from his helmet. Legacy Fujita family tombstone featuring a propellor blade from the Meigs Relationships between the Darwin community and Fujita Salvage Company crew grew over the two-year operation. The salvage operations on the harbour coincided with the building of a new church on the Smith Street site of the former US military headquarters, destroyed during the war. Fujita, in a spirit of generosity, commissioned his team to create 77 bronze crosses for the church from scrap salvaged from the Australian vessel Zealandia. He spoke at the official opening of the church on 23 July 1960, a year after the arrival of the Japanese salvage team. Fujita considered the salvage operation his life work. A propeller blade from the Meigs features on his gravestone. The blade was gifted and relocated to Darwin Memorial Uniting Church in 2017.

He was a major force in establishing an American approach to carillon performance, composing and arranging. Barnes' style revolved around the carillon as a concert instrument, requiring an intense focus on the sound of the bells. He began playing the carillon at First-Plymouth Congregational Church, earning his BMus in 1950 at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and his MA at Stanford University in 1961. Barnes joined the Guild of Carillonneurs of North America (GCNA) in 1948, serving as the publisher of the Guild's Bulletin and president for three terms. From 1952 to 1963 he was University Carillonist at the University of Kansas, Lawrence. He was Cathedral Carillonneur at the National Cathedral, Washington, DC, from 1963 to 1975 and University Carillonist at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1982 until his retirement in 1995. Much of Barnes' music is considered to be standard playing for carillon students. At Berkeley, he founded the Berkeley Carillon Institute, and in 1988 he was awarded the GCNA's Certificate of Extraordinary Service. Barnes died of leukemia on November 3, 1997 at Coming Home Hospice in San Francisco. He was 70.

He served under the government of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) for over 20 years, where he held the position of Engineer-in-Chief of the Public Works Department. He oversaw the construction of numerous roads and bridges in the country and contributed to buildings such as the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.  Early life  In 1889, he left university and went to Thailand to work for the Grassi Brothers, a foreign construction company in Siam. Later, the Thai government hired Allegri to help build palaces and other structures, making him the first foreign engineer to work in the Thai construction industry. In 1893, he became the chief engineer for the Ministry of Public Works and promptly hired 35 Italian staff members.  Career  Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, completed in 1915 Allegri was assigned by the Thai government to modify the palace. During renovations, Allegri had to overcome numerous construction issues. For example, he initially chose brick for the foundation of the building without realizing it was not strong enough. Allegri partnered with Annibale Rigotti and Mario Tamagno who both graduated from the Accademia Albertina in 1890. Allegri was not formerly educated in the same way as his partners, but had learned some engineering knowledge and experience from his family business. His family was known for bridge construction in Italy, and the Thai government knew that Allegri and his partners were able to construct the bridge. This is why they permitted to build many bridges in Thailand. In 1905, he and his partner wanted to build a bridge that was made from iron. In 1907, he and his friends had designed Villa Norasingh that had a feeling of ‚ÄúVenice of the East‚Äù and they built a huge palace for King Rama V called the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. Allegri built many buildings and structures and contributed to buildings such as, Phan Fa Li Lat Bridge (1905), Red cross hospital (1900), Paruskavan Palace (1903-1905), and Phan Phiphop Lila Bridge (1904).  Personal life  Having played a prominent role in Thailand during the time of King Rama V‚Äôs renovation of Siam (Thailand), Allegri retired and returned to Italy after the completion of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. In 1938, he died in Italy at the age of 76.

History  The Charter of the Forest was first signed on 6 November 1217 as a sister charter to the Magna Carta from which it had evolved. Some minor changes were made to it, before it was reissued in 1225. It was then joined with Magna Carta in the Confirmation of Charters in 1297. A Charter of the Forest was signed by Henry III to set down rights for people to access the sustainable benefits of the woods, trees and grazing lands of the Royal Forests in England. It provides a window to a period of history when trees and woods were integral to everyday life for firewood, building material and food. In October 2010, the government introduced the Public Bodies Bill to The House of Lords, which would have enabled the Secretary of State to sell or lease public forests in England. The Woodland Trust believed that the public outcry that stopped those plans in its tracks revealed the connection people feel to the woods and trees of the UK, a connection that is rarely visible. The Independent Panel on Forestry wrote in its 2011 Report > A Charter should be created for the English Public Forest Estate, to be > renewed every ten years. The Charter should specify the public benefit > mission and statutory duties. The new Charter for Trees, Woods and People was launched on 6 November 2017 on the 800th anniversary of the Charter of the Forest. The Tree Charter address different issues to the historic charter because society and priorities have changed so much. However, there has been no comparable statement of rights and responsibilities in the intervening 800 years. The Tree Charter aims to bring this discussion of the importance of woods and trees to people back to the forefront of public consciousness.  Aims  The call to create a Charter for Trees, Woods and People was first launched in January 2016 The purpose of the Tree Charter: The charter aims to join the dots between all the different areas of society in which trees give benefits so that it can recognize and protect the true value of trees to society. Organizations involved are from a variety of industries. This includes commercial forestry, health, wildlife conservation and many more. Creating the Tree Charter: To create this Tree Charter, thousands of tree ‚Äòstories‚Äô were collected from people across the UK about what trees and woods mean to them. A tree story is any expression of what trees and woods mean to people. They can be a sentence or longer phrase, a photo, audio clip or video. The tree stories were collected until the end of February 2017. These tree stories collected from the UK public, along with specific consultations with forestry and sector professionals, will form the basis for the partner organizations to write the content of the final Tree Charter. The new Tree Charter document will not be legally binding, but more a set of guiding principles, to which politicians, organizations, community groups and individuals can be held to account. The 10 Tree Charter Principles were announced on 27 March 2017. From this moment onwards, the public is being asked to sign to show support for the Tree Charter.  Purpose  The Tree Charter will be a document which can be used to hold politicians, community groups and organizations to account, backed up by the body of evidence of over 60,000 public stories. It will be the basis each year of a joint statement from the partner organizations, which will demonstrate whether or not the aims of the Charter have been achieved.

Biography From 1967, Pietro Corsi studied at the Faculty of Philosophy, The University of Pisa, and was also a pupil of the Class of Letters, The Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa. Under the supervision of Francesco Barone and Gilberto Bernardini, he worked on selected issues in the history of science. In particular, he completed yearly theses on the works of Galileo Galilei, Ren√© Descartes, and the historiographic conceptions elaborated by Alexandre Koyr√©. His final thesis reconstructed the relationship between epistemology and the history of science in France, from Henri Poincar√© to Alexandre Koyr√©. From 1971 to 1981, Corsi occupied research positions at the Faculty of Philosophy, The University of Pisa; the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine, The University of Oxford; the King's College, The University of Cambridge (1981‚Äì1982). In 1981 Corsi obtained a D. Phil in the History of Science from the University of Oxford. From 1983 to 1987 he was Assistant Professor at the Department of the History of Science, Harvard University. In 1987, Corsi was appointed Associate Professor of the History of Science at the University of Cassino, Italy, and full Professor in 1997. On special leave from 1997 to 2015, he has been in succession Director of the Italian Cultural Institute in Paris (1997‚Äì2001); Professor of the History of Science at the Universit√© Paris 1, Panth√©on-Sorbonne (1999‚Äì2006); Directeur d'√©tudes cumulant at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris (2000‚Äì2018); Director of the Centre d'histoire des sciences et des techniques, La Cit√© des sciences et de l'industrie, Paris (2001‚Äì2005). From 2006 to 2015 he has been Chair Professor of the History of Science, The University of Oxford. In 1991, Corsi was awarded the Palmes Acad√©miques by the French government, and in 2016 he was the Marc‚ÄìAugust Pictet medallist of the Soci√©t√© de Physique et d'histoire naturelle of Geneva. Corsi has collaborated with various history of science journals, such as Annals of Science, The British Journal for the History of Science and the Journal of the History of Biology. From 1982 to 2016, he was at various times member of the editorial board of Nuncius, Isis- Journal of the History of Science Society, Histoire du CNRS, Notes and records of the Royal Society of London, Centaurus, HOPOS: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science. Together with Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, he established KOS, the first journal entirely devoted to the complex roles of images in the history of science (1983‚Äì1987). From 1983 to 1986 he was Editor-in-chief the US edition of the Italian art magazine FMR. In 1992, with the help of Benedetta Craveri, Roberto Calasso, Furio Colombo, and Umberto Eco, Corsi launched the Italian language edition of The New York Review of Books, La Rivista dei Libri, of which he was Editor-in- Chief (1992‚Äì2010). Corsi has been involved in several major exhibitions as scientific secretary or member of the scientific committee. In 1989 he authored La fabbrica del pensiero: dall‚Äôarte della memoria alle neuroscienze, organized by the Museo Galileo ‚Äì Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, Florence. The main body of the exhibition was also shown in Paris, Cit√© des sciences et de l'Industrie, and Madrid, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, whereas an itinerant version visited scores of towns in Italy, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, and the United States. The exhibition catalogue was printed in Italian and French by Electa, Milan and the English language edition was published by Oxford University Press US under the title The Enchanted Loom. Chapters in the History of Science. The exhibition explored the relationship between the sciences of the brain and of the mind and wider cultural dimensions (the visual arts, philosophy, the social sciences, computer science) from the Renaissance to the theory of neural Darwinism put forward by Gerald Edelman. A follow up exhibition, Drugs and the Brain, circulated widely throughout schools and abuse-prevention agencies in Italy and Europe. Corsi has also served on the scientific committees of Tous les savoirs du monde, displayed on the occasion of the opening of the Biblioth√®que Fran√ßois Mitterrand in Paris (1996), and l'√Çme au corps, authored by Jean Clair and Jean-Pierre Changeux (Paris, Grand Palais, 1994). From 1994 to 2004, Corsi has been the \\"Editor for science, 1600‚Äì2000\\" of the New Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, under the General Editorship of Colin Matthew (67 vol.) and since 2014 is the Editor for Science of the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani. Corsi has also experimented with Internet Technologies in the history of science: the website devoted to Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, his works and heritage, opened in 1998, followed in 2002 by the website Lavoisier, Buffon (2004), and a website devoted to the history of geological cartography in Italy and France (2004). Research Corsi's early research focused on the career and controversial doctrines of Jean Baptiste Lamarck, with particular reference to his biology and taxonomy. The reconstruction of the wider theoretical and chronological context of Lamarck's work spanned from the dissolution of the theoretical and institutional empire of Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon to the debates on the evolutionary theories put forward by Charles Darwin. The research was presented in Oltre il mito: Lamarck e le scienze naturali del suo tempo (Bologna, Il Mulino, 1983); a new English language edition, under the title The Age of Lamarck: Evolutionary Theories in France (1790‚Äì1830) was published in 1988 by the University of California Press. In 2001 √âditions du CNRS published a much-revised edition, Lamarck. Gen√®se et enjeux du transformisme 1770‚Äì1830 (2001), with appendices devoted to the prosopography of the 978 pupils who attended Lamarck's lectures at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle from 1795 to 1823, and to the transcription of notes taken at his classes. In several publications, Corsi also explored the relationship between the intellectual and the social practices of natural sciences during the French Revolution, the Empire and the Restoration, and paid particular attention to the large population of naturalists writing for periodicals, encyclopaedias and dictionaries. The study of Lamarck was paralleled by the exploration of the reception of his doctrines in the United Kingdom during the first half of the nineteenth century. Debates on Lamarck reflected the complex social and cultural changes that paved the way to the acceptance of various brands of evolutionary doctrines during the second half of the century. The doctoral dissertation Corsi discussed at Oxford in 1981 examined the role of the philosophy of science, natural theology, and the question of species in the works of the Reverend Baden Powell (1796‚Äì1860), Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford and the first Anglican theologian to fully embrace Darwin's theories. This unduly neglected protagonist of scientific and theological debates of his days offered a healthy corrective to the Darwin-centred accounts of debates on evolution in early nineteenth-century England (Science and religion: Baden Powell and the Anglican debate, 1800‚Äì1860, Cambridge University Press, 1988). Corsi also explored in detail the complex relationship between Darwin and broadly transformist French doctrines; he emphasised the role of Charles Lyell in shaping Darwin's attitudes, and in informing British naturalists and the cultivated public on the state of scientific affairs across the Channel. A period of research at King' College Cambridge (1981‚Äì1982) allowed Corsi to examine selected features of the relationship between the physical and the social sciences during the decades 1810‚Äì1840, with particular reference to debates on the epistemological foundations of the new science of political economy (\\"The Heritage of Dugald Stewart: Oxford Philosophy and the Method of Political Economy, 1809‚Äì1832\\", 1987). Corsi's research on Italian science during the nineteenth century was firstly published in an article of 1983, followed by a wide-ranging project on Italian geology from the early 1800s to the early 2000s. Prompted by Lyell's comments on Italian geology, Corsi has tackled the problem of why Italy is the only country in the Western World that does not possess an exhaustive geological map, in spite of the dangerous structural instability of much of the national territory. Elements of an answer were provided in entries for the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani devoted to figures such as Igino Cocchi, Carlo de Stefani or Felice Giordano; a first synthesis was offered in 2007 in the article \\"Much Ado about Nothing. The Italian Geological Survey, 1861‚Äì2001\\" that appeared in Earth Sciences History. In 1991, thanks to the suggestion of colleagues and librarians at the Department of Earth Sciences, The University of Pisa, Corsi recovered a major collection of letters addressed to Giuseppe Meneghini, Professor of Geology from 1849 to 1889. Together with the Paolo Savi fund, the geological archives at Pisa are amongst the most impressive in Italy. In 2008, Corsi published a small albeit significant selection of the Meneghini correspondence, covering the years 1853‚Äì1857, and monitoring the personal contacts the Pisa geologists entertained with colleagues in France, England and the German States (Fossils and reputations, 2008). The letters (relevant excerpts in English are reproduce in the long introduction) are a precious guide to the complex negotiations of authority and reputations within the European earth sciences of the middle of the 19th century. Latterly, Corsi has explored the transition from the Eighteenth to the Nineteenth century within debates on life and its history; particular reference is placed on the acrimonious and politically charged denunciations of materialism and atheism that forced many naturalists and commentators to adopt defensive strategies and to distance themselves from unsavoury doctrines. This did not prevent the persistence of 18th-century themes well into the mid-decades of the 19th century.\\"Syst√®mes de la nature' and theories of life.

It was kept in operation until 1992, when, after some heavy rains, the tunnel was flooded. Palas Tunnel remained abandoned and unmaintained for the next 19 years.

Description  The advertisement features a woman wearing red lipstick and looking at the reader while holding a Del Monte ketchup bottle with the appearance of being about to open it. The tagline directly below it is, \\"You mean a woman can open it?\\" with the word woman underlined. The first sentence of the article it accompanied stated, \\"Easily‚Äîwithout a knife blade, a bottle opener, or even a husband!\\"  Critical review  The advertisement has been described as an example of targeted advertising towards women, is viewed as a symbol of social stereotypes during the 1950s, and is frequently cited as emblematic of the Mad Men era. Scholarly interpretation states that it implies that a woman is dependent upon her husband to do things for her. In one such commentary, the New York Daily News stated that the woman in the advertisement is \\"clearly stunned and possibly delighted\\" at being able to open the bottle easily. In addition, the advertisement has been used as a symbol of retro advertising, with a book bearing the same title as the tagline being published in 2000 by Adams Media detailing retro advertisements.

He was a leader of the NgƒÅti Manu hap≈´ (subtribe) of the NgƒÅpuhi. Whetoi adopted the name of P≈çmare, which was the name of the first king of Tahiti and founder of the P≈çmare dynasty. After his death he was called Pomarenui (P≈çmare the Great) by the Ngati Manu in order to distinguish him from his nephew Whiria. The NgƒÅti Manu originally lived at Tautoro, south of Kaikohe, however disputes with the NgƒÅti Toki (NgƒÅti Wai) in P≈çmare‚Äôs lifetime forced them to move and settle at KororƒÅreka, Matauwhi, Otuihu, Waikare and Te Karetu on the southern shore of the Bay of Islands. P≈çmare I established a pƒÅ at Matauwhi, near to Kororareka, in what is now called Pomare Bay. Following the death of P≈çmare I in 1826, his nephew Whiria adopted his uncle‚Äôs names, Whetoi and P≈çmare, so that Whiria is referred to as P≈çmare II, so as to distinguish him from his uncle. Relations with the Church Missionary Society (CMS) The Church Missionary Society (CMS) arrived in the Bay of Islands in 1814. P≈çmare supplied food and timber to the missionaries. He traded timber for tools and he also traded timber for muskets to provided security against the northern hap≈´ within the NgƒÅpuhi, which was led by Hongi Hika, Tareha, Ruatara, and Rewa (Manu) a chief of the NgƒÅti Tawake hap≈´ of Kerikeri. At this time there was fighting between the hap≈´ of the NgƒÅpuhi as well as intertribal fighting (known as the Musket Wars). The Rev. Henry Williams was appointed the leader of the CMS mission in 1823. He stopped the CMS trading muskets with the NgƒÅpuhi. However other Europeans continued to trade muskets with the NgƒÅpuhi and other MƒÅori tribes. The missionaries regarded P≈çmare as one of the important leaders in the Bay of Islands, together with Hongi Hika, Te Whareumu and Rakau. In July 1815 P≈çmare went to visit Port Jackson (Sydney) in the missionary vessel Active. P≈çmare I as a war leader P≈çmare I led a number of war parties against other MƒÅori tribes: *In 1820 he engaged in a six-month siege of Te Whetu-matarau pƒÅ at Te Kawakawa (Te Araroa) in the East Cape region of the North Island; *In 1821 he joined Hongi Hika in the attack on the NgƒÅti PƒÅoa at the Mau-inaina pƒÅ at Mokoia (Panmure) between the WaitematƒÅ and Manukau Harbours; then the NgƒÅpuhi attached the NgƒÅti Maru of Te Totara pƒÅ, in the Thames area; *In 1822 he led an attack on the Nga-uhi-a-po pƒÅ on Tuhua (Mayor Island), and then pursued the NgƒÅti Awa of the eastern Bay of Plenty, up the Whakatane River valley and into Te Urewera, the land of the NgƒÅi T≈´hoe; *In 1823 he joined Hongi Hika in the attack on against the Te Arawa on Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua. A dispute arose between P≈çmare I and Hongi Hika over the conduct of the attack; *In 1824 he attacked the NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua of the Kaipara. Later that year he joined Te Maitaranui of Te Urewera and attacked Wairoa and took the Titirangi pƒÅ near Lake Waikaremoana; *In 1826 P≈çmare I was killed during a raid in the Waikato. Legacy The death of Tiki, the son of P≈çmare I, and the subsequent death of Te Whareumu in 1828 threw the Hokianga into a state of uncertainty as the NgƒÅpuhi chiefs debated whether revenge was necessary following the death of a chief. The Rev. Henry Williams, Richard Davis and the chief Tohitapu mediated between the combatants. As the chiefs did not want to escalate the fighting, a peaceful resolution was achieved. P≈çmare I was succeeded as leader of the NgƒÅti Manu hap≈´ by his nephew, Whiria, who took his uncle‚Äôs names, Whetoi and P≈çmare.

He was a MƒÅori rangatira (chief) of the NgƒÅpuhi iwi (tribe) in New Zealand and the leader of the NgƒÅti Manu hapu (subtribe) of the NgƒÅpuhi. He was the nephew of P≈çmare I. His mother, Haki, was the elder sister of P≈çmare I. When he succeeded his uncle as leader of the NgƒÅti Manu he took his uncle's names, Whetoi and P≈çmare. He is referred to as P≈çmare II, so as to distinguish him from his uncle. Girls‚Äô War (1830) In 1830, P≈çmare II's position as the principal chief of the NgƒÅti Manu was consolidated during the Girls‚Äô War, which is the name given to fighting on the beach at Russell, New Zealand, then known as KororƒÅreka, in March 1830 between northern and southern hap≈´ of the NgƒÅpuhi. P≈çmare II supported Kiwikiwi, the chief of the NgƒÅti Manu hap≈´ of KororƒÅreka, when northern hap≈´ led by Ururoa (also known as Rewharewha), a chief of Whangaroa and brother-in-law of the late Hongi Hika, raided the k≈´mara gardens at KororƒÅreka on 5 March 1830. Ururoa was supported by other chiefs from the various northern hap≈´, including Hone Heke and Rewa of the NgƒÅti Tawake hap≈´ of Kerikeri. Henry Williams, William Williams and other members of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) came over the bay from Paihia to attempt to mediate an end to the fighting. The mediation efforts appeared promising, with the missionaries believing that the chiefs would accept that the plunder of the k≈´mara gardens at KororƒÅreka would suffice as satisfaction of the earlier insults to Pehi, the daughter of Hongi Hika, and Moewaka, the daughter of Rewa (the reason the battle is called the Girls‚Äô War). However, further fighting occurred, which resulted in the death of Hengi, a chief of Whangaroa. Eventually Henry Williams persuaded the warriors to stop the fighting. Reverend Samuel Marsden had arrived on a visit and over the following weeks he and Henry Williams attempted to negotiate a settlement in which KororƒÅreka would be ceded by P≈çmare II to Tƒ´tore as compensation for the death of Hengi, which was accepted by those engaged in the fighting. Events from the Girls' War to the Treaty of Waitangi P≈çmare II strengthened his pƒÅ at Otuihu to make it impregnable against any attack by the northern hapu of the NgƒÅpuhi who now controlled KororƒÅreka and he also worked to promote trade with the Europeans, who were described by Samual Marsden as \\"generally men of the most infamous character: runaway convicts, and sailors, and publicans, who have opened grogshops in the pas, where riot, drunkenness, and prostitution are carried out daily\\". He quarreled with European settlors and seized their possessions as compensation. He seized Captain James Clendon's whaleboat in 1832. However, he was usually on friendly terms with Clendon.Te Ara, An Encyclopedia of New Zealand 1966: James Reddy Clendon He also seized Thomas King's boat in 1833. The latter event led to the mediation of the dispute by Henry Williams and the intervention of James Busby, the British Resident, which resulted in HMS Alligator anchoring off P≈çmare's pƒÅ at Otuihu. He also fought a three-month war with Tƒ´tore in 1837, until a peace agreement was negotiated by Tareha. H≈çne Heke fought with Tƒ´tore against P≈çmare II. An underlying cause of the fighting was a dispute as to the boundary line of the KororƒÅreka block that had been surrendered as a consequence of the death of Hengi some seven years previously in the Girls‚Äô War. P≈çmare II signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 17 February 1840. Flagstaff War - attack on the pƒÅ of P≈çmare II HMS North Star destroying the PƒÅ of P≈çmare II, 1845. Painting by John Williams. Customs duties were put in place in 1841, which H≈çne Heke and P≈çmare II viewed as damaging the maritime trade from which they benefited - each levied visiting ships a fee to anchor in the Bay of Islands and the imposition of the customs duties resulted in whaling and sealing ships choosing to avoid the Bay of Islands. While P≈çmare II had grievances as to the actions of the colonial government following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, he did not support H≈çne Heke's actions in what is known as the Flagstaff War. After the Battle of KororƒÅreka on 11 March 1845, when H≈çne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti and their warriors sacked KororƒÅreka and Heke cut down the flagstaff, the colonial government attempted to re-establish its authority. On 28 March 1845, troops, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel William Hulme, arrived in the Bay of Islands. The following day the colonial forces attacked the pƒÅ of P≈çmare II, notwithstanding his position of neutrality. The reason for the attack was what were claimed to be treasonous letters from P≈çmare to P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero that had been intercepted. As the pƒÅ at Otuihu was on the coast, cannon fire from HMS North Star was directed at the pƒÅ. The colonial forces were able to occupy P≈çmare's pƒÅ without a fight. When they arrived at P≈çmare's PƒÅ, the chief himself came down to see what all the fuss was about and was promptly made prisoner. He then ordered his warrior not to resist the British and the warriors escaped into the surrounding bush. This left the British a free hand to loot and burn the pƒÅ. This action caused considerable puzzlement since up until that time P≈çmare had been considered neutral, by himself and almost everyone else. When they burnt the pƒÅ the British also burnt two pubs or grog shops which P≈çmare had established within his pƒÅ to encourage the PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers, sailors, whalers etc. to visit and trade with him. P≈çmare was taken to Auckland on the North Star. He was released after the intervention of TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene and he was paid compensation. He remained neutral in the conflict between H≈çne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti against the colonial forces and their NgƒÅpuhi allies, who were led by TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene.

His feast is on 16 June.  Life His is the first name on the earliest surviving list of bishops of Mainz, which dates to the 10th century. The only sources for his life are church sources and legends of his life. The earliest one derives from a work written by Rabanus Maurus, the first Archbishop of Mainz after it was promoted to an archdiocese in the early 780s - this was written on Rabanus' consecration of Fulda Abbey, in whose south aisle there was later an altar dedicated to Aureus. In 843 Rabanus also wrote a martyrology testifying to the murder of Aureus and his sister St Justinahttp://www.evangeliumtagfuertag.org/main.php?language=NL&module;=saintfeast&localdate;=20150616&id;=853&fd;=0 on 16 June in a church during a Hun raid. Later sources fix the raid in 454, but this is unlikely and may be an error for one of the datable raids in 451. If the raid occurred in the migratory period, the raids in 451, 436, 406-407 or even 368 is possible - Alban of Mainz is said to have been beheaded for preaching against Arianism during a raid in 406-407 for example. Diesel's tradition speaks of bishop Aureus as being expelled before the time of Alban.Nopper; S. 85ff This would mean Aureus was bishop of Mainz before 406. Tradition holds that the people of Mainz expelled him for opposing Arianism and that Theonistus and Alban carried on his work in his absence. Aureus then returned to the now-destroyed city after 406 and resumed his work as bishop. However, if his martyrdom is dated to 451, this would mean he was in office for fifty years and complicates the dating of the next bishop, Maximus. Aureus and his sister Justina were thus probably martyred in 436.Nopper; S. 90 His remains were either buried in the city's Basilica of St Alban immediately after his death or transferred there in 805.Nopper; S. 95  Cult Lithograph of the ruins of the Aureuskapelle by Jean Dionis Bernard Wasserburg (1813‚Äì1885), brother of Philipp Wasserburg He is traditionally venerated as a saint in the Diocese of Mainz. The Aureuskapelle chapel was built in the Zahlbach district of the city on the traditional site of his martyrdom and his initial burial - it is probably the earliest site of Christian worship in Mainz. Its predecessor was the St. Hilariuskirche, often the burial place for early bishops of the city. It was completely destroyed in the Siege of Mainz in 1793 and replaced by a new building to designs by Vincenz Statz, which was itself destroyed in an air-raid in 1944.

This was based on a different version of his legend, in which he and his deacon Justinus were fleeing Atilla the Hun, who caught up with them at Eichsfeld, where he tortured and beheaded them. They were then buried there and miracles began occurring on the spot.

Each part lies against central parts of the Portuguese capital Lisbon. Due to its strategic site between Europe, Africa, and the Atlantic, it is one of the most accessed and used in Europe. For container ships it begins with a 1080-metre mooring, with cranes, south of a thin, rectangular, pleasure boat marina. It is north- east of the centre of the strait-spanning suspension bridge, the Ponte 25 de Abril. Continuations are to the north-east. These are a bank-side cruise ship terminal next to the old Alfama district, followed by multi-use harbour-side terminals at Xabregas, Grilo, Beato ()) and Bra√ßo do Prata, Marvila (Lisbon). Denser military docks are beyond a headland to the south-east - Lisbon Naval Base, long colloquially synonymous with Alfeite, a slightly wider, once royally-owned, district. History There are data on human presence in the Tagus estuary since prehistory. Probably the Phoenicians were in this area in the 12th Century BC and they would create a commercial port in the north margin of the River Tagus. In 205 BC, the city (known as Olissippo) was conquered by the Romans. In the 5th Century the Suebi conquered the area, followed by the Visigoths. In AD 714, the Moors conquered Lisbon, expanding the port with their Mediterranean and Atlantic trades.

Historical field map from 1886, Kolindsund The pumping station in Fannerup was built in the 1930‚Äôties together with an identical pumping station in Enslev. The pumping elevation is 5 meters. Via a middle canal the two pumping stations pump the water from the sound up into The North Canal. The water enters the Kattegat Sea by the town Gren√• on the east coast of the peninsula, Djursland. One of two 240 HP electrical motors that drive the pumps that keep Kolindsund from flooding The North Canal down from Skiffard. Together with The South Canal the two canals cut of the streams that would otherwise fill Kolindsund with water. A third canal, The Middle Canal, connects to two pumping stations that pump water from the former lake into the North Canal. The pumping stations are located at the villages Fannerup and Enslev. Kolindsund (The Sound of Kolind) is a 26.4 square kilometer[Kolindsund.odeum.com] elongated drained lake on the peninsula Djursland in Denmark, extending 25 kilometers west, inland from the seaport Gren√• by the Kattegat sea.[Krak.dk] The bottom of the drained lake is on average 2.5 meters below sea level.[Kolindsund.odeum.com] Today the area is rich farmland kept dry by means of two pumping stations. At each station a 240 HP pump is turned on as needed regulated by the water level in the canals that feed water to the pumps.[Posters at Fannerup Pumping Station] The width of Kolindsund varies between 0.8 kilometers and 2.5 kilometers.[Krak.dk] Pumping the lake dry started in May 1874. To this end a consortium built an infrastructure of drainage canals and two steam and wind powered pumping stations. Today the electric main pumping stations are located in the villages Fannerup and Enslev. Here water from the sound is pumped 5 meters up into a North Canal. From the North Canal the water runs into the Kattegat Sea by the seaport Gren√•. Together with a South Canal the North Canal encircles the sound starting by the town Kolind 26 kilometers inland and ending the encircling a few kilometers before Gren√•. At Kolind the level of the canals is a bit more than one meter above sea level. The North and South Canal cut of streams that would otherwise run into the former lake. The fertile claylike soil in the sound consists mainly of two types of aquatic deposits, marine and fresh water silt. Throughout all of the sound there is a mesh of drainage pipes that drain water into the middle canals ending at the two pumping stations. In the Stone Ages after the last ice age 12.000 years ago Kolindsund was a salt water sound that cut of the northern part of the peninsula Djursland into an island. Sea level changes and or land rise combined with wind based sand drift blocked the entrance to the sea by Gren√• and turned the navigable sound into a lake in the Middle Ages. Today there is concern that possible future rising sea levels due to climate change might make it more difficult to keep the former lake dry as farmland. History When the pumps started pumping in 1874, the water level reportedly sank 1.30 centimeters per day. The pumping stations were powered by steam engines and windmills until the 1930s. A shareholder based company stood behind the lake drainage project as well as farming the former lake bottom in the first decades. From the start it had only been planned to pump dry the western part of the lake, but as it turned out the shareholder based company did not succeed in building a dam across the lake to isolate the western part from the eastern part. When attempting to build an 800-meter dam cutting the lake in two by the village Fannerup, the dam-material loaded onto the lake bottom simply disappeared in the mud, the story goes. For this reason the project was changed to pumping out the whole lake. In 1921 Kolindsund, including the farms with large characteristic storage barns that had been built by the shareholder company, was sold to private owners. In the first decades after drainage, Kolindsund was not particularly good business for the shareholders. In the late twenties the infrastructure of pumps and canals was in need of repair and renewal. Combined with an economic crisis for farming in general these factors jeopardized the continued pumping of water from the sound. The Danish Parliament, Folketinget, intervened in order to secure Kolindsund as farmland, and on 2 May 1932 a set of laws and loans was implemented aiming at continuing the pumping to keep Kolindsund as farmland. As part of the same deal the unionized workers rights in the labor-intensive farming of Kolindsund were officially recognized. The Pumpelaug, a landowners association, that still exists, was delegated the task of managing the pump- and canal-infrastructure by the Folketing. Between 1935 and 1938 the steam and wind driven pumping stations were replaced by two electrically driven pumping stations, that are still used today. With the renovation in 1935‚Äì1938 the water level was lowered further in Kolindsund, just as dams between the cut- off canals and the former lake were strengthened. Pumping During project planning prior to drainage of the lake in the 1870s, the amount of water that had to be pumped out to keep the lake dry, was erroneously calculated to be less than half the actual pumping needed.[Finn Hansen (1969): Kolindsund, En Landbrugsgeografisk Analyse] The figure was based on the calculated influx from rainfall over the given area. In reality groundwater from the surrounding hills has a tendency to run under the cut-off canals and into the former lake, often surfacing as wellsprings that formed bogs, causing problems for farming. This extra amount of water meant that the pumping capacity was insufficient in the first decades after drainage of the lake. Here large parts of the sound were marshy fields only suitable for grazing in summer, but too wet for plowing and growing of more intensive grain-based crops. With electrification and thus more efficient electric pumps and the lowered water table implemented in the late thirties, these problems were solved, making Kolindsund into high yield and stable farmland, which is still the case today. Farming Farming in Kolindsund does not require expensive and energy consuming irrigation even in the driest of summers. Irrigation is otherwise widespread when farming in Denmark. On the other hand, extra energy must be used to keep the two 240 HP electric pumps running a lot of the time. The high yields of Kolindsund are in part based on the nutrient rich silt based soil, deposited through millennia at the bottom of the former lake and sound in layers that are up to 20 meters thick. The soil is free of stones and rocks. Some places the fields are colored with white streaks of prehistoric banks of oyster and mussel shell that have been ploughed up giving witness to the marine past of Kolindsund. A similar type of drained sound- and lake farmland in Denmark with mussel rich soil can be seen in the Lammefjord located on the northern part of Denmark‚Äôs largest island, Zealand. Lammefjorden was also pumped dry in the 1870‚Äôties. Here vegetables, not least carrots, are established crops.http://www.lammefjorden.dk/lammefjorden/historien-om-lammefjorden/ [] This is not the case in Kolindsund, even though the potential might be there, due to the same types of soil. The crops in Kolindsund are purely grain based, including grass seed. It is also characteristic that many of the farms in Kolindsund are livestock free, and solely based on farming of grain crops, not least wheat.

History  The church was built in the 14th century in the centre of Hanover, succeeding a chapel, and a Romanesque church built in 1163. The western wall of that church is partly extant. The church was dedicated to Saint Giles, one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. The present Gothic building was built in 1347 of sandstone from the Deister.

The tower of the former cathedral  History  The Diocese of Leeuwarden was established in principle on 12 May 1559, canonically split from the then Diocese of Utrecht, which was simultaneously promoted to an Archdiocese and became Leeuwarden's Metropolitan. Its territory was defined by the papal bull Regimini universalis of 7 August 1561 as the territory of Friesland with the islands Terschelling and Ameland. The episcopal see was to be the church of St Vitus, formerly a parish church. Diocesan finances were derived from the income of the regular canons of Burgum and the Premonstratensian Pingjum Abbey near Bolsward, with the cathedral chapter financed from Mariengaard Abbey in Hallum.L. J. Rogier, Geschiedenis van het katholicisme in Noord-Nederland, vol. 1 (Amsterdam, 1947), p. 226. The first bishop to be appointed, in 1561, was Remi Drieux (Remigius Driutius), who never took possession of his see. Despite this, in October 1565, Dreux did take part in the provincial council of Utrecht as bishop of Leeuwarden.L. J. Rogier, Geschiedenis van het katholicisme in Noord-Nederland, vol. 1 (Amsterdam, 1947), p. 273. In 1569 Drieux was appointed to the diocese of Bruges, and was succeeded in Leeuwarden by Cunerus Petri. In 1578, during the Dutch Revolt, part of the Eighty Years War (when Catholic Habsburg lost the northern provinces), bishop Petri was captured by the rebel stadtholder (governor) of Friesland, George de Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg, and imprisoned in Harlingen. The bishop was to die in exile in Germany in 1580. In 1579 Rennenberg sequestered the revenues of the diocese, and transferred them to the States of Friesland. The diocese was legally suppressed, along with Catholic worship, in 1580.W. Eekhoff, Geschiedkundige beschrijving van Leeuwarden, vol. 1 (Leeuwarden, 1846), pp. 226-227. From 1592 the diocesan territory was ecclesiastically part of the Dutch Mission.

The Gothic hall church is one of three churches in its Old Town; the other two are the Marktkirche and the now-ruined Aegidienkirche. It was dedicated in 1330 to the Holy Cross. The church became Lutheran in the Reformation. It was expanded then, and renovated in the 19th century. Destroyed by bombs in World War II, it was rebuilt in simpler form. It received an altar by Lucas Cranach which had been in the Schlosskirche that was not rebuilt. The official name became then Schloss- und Stadtkirche St. Crucis Hannover (Palace- and town church of the Holy Cross). From 1982, the Kreuzkirche parish became part of the Marktkirche parish.  History  The parish of the Kreuzkirche was in 1284 separated from the Marktkirche parish. A church was consecrated in 1333, built in sandstone masonry, dedicated to St. Spiritus et Crucis (Holy Spirit and Cross). The present church is a Gothic hall church with one nave of four bays and a rib vault. Interior with Cranach- altar When the citizens of Hanover accepted the Reformation in 1533, the church became Lutheran, and the first Lutheran sermon was held then in the Kreuzkirche. In 1560, it was expanded to adjust to the different needs of a Protestant congregation. In 1594, a pulpit was installed by Claus von M√ºnchhausen, but moved to the church in Lauenau. The court sculptor created a carved hanging pulpit in 1756. The spire of the steeple was damaged by a storm in 1630, and was replaced in Baroque style in 1652. In a \\"renovation\\" in 1822/23, many older artifacts were sold or destroyed, leaving the baptismal font as the only medieval furniture. In World War II, an air raid in July 1943 destroyed the town centre, including the Kreuzkirche. It was rebuilt from 1959 to 1961 in a simplified form, by architect Erich Witt. The Schlosskirche (palace church) was not rebuilt, therefore the Schlosskirche parish used the Kreuzkiche from 1960, leading to the name Schlo√ü und Stadtkirche St. Crucis. In 1982, the parish was merged with the Aegidienkirche to the Marktkirche, which is responsible for matters such as building, concerts and expositions. The Sunday services in the Kreuzkirche are often held by the Evangelischen Studierendengemeinde (Parish of Protestant students). The church is a venue for education, guided tours, concerts and other events.  Interior  The organ The baptismal font was made 1410 from bronze, possibly in Hildesheim. The main treasure of the Kreuzkirche is an altar which Lucas Cranach created and signed, probably before 1537. He made it for the Stiftskirche St. Alexandri in Einbeck, showing a central crucifixion scene, with St. Alexander und St. Felicitas on the side panels, the patron saints of Einbeck. The altar was owned next by the dukes of Braunschweig who placed it in the new Schlosskirche in the Leineschloss from 1666 to 1680. During French occupation, the outer panels were separated, but returned to the Hausmann collection in 1816. They belonged to King George V of Hanover from 1857, and to the Nieders√§chsische Landesgalerie from 1925. The central panel and the side panels returned to the Schlosskirche sooner. After World War II, the altar belonged to the Church of Hanover. Three chandeliers were formerly in the Aegidienkirche that was left as a ruin and memorial of the war. Cast in the 17th and 18th century, they had been evacuated before the bombing. The organ was built by in 1965. It has 34 stops on three manuals and pedal.

The VLW also built a factory in Laatzen outside the city limits in 1936 which was not directly attacked. Two large refineries Deurag and Nerag in Misburg on the northeastern outskirts of the city produced gasoline and motor oils for the Luftwaffe, meaning they were targeted early and continued to be attacked, especially late on in the war. Raids Lancaster on a bombing run Raids on Hannover involved a relatively short flying-time from bases in the United Kingdom and the nearby Steinhuder Meer provided a useful navigational aid. The 78 hectare Maschsee on the southern edge of the city centre was partly covered with wooden boards and artificial islands to make it less recognizable from the air, but the geometrical patterns in the 50 hectare Gro√üer Garten remained undisguised and were used by the RAF's H2S radar from mid 1943 onwards.  1939 and 1940 ‚Äì initial raids  The first raid was on 4 September 1939, the day after the British declaration of war ‚Äì it involved just one RAF Armstrong Whitworth Whitley dropping leaflets. On 19 May 1940 the RAF bombed the Misburg refineries, killing nineteen people. 1 August the same year saw the first raid on Hannover itself, with a raid on the Seilerstra√üe in the south of the city. On 30 September 1940 six planes destroyed several buildings in W√ºlfel and Linden. 1941 On 10 February 1941, the city was raided by 220 British planes, mainly hitting the eastern district and killing 101 people. Another British raid followed on the night of 15/16 April on the Vahrenwald and Hainholz and on 15/16 June on the VLW-Werk factory and the Misburg refineries.

Based in Cherlapally, Secunderabad (twin city of Hyderabad) in the Indian state of Telangana, the mint was originally established in 1803 AD as the Royal Mint to serve as the mint for the Nizam of Hyderabad. The mint was founded by Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III and was originally situated at Sultan Sahi in Moghalpura suburb of Hyderabad city. In 1950, the mint was taken over by the Government of India, and in 1997 it was shifted to its present location at Cherlapally in Secunderabad. Indian 1, 2, 5 and 10 rupee coins are produced in this mint. History Till early 19th century, mints were privately operated by wealthy businessmen (Sahus, Jagirdars and Omaras) in India. Licenses for minting coins were obtained by paying fees to the exchequer. The mints used to produce coins with the name of Emperor in Delhi. FIDVI, QITAAB (title) and lettering \\"Yar-E-Wafadar\\" (trusted follower) were added to the coins. 1803‚Äì1858 India Government Mint, Hyderabad was established in 1803 AD by Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III as a private mint and along with other private mints in the country. The mint produced Indian coins in the name of Emperor of India. Initially the mint was situated at Sultan Sahi in Moghalpura suburb of the Hyderabad city. The dies were made of steel but the private mints did not have a master die. The dies hence differed in size, production of coins was crude with only partial inscription appearing on coins frequently. 1858‚Äì1903 With the end of the Mughal empire in 1858 AD, all private mints (except Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai) were abolished. Coins produced thereafter ceased to carry the name of Emperor of India. Instead, coins produced in the Hyderabad Royal Mint were inscribed with name of the dynasty, initials of Nizam of Hyderabad and the numeral 92 (of Islamic religious significance; represents sum of symbolic numbers of the letters in Prophets and messengers in Islam). These coins were called Halli Sicca coins (current coins). In 1985 AD, use of machinery was introduced in coin making and the machine made coins were called \\"Charkhi coins\\" (Charkhi means \\"wheel\\" in Hindi). 1903‚Äì1950 On 13 July 1903, a new mint was established in Saifabad, Hyderabad and the operations were shifted to the new location. In 1950, post \\"Federal Financial Integration\\", the mint was over-taken by the Government of India. 1950‚Äì1997 The Hyderabad mint operated in Saifabad from 1950 to 1997. On 20 August 1997, the mint was shifted to its present location at Cherlapally in the city of Secunderabad, India. The facility was established with annual production capacity of 700 million coins and 950 million planchets. 1997 ‚Äì present India Government Mint in Hyderabad has been operating at the same location since 1997. As a result of the corporatisation, from 13 January 2006 the mint is functioning as one of the units of the Security Printing & Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL).

Plot The film takes place in the US during the 1960s and 1970s. Jack Rafferty, deputy head of the trade union of transport workers gives testimony before the senate committee on suspicion of corruption. Rafferty has the right to refuse to testify citing the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but then he will never be elected as chairman of the trade union. Therefore Rafferty decides to take a chance and starts to answer questions of the commission... Climbing the corporate ladder was a very difficult task for Rafferty; full of \\"dark\\" deeds. These included the creation of false trade union committees with the help of his close friend gangster Farichetti, and illegal use of union pension funds for personal enrichment, and using his wife as a shill. Rafferty even exploited his mistress Jill by making her a sexual \\"gift\\" to a senior trade unionist. But the moment of truth comes and in the course of the investigation by the commission all these ugly facts come to light showing the public all the depravity of Rafferty's activities. As a result he becomes totally bankrupt: his wife leaves him with the children (additionally his daughter dies in a car accident), a childhood friend commits suicide and publicly disgraced Jill Hart also escapes, taking with her all of Rafferty's secret savings. But attorney Ames saves the final blow for later. Ames provides a recording of telephone conversations from which it is clear that Rafferty called the police and ratted out his closest friend ‚Äì Tommy Farichetti. Watching this on TV live Farichetti understands that he is doomed. He faces a third conviction which means that the sentencing will be brief ‚Äì life imprisonment waits for him. And then Farichetti drives up to the building where the commission is in session and pulls out a machine-gun to finally settle accounts with Rafferty who betrayed him...

This species can reach in total length. Description The Okefenokee pygmy sunfish is an olive green color fish with brownish-red mottling across the body, mixed with bright blue colors. Elassoma okefenokee differs from its close relative Elassoma gilberti by only having three preopercular canals (gilberti has, on average, four). The average number of anal fin rays is seven in E. gilberti whereas E. okefenokee has 8. The female E. gilberti often expresses a blue patch of color behind her eye and on her body, while the E. okefenokee does not Diet Some good foods to try in the aquarium are California blackworms, daphnia, Grindal worms, microworms, and having a healthy population of snails. Some pygmy sunfish will learn to supplement their diet with crushed flake food, but this should not be relied upon as the only food source. The crushed fish flakes are a good idea, though, because they will feed the microfauna that will in turn feed the Elassoma. Habitat Elassoma okefenokee is a freshwater, demersal fish which spends its time in dense vegetation growth in waters with a pH range of 6.0-8.0 and a dH range of 5-unknown. Their preferred temperature range is 4 ¬∞C - 30 ¬∞C. Reproduction and life cycle The male turns black with blue sparkles while the females remains clear, tan, and light brown. Importance to humans E. okefenokee are moderate-expert aquarium fish. They can breed in as little as 5 gallons of water and prefer a well planted aquarium.

He spent his youth in foreign military service, and then held different fiefs from the King. Called up to duty during the war, he at first distinguished himself at land, later becoming a ship's captain, and finally admiral commanding the Danish fleet. Early career Otte Rud was the son of the privy counsellor Knud J√∏rgensen Rud of Vedby and M√∏gelkj√¶r. He began his education at Sor√∏ Abbey, came to the House of Mansfeld as a page, and then served the House of Schwarzburg, becoming an esquire at 18, and fighting in the Bishop of Munster's war against the anabaptists. Rud then fought in the service of Saxony in its war against Brunswick. Back in Denmark, he became a courtier 1543, married 1549, and received his first fief the same year.Bricka, C.F. (1887-1905).

Flag Officer At the outbreak of the Northern Seven Years' War in 1563, Rud was sent to Elfsborg Castle as commissary of war under Daniel Rantzau. He distinguished himself at the battle of Mared the same year, and the King made him captain of the warship Byens L√∏ve (56 guns).Anderson, R.C. (1910). Naval wars in the Baltic during the sailing-ship epoch, 1522-1850. London: C. Gilbert-Wood, pp. 7, 10-11. Byens L√∏ve belonged to Herluf Trolle's fleet when it met the Swedes at the first battle of √ñland in the spring of 1564. During the second day of the battle Byens L√∏ve and the L√ºbeck ship Engel boarded the Swedish flagship Mars, and manage to take captive the Swedish admiral Jakob Bagge, his second-in- command, and about 100 Swedish sailors before the burning Mars exploded. After a shorter interlude fighting with his men and horses in the land campaign in Sk√•ne, Rud was in 1565 back at sea, as captain of the Krabat, a ship taken from the Swedes. He participated in the battle off Bukow 1565, where Herluf Trolle fell. The vice-admiral J√∏rgen Thygesen Brahe died of fever a few days later, and Otte Rud was subsequently appointed admiral and his brother Erik, another prominent captain, vice-admiral. In the battle of Bornholm a month later, Rud took his flagship J√¶germesteren (90 guns), alongside the Swedish flagship St. Erik (90 guns), but a fire in a Swedish ship made the fleets scatter, and left J√¶germesteren surrounded by enemy ships. Having lost most of his crew, the wounded Rud surrendered and was taken prisoner to Stockholm. Later taken to Svartsj√∂ castle, he fell victim to the raging plague. Personal life Rud was married to Pernille Johansdatter Oxe (1531-1676), daughter of the privy counsellor Johan Johansen Oxe, and sister of the privy counsellor Peder Oxe.

It was historically known to occur in springs in North Alabama along the Tennessee River in Limestone and Lauderdale counties. The spring pygmy sunfish was first discovered in Cave Spring in Lauderdale County, Alabama in 1937 but in 1938, this site was flooded by the creation of the Pickwick Reservoir. The spring pygmy sunfish was considered extinct until its rediscovery in the Beaverdam Spring complex in 1973 by researchers from the University of Tennessee.  Appearance  The spring pygmy sunfish a small fish that rarely exceeds an inch long. Males and females exhibit different coloration. Breeding males are vividly colored. Overall the breeding male is very dark except for vertical, iridescent blue-green bars along the body and iridescent mottling on the cheek. Females are more muted in coloration when compared to the males. A female pygmy sunfish  Habitat  The preferred habitat for the spring pygmy sunfish is spring water, and associated spring-fed wetlands. The species is most abundant at the spring head and spring pool area.  Diet  Diet likely consists of small aquatic invertebrates such as amphipods, isopods, and larvae of mayflies, caddisflies, and midges.  Range   Historical range  Historically, this fish was known to occur at two other sites in northern Alabama, one in Limestone County and the other in Lauderdale County. The species decline has been attributed to water pollution, a reduction of water quantity and impoundments. It was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 2013.  Current range  Currently, the only spring-dwelling population occurs in Limestone County in the Beaverdam-Moss Spring/Swamp spring system, where it is threatened by the construction of an automobile plant, though a conservation agreement was reached between the manufacturers and the Center for Biological Diversity. The Beaverdam spring and creek complex was formerly thought to be the only remaining habitat of the species, but in 2015 another population was discovered in the Blackwell Swamp of Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge in Madison County.  Conservation challenges  The spring pygmy sunfish and its habitat are currently facing the threats of both declining water quality and quantity. Possible excessive groundwater usage, and the resultant reduction of water quantity in the aquifer/recharge areas and decreased spring outflow in the Beaverdam Spring/Creek system, is believed to have negatively impacted the spring pygmy sunfish and its habitat. Increased contamination of the recharge area and aquifer from the intensive use of chemicals (i.e., herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers) and possible overgrazing by livestock and land clearing near and within the water systems reduces the vegetation in the spring and increases stormwater runoff within the spring pygmy sunfish's habitat. Stormwater discharge from agricultural lands compounds the water quality degradation by increasing sediment load and depositing contaminants into surface and groundwater sources. Recently, land use practices have begun to change surrounding spring pygmy sunfish habitat. Land that has been historically used for agriculture is being converted into higher density residential and industrial developments. These large-scale residential and industrial developments can place a different set of environmental stressors (i.e. impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff) on aquatic habitats and potentially reduce water quantity and quality within the Beaverdam Spring/Creek system.

After the war she taught architecture in Bristol Architectural School, and undertook some private practice that included restoring her home Tickenham Court, Community halls, and updating the village church screens. She studied the Painted Monasteries of Bukovina in pre-war Romania until her attention was turned to Ethiopia. Book review by Richard Pankhurst, Royal Asiatic Society, London In 1967 she travelled to Addis Ababa accompanying an old friend who was an acquaintance of Emperor Haile Selassie‚Äôs daughter Princess Tenagnework, and also to the northern Tigre Region as a guest of the Governor and his wife, Princess Aida Desta, daughter of Princess Tenagnework. This started her interest in Ethiopian rock churches which were then scarcely known to the world of scholarshipObituary in The Independent and resulted in six trips between 1967 and 1974 covering over a 100 churches and in total nearly a year away from the UK. She travelled frugally caring little for her own comfort or safety, focusing on her intellectual pursuit. After the revolution in 1974 Princess Tenagnework and Princess Aida Desta were among the female members of the Royal Family who were imprisoned and Ruth was among a group who lobbied heavily to the Foreign Office and local pressure groups for their release. She presented papers on research at international conferences and in 1985 published a book Architecture of the Tigre, Ethiopia. For her research she was awarded an M. Lit. from Bristol University.

Perry et al., Condemned to Metallum?: Illuminating Life at the Byzantine Mining Camp at Phaeno in Jordan, in Bioarchaeology and Behavior, University Press of Florida, October 2012, is an archaeological site in Wadi Faynan, southern Jordan. It lies just south of the Dead Sea in Jordan. The site was an ancient copper mine that overlooks two Wadis and is the location of one of the best and most well preserved ancient mining and metallurgy districts in the world.  Site Description and Excavation:   Site Description:  Khirbat Faynan is located near Wadi Faynan, 215 kilometres from Amman. It was built between Wadi Dana and Wadi Ghuwayr. The site itself was one of the biggest copper mines in the Roman Empire.  Excavation:  The German Mining Museum in Bochum, Germany was the first to conduct an intensive research on the site in 1983.They were the first excavation to be sent out to the site, and the first ones to record what the site was used for. Upon their findings during the excavation, they recorded that the mining and smelting dated back to the Chalcolithic period around 4500-3100 BCE. The site had been mined continuously until around the 400 CE, however archaeological data gathered at the site along with corresponding studies show that there was a final phase of mining during the Mamluk Period which took place between 1250 to 1516 CE. History and archaeology  Early Bronze Age  The environment in Faynan had become increasingly arid around 4,000 BCE, as the settlement expanded out into the main wadi. During the Early Bronze Age which was approximately 3,500 BCE, more structured systems of irrigated farming had been developed due to the aridity of the area. These field systems are still visible and conserve many elements of the earliest irrigation systems and techniques used during this time. While mining for metals as well as ore processing began to intensify in Khirbat Faynan during the Iron Age, both practices in farming and irrigation as well as smelting had become more sophisticated under the Nabatean kingdom. Bronze and Iron Ages Located at the confluence of Wadi Dana and Wadi Ghuwayr, the settlement was occupied from the Early Bronze Age, with carbon dating showing activity at the site as early as 10,900 BCE. The mining and smelting activities intensified during the Iron Age. =In the Bible= The site has been identified with biblical Punon, one of the stations of the Exodus (). Nabataean period In the time of the Nabataean kingdom, both the farming and smelting activities reached a new degree of sophistication. The site drastically increased in activity when the Roman Empire had successfully annexed the Nabatean Kingdom in 106 CE. Roman and Byzantine periods In the Roman and Byzantine periods, it was the center of the area's extensive copper mining complex, the largest in the Southern Levant. Claims of early Christian authors including Eusebius and Athanasius of Alexandria of large numbers of Christians and heretics being deported to Phaeno, where they suffered under terrible conditions or even martyrdom, have not been supported by the study of 45 skeletons from the 4th- to 6th-century cemetery excavated at the site.Candida Moss, Did Christian Historians Exaggerate Persecution by the Romans?, The Daily Beast, 24 November 2018, accessed 14 January 2019  Today  Due to Faynan's location, the site is in a dry desert region that barely gets any rainfall. Faynan receives approximately 50mm of every year, which is significantly lower than its neighboring area in the Highlands of Jordan which averages 102-300mm of rainfall each year. This puts Faynan in the category of a hyper-arid zone. Remains of what used to be a water management and water storage systems are still visible and are located along the south bank of the Wadi Ghuweir, which is opposite of Khirbat Faynan. The remains consist of an open channel, an aqueduct across Wadi Sheger, as well as a large and sunken reservoir.

Built as a school about 1854, it has had a history of varied uses and prominent local owners, and has high quality Colonial Revival and Italianate features. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The Shearer and Corser Double House stands in a suburban residential area northwest of downtown St. Johnsbury, on the east side of Summer Street between Webster and Mt. Pleasant Streets. It is a two-story wood-frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. Corner pilasters rise to an entablature and cornice bracketed in the Italianate style. The main facade is six bays wide, with a two-story Colonial Revival porch extending across the center four bays. Its hip roof is supported by Tuscan columns, and it has shingled skirts topped by low metal balustrades. Its two entrances are in the two center bays, each doorway flanked by sidelight windows; they share a molded lintel. Windows are topped by slightly projecting moulded cornices. The interior is divided into roughly symmetrical side-by-side units, each retaining some original 19th- century woodwork. with This building began life as a schoolhouse, built in the mid-1850s, and located at the corner of Summer and Winter Streets. In 1864 it was moved to its present location and was converted into an armory. In 1870 the town sold the building to Franklin Fairbanks co-owner of the Fairbanks Scale Works, the town's largest employer. The Fairbanks family originally laid out Summer Street and oversaw its residential development. It is unclear whether they were responsible for the building's Italianate features, or if they were added by Leroy Shearer and Brackett Corser, who purchased it from Fairbanks in 1878. The pair are probably responsible for its conversion into a two-family residence, which is how it was recorded at a tax sale in 1883. The house subsequently has had a variety of owners; the front porch was probably added in the 1910s.

Class 341000 trains were manufactured and delivered between 1993 and 1999 to expand service on the Gwacheon Line and the Ansan Line sections of Line 4.  Technical details  Formation The Class 341000 cars are arranged in 10-car trains. Details of the car types of each train are listed below: 3410XX (ex-20XX) - Tc (trailer driving car with SIV, air compressor, and battery) 3411XX (ex-22XX) - M (motor car with inverter and controller) 3412XX (ex-23XX) - M' (motor car with pantograph, transformer, inverter, and controller) 3413XX (ex-28XX) - T (trailer car) 3414XX (ex-24XX) - M' 3415XX (ex-25XX) - T' (trailer car with SIV, air compressor, and battery) 3416XX (ex-29XX) - T 3417XX (ex-26XX) - M 3418XX (ex-27XX) - M' 3419XX (ex-21XX) - Tc  Electrical parts  Trains 341-01~341-05, 341-08, 341-18~341-23, 341-25, and 341-26 use IGBT controls with passive cooling through a heat pipe, while all other trains use Toshiba GTO-based VVVF controls with active cooling. Power output on the Class 341000 trains is greater than that on the Class 1000 trains. As a result, the trains only utilize five powered cars, as opposed to six powered cars in older Korail metro trains. The trains are also equipped with regenerative braking, which reduces energy consumption and simplifies train inspection.  Interior design  The Class 341000 trains used an ivory-colored interior with a long sheet prior to their overhauls. All trains now use a white interior. LED display monitors are installed on the top of each car. The end cars have a space for wheelchairs.  Cabin  The Class 341000 trains equipped with TGIS use color displays, and service machines can be automatically controlled in TGIS after a refurbishment of these trains in 2005. Dead section notifiers are also installed.  Depot  The Class 341000 trains are stored at the Siheung depot, which is located after Oido Station on Line 4. Generations  1st Generation  Class 341000 (1st batch) train 341-16 (ex-Class 2030 train 2-45) The first generation of Class 341000 trains were built from 1993 to 1996. The trains used a livery consisting of red and orange stripes when delivered, but after refurbishment, the trains started using the new livery. Because of the flat front ends, the trains are nicknamed \\"flat face\\" (ÎÇ©ÏûëÏù¥). The trains are numbered 341-01~341-25; the trains were renumbered from trains 2-30~2-46, 2-49, 2-51~2-54, 2-70~2-72. Trains 341-01~341-22 were manufactured from 1993 to 1994 by Daewoo Heavy Industries, Hanjin Heavy Industries, and Hyundai Precision to address the opening of the Gwacheon Line and the Ansan Line (from Seonbawi Station to Ansan Station) and were originally six cars long. Additional cars were built in 1995 by Daewoo Heavy Industries to expand these trains to ten cars. Meanwhile, trains 341-23~341-25 were manufactured in 1996 by Daewoo Heavy Industries to expand the rolling stock on Line 4; they were built with 10 cars each. Trains 341-01~341-07 are expected to be replaced by third generation Class 341000 trains. Train 341-02 was retired in 2018 after it was cannibalized of cars for other metro trains, and many trains currently utilize cars from other Class 341000 trains or from older Class 311000 trains.  2nd Generation  Class 341000 (2nd batch) train 341-29 (ex-Class 2030 train 2-80) The second generation of Class 341000 trains were built in 1999 by KOROS (Korea Rolling Stock Company) to address the extension of the Ansan Line section of Line 4 from Ansan Station to Oido Station. The cab ends of the driving cars changed completely into a circular front view, which led to the trains being nicknamed \\"round face\\" (ÎèôÍ∏ÄÏù¥). The trains used a livery consisting of red and orange stripes when delivered (similar to that of the first generation trains), but after refurbishment, the trains started using the new livery. The trains are numbered 341-26~341-30; the trains were renumbered from trains 2-77~2-81.  3rd Generation  The third generation of Class 341000 trains is being built by Hyundai Rotem starting in 2018 to replace the aging first generation trains, which in recent years have been suffering from reliability issues. The trains sport some minor changes, such as the change in the propulsion system (from an IGBT-based system to an interior permanent magnet-based system). The cab ends of the driving cars changed completely; as a result, railfans nicknamed the trains \\"Ï£ºÎë•Ïù¥\\" (roughly translated as \\"snout face\\").https://m.blog.naver.com/junha1085/221477792709 The trains will be delivered in the new livery. At this time, seven trains, numbered 341-31~341-37, have been delivered and entered service; however, trains 341-31~341-34 and 341-36 are temporarily assigned to Line 1 to serve as temporary replacements for aging third generation Class 1000 trains until Line 4 is extended northward.https://gall.dcinside.com/board/view/?id=train&no;=878983 A further 18 trains, tentatively numbered 341-38~341-55, are expected to be manufactured and delivered before 2023;https://v.kakao.com/v/20191219110613029 these trains will serve as replacements for aging first generation Class 341000 trains.  Refurbishment  The Class 341000 trains were overhauled from 2003 to 2005 (though minor refurbishments were started in 2002). Major and minor refurbishments are listed below.  Overhaul  The Daegu subway fire compelled Korail to introduce flame-resistant interiors for passenger safety. As a result, all trains were overhauled with fire-retardant interiors from 2003 to 2005.  New livery  Refurbished interior of a second batch train All trains used an old KNR livery consisting of red and orange stripes. These trains were repainted into the current blue and bluegreen livery from 2003 to 2005. The new livery has a metaphor of Taegeuk, but was criticized as being too primitive-looking. Livery is applied only on front and on the doors.  Electric parts  * 2002: Trains 341-01~341-25 were retrofitted with Comonet broadcasting systems. They have since been removed. * 2004: All trains' braking systems are refurbished to generate less noise. * 2004-2005: SIV traction systems were replaced with IGBT traction systems built by Woojin Industrial Systems. * 2005: Various new components in all trains (public address systems, newer cooling systems, and LED destination signs) are added. From 2003, some trains had their GTO inverters replaced with IGBT inverters. As of 2018, trains 341-01~341-05, 341-08, 341-18~341-23, 341-25, and 341-26 have received new inverters. From July 2008 all trains were retrofitted with automatic gangway doors (similar retrofits were also done in Class 311000, Class 321000, and Class 351000 trains). This retrofit included the installation of automatic doors to replace the older doors that were manually pulled open; gangway doors can now be automatically opened by the push of a button. This retrofit process was completed by February 2012. Some trains are now being retrofitted with LED headlights, following the successful testing of LED headlights on the Korail Class 311000 cars.  Renumbering  In 2011, the Class 341000 trains were renumbered from the 2000-series to the 341000-series as a part of a new numbering scheme by Korail (the leading \\"3\\" indicating a metro car). Renumbering was finished by mid-2011.

The 17th century Aegidienkirche, now deconsecrated and rebuilt. The √Ñgidienkirche was a church in the German city of Speyer. Dedicated to saint Giles, it was founded around 1140 as part of a hospital complex by bishop Burchard on land owned by himself and his mother in what was then the city outskirts. In 1148, after his mother's death, he granted it to the Augustinian canonry at H√∂rdt. It soon became one of Speyer's parish churches, with clergy supplied or appointed by the canonry. Its last Roman Catholic priest, Jost Neblich, was presented in 1565. The Protestant Frederick III, Elector Palatine took control of the canonry in 1566, forcibly expelled the canons from the √Ñgidienkirche and in spring 1572 installed its first Protestant pastor, Johann Willing. Leopold V's troops occupied Speyer during the Thirty Years War and he handed the church over to a new Capuchin foundation in the city on 1 May 1623. It was in such a poor state that they laid the foundation stone for a new hall church, designed by the Capuchin brother Peter of Cologne, completed in 1628 and costing Leopold 10,000 florins. The bishop of Speyer ordered that the new church's main altar retain the dedication to St Giles. New monastic buildings and hospitals were also built on the old site. The Capuchins were expelled in 1650 following the Peace of Westphalia and a priest was even dragged from the altar during mass. The new church became a Protestant parish church, although the monastery was given back to the Capuchins in 1688 when the French took control of the areas during the Nine Years War, although it was damaged when the French burned the city the following year. Monks had returned by 1694 and the order's minister general visited early in 1766. It refused the Civil Constitution of the Clergy after the French occupied the city in the War of the First Coalition but returned to the monastery in 1796. The Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 formally annexed Speyer to France and the following year the monastery was declared state property and the church made the city's main parish church, since it was planned to demolish the city's ruined cathedral. Instead the cathedral was saved and the monastery sold off in 1806, though the deconsecrated church (by then a tobacco store) was acquired by the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1807 for use as a customs warehouse. In 1979 it was turned into a community centre named the √Ñgidienhaus.

According to Franz Hinkelammert, recent Pixley's work on the theology and Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy shows that the liberation theology has entered a process of renewal. Pixley opens up to the dimension of God, to the \\"God's drama in the history\\", especially when he examines the book of Job. In all his argumentation, he defends the \\"option for the poor\\": God is the God of all, rich and poor, but \\"if he did not choose the option for the poor, he would be a partial God in favor of the rich\\", then, it would be an option against the poor.Hinkelammert, Franz (2009) \\"Apresenta√ß√£o\\"; in J.

These services lack authentication when reacting to user commands, making it possible for attackers to issue activation words and commands and trigger the execution of desired actions. Injection results include fraud, burglary, data espionage and takeover of connected systems.  Approach  Most digital assistants require an activation word to trigger the complete recording and audio analysis of spoken commands (e.g. \\"OK Google\\"). These commands, spoken in natural language, will be processed and executed. The activation word itself is different for each manufacturer, most often connected to product‚Äôs name. It is not possible for the product's owner to customize this activation word, meaning that all models react to the same word. Processed language is not analyzed in regards to voice and recognition or authorization of individual users. As a result, all users which are in the audible range of a device have the same authorizations to trigger and execute actions. Depending on functionality, these actions can range from simple actions like music playback or controlling lights, to security critical or sensitive actions such as opening gates, executing or ordering chargeable transactions or reading out private information. Audio injection attacks can be performed remotely. If the access into the audible area of a digital assistant is restricted, it can be attacked by increasing the distance of transmission. Either this can be reached by overcoming existent acoustic barriers (e.g. via vending opening or a momentary opened window) or via unusual loud playback via amplifiers and loudspeakers. With such an approach it is possible to control digital assistants from other rooms, floors or outside of a building. Digital assistants do not distinguish whether voice commands are directly spoken or reproduced by a loudspeaker system. This means that attacks can be performed via devices which support audio playback via loudspeaker. Radio and television can be used to run mass-attacks, and telephones, hands-free systems, other digital assistants or systems for text-to-speech-processing can be misused. Systems which can be accessed randomly, anonymously and in absence of the owner, as well as being activated remotely, are critical. Answering machines with an automated monitoring function playing a message aloud along could be used for remote and precise attacks.  Examples  A June 2014 television commercial from Microsoft depicted an actor issuing a voice command to an Xbox, causing the same command to be interpreted by Xbox systems in the same room as any television showing this commercial. In December 2016, Adam Jakowenko showed how one virtual assistant could activate another one using TTS-processing. In January 2017, television news coverage of a child's ordering of a dollhouse through Amazon's Alexa interface included news anchor Jim Patton quoting the child.

The film also stars Anupama Kumar in an important role. The film features music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. Chandini plays title role of Ranguski in this film. This film received generally positive reviews. Plot Raja is a police constable who lives with his colleague Baskar. He falls in love with an aspiring writer named Ranguski. He often visits Maria, a senior citizen living in a villa community who has demanded police protection as she is an antique collector and possesses many valuable things. Maria and Ranguski live in the same housing complex. Raja tries to woo Ranguski by making her prank calls in the name of a stranger and forcing her to love him instead. As Ranguski is frustrated by this, she falls in love with Raja. To Raja's surprise, he finds that Ranguski still gets such calls from a stranger. Soon, he too gets such calls, and the caller threatens to kill Ranguski. Raja rushes to Ranguski's home to save her, but he finds out that the killer has killed Maria instead. With circumstances proving that Raja is the killer, he plans with Baskar and Ranguski to find the real killer. They deduce that the killer is part of the villa community too. When Raja goes to meet a photographer who claimed to know who the real killer is, he finds the latter has been murdered. Raja is then arrested by CBCID officer, KK. However, Raja manages to escape custody and reunites with Ranguski and Baskar. He tells them while at Maria‚Äôs house on the day of murder, he saw a man with a tattoo on his forearm. They then track down that man, John. John says that he went to Maria‚Äôs house looking for the highly valuable Gutenberg Bible but found her already dead. Raja then asks Ranguski to meet KK and hand over a recording of John‚Äôs confession to him. They then find John dead. Raja receives a call again which seems to indicate that Ranguski has been kidnapped. Raja and Baskar are then rounded up by the police. However, Raja fights off the police and runs away to find his friend Shiva. Shiva tells him that the last location of Ranguski‚Äôs phone was at a church in Cheyur. Raja visits the church and meets Maria‚Äôs twin sister Mary, who reveals that Ranguski is the one who committed all the murders and framed Raja. Meanwhile, Ranguski, in possession of the Gutenberg Bible, meets the buyers, the contact she got from John before killing him. While trying to escape with the money, she is shot by the police and dies in Raja‚Äôs arms.

A hyperbolic hyperboloid design, a ruled surface developed from the hyperbolic function; the intrinsic strength in the hyperboloid design is similar to that of an eggshell in the surprisingly small wall thickness Early life He was born in Roermond. He was the son of Gerrit van Iterson and Aghate Henrietta van Woelderen. He attended the Delft University of Technology (Technische Universiteit Delft or TU Delft). In 1899 he gained a diploma in Engineering (ingenieursdiploma). Career In 1910 he began teaching at the technical high school in Delft. He became Director of the Dutch State Mines (DSM). Cooling towers He began work into the design of cooling towers. Previously, designs of cooling towers were more-or-less the same as chimneys, in octagonal planform. On 12 February 1915, the Dutch State Mines decided to build a new concrete cooling tower. This led to his work producing the hyperboloid design of cooling towers at the Staatsmijn Emma in 1918; the towers were demolished on 26 June 1985. This design of cooling towers was the world's first, and nearly all cooling towers now follow this hyperboloid design, with concrete structure. On 16 August 1916, he took out the UK patent (108,863) for Improved Construction of Cooling Towers of Reinforced Concrete; the patent was filed on 9 August 1917, and published on 11 April 1918. The Emma coal mine, named after Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, was the second- largest in the Netherlands, with the Staatsmijn Maurits the largest. The Delft University of Technology still conducts much research on coal technology. In 1931 he won an award from the Koninklijk Instituut van Ingenieurs. In 1934 he was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1945 he helped to establish Tebodin Consultants & Engineers, bought by Hollandse Beton Groep (HBS) in 2002, and now owned by Bilfinger of Germany since 2012. Personal life He married Jennie Woutera Rotgans on 24 December 1910. They had two daughters and a son. He lived at Heerlen.

Originally formed in the Royal Engineers (RE), it was transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) at the start of World War II. It fought with distinction in the defence of Calais during the Battle of France, in which it was virtually destroyed. Reformed, it helped to protect the cities of South Wales from the Luftwaffe during The Blitz, and later defended the South Coast of England against Fighter bomber and V-1 flying bomb attacks. It went to North West Europe to defend Antwerp during the final stages of the war, and served in the Gibraltar garrison postwar. Royal Engineer origins Cap badge of the Royal Engineers (cipher of King George VI) The Royal Engineers (RE) had developed an extensive anti-aircraft (AA) searchlight (S/L) organisation during World War I,Short et al.Anon, RE History, Vol V, pp. 55‚Äì68. but this was quickly reduced after the Armistice. The last remnants of Nos 3 and 17 AA Companies moved to Blackdown Camp at the end of 1920 to form the nucleus of 1st AA Battalion, RE, as part of the newly created 1st Air Defence Brigade. Although destined to become the largest Regular unit of the RE during the inter-war years, its initial strength was three non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and four sappers under the command of a lieutenant of the Royal Field Artillery. It was another year before it got its first RE commanding officer (CO), Lt-Col G.C.E. Elliott, and nearly two years before it received substantial reinforcements, including troops who had operated lorry-mounted searchlights during the Irish War of Independence. It formed two companies, A and B. From early 1925 the battalion also had a detachment at Belfast, but this disappeared in late 1926.Anon, RE History, Vol VII, pp. 203‚Äì4.Monthly Army List (various dates)Frederick, pp. 858‚Äì63.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 107. The main responsibility for AA defence of the United Kingdom was entrusted to the part-time Territorial Army, which developed a large-scale organisation under Anti-Aircraft Command before the outbreak of World War II. The Regulars of 1st Air Defence Brigade (later 1st AA Brigade) were to provide AA cover for field forces, initially for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that would go overseas on the outbreak of war. In 1938 it was decided that all coastal and AA searchlights, which operated alongside the Royal Artillery (RA), would become the responsibility of that corps; however, the transfers had not been completed when war was declared in September 1939. A 2nd AA Battalion, RE, was organised at Blackdown in 1936, but this was disbanded in September 1938 and replaced by 2nd Searchlight Regiment, RA. Pakenham-Walsh, RE History, Vol VIII, pp. 5, 161.Robert Palmer, A Concise History of Anti- Aircraft Command (History and Personnel) at British Military History. World War II RA cap badge. Mobilisation 1st AA Battalion, RE, under the command of Lt-Col R.M. Goldney, RA, was ordered to mobilise by 1st AA Brigade on 1 September 1939, and war was declared two days later. Battalion HQ with A and B Companies (which officially became Nos 1 and 2 Companies) left Blackdown and embarked at Southampton on 10 September, landing at Cherbourg the following day.Farndale, p. 19.Joslen, p. 462.1st AA Bn War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 167/674.Routledge, p. 113. However, this may have been a mistake: it is alleged that the movement order was supposed to have said 'less 1st AA Bn RE', and the battalion was intended to defend the Thames Estuary under AA Command. On arrival in France, the battalion deployed to protect the BEF's No 2 Base Sub-area at Nantes, but at the end of the month it moved up to Fauquembergues, where its lights cooperated with night fighters of No 60 Wing, Royal Air Force in the Aircraft Fighting Zone (AFZ) bounded by Bergues, Cassel and Guisnes (just inland from the ports of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk). The 72-light S/L layout (at an average separation of 4500 yards, seven rows deep, with Mk VIII Sound locators in the first row) was built up from west to east as 3rd Searchlight Battery arrived.Routledge, p. 115. 3rd Searchlight Battery, RA, had mobilised at Portsmouth, and sailed from Southampton, disembarking on 16 September at Brest, where it was delayed for a week awaiting the arrival of much of its transport. It joined the rest of the battalion on 3 October and deployed three days later. On 17 October the battalion came under the command of 2nd AA Brigade, and on 2 November the first Luftwaffe raider came over the battalion's area (a Heinkel He 111 shot down by the RAF).3 S/L Bty War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, TNA file WO 167/682. 4th Searchlight Battery, RA, mobilised on 1 December at Yeovil and sailed from Southampton to Cherbourg on 8 December.

This brought the number of lights operated by the battalion up to 96.Routledge, Table XVII, p. 125.

Phoney War 90 cm Searchlight in France May 1940 (this example was operated by 10th S/L Bty, 3rd S/L Rgt) Apart from occasional air raid alarms, there was little activity during the winter of 1939‚Äì40 (the Phoney War).Routledge, p. 115. The battalion officially became 1st Searchlight Battalion, RE, on 17 December 1939. and then 1st Searchlight Regiment, RA, on 15 January 1940.1 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339. Between 16 and 21 March, A and B S/L Companies, RE, were relieved by 1st and 2nd S/L Batteries, RA, direct from 216th S/L Training Regiment at Kinmel Park, Abergele. The equipment and some of the RE officers and sappers transferred to the new regiment but others returned to the UK, while the RA officers and gunners familiarised themselves with the S/L layout.B S/L Coy War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, TNA file WO 167/676.1 S/L Bty War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, TNA file WO 167/680. From 23 February the regiment formed part of 5th S/L Brigade, which had been formed to control most of the S/L units deployed to protect airfields, ports, and the BEF's forward gun areas.Farndale, Annex A, p. 237.Ellis, Appendix I.Routledge, p. 116; Table XVIII, p. 126.GHQ BEF at RA 39‚Äì45. During April, 1st S/Lt Rgt was moved up close to the Belgian Border to protect the artillery concentrating there in accordance with 'Plan D'.Routledge, pp. 115-6. Battle of France When the Battle of France began on 10 May, the BEF started its planned advance north into Belgium, but the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again. 1st and 3rd Searchlight Batteries were ordered to hold the bridges on the La Bass√©e‚ÄìB√©thune Canal 'at all costs' against attacks from the south. They deployed their Boys anti-tank rifles and Bren guns, using S/L lorries as roadblocks, while French forces withdrew through them. The towns were bombed and S/L positions were machine-gunned by Luftwaffe fighters.Routledge, pp. 116-7. 4th Searchlight Bty, deployed round Lille, saw constant enemy air activity. On 17 May it detached a group of riflemen with Boys rifles to 5th AA Brigade HQ at Lens (these never returned to the battery during its stay in France) while the remainder joined the Bethune canal guards. Meanwhile, Army Group A had cut the BEF's lines of communication into France and driven it back towards the coast at Dunkirk, cutting off the British troops at Calais and Boulogne from the main force. When planning the evacuation from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo), the BEF's commanders decided that Calais and Boulogne should still be held as supply points for further fighting or possible exit points for a final withdrawal.Routledge, pp. 117‚Äì8. On 17 May, 1st S/L Bty was ordered back to Calais, a move made difficult because all the roads were choked with refugees. There it operated in the S/L role to defend the port. Calais By 20 May, the AA units at Calais, including 1st and 2nd S/L Btys, were deployed in a semi-circle from Fort Risban and Fort Vert west of the town, round to the east side where there was a screen of S/L detachments one mile apart. Lt-Col Goldney was appointed AA Defence Commander for the town. The 1st Bn Queen Victoria's Rifles (QVR), the lead unit of 30th Infantry Brigade, arrived by sea on 22 May, just before advanced German troops began probing the defences.Farndale, p. 57.Routledge, p. 119.Ellis, Chapter 10.Neave, pp. 29 & 35. On the night of 22/23 May the AA units engaged Luftwaffe raiders that bombed Calais, starting fires. But ground attack was now the biggest danger, and the S/L men had to man the perimeter as infantry, a role for which they (mainly older Territorials, raw militiamen and a few ex- RE reservists) were untrained.Neave, p. 33. Goldney ordered his S/L detachments to concentrate at their Troop HQs (THQs) at dawn on 23 May, dig trenches and erect roadblocks.Neave, p. 37. The first serious attack came the following day, against a position held by C Troop of 1st S/L Bty on the Saint- Omer canal at Les Attaques, eight miles south-east of Calais. Reinforced by men from 2nd S/L Bty they put up a stout fight, halting a tank column for three hours before they were overwhelmed.Neave, pp. 40‚Äì2. Next, Goldney's HQ at Orphanage Farm came under attack. The HQ details of 1st S/L Rgt and 172nd LAA Bty (58th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) LAA Rgt), supported by Bren gunners from Lt Airey Neave's Troop of 2nd S/L Bty at nearby Coulogne, held the position for five hours before Goldney ordered them to slip back towards Calais. He ordered Neave to withdraw his men by lorry to Calais, pausing only to destroy his experimental sound locator, codenamed 'Cuckoo'.Probably the new Mk IX, equipped with Visual Indicating Equipment (Routledge, pp. 55, 61.) Neave with a sergeant and a sapper, failed to blow the apparatus up with Gun cotton, but two French drivers abandoned and set on fire their tankers of aviation fuel and the resultant blaze destroyed the equipment successfully.Neave, pp. 44‚Äì5.Jon Latimer, 'Sacrifice at Calais' at HistoryNet.Frandale, p. 64. By 24 May the town was completely cut off, and 2nd Lieutenant William Dothie, commanding a Troop of six S/L detachments east of the town, found himself out of communication with his Battery HQ. His THQ, including a number of stragglers from other units, came under attack by German tanks and aircraft in the evening and he fell back to a small farm in a nearby wood. The following morning, Dothie led an attack on the tanks in their camp, engaging them with Boys and Bren fire. Although the tanks withdrew, Dothie guessed that they would bring up reinforcements and he ordered his men to withdraw, covering their crossing of some open ground with a Bren gun. However, he and the QVR Bren gunner found themselves cut off on the wrong side of the open ground and could not get back to the rendezvous until after dark, by which time the rest of the party had made their way to Calais.Dothie's detailed citation at TNA file WO 373/60/319.'Early Escapers' at WWII Escape and Evasion. British prisoners being marched away after the fall of Calais, 26 May 1940 In the town, Goldney formed the S/L and AA troops into a reserve for 30th Brigade, which was manning the outer fortifications. On 24 May 30th Brigade's infantry and the S/L gunners were involved in close-quarter fighting and were forced back to the citadel and the harbour. Many wounded and 'non- fighting' personnel were evacuated on the City of Canterbury and the Kohistan and a Flotilla of Destroyers. Goldney allowed about 200 AA troops to leave, but ordered the remainder to stay and fight. Hundreds of 'non-fighting' men, including Neave's party, were left at the port and later in the dunes hoping for evacuation. The garrison held out in the citadel and port until 16.00 on 26 May. The survivors, including Goldney and Neave (by now wounded) became Prisoners of war (PoWs). During the final stages and during the night of 26/27 May some of the defenders escaped or were picked up by boats.Neave, pp. 65, 96.Routledge, p. 120. Reaching the shore, 2nd Lt Dothie volunteered to swim out to a destroyer to arrange evacuation, but could not reach it and had to return to the beach. Wearing nothing more than a blanket at first, he then went on the run for several days before being taken prisoner. Later, he escaped from a PoW column being marched towards Germany, returned to the coast and stole a boat in which he reached Alderney. Finding that the Channel Islands were already in enemy hands, he returned to Cherbourg before making a second successful attempt to reach England by boat. He was awarded a Military Cross for his exploits. Calais fell on 26 May, but its three-day defence, holding up Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzerkorps, had provided some respite for the Dunkirk evacuation.Farndale, p. 57.Neave, p. 208. Dunkirk 3rd and 4th Searchlight Btys were withdrawn from the La Bass√©e‚ÄìB√©thune Canal on 19 and 20 May and sent to provide AA cover at Hazebrouck and Cassel, which were heavily bombed. 4th S/L Bty sent some S/L lorries to Lille, but these never rejoined. On 22 May a German mechanised column forced a passage over the Canal de Neufoss√© at Blaringhem despite the defensive efforts of P Troop, 4th S/L Bty, while N Troop, 4th S/L Bty, was also forced to withdraw. The two troops reached Furnes the following day and dug in along the Furnes‚ÄìDunkirk Canal, where they were joined by O Troop and J Troop of 3rd S/L Bty, which had withdrawn from Hazebrouck to Spycker. All the units were being regularly bombed. On 27 May, 4th S/L Bty was ordered to destroy its S/L equipment and vehicles and move into Dunkirk for evacuation, which occurred in the early hours of 28 May. Finally on 28 May 3rd S/L Bty was also ordered to destroy its equipment and march to Dunkirk docks for evacuation. Both batteries were regularly bombed and machine gunned during the evacuation, suffering several casualties. It is claimed that only one officer and 57 men of 1st Searchlight Regiment's 52 officers and 1600 men got back to England,Neave, p. 44. but that must apply only to the two batteries at Calais, the bulk of the other two batteries having been evacuated from Dunkirk. William Dothie got back on 2 August, and Airey Neave later made the first successful British escape from Colditz Castle, reaching England in April 1942. Blitz On return to the UK, 3rd S/L Bty was quickly re-equipped with a reduced number of S/Ls and sent to Gibraltar in July to bolster the AA defences of the naval base against raids by Vichy French and Italian bombers.Routledge, p. 201. 4th Searchlight Bty joined 2nd S/L Rgt defending airfields in South West EnglandRoutledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. and later served in Malta.Routledge, Table XXIX, p. 175. 1st Searchlight Regiment was reformed at the AA Command Practice Camp at Codsall, near Wolverhampton, on 24 July 1940. The reconstituted unit consisted of 1st, 2nd, 7th and 8th S/L Btys (7th and 8th had served in France with 2nd S/L Rgt), and the replacement personnel were drawn from 477th, 479th and 480th S/L Btys, all of which were newly-raised. For example, 477th S/L Bty had been formed at 217th Searchlight Training Regiment at Bradbury Lines, Hereford, with a cadre of experienced men from the Territorial 59th (Warwickshire) S/L Rgt. It was intended to join a newly-formed 76 S/L Rgt, but these plans were immediately changed: 477th S/L Bty was disbanded in July and the men posted to 1st S/L Rgt.War Office letters of 2 & 3 May and 25 July 1940 in 76 S/L Rgt War Diary, 1940‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/3096. At the end of September the regiment joined 45th AA Brigade of 5th AA Division (9th AA Division from November) to complete the 'Illuminated Area' in South Wales. At the time, the towns of South Wales, including important coal and oil port facilities, refineries, steelworks and ordnance factories, were under almost nightly air attack (the Cardiff Blitz and Swansea Blitz). The regiment's searchlights were deployed under both 45th and 61st AA Brigade, assisting the AA guns of the Cardiff and Swansea Gun Defence Areas, while the S/L detachments occasionally engaged the raiders directly with their LMGs.45 AA Bde War Diary 1940, TNA file WO 166/2285.Routledge, pp 391, 385.Farndale, Annex D, pp. 258‚Äì9.9 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 230th S/L Training Rgt at Blandford Camp where it provided the basis for a new 545 S/L Bty formed on 16 January 1941. This battery later joined a newly-forming 81st S/L Rgt. After The Blitz ended in May 1941, the regiment remained under 61st AA Brigade until January 1942, when it transferred to 27th (Home Counties) AA Brigade in South East England.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. Hit and run The city of Canterbury was raided in the so-called Baedeker Blitz soon after the regiment arrived in the area, and thereafter the AA defences of Southern England were severely tested by the Luftwaffe's 'hit-and- run' attacks along the South Coast from the summer of 1942. The AA Divisions were disbanded on 30 September and replaced by AA Groups that more closely matched the organisation of RAF Fighter Command. 27th AA Brigade took responsibility for all S/L units under 2 AA Group covering South East England, though 8th S/L Bty was often operationally attached to 71 AA Brigade in 2 AA Group.Routledge, pp. 400‚Äì4.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, TNA file WO 212/84. Because of the continuing hit-and-run raids by Luftwaffe Fighter-bombers, the defensive armament of S/L positions was enhanced, the allocation of LMGs being increased from one to four and then six per S/L site. Later the LMGs in 27th AA Brigade were supplemented with twin Vickers K machine gun mountings and eventually twin 0.5-inch Browning machine guns on power mountings. The guns had to be manned throughout the hours of daylight.Sainsbury, Chapter 5.355 S/L Bty War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11550. Baby Blitz and Operation Diver AA Radar No 2 SLC Between 21 January and 14 March 1944 the Luftwaffe crossed the S/L belt of SE England to carry out 11 night raids on London in the so-called Baby Blitz. However, by March 1944, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for service overseas, including the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). Each of 27th AA Brigade's S/L regiments lost one of its four batteries. In the case of 1st S/L Rgt it was 8th S/L Bty that began to disband on 25 February, completing the process by 24 March.Routledge, pp. 409-10.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. being sent to Malta.8 S/L Bty War Diaries 1944 and 1945, TNA files WO 169/18679 and WO 169/22134. Soon after D Day, the Germans began launching V-1 flying bombs against London by day and night. The AA resources in SE England were strongly reinforced in Operation Diver, the S/L belt being thickened up both to cooperate with RAF Night fighters and to use their S/L Control (SLC or 'Elsie') radar to guide LAA guns. All these units were heavily engaged until the autumn, when 21st Army Group overran the V-1 launching sites in northern France.Routledge, pp. 99, 399, 411‚Äì15. North West Europe By the end of 1944, 21st Army Group had advanced to the Belgium‚ÄìNetherlands frontier, and required AA reinforcements to protect the vital port of Antwerp and its approaches up the Scheldt Estuary from bombing (including parachute mines) and 'Divers'. 1st Searchlight Regiment left 27th AA Brigade and crossed to the Continent in January 1945 under the command of Lt-Col G.Howson to join 76th AA Brigade.Routledge, pp. 333‚Äì7.Joslen, p. 463.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889. V-1 in flight over Antwerp Captured V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. The regiment relieved 2nd S/L Rgt on the Scheldt on 23 January, with Regimental HQ at Goes on South Beveland, 1st S/L Bty HQ at 's-Heerenhoek and 2nd S/L Bty HQ at Krabbendijke. These two batteries took over a permanent radar watch to provide early warning for the LAA units deployed with them. The regiment also supplied the S/Ls for two Landing Craft Flak operating in the estuary under 124th (Highland) LAA Rgt. The AA units on the Scheldt were employed both in the AA and coastal defence role, because of German miniature submarines infiltrating into the shipping lane. 7th Searchlight Battery was detached and deployed at Brasschaat near Antwerp on anti-Diver duties under 5th Royal Marine AA Brigade. On 25 February a V-1 hit inflicted casualties of five killed, two missing and six wounded on this battery. During February the regiment began to receive the latest AA No 2 Mk VIII* SLC centimetric radar to improve the coverage of the AA Inner Artillery Zone.Routledge, p. 99. However, the threat of serious air raids diminished as the war drew to its close, and the Diver defences were closed down on 20 April. While some other AA units were disbanded or moved up into Germany, 1st S/L Rgt maintained its deployment throughout the final weeks of the war.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. 76th AA Brigade was ordered to cease fire on 3 May 1945 when a local truce came into effect to allow supplies to be airlifted to civilians in the enemy-occupied Netherlands (Operation Manna). This was followed on 4 May by the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath and the end of the war in Europe (VE Day). After VE Day, 76th AA Brigade remained temporarily on its AA tasks. Its units, including the whole of 1st S/L Rgt, then returned to the mainland from the Scheldt islands and concentrated north of Antwerp before moving into Germany in June to garrison the Dortmund‚ÄìBochum area.Routledge, p. 363. 1st Searchlight Regiment returned to the UK on 1 December 1945.76 AA Bde War Diary, August‚ÄìDecember 1945, TNA file WO 171/4890. Postwar On 1 April 1947 the regiment was redesignated 78th Searchlight Regiment, RA (not to be confused with the wartime 78th S/L Rgt, disbanded in 1943), 1, 2 and 7 S/L Btys becoming 212, 213 and 240 S/L Btys respectively.Frederick, p. 958.76-80 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. However, on 30 September 1948 the regiment was re-equipped with 3.7-inch AA guns as 78th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (not to be confused with the wartime 78th (1st East Anglian) HAA Rgt, which had been reformed as 284th HAA Rgt in the TA). In August 1950 the regiment went to Gibraltar, where 213 and 240 Btys served in the Grand Casemates and 212 Bty at Moorish Castle. On Gibraltar the regiment was equipped with a mixture of 3.7-inch HAA guns and 6-pounder and 17-pounder anti-tank guns. On 4 December 1953 the regiment was ordered back to Woolwich for disbandment, which was completed on 1 February 1954.

In some areas, flights and shipping services were suspended, and there was major disruption to power supplies and other essential infrastructure. The weather was the result of stationary high pressure over western Europe, resulting in strong winds circulating from Russia and Scandinavia towards eastern Europe. On 9 January, the Continental Arctic (cA) air mass extended from Germany across the Balkans, resulting in deep snow in Greece and strong bora winds affecting Croatia in particular. In addition, heavy snow in central and Southern Italy was the result of cold air flowing across the warmer Adriatic Sea. At least 61 deaths were attributed to the cold wave.  Affected areas  During the first week of 2017, 46 (mainly homeless) people died from the cold in Poland, when temperatures fell below . Free public transport was provided in Warsaw, Krak√≥w and Kielce because of the smog caused by the cold weather. Wroc≈Çaw was also affected by smog with air quality in the area dropping to critical levels. Seven cold-related deaths were reported in Italy as of 9 January, mainly of homeless people, and parts of the country experienced exceptional falls of snow, high winds and freezing temperatures. Several airports were closed, including those in Sicily, Bari and Brindisi. Ice formed on the Adriatic Sea, and schools in the south of the country were closed. On 10 January, shipping was halted along a stretch of the Danube in Romania, Croatia and Serbia, because of the icy conditions.

The Bosphorus was closed to shipping after a snowstorm that also affected services in Istanbul, Turkey, where more than 650 flights were grounded. Blizzards affected Bulgaria and also parts of Romania and Ukraine, and shipping on the Danube was suspended. Heavy snow in Bucharest causes major disruption to the traffic (11 January). Temperatures fell to in Greece, where the National Observatory of Athens referred to the weather phenomenon as Ariadne (after the goddess Ariadne). Greek authorities decided in 2016 in Greece to name extreme weather phenomena starting from January 2017; Ariadne was the first weather phenomenon to receive a name. The whole country was blanketed by unusually heavy snowfall, causing huge problems in transport. Snow even fell in Athens and Santorini. One migrant died of cold, and many migrants on islands in the Aegean Sea were moved into heated tents as the area was covered in snow. The authorities opened three Athens Metro tube stations to homeless people to help protect them from the cold. Road and public transport in the country were also disrupted. On 10 January, it was announced that in Thessaloniki in the province of Macedonia only 130 buses out of 480‚Äì500 operated by Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organisation were in operational condition. The islands of Euboea, Skopelos and Alonnisos declared a state of emergency after serious power failures and collapse of traffic due to snowfall. Mytilene on the island of Lesbos recorded a low of on 7 January, a temperature expected to occur on average once in 300 years in current climatic conditions. January 2017 overall mean monthly temperature was below average in Mytilene and Bucharest, and many weather stations reported monthly means more than below average. Deaths were also reported in Russia and Ukraine. Temperatures in some parts of European Russia fell to below , setting records across the region. About 100,000 residents of settlements in Moscow Oblast such as Lyubertsy, Lytkarino, Dzerzhinsky and Kotelniki lost electricity due to extremely harsh temperatures. On 11 January, the cold wave reached Albania, with temperatures reaching and supplies being flown in by army helicopters, mainly in the city of Gjirokast√´r and the nation's capital Tirana. On 16 January, it was reported that the electricity prices in Europe were at their highest since 2008 as a result of power outages and increased demand.

Crakehall was from Crakehall in the North Riding of Yorkshire and may have been a younger son of Ellis of Crakehall. Ellis was a sub-tenant who held lands in the lordship of Richmond.Jobson \\"Crakehall, John of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Crakehall first appears in records when he was the attorney at Westminster for Hugh of Wells, the Bishop of Lincoln, over Easter in 1231. On 9 April 1231 he was installed as the rector of Somerton in Oxfordshire. Hugh named Crakehall as an executor of his estate in June 1233. Crakehell served Robert Grosseteste, who was the Bishop of Lincoln, from around 1235 to 1250, as the chief steward of the Diocese of Lincoln. As steward he was involved in a number of disputes, including one in 1240 over the rights of the bishop to visit and inspect the activities of the dean and cathedral chapter of Lincoln Cathedral. In 1241 Crakehall was Grosseteste's agent in negotiations with King Henry III of England over the prebend of Thame. In 1250 he went with Grosseteste to Lyons to meet with Pope Innocent IV. After leaving the steward's office, Crakehall remained close to the bishop, and in 1251 was appointed by Grosseteste to review the bishopric's finances, which had suffered under Crakehall's successor as steward. When Grossteste died in late 1253 Crakehall was present at the deathbed and his account of the event was the basis for Matthew Paris' account in the Chronica majora. Crakehall served as Grosseteste's executor. Besides his service to the bishops of Lincoln, Crakehall corresponded with Adam Marsh and was one of Marsh's close friends. Crakehall was a canon of Lincoln Cathedral sometime after 1233 or 1234. He was ordained a subdeacon sometime before April 1235. He also acquired a number of minor ecclesiastical offices by 1240 and in 1247 he was named rector of Eddlesborough in Bedfordshire (now in Buckinghamshire, although the parish church of St Mary remains in Bedfordshire). He was Archdeacon of Bedford by 18 November 1254 when he was named as such.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3, Lincoln: Archdeacons: Bedford He was also a prebendary of Rugmere in the Diocese of London, where he was installed sometime in February 1259. He was ousted from the Rugmere prebend when the papacy appointed another clergyman to the prebendary.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 1, St. Paul's, London: Prebendaries: Rugmere Crakehall was appointed Treasurer of England on 2 November 1258. He owed his appointment to the baronial council that was formed under Simon de Montfort, which had recently taken power from the king's hands. As treasurer Crakehall worked to implement the reforms laid out in the Provisions of Westminster of 1259, including revamping the records of the exchequer. He also worked to improve the stability of the royal revenues and during his time in office there was a small increase in the proceeds paid into the treasury. Crakehall died between 8 and 10 September 1260,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 103 in London. He was buried at Waltham Abbey. His death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral on 5 September. Although Crakehall was ordained in major orders, which normally required celibacy,Hamilton Religion in the Medieval West pp. 34‚Äì35 he had a daughter, Petronilla. Petronilla was married to Alan of Kingthrope. Petronilla and her husband inherited part of Crakehall's estate while the other part went to Crakehall's nephew, William of Cadeby.

Its hymn tune, Zahn No. 624, was adopted in several compositions. It was translated into English and is part of modern hymnals.  History  Hymn in 1691 W√ºrttemberg hymnal with soprano clef The text of the hymn has been attributed to Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, but this authorship is doubted, as the attribution appears only in prints from the late 17th century. In Thuringia and Saxony, the hymn was sung on Sundays after the minister had entered the pulpit to deliver the sermon. In a 1668 print, the 6th edition of Lutherisch Hand-B√ºchlein (Lutheran handbooklet) it is assigned to Trinity Sunday (Am Fest der heiligen Dreyfaltigkeit).  Text and translations  The hymn was translated into Swedish in 1695 by Johannes Gezelius, with the title \\"O Jesus Krist, dig till oss v√§nd\\". The hymn was translated in the 1722 Psalmodica Germanica of Johann Christian Jacobi as \\"Lord Christ, reveal thy holy Face\\".Text and melody, Psalmodica Germanica, 1722 Catherine Winkworth translated the hymn in 1863 as a communion song with the title \\"Lord Jesus Christ, be present now!\\" The English translations below are those of Jacobi. 1 Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend, dein‚Äô Heilgen Geist du zu uns send; mit Hilf und Gnad er uns regier und uns den Weg zur Wahrheit f√ºhr. 2 Tu auf den Mund zum Lobe dein, bereit das Herz zur Andacht fein, den Glauben mehr, st√§rk den Verstand, dass uns dein Nam werd wohlbekannt, 3 bis wir singen mit Gottes Heer: \\"Heilig, heilig ist Gott der Herr!\\" und schauen dich von Angesicht in ewger Freud und selgem Licht. 4 Ehr sei dem Vater und dem Sohn, dem Heilgen Geist in einem Thron; der Heiligen Dreieinigkeit sei Lob und Preis in Ewigkeit. Lord Christ, reveal thy holy Face, And send the Spirit of thy Grace, To fill our Hearts with fervent Zeal To learn thy Truth, and do thy Will. Lord, lead us in thy holy Ways, And teach our Lips to tell thy Praise, Increase our Faith, and raise the same To taste the Sweetness of thy Name. Till we with Angels join to sing Th'eternal Praise of Thee, our King; Till we shall see Thee Face to Face, And all the Glories of thy Grace. To God the Father, God the Son, And God the Spirit, Three in One, Be Honour, Praise, and Glory giv'n, By all on Earth, and all in Heav'n.  Musical settings  Krebs In Weimar, Johann Sebastian Bach and his cousin Johann Gottfried Walther, who were the organists at the Schlosskirche and the Stadtkirche, both composed several settings of the hymn. Georg B√∂hm, Walther and Johann Ludwig Krebs all wrote chorale partitas and variations on the hymn: Krebs wrote a chorale fantasia Krebs-WV 524. Among the most notable settings by Bach are the chorale preludes BWV 632, from the Orgelb√ºchlein, and BWV 655, from the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes. There are further chorale preludes BWV 709, 726 and 749, with questions over the third's authenticity. Max Reger composed a chorale prelude as No. 9 of his 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67 in 1902. He also set it in 1914 as No. 11 of his 30 little chorale preludes for organ, Op. 135a.

It was the first film the team made together. The film was selected to the United States National Film Registry in 2016 as \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically‚Äù significant. Plot The Beau Brummels, performed in a deadpan manner, opens with curtains parting to reveal Shaw and Lee standing next to each other wearing matching suits, bow ties, and hats. They begin by performing a parody of the song \\"Strolling Through the Park One Day,\\" in which they describe a woman with crossed eyes, knock-knees, flat feet, and a wig that's turning gray, before briefly singing in Yiddish. Then they slowly remove their hats, sing a song a capella, \\"Don't Forget to Breathe of Else You'll Die\\" giving advice (\\"Always eat when you are hungry, always drink when you are dry, go to bed when you are sleepy, but don't forget to breathe or else you'll die.\\"), and slowly replace their hats. The duo then continues by telling a series of jokes, such as: * \\"20 people under one umbrella and not one got wet.\\" \\"How's that?\\" \\"It wasn't raining.\\" * \\"I wasn't born, I'm a self-made man.\\" \\"Well, come around when you're finished.\\" In between jokes, the two occasionally begin speaking at the same time and turn to each other and say, \\"Huh?\\" The film ends with the duo singing a self- referential song (\\"This Is the Chorus\\") before breaking into a brief dance routine performed without background music. Throughout the film, Shaw & Lee sing and tell jokes in a monotone manner while standing still and facing the camera. Aside from the brief dance number at the end, taking off and replacing their hats, and bowing to the audience in the film's final moments, they only move to give each other confused looks. Availability The Vitaphone Project helped develop funding for a restoration of The Beau Brummels by the UCLA Film and Television Archive in the early 2000s. The Beau Brummels was included along with other Vitaphone shorts as part of the 80th anniversary DVD and the 2013 blu-ray releases of The Jazz Singer. A restored print of The Beau Brummels was screened at the Turner Classic Movies Classic Film Festival in 2016.

Background and education He was born in 1905 into a prominent family of Peranakan Chinese roots, part of the Cabang Atas or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. His great-grandfather, Phoa Tjeng Tjoan, served as Kapitein der Chinezen of Buitenzorg (now Bogor) from 1866 until 1878. This was a post in the colonial civil administration with political and legal jurisdiction over the local Chinese community. Phoa was styled 'Sia' from birth as the descendant of a Chinese officer. Phoa was also a great-nephew of the prominent community leader and landlord, Phoa Keng Hek Sia. The younger Phoa was educated at the Europeesche Lagere School (European lower school) in Garut, and at the Hogere Burgerschool (higher civic school) in Batavia. Both institutions admitted only the children of elite Europeans and a small number of select non-Europeans. Phoa subsequently studied at the Rechtshoogeschool (law school) in Batavia before continuing his education at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He graduated as a Meester in de rechten (‚ÄòMaster of Laws‚Äô) in 1925. Legal and political career Upon returning to Bandung in 1927, Phoa joined the legal practice of the leading Dutch lawyer C. W. Wormser. A year later in 1928, Phoa moved to Batavia in order to open his own law firm. Following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather and great-uncle, Phoa also went into politics. He was a vocal leader of the younger faction of Chung Hwa Hui (CHH), a centre-right political party seen by many as a mouthpiece of the Chinese establishment in colonial Indonesia. Phoa came into conflict with some of the policies of the older party leadership, represented by the senior parliamentarians H. H. Kan and Loa Sek Hie. Phoa resented his party leaders‚Äô pro-Dutch sympathies, and advocated Chinese neutrality in the Indonesian struggle for independence. Phoa even indicated his willingness to support Indonesian nationalism in the right set of circumstances. Following an open conflict in 1934 with H. H. Kan, over the latter's supposed dominance over CHH, Phoa resigned his membership of the party. He maintained, however, his political involvement. On May 8, 1939, Phoa was appointed by the Dutch authorities to the ‚ÄòVolksraad‚Äô (the colonial parliament of Indonesia), and took his seat as an independent member. After the Second World War, between 1946 and 1948, Phoa acted as a legal advisor and delegate of the Netherlands at the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in New York and Geneva. Newspaper proprietor Around the time of his move to Batavia in 1928, Phoa also became active in the burgeoning news media and public discourse of colonial Indonesia. In 1930, he acquired a daily newspaper, Perniagaan, whose name he changed to Siang Po. This was the beginning of Siang Po Printing Press, which would acquire or create more publications in due course. A year later, in 1931, Phoa's company bought another daily, Panorama, which had been founded by the writer and journalist Kwee Tek Hoay. After Phoa resigned from the CHH in 1934, his newspapers assumed an increasingly sympathetic tone towards the Indonesian nationalist movement. The editorial board of Panorama included such leading nationalists as Sanusi Pane, Amir Sjarifuddin and Mohammad Yamin, with the prominent journalist, Liem Koen Hian, as chief editor. Liem, as well as Saeroen, also contributed to Siang Po. In mid-1936, Liem, Pane, Sjarifuddin and Yamin founded yet another daily, Kebangoenan, which Siang Po Printing Press likewise printed. Phoa was also the owner of two further publications, the magazines Si Pao and Kong Hwa Po, the last of which was similarly under Liem's editorial oversight. Personal life Phoa was married Laura Charlotte Ongkiehong, daughter of the Ambon- based newspaper owner and magnate, Ong Kie Hong, and granddaughter of Njio Tek Liem, Luitenant der Chinezen of Ambon ('Lieutenant of the Chinese'). Together with his family, Phoa later moved to Switzerland, where he spent the remainder of his life.

The acronym CPO originally stands for the abbreviation of Code of PLM Openness. Openness is a capability provided by an IT system, and it is characterized by interoperability, portability and extensibility. These capabilities are implemented using IT interfaces, standards and the IT architecture. All these are technical aspects of openness, Openness is also based on non-technical aspects, which are related to the partnership between the involved partners (IT customers, IT vendors and/or IT service providers). The development of the CPO was inspired by the spirit of a \\"code of conduct\\". Thereby, the CPO goes far beyond the requirement to provide IT standards and related interfaces. It aims seamless connectivity and the easy integration of IT in networked IT- environments and therefore combines technological IT-requirements with those of IT customer and users. CPO a standard catalogue that defines measurable criteria (‚Äòshall‚Äô, ‚Äòshould‚Äô, ‚Äòmay‚Äô) for the following categories: interoperability, infrastructure, extensibility, interfaces, standards, architecture as well as partnership.  History  From July 2011 to February 2012 representatives of BMW, Daimler, Dassault Syst√®mes, IBM, Oracle, PTC, SAP, Siemens PLM Software, T-Systems and Volkswagen specified the first version of the CPO, which was publicly introduced by the CIO of BMW and Continental at a conference within the context of the CeBIT 2012.CIO of BMW and Continental introduce the CPO at CeBIT, 08 March 2012. In 2012 and 2013 the CPO was continuously enhanced. Since 2014 the internationalization as well as the industrial roll-out was driven forward actively. Companies like e.g. Airbus, Ford, Fuji Heavy Industries, Hino, Honda, Isuzu, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki, thyssenkrupp, Toyota, Volvo and Yamaha joined the initiative.CPO-Signees, 15 November 2018. Within the following, it became more and more clear that the CPO Criteria do not only serve the original target PLM, but also for assuring openness in IoT scenarios. Consequently, in April 2016 the German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Sigmar Gabriel, declared the patronage of the BMWi for the CPO: \\"The German industry relies on the fact, that smart products and services can be offered and applied globally. With regard to this, interoperability is the key. A certification assures trust with regard to the broad application of information and communication technology (ICT), removes technological barriers and boosts the power of the German economy.\\"  Certification  Together with the BMWi prostep ivip currently specifies the CPO-related certification procedure. Pilot-certifications have been conducted in 2017. Companies like CONWEAVER, HCL, PROSTEP, PTC and Siemens PLM were the first who received this certificate. In parallel, an accredited certification program is worked out together with the DAkkS. Additionally, related next steps on EU-levelOpenness in IoT / Industry 4.0, 01 January 2017. and in Japan (together with the METI) are planned.

He founded Waterloo Metal Stampings, the first company to manufacture music stands in Canada. Thiele also established the Waterloo Music Company, which produced sheet music used by bands across Canada. Actively involved in the local and national music community, Thiele was a founding member of the Ontario Amateur Bands Association and the Canadian Band Association, and was the driving force behind the nationally recognized Waterloo Band Festival. Biography Thiele with wife Louise (left) and daughter Carolyn (right). Thiele was born on November 17, 1884 in New York City. He was the son of third-generation German- American Elizabeth Kernig, who supported the family as a chef, and Helmut Thiele, a newly landed German immigrant. Thiele married his wife, Louise Freeman, at the age of 19. Their daughter, Carolyn, was born the following year in 1904. A trained, solo cornetist, Thiele performed with and directed several American bands. He founded his own band, the Thiele Concert Party, which featured his wife, who also played the cornet, and their daughter who played the saxophone. Louise and Carolyn also performed as part of circuit Chautauquas throughout the United States in order to supplement Thiele's income while he headed the Rumford, Maine city band as Musical Director. Life in Waterloo The Thiele family moved to Waterloo, Ontario in 1919 after Thiele accepted a position as the Director of the Waterloo Musical Society Band. He'd seen an advertisement for job in Billboard magazine and was hired on a trial basis. They moved to the region, in part, because of anti- German sentiment in the United States following World War I. While living in Waterloo Thiele founded two companies - Waterloo Metal Stampings and the Waterloo Music Company - employing as many as 150 employees at the height of their operation. Waterloo Metal Stampings began after Thiele took over a section of an industrial plant in Waterloo. Waterloo Metal Stampings produced a variety of music-based items including music stands, drums and cymbals, eventually introducing the production of office furniture. When it was founded in 1922, Waterloo Music Company sold and produced music for pianists working in silent film houses, later selling sheet music used by bands across the country. Thiele started the business in his home, relocating to an office after outgrowing the space. The Company went on to sell and repair musical instruments, as well as offer music lessons and educational resources. The Waterloo Music Company operated for the majority of its time at 3 Regina Street North in Waterloo. The business was relocated to the Tannery building at Joseph and Victoria streets in Kitchener, Ontario in 2011. The business was purchased by St. John's Music in 2004, who dropped the original name after the moving the business to Kitchener. The location closed after 92 years in operation in 2014. In 1924 Thiele founded the Ontario Bandsmen's Association, today the Ontario Amateur Bands Association, which oversaw band competitions at the Canadian National Exhibition. He served as president until 1948. Thiele was also a founding member of the Canadian Bandmasters' Association, established in 1931, serving as president from 1934 to 1935. The association, which evolved into the Canadian Band Association, held an annual Bandmasters' Instrumental Clinic in Waterloo aimed at improving the quality of band music across the country. Run at Thiele's expense, the events hosted international artists and attracted attendees from across North America. In addition to his band association work, Thiele served as the editor of Musical Canada from 1928-1933. Founded in 1906 by Edwin Parkhurst as The Violin, the monthly publication was a journal dedicated to musical themed news and commentary. Under Thiele's direction the journal's office was relocated to Waterloo from Toronto and began featuring sheet music copyrighted by the Waterloo Music Company. The final issue of the journal was released in February 1933. In 1944 Thiele played a role in founding the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony Orchestra, along with conductor Glenn Kruspe and percussionist Archie Bernhardt. Two years later Thiele started the Waterloo Music Camp for Boys, known as 'Bandberg', in nearby Bamberg, Ontario. Situated on 65 acres of land Thiele purchased in 1944, the camp was situated 12 miles west of Waterloo on the site of a sawmill that had been established in 1838. Concerned about the lack of instructional opportunities in small towns, Thiele's vision was to provide professional instruction to musically inclined boys who may otherwise have no access to musical training. The camp was dedicated to the memory of Canadian bandsmen who had fought and lost their lives during World War I and II. alt=Memorial for Thiele in Waterloo Park. Plaque reads: In memory of Prof. C.F. Thiele for his considerable contribution to band music in the City of Waterloo. Bandmaster Waterloo Music Society Band 1919-1951. Waterloo Band Festival Thiele started the Waterloo Band Festival in 1932. What would become an annual festival, was the result of a commemorative event to mark the Golden Jubilee of the Waterloo Musical Society. It was held in Waterloo Park making use of a bandstand donated by Joseph E. Seagram of Seagram Distilleries. It was one of only two bandstands in Ontario. The event featured fifteen bands and 80 solo performers making it, at the time, the largest music festival in the country. The festival ran from 1932‚Äì40 and 1946‚Äì58, going on hiatus during the early 1940s as a result of World War II. The festival was so popular that in 1950 Toronto Star journalist Augustus Bridle noted that it had made Waterloo \\"far more famous than \\"Berlin\\" used to be before W.W.I made the town Kitchener.\\" By 1953 the festival featured 60 bands and attracted more than 1,000 solo entries. Bands and solo performers from across Canada and the northern United States played over the course of the festival's run including Boston cornetist Walter Smith, New York saxophonist Sigmund Rascher and NBC Symphony Orchestra tuba player William Bell. Death Thiele died on February 3, 1954 at the Kitchener-Waterloo Hospital after being sick for most of the previous year. A funeral for Thiele was held on February 6, 1954 at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Kitchener with an address given by Reverend J.G. Mudock. Bands people from across Ontario and Quebec were in attendance and the Royal Canadian Air Force Training Command Band, Toronto performed following the service. He was entombed at the Woodland Cemetery Mausoleum. Following Thiele's death his personal library of band music was left to the Waterloo Musical Society. Waterloo Metal Stampings continued to operate eventually relocating to Manitou Drive in Kitchener, Ontario, under the name Waterloo Furniture Components. Legacy At the time of his death he was remembered for his contributions to the community by the Kitchener-Waterloo Record: \\"Mr. Thiele was not only a talented bandsman but he also was gifted as an organizer. He did much to improve the standard of band music in Canada. Mr. Thiele's demise has deprived Waterloo of a great booster and a valuable citizen\\". He was remembered in a similar light by composer and music conductor Howard Cable, who in 2016 referred to Thiele as a \\"hidden star\\" without whom Canadian music could not have attained its current status.

Its architecture resembles that of Novocherkassk Cathedral, but is much smaller in size. Church of the Intercession is a five-domed church with largest of them being at the centre. There is also a three-tiered bell tower at the church territory.  History  Church of the Intercession was founded in Sulinovsko-Kundrjuchensky khutor (present-day Kazachy village) in 1911. Its architect is unknown, but historians found out that many such churches were built on the Don land on projects of the famous architect Peter Semenovich Studenikin. The construction began in 1912, and was conducted under the supervision of ataman and honorary citizen Alexander Ivanovich Polyakov. First church building was erected at the expense of khutor community, and in 1913 the khutor administration allocated funds in the amount of 29,000 rubles for the completion of construction works and purchase of all the necessary accessories for clergy. In 1914, construction was finally completed. On December 10, 1914, the church was consecrated by Archbishop of Don and Novocherkassk Vladimir (Putyata). Church of the Intercession survived the October Revolution. Services were held there until its closure in 1935, and was opened only under the German occupation during World War II. Here was sent a priest ‚Äï a Greek who belonged to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The occupation authorities have tried to bring disunity to the Russian Orthodox Church, and, in this regard tried to pick up clergymen that didn't have any ties with Moscow. After the liberation of the town, services at the temple for some time had not been carried out, and resumed only in 1946, after the new appointment of a priest, and have not stopped until then. In 1980 the churched was redecorated. On January 15, 1981, the temple was recognized as a monument of history and culture of the USSR. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, on the decision of the Regional Council of December 17, 1992, the church was declared a monument of history and culture of the Russian Federation. In 2003, on the territory of the temple there was established a Sunday school. In 2010 in church began another great- scale restoration works.

Life  Eido, thought to have been a member of the noble von Colditz family, belonged to the cathedral chapter of Magdeburg. His appointment as bishop of Meissen in 992 was on the recommendation of Giselher, Archbishop of Magdeburg. Among the major events of his period of office was the dispute over the restoration of the bishopric of Merseburg, which had been abolished in 981 by the efforts of Giselher, and of its territories to the east of the Mulde which had fallen to the bishopric of Meissen. Eido was successful in retaining those territories for Meissen even after the restoration of the bishopric of Merseburg in 1004. Although measures had been taken in the court of Otto III to readjust the boundaries, they remained without effect. Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg, appointed in 1009, reported in Book 7 of his Chronicle that Eido died on 20 December 1015 while travelling through urbs Libzi: this is the first written reference to the town of Leipzig. His body was escorted by Hildeward, bishop of Zeitz, back to Meissen, where it was buried.  Literature  * Knut G√∂rich: Otto III. Romanus Saxonicus et Italicus (p. 171).

She has taken a special interest in the conjunction between the history and culture of both Iceland and Greenland, publishing widely on both, while also examining the relationship between the theatre and anthropology. Hastrup was president of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters from 2008 to 2016. Biography Born on 20 February 1948 in Copenhagen, Hastrup is one of the five daughters of the physician Bent Faurschou Hastrup (1922‚Äì85) and his wife Else Blinkenberg, an educator. After matriculating from Aarhus Cathedral School in 1965, she studied geography and biology at Aarhus University. She went on to study ethnography at Copenhagen University, receiving an M.Sc. in 1973. The following year, she was awarded the university's gold medal for researching the woman's place in anthropology. In 1968, she married her colleague Jan Ovesen, with whom she had four children. She moved with her children to Oxford University in 1974, embarking on a doctorate course which took her to Assam in India. She was unable to complete the assignment as the area was soon closed off to visitors as a result of political conflicts. She therefore decided to join the staff of Aarhus University in 1976, hoping to undertake field work in Iceland. She learnt Icelandic and studied the country's history, taking a special interest in the Middle Ages. With the agreement of Oxford, she wrote her thesis on Cultural Classification and History with Special Reference to Medieval Iceland (1979), earning a doctorate in 1980. The same year, her work led to the creation of historical anthropology as a new university subject in Denmark. In 1982, she travelled to Iceland where she spent half a year at the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies where she comprehensively researched Iceland's history from 1400 to 1800 for the first time, showing that the general decline over the period was a result of the Icelanders' own approach and own management rather than external factors as had previously been thought. She published her findings as Nature and Policy in Iceland 1400‚Äì1800 which ultimately earned her a second doctorate as dr.scient.soc or doctor of social sciences from the University of Copenhagen in 1990. She spent a further period carrying out field work on a farm and in a fishing village in Iceland, examining the relationship between the social history and cultural identity. Her work was documented in a trilogy covering Culture and History (1985), Nature and Policy (1990) and A Place Apart (1998). Hastrup also initiated a larger, two-year research project which led to the publication of Den nordiske verden (The Nordic World) in 1992. From 1985 to 1990, Hastrup was a professor of research at Aarhus University where her work focused on the relationship between the theatre and anthropology. This led to the partly auto-biographical play Talabot presented at Holsterbro's Odin Teatret and at other locations worldwide over a three-year period. In 1990, she was appointed professor at the University of Copenhagen where she continued her interest in theatre, arranging a large conference on theatre anthropology. In 1966, she travelled to England to research the history of the Shakespearean theatre tradition in collaboration with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Her interest in the relationship between human structures and the process of change resulted in her appointment as the first head of research at the Danish Centre for Human Rights in 1998. This, in turn, led to her presidency of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters from April 2008 to June 2016. More recently, from 2009 to 2014, Hastrup ran Waterworlds, a major European research project analysing social responses to climate change, followed by fieldwork in Greenland, where she researched the effects of the modern world on a small community of hunters. Awards Hastrup has received a number of awards including: *2010: Ebbe Munck Award for her biography of the polar explorer Knud Rasmussen *2012: Gad Rausing Award for outstanding humanitarian research from the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities Hastrup is a Fellow of the British Academy and a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Selected works Hastrup has published some 40 books including:   * References External links *Kirsten Blinkenberg Hastrup's profile at the University of Copenhagen *Performance of Talabot from mid-1990s by Odin Teatret 1948 births Living people Scientists from Copenhagen University of Copenhagen alumni University of Copenhagen faculty Danish anthropologists Danish women scientists Women anthropologists Danish non-fiction writers Danish women writers Danish women academics 21st-century Danish scientists 20th-century Danish scientists 20th-century women writers 21st-century women writers ","title":"Kirsten Hastrup"},{"id":"52819606","text":"Daniel D.

Though they had some competition success and set an unofficial lightplane duration record, only two were produced. Design and development The wooden, cantilever, two-spar wing of the U 7 was almost trapezoidal in plan, with sweep on the leading edge, out to ellipsoidal tips. It also thinned outwards in section with most of the taper on the upper surface, giving some anhedral. Short ailerons extended to the tips. The wing was mounted over the fuselage on six streamlined steel struts; two upright tripods ran from the forward spar to points on the upper and mid fuselage and two inverted V-struts joined the rear spar to the upper fuselage. When the U 7 first appeared in 1924 it was powered by a Douglas flat twin, mounted in a squared-off cowling with its cylinders exposed for cooling. By June 1924 this had been replaced by a Douglas flat twin. In the summer of 1925, one of the two U 7s built had a ABC Scorpion flat twin, similarly enclosed. Behind the engine the rectangular section fuselage was plywood covered, with an open cockpit under the wing. The Kolibri's tail was conventional, with a trapezoidal plan tailplane and elevators mounted on top of the fuselage and with a quadrantal fin and a rounded rudder that reached down to the keel. It had a very simple, fixed, tailskid undercarriage with the mainwheels on a short single axle held just below the fuselage underside, making the track narrow. thumb Operational history The U 7s took part in several contests. One of the earliest was the August 1924 Rh√∂n meeting for gliders and lightplanes. There were thirty of the latter, though several were motorised gliders rather than sports tourers. The weather was not good, with high winds, and the Kolibri, flown by Udet, was the only one of three powered aircraft to complete the round trip from the Wasserkuppe to Kissingen and back, thus winning first prize. In October 1924 Udet, again starting from the Wasserkuppe, flew the U 7 for 4 hr 39 min, an unofficial record for very light aircraft. There was no official recognition of this class of aircraft at the time. The two Kolibris, fitted with the engines used at the Rh√∂n, flew in the demanding \\"Round Germany Flight\\" which began on 9 June 1925. They were expected to do well but the ABC powered machine had to make two forced landings on the first day, resulting in some damage. Neither was amongst the small group from the lowest power class that completed enough circuits to be amongst the prizes; the winner was the Daimler L21.

He died in March 1953. Contributions in Constituent Assembly Prof. K.T. Shah was elected to the Constituent Assembly of India from Bihar and contributed immensely in the Constituent Assembly Debates. He was a member of Advisory Committee and Sub- Committee on Fundamental Rights. He made important interventions in the Constituent Assembly. Although several of his proposed amendments were rejected then, some of them were later adopted by later governments. * Shah made two attempts to get the word \\"secular\\" included in the Constitution but failed on both the occasions. He moved yet another amendment that India, being a secular state, should have nothing to do with any religion, creed and/or profession of faith and would be totally detached in all matters of religion. * Shah envisioned a greater role for judiciary in providing social transformation. In a debate on November 19, 1948, he said that \\"[The judiciary] is the only authority that we are going to set up in the Constitution to give effect to whatever hopes and aspirations, ambitions and desires, we may have in making these laws and in laying down this Constitution.\\" * Shah wanted to include Secular, Federal and Socialist in Article 1 and moved amendments twice for the same, Dr. Ambedkar rejected both the amendments at the meeting of the Drafting Committee. * Shah stood for equality of states in the Union of States, so the following amendment was raised ‚Äî \\"India shall be Union of States which are equal inter se\\". This amendment was not passed but it was agreed upon that provinces and states shall be merged and given equal status but it was now was too soon for that to happen. * Shah suggested the formation of competent Boundary Commission, or any other body or authority to settle and decide boundary readjustments. He even suggested direct referendum to make required boundary changes. * Shah was in favor of the adoption of Presidential system of government. * Shah and H. V. Kamath proposed that ministers should be obligated to declare their interests, rights and properties before they assumed office. This proposal was aimed at curbing corruption in politics. Ambedkar, in his reply in the Constituent Assembly on December 31, 1948 said that mere disclosure was insufficient and that \\"we have a better sanction for the enforcement of the purity of administration, and that is public opinion as mobilised and focussed in the Legislative Assembly\\". Other Facts * He was a playwright and wrote Gujarati plays.http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1953_5/11/prof_k_t_shah.pdf * He was one of the members of the National Planning Committee which was set up in 1938 under the chairmanship of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru.

It was considered one of the U.S.'s most famous trees, and drew thousands of visitors annually. It was estimated to have been more than 1,000 years old, and measured in diameter; its exact age and height were not known. The tree was topped before 1859. It fell and shattered during a storm on January 8, 2017.  History  c. 1860‚Äì1880, before the tunnel was opened further The Pioneer Cabin Tree got its name from its distinctively hollow trunk, partially burnt by lightning strikes and forest fire. It had small compartments as in a log cabin, with the tree's burnt core as a chimney, and a small opening as a backdoor. In 1857 it was noted that the \\"top half\\" of the tree was broken off at about 150 feet, and that the tree was hollow. A stereoscope image of the Pioneer Cabin with people and horse passing through (c. 1867‚Äì1899) In the early 1880s, a tunnel was cut through the compartments by a private land owner at the request of James Sperry, founder of the Murphys Hotel, so that tourists could pass through it. The tree was chosen in part because of the large forest fire scar. The Pioneer Cabin Tree emulated the tunnel carved into Yosemite's Wawona Tree, and was intended to compete with it for tourists. Since the 1880s and for more than 50 years, visitor graffiti was encouraged, but this practice was prohibited in the 1930s. At first only pedestrians were allowed to pass through the tree. Later, for many years, automobiles drove through it as part of the \\"Big Trees Trail\\". It was one of several drive-through trees in California. Subsequently, only hikers were allowed to pass through the tree's tunnel as part of the North Grove Loop hiking trail.  Fall  The Pioneer Cabin Tree fell during a rain storm and flooding on January 8, 2017. It was the strongest storm to hit the area in over a decade. The flooding, combined with the shallow root system of giant sequoias, likely caused it to fall. A park volunteer reported that the tree had been weakening, becoming brittle and leaning to one side for several years, with only a single branch remaining alive. It had been weakened by the severe damage caused by the tunnel carved through its trunk. The tree shattered on impact with the ground. After the fall of the tree the park trail closed for a cleanup operation. Some sections of the tree remained intact, but the park's preservation policy prevented them from being cut up, for example to determine the tree's exact age. At least one observer suggested that the tree fell victim to the profit motive and greed, not just a storm. It was one of several trees that were mutilated to promote tourism. California State Parks supervising ranger Tony Tealdi said that today the hollowing out of a tree would not be permitted. Drive-through and other noted trees This was one of several trees that were hollowed out for the amusement of tourists. A stereoscope image of the Pioneer Cabin and Pluto's Chimney (left in the distance) (c. 1864‚Äì1874) The two giant sequoia drive-through trees have both fallen: *Wawona Tree, in Mariposa Grove, Yosemite National Park, fell in 1969. *Pioneer Cabin Tree, in Calaveras Big Trees State Park, fell in 2017. Two walk-through giant sequoia tunnel trees still stand: *California tunnel tree in Mariposa Grove, Yosemite National Park *A dead tunnel tree in Tuolumne Grove, Yosemite National Park Two others have edifices carved within: *Hercules Tree in Mountain Home State Forest has a room carved into it, and it is still alive. *Tharp's Log in Sequoia National Park Giant Forest, a fire- hollowed fallen giant, was utilized as part of a cattleman's cabin. Tunnel Log is a fallen giant sequoia tree in Sequoia National Park. The tree, which measured 275 feet (84 m) tall and 21 feet (6.4 m) in diameter, fell across a park road in 1937 due to natural causes. The following year, a crew cut an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall, 17-foot (5.2 m) wide tunnel through the trunk, making the road passable again. There are three coast redwood trees that can be driven through near US 101 in northern California, namely: Klamath Tour Thru Tree; Shrine Drive-Thru Tree; and Chandelier Tree. The loss of the Pioneer Cabin Tree occasioned an encomium to other important trees that still remain.

Plot The book relates an imagined conference arranged by a multi-millionaire, Francis Carey, to discuss Empire. The guests are contemporary figures from the upper and professional classes, nine men and nine women who have in common superb articulateness, wide experience, and an interest in understanding how Empire might be a positive influence. Buchan uses the opportunity to set out a variety of views on political and social issues, and to play devil's advocate.  Critical reception David Daniell, in The Interpreter's House (1975), called the work \\"an extraordinary book, like nothing else\\". It is mostly serious discussion, but there is also a lot of fun especially in the portrait of Lady Flora Brume, based upon the real- life Susan Grosvenor who was later to become Buchan's wife. Writing for The John Buchan Society website in 2002, Edwin Lee noted that while the book has some aspects of a novel it is not a novel in the ordinary sense of the word. Rather, he suggested, Buchan is using the imagined conference, via the utterances of his characters, as a means of defending the ideals and practical benefits of Empire. In his 2009 essay John Buchan and the South African War Michael Redley noted that the book drew on Buchan's South African experiences. The author's intention \\"was to rescue [Lord] Milner's best ideas from the wreckage of his South African policy when British politics lurched to the left in January 1906\\". Andrew Lownie, in his 2013 biography John Buchan: The Presbyterian Cavalier, suggested that while the attitudes appearing in the book may appear patronising to a late 20th-century reader, Buchan ‚Äúshows himself to be far in advance of many of his contemporaries with his view of the empowerment of the individual and the Empire as a liberalising force for good‚Äù.

The conditional joke is one of two main categories of jokes, according to Ted Cohen; the main one being a universal joke, which does not require familiarity with the hermetic language of a conditional joke. The conditional, or hermetic jokes, often depend on the internalized negative stereotypes held by the audience toward a targeted group of people. Such affective disposition can also explain the persistence of ethnic jokes in multicultural societies. Although they can be understood by many, the conditional jokes usually don't make ridiculed individuals laugh at the punch line. The most common type of conditional jokes, which target the jargon and all topics specific to professions and occupations, include the doctor jokes (surgeons, internists, psychiatrists, etc.), the lawyers and politicians, musicians, and the rabbi jokes among many. Other hermetic jokes which target ethnicity include Polish jokes made in the US, Irish jokes made in England, Ukrainian jokes made in Russia, Newfie jokes made in Canada, Sardarji jokes made in India, Russian jokes about ethnicities, Texas jokes, Jewish jokes made by non-Jews, the Black people jokes, and numerous others.

The tonic quickly became a best seller, and the line of Sutherland Sisters hair products expanded to include a scalp cleanser, brushes and combs, and \\"Hair Colorators.\\" In addition to wholesaling their products to retail stores, they also made public appearances at retail outlets, and maintained several outlets of their own -- \\"parlors\\" where customers could consult with a salesperson and make purchases -- including one in New York City.

The Sutherlands resided in a mansion they built in Warrens Corners, New York, which burned down in 1938.

Located close to the old harbour, it is likely the best-known neighbourhood of the old town of Genoa.  Etymology  Pr√® takes its name from the Latin word pr√¶dia (fields), because in origin this was a rural zone.

The neighbourhood occupies the semi-plain area between the port and the rear hill. The central and most characteristic area of the neighborhood is that of Via Pr√® and Via del Campo, with its narrow alleys (the typical Genoese \\"caruggi\\"), upstream of which is Via Balbi with its noble palaces. History The first settlements in the area date back to the second half of 12th century, when outside of the \\"Saint Faith Gate\\" (now called \\"Vacca's Gate\\") of the \\"Barbarossa\\" walls some buildings were built to assist travelers along the road leading from the city to the west. Included were several hospitals, founded by religious orders to offer accommodation and assistance to Crusaders, pilgrims, and merchants who were traveling from the port of Genoa to the Holy Land and the East. The best known of these was the Commandery of St. John of Pr√®, of the Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, or Knights Hospitaller, built in 1180.Corinna Praga, \\"A proposito di antica viabilit√† genovese\\" (\\"About ancient Genoese roads\\"), 2008 Fratelli Frilli Editori In the same period, dockyards for repairing ships were built in the near port, in the same place where two centuries later would be established the main base of the Genoese Navy.Touring Club Italiano, Guida d'Italia ‚Äì Liguria, Milan, 2009 This first port terminal gave an economic boost to the development of the neighbourhood. In 1347, the whole neighborhood was enclosed into the city walls, by building a new section of walls on the north-west side. During the 17th century the noble families of Balbi and Durazzo built, upstream the neighbourhood some luxurious palaces along a new wide street, Strada Balbi. In the 19th century another important road was opened, Carlo Alberto road, suitable for transit of wagons coming to and from the port and in 1860 the Genoa Principe railway station was completed in the north west area of Pr√®.

Giovanni Battista and Giovanni Carlone made frescoes in the ceiling of the nave, aisles and transept. The Neoclassical fa√ßade, designed by Giovanni Battista Resasco in the 19th century, has a tall portico with six Ionic columns.

Tuesday, 14.03.1905 Page: 3 was a Manx lawyer, who was the First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls in the Isle of Man. He was also the first Manxman to become Attorney General of the Isle of Man. Biography Early life James Gell was born on 13 January 1823, the son of John Gell, of Kenna, in the parish of German, Isle of Man and Margaret (n√©e McHutchin) of Peel, Isle of Man. He was the second of three children, his brothers being John Gell (Jnr) and Captain Phillip Gell (1827-1898).http://www.isle-of- man.com/manxnotebook/famhist/families/awm1889/gill.htm Gell was educated at King William's College, Castletown, Isle of Man. Career Following his schooling, Gell was articled to Gilbert McHutchin (his uncle) at the Rolls Office. In 1845 he was called to the Manx Bar.Mona's Herald Wednesday, 15.03.1905 Page 7 After completing his articles Gell set up his own legal practice, becoming a highly sought-after advocate. His first official appointment was as High Bailiff of Castletown upon the death of John Kelly; he held this office from 1854-1866. In 1866 the office of Attorney General became vacant following the retirement of Charles Ogden. Until the appointment of Gell, this office had always been held by an English lawyer, the Crown being rather pronounced on this point, but at this juncture Governor Loch made determined efforts to secure the appointment of a Manxman, and made strong representations to the Home Office as to the advisability of appointing a Manx lawyer, Gell was eventually appointed, being the first Manxman selected for the office. From 1872 to 1881 he was Chairman of the island's Board of Education. In 1887 he was knighted by Queen Victoria, along with William Drinkwater. In 1895 Sir James Gell was elected as a Church Commissioner. After holding the office of Attorney General for 32 years, he was appointed First Deemster in 1898 upon the retirement of Sir William Drinkwater; and in 1900 he succeeded Sir Alured Dumbell as Clerk of the Rolls. On two separate occasions Sir James held the highest office open to a Manxman, that of Governor of the Isle of Man. The first instance was during the illness of Lord Henniker: Sir James was appointed Deputy and presided at Tynwald. The second instance was in 1902, during the interregnum between the death of Lord Henniker and the appointment of Lord Raglan. During the second period Sir James welcomed King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra to the island during their visit in August 1902,http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/iln/n300802.htm an occasion on which Sir James was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) by King Edward. Sir James was also present at the Coronation ceremony of King Edward VII. Whilst Sir James was appointed Deputy Governor in the first place, he was appointed Acting Governor in the second instance, an important distinction. The Duke of Athol was the last supreme Governor of Man, until the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 (also known as the Act of Revestment). All Governors since then had been Lieutenant Governors, but Sir James' appointment as Acting Governor was on a par with the position of the Duke of Athol, and he had the right to appoint a Lieutenant Governor had he so wished. Thus his office of Acting Governor carried with it greater authority than that of Lieutenant Governor; this fact Sir James himself pointed out to the Home Office. Other offices held by Sir James included: Chairman of the Insular Magistrates (to which office he succeeded in 1872 upon the death of William Callister), President of the Manx Law Society and Trustee of King William's College. It was said of Sir James that as a lawyer he had an unequalled knowledge of Manx law in all its intricacies. In addition he was a very thorough ecclesiastical lawyer and as a judge he presided over some of the most important cases concerning the Isle of Man in the early 20th century, not least of which was the Dumbell's Bank Scandal. Amongst his earlier cases he had experience as an advocate in the Bank of Mona failure and he was at one time standing counsel for the Isle of Man Railway Company and the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. He was also engaged as an advocate in several murder trials. Although a communicant of the Established Church, Sir James was renowned for his attitude to the Nonconformist conscience. A notable instance of this is when he introduced the Burial Act, which granted new privileges to Nonconformists; also an Act amending the law as to marriages in Nonconformist places of worship. He took an interest in legal publications, and was editor of Statute Laws of the Isle of Man, 1836-1848, and of the revised edition of 1895. He edited Vol. 1 of Deemster Parr's Abstract Law of the Isle of Man; and also compiled a memorandum on the Tithe Question. Personal life Sir James Gell is said to have lived a quiet life. A deeply religious man, in 1850 he married Amelia Marcia Gill, the daughter of the Reverend William Gill, the Vicar of Malew. The marriage produced six children. Sir James' second son, James Stowell Gell, followed his father into the legal profession, in turn becoming High Bailiff of Castletown and of Douglas. Another son, William, joined the priesthood, becoming Vicar of Pontefract, Yorkshire. Lady Gell died in 1899; Sir James was also pre-deceased by two of his children (John Gell and Hugh Gell).http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq21086.htm Sir James was said to have been an ardent defender of the rights of the Manx people and a tenacious supporter of the Manx Home Rule Constitution. Death Until his death it was said that Sir James had enjoyed good health. He would rise early each morning and complete a large amount of correspondence before his breakfast. In mid-February 1905, Sir James had been confined to his home due to suffering from a cold. However he made a full recovery and took his seat on the bench of the Chancery Division on Wednesday 1 March. Sir James was in attendance, as a guest of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, for the launch of the steamer Viking at Newcastle upon Tyne on 9 March, after which he returned to the Isle of Man. On Sunday 12 March 1905, Sir James attended divine service at the church of St Mary's on the Harbour, Castletown, taking his seat in his family pew, along with his daughter Amy. Whilst at prayer Sir James was noticed to slump over to one side. He passed away peacefully, the cause of death was given as heart failure. Funeral Sir James Gell's funeral took place on Thursday 16 March 1905.Ramsey Courier Friday, 17.03.1905 Page 4 A special train, hauled by two locomotives, was required to transport people from all over the island to attend the service. Amongst those present at the service were the Island's Lieutenant Governor, Lord Raglan; the Lord Bishop of Sodor and Man; Deemster Kneen; Deemster Moore; the Vicar General of the Isle of Man; the Attorney General, the Speaker of the House of Keys and other members of the House of Keys. Following the service the body was interred in the family vault at Malew Parish Churchyard.

The general trend is that more established Chinese populations in the Western world and in many regions of Asia have Cantonese as either the dominant variety or as a common community vernacular, while Mandarin is much more prevalent among new arrivals, making it increasingly common in many Chinatowns, though still not dominant.West (2010), pp. 289-90 Southeast Asia Within Southeast Asia, Hokkien and Cantonese has traditionally served as the lingua francas amongst ethnic Chinese across most of the region and within many of its nations. However, the language situation of these communities can vary greatly amongst neighboring nations or even within. Myanmar Although the Burmese Chinese (or Chinese Burmese) officially make up three percent of the population, the actual figure is believed to be much higher. Among the under-counted Chinese populations are: those of mixed background; those that have registered themselves as ethnic Bamar to escape discrimination; illegal Chinese immigrants that have flooded Upper Burma since the 1990s (up to 2 million by some estimates) but are not counted due to the lack of reliable census taking. The Burmese Chinese dominate the Burmese economy today. They also have a very large presence in Burmese higher education, and make up a high percentage of the educated class in Burma. Most Burmese Chinese speak Burmese as their parent tongue. Those with higher education also speak Mandarin and/or English. The use of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties still prevails. Hokkien (a Southern Min dialect) is mostly used in Yangon as well as in Lower Burma, while Taishanese (a Yue language akin to Cantonese) and Yunnanese Mandarin are well preserved in Upper Burma. Vietnam Ethnic Chinese in Vietnam are categorized into three groups that are based on migrant history, location and level of integration. The largest group is the Hoa, numbering almost a million individuals and have historically been influential in Vietnamese society and economy. They are largely concentrated in major cities of the former South Vietnam (especially in Ho Chi Minh City) and largely speak Cantonese, with Teochew being found among a significant minority.Khanh (1993), p. 31 The two smaller Chinese-speaking groups consist of the San Diu and Ng√°i. The San Diu number over 100,000 and are concentrated in the mountains of northern Vietnam. They actually trace their origins to Yao people rather than Han Chinese, but nevertheless have been heavily influenced by Chinese culture and speak a variant of Cantonese. Meanwhile, the Ng√°i are concentrated in rural areas of Central Vietnam and number around 1,000. They speak Hakka natively and use Cantonese to communicate with Hoa communities. Cambodia A 2013 census estimated there to be 15,000 ethnic Chinese in Cambodia. However, Chinese community organizations have estimated that up to around 7% of the population may have Chinese ancestry. Chinese Cambodians have historically played important economic and political roles in the country and are still often overrepresented in Cambodian commerce. As a vast majority of the group emigrated from Cambodia following the Khmer Rouge, the community has assimilated greatly into Cambodian society and many now speak Khmer as their main language. Over three-fourths of Chinese Cambodians belong to the Teochew group, which is also the most commonly spoken Chinese variety. The other two largest groups include Hokkien and Hainanese. Cantonese formed the largest group from the 17th to the mid-20th century, but form only a minority today and are concentrated in major urban centers, especially in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Nevertheless, Cantonese continues to serve as the common community language among most Chinese Cambodians.Willmott (1967), p. 104 - Table A: Chinese Urban Population in Cambodia by province and language group In Chinese-language schools, either Cantonese and Mandarin are taught, depending on which school. Laos Among the small ethnic Chinese community of Laos, Teochew and Cantonese are the two most spoken Chinese varieties. Ethnic Chinese living on the border with China speak Southwestern Mandarin. Thailand Although Thailand is home to the largest Overseas Chinese community in Southeast Asia, the level of integration is also the highest and most Thai Chinese today speak Thai as their native or main language. Most ethnic Chinese live in major cities such as Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Chumphon, Ratchaburi, Chon Buri, Hat Yai and Nakhon Sawan, with Chinatowns in these cities still featuring signage in both Chinese and Thai. As of the 2000s, only a little over 2% (200,000) of Thai Chinese still speak a variant of Chinese at home. A little over half speak Teochew, the largest variant group, followed by Hakka, Hokkien, Hainanese, Cantonese and Shanghainese. In commerce, Teochew, Cantonese and Thai are used as common languages and Chinese-language schools often use Cantonese as the medium of instruction due to its lingua franca status among most ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia.Tong, Chee Kiong. Alternate Identities: The Chinese of Contemporary Thailand, 2001, BRILL, p. 21-25. Singapore Singapore has an ethnic Chinese majority population, with Mandarin recognized as one of its official languages. The Singaporean Chinese community do not consider themselves as 'overseas Chinese' but rather as 'Singaporean Chinese', with an emphasis on their national identification and distinct culture. Furthermore, simplified Chinese characters are used in contrast to other overseas Chinese communities, which almost exclusively use traditional Chinese characters. Although the majority of ethnic Chinese in Singapore are predominantly of Hokkien descent and Hokkien has historically been the most spoken Chinese variety, the government of Singapore discourages the usage of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties through the Speak Mandarin Campaign (SMC).Profile of the Singapore Chinese Dialect Groups Lee, Edward Eu Fah. Singapore Department of Statistics, 2000 The Singaporean government also actively promotes English as the common language of the multiracial society of Singapore, with younger Chinese Singaporeans being mostly bilingual in Mandarin and English, while the older generations speak other Chinese varieties. Under the SMC policy, all nationally produced non-Mandarin Chinese TV and radio programs were stopped after 1979. Additionally, Hong Kong (Cantonese) and Taiwanese (Hokkien) dramas are unavailable in their original languages on non-cable TV. Nevertheless, since the government restriction on non-Mandarin media was relaxed in the mid-1990s, these media have become available once on again on cable TV and sold in stores. However, only Cantonese seems to have benefited from this uplift, thanks to a large following of Hong Kong popular culture, such as television dramas, cinema and Cantopop. Brunei A number of Chinese variants are spoken in Brunei. Hokkien, Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese are the most commonly spoken varieties in the nation. Malaysia Malaysia is the only country besides Mainland China and Taiwan that has a complete Chinese education system, from primary schools to universities.\\"\\" Malaysian Chinese speak a wide variety of variants, which are concentrated around particular population centers. Hokkien, the largest Chinese group, is concentrated in Penang, Klang, Kelantan and Malacca, with Penang having its own Hokkien variety. Cantonese is centered on Kuala Lumpur, Seremban, Kuantan and Ipoh, with Hakka minorities also scattered in some states. Meanwhile, in East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo), Southern Min (Hokkien and Teochew), Hakka and Mandarin are found except in Sibu, where Fuzhounese (a language of Eastern Min) is predominant, and in Sabah's Sandakan town, where Cantonese and Hakka are both widely spoken.Astro AEC, Behind the Dialect Groups, Year 2012 Regardless of location, however, younger generations are educated in the Malaysian standard of Mandarin at Chinese-language schools. Also, most Chinese Malaysians can speak both Malaysian (the national language) and English, which is widely used in business and at tertiary level. Furthermore, Cantonese is understood by most Malaysian Chinese as it is the prevalent language used in local Chinese- language media, although many are unable to speak it fluently.Tze Wei Sim, Why are the Native Languages of the Chinese Malaysians in Decline. Journal of Taiwanese Vernacular, p. 75, 2012 Indonesia Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia had been subjected for decades to official, and at times discriminatory, assimilation policies. As a result, a large number are no longer proficient in Chinese. Originally, the majority of the population emigrated from Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in Southern China, with the first wave of arrivals preceding the Dutch colonial period in the 1700s. The four recognized varieties of Chinese spoken by the Chinese Indonesian community are, ordered by number of speakers: Hokkien, Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Additionally, Teochew and Puxian Min are also found. Indonesia's 2010 census reported more than 2.8 million self-identified ethnic Chinese: 1.20 percent of the country's population.[1] However other source stated that there are about 10 to 12 million Chinese living in the nation, making up 5-6% of Indonesia population. Most of the Chinese resided in big cities and towns around east coast of Sumatra, north coast of Java and west coast of Kalimantan. The distribution of Chinese varieties are scattered throughout the archipelago. On North Sumatra, Riau, Riau Islands and Jambi, two varieties of Hokkien exist, Medan Hokkien and Riau Hokkien, which incorporate local and Indonesian vocabulary. Hakka is concentrated in Bangka-Belitung, South Sumatra, Jakarta and West Kalimantan where they form a significant part of the local population. Meanwhile, Pontianak to Ketapang, Kendawangan on the southern tip of West Kalimantan is populated by Teochew speakers. Cantonese and, more recently, Mandarin have been used in Chinese-language schools and both variants are found in major cities such as Jakarta, Medan, Batam and Surabaya, with Mandarin usage increasing with recent arrivals from China (especially in the north) and Taiwan, as well as Cantonese speakers originating from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong and Macau. Younger generations of Indonesian Chinese are generally fluent in Standard Indonesian, with some being fluent in English, local Chinese languages and even local native Austronesian languages (Javanese, Sundanese, etc.). Meanwhile, the older generations are only fluent in their native Chinese languages and Indonesian. Philippines Chinese Filipinos officially comprise 1.5% of the country's population, although demographic surveys from third parties find that 18-27% of the Philippine population have at least some Chinese ancestry, totalling up to 27 million people. Most Chinese Filipinos are trilingual, speaking a native Chinese variant, English, and a Philippine language, which is most often Tagalog or any Visayan language (e.g. Cebuano, Hiligaynon, etc.), but also Ilocano, Pangasinan and/or Kapampangan. Older Chinese Filipinos generally prefer to use a Chinese variant, whereas younger generations prefer to use either English or any native Philippine language, a result of the strong prohibition of Chinese- language education enacted during the martial law dictatorship of President Marcos (1972‚Äì1986). The most widely-spoken Chinese variety is Hokkien, specifically a branched-off local variant of it called Lan-nang-oe. Other Chinese varieties such as Teochew, Cantonese and Shanghainese are also spoken, albeit by a very tiny percentage. In contrast to much of Southeast Asia, the Chinese community of the Philippines does not use Cantonese as its preferred community language or as a principal lingua franca, but rather Philippine Hokkien, which is also spoken informally at schools and in business amongst Chinese Filipinos.Teresita Ang-See, \\"Chinese in the Philippines\\", 1997, Kaisa, pg. 57. In Chinese-language schools, a Philippine standard of Mandarin is taught, although most Chinese Filipinos do not speak it at home and do not attain the same level of fluency as those of Chinese peoples in China, Taiwan, Singapore and other overseas communities. Due to extensive albeit informal contacts with the Ministry of Education of the Taiwan (ROC) during 1950‚Äì1990, the traditional Chinese script as well as the bopomofo are still used, although these are gradually being eased out in favor of simplified Chinese characters and pinyin starting 2005, with Chinese-language textbooks increasingly imported from both mainland China and Singapore. As part of a recent trend, partly due to increased contacts with other overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Singapore, more Chinese Filipino families are now opting to use English as their first language at home. There is also a trend among some young Chinese-Filipinos to re-learn Hokkien, a result of increasing pride in being \\"ethnic Chinese\\" and the popularity of Taiwanese films and shows, which is associated with the rise of China in the 21st century. Despite the perceived widespread assimilation of the Chinese Filipinos into the general Philippine population, most still form part of a \\"Tsinoy\\" community where Chinese culture is celebrated and practiced. Despite the fact that not all Chinese Filipinos can fluently speak Hokkien or any other Chinese variant, most can still understand at least some degree of Hokkien. On the other hand, most Chinese Mestizos (called chhut-si-ia in Hokkien), or those who are of mixed Chinese and Filipino, Spanish, and/or American ancestry, tend to downplay their Chinese roots and invariably consider themselves Filipino. Most Chinese Mestizos speak any local Philippine language (i.e. Tagalog or Visayan) and/or English. North America Brooklyn Chinatowns (Â∏ÉÈ≤ÅÂÖãÊûóËèØÂü†) on Long Island, New York, US. Multiple Chinatowns in Manhattan (Á¥êÁ¥ÑËèØÂü†), Queens (Ê≥ïÊãâÁõõËèØÂü†), and Brooklyn are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, as large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York, with the largest metropolitan Chinese population outside Asia. Many overseas Chinese populations in North America speak some variety of Chinese. In the United States and Canada, Chinese is the third most spoken language. Yue dialects have historically been the most prevalent forms of Chinese due to immigrants being mostly from southern China from the 19th century up through the 1980s. However, Mandarin is becoming increasingly more prevalent due to the opening up of the PRC. In New York City in 2002, Mandarin was spoken as a native language by only 10% of Chinese speakers, but was used as an auxiliary language among the greatest number of them and was predicted to replace Cantonese as their lingua franca. Although Min Chinese or Fuzhounese, the majority of Min Chinese, is spoken natively by a third of the Chinese population there, it is not used as a lingua franca because speakers of other dialect groups do not learn Min. In Richmond (part of the Greater Vancouver metropolitan area in Canada), 55% of the population is Chinese. Chinese words can be seen everywhere from local banks to grocery stores. In the broader Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area, 18% of the population is Chinese. Similarly in Toronto, which is the largest city in Canada, Chinese people make up 11.4% of the local population with the higher percentages of between 20 and 50% in the suburbs of Markham, Richmond Hill and within the city's east end, Scarborough.Community Profiles from the 2006 Census - Vancouver CMA. Statistics Canada. Retrieved 2011-01-16. Cantonese and Mandarin are the most popular forms of Chinese spoken in the area.

History  Komo≈ôany was recorded in 1088 as \\"Comoraz\\", a settlement belonging to the Vy≈°ehrad Chapter. The name derives from komora (in the sense of royal or aristocratic property, rent or income), referring to the land on which the villagers dwelt. Other records indicate that the land (or parts of it) was owned by Wenceslas II (until 1304), the Scholastic Dobe≈° (until 1332), the Zbraslav monastery (until 1436), George of Podƒõbrady until 1470)) and V√°clav ≈†turm of Hyr≈°feldu (who added the title seat to the village, after 1589). In 1638 it became the property of the Zbraslav monastery. In 1785, however, the Zbraslav monastery was closed, and Komo≈ôany devolved to the secular trust, which sold the Komo≈ôany chateau, grounds and sheepfold to the Prince of Oettingen-Wallerstein 40 years later. In 1866, it was sold to an Albertan knight. In the meantime, the Komo≈ôany cadastral municipality was created, and in the 19th century, they formed a shared political community with Toƒçn√°. For that reason, in Mal√Ω Otto's dictionary of 1904, Komo≈ôany is listed simply as a chateau near the village of Toƒçn√°. Komo≈ôany became an independent community on May 20, 1957,.Pra≈æsk√Ω dopravn√≠ zemƒõpis II, 15th section, Mod≈ôany 1st part, DP Kontakt 7/2000 , Dopravn√≠ podnik hl. m.

At that time, Komo≈ôany had 1,107 residents and 133 residences. In the 1990 administrative reform of Prague's districts, Komo≈ôany became part of the district of Prague-Mod≈ôany, which was renamed Prague 12 in 1994. Geography View of Komorany from Chuchle The main thoroughfare through Komo≈ôany is Komo≈ôansk√° street. The unnamed square formed by Kysl√≠kov√°, Komo≈ôansk√° and Revoluce streets forms Komo≈ôany's natural center. However, that square, the Sigma Mod≈ôany industrial park, and the northeastern part of the Komo≈ôany housing estate all technically fall within Mod≈ôany's cadastral subdivision, despite being separated from Mod≈ôany by a wooded creek valley. The territory of Komo≈ôany is bounded on the west by the Vltava river's right bank. The Komo≈ôansk√° stream bisects the municipality, flowing into the Vltava. To the south, the unnamed creek which flows from Toƒçn√° separates Komo≈ôany from Z√°vist. This area has many cottages and garden plots, as does the area on the edge of the Mod≈ôany Gully park. The headquarters of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute is located in the south-eastern part of Komo≈ôany, next to the chateau and the ≈†abatka estate. In 2000, the estate was renovated into an equestrian center, which is now the home of the Epona Praha equestrian club.Jan Z√°gler: Na ≈†abatce v Praze, maj√≠ se konƒõ blaze, J√° m√°m konƒõ, srpen 2006 Railway line 210 passes through Komo≈ôany on the right bank of the Vltava, connecting Prague with Vran√© nad Vltavou. The Praha-Komo≈ôany railway station opened in 1997, replacing the nearby Prague-Mod≈ôany station, which had been closed to passenger traffic in 1991. A spur line to the Sigma Mod≈ôany industrial park carried passenger traffic during a brief period in 1995 while Komo≈ôansk√° street was under reconstruction. Komo≈ôany is served by bus lines 165 and 139, with some 165 buses continuing on to Z√°vist and Zbraslav. The southern part of Komo≈ôany is bisected by Prague's Outer Ring Road. The ring road crosses the Vltava river valley above grade - a structure known as the Radot√≠nsk√Ω Bridge. The east of the bridge lands in Komo≈ôany, where an unfinished intersection awaits the completion of the Komo≈ôany bypass, before continuing on into the east portal of the Komo≈ôany tunnel. There was a dispute over the partial construction of the intersection, fueled by controversy over construction of the bypass itself and irregularities in the building permits.http://www.prahamhd.vhd.cz/Draha/komorany.htm Pra≈æsk√© ≈æelezniƒçn√≠ stanice a zast√°vky ‚Äì Praha-Komo≈ôany, Spoleƒçnost pro ve≈ôejnou dopravu, prahamhd.vhd.czJakub D≈æurn√Ω: Pr≈Ømyslov√° historie Komo≈ôan, web Pos√°zavsk√Ω pacifik, aktualizace 9. 1. 2010 Photo gallery File:Okru≈æn√≠ str, Prague Komo≈ôany.jpgVillas on Okru≈æn√≠ street File:Na ≈†abatce str, Prague Komo≈ôany.jpgCzech Hydrometeorological Institute File:Do Kout≈Ø str, Prague Komo≈ôany.jpgAbandoned shopping centre (reconstructed in 2008) File:U Vleƒçky str2, Prague Komo≈ôany.jpgU Vleƒçky housing estate  References  *This article was initially translated from the Czech Wikipedia.

A Hurewicz space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers \\\\mathcal{U}_1, \\\\mathcal{U}_2, \\\\ldots of the space there are finite sets \\\\mathcal{F}_1 \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_1, \\\\mathcal{F}_2 \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_2, \\\\ldots such that every point of the space belongs to all but finitely many sets \\\\bigcup\\\\mathcal{F}_1, \\\\bigcup\\\\mathcal{F}_2,\\\\ldots .  History  In 1926, Witold Hurewicz introduced the above property of topological spaces that is formally stronger than the Menger property. He didn't know whether Menger's conjecture is true, and whether his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property, but he conjectured that in the class of metric spaces his property is equivalent to \\\\sigma-compactness.  Hurewicz's conjecture  Hurewicz conjectured that in ZFC every Hurewicz metric space is œÉ-compact. Just, Miller, Scheepers, and Szeptycki proved that Hurewicz's conjecture is false, by showing that there is, in ZFC, a set of real numbers that is Menger but not œÉ-compact. Their proof was dichotomic, and the set witnessing the failure of the conjecture heavily depends on whether a certain (undecidable) axiom holds or not. Bartoszy≈Ñski and Shelah (see also Tsaban's solution based on their work Boaz Tsaban (2011), 'Menger's and Hurewicz's Problems: Solutions from \\"The Book\\" and refinements', in \\"Set Theory and its Applications\\" Contemporary Mathematics 533, 211‚Äì226. https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5645 ) gave a uniform ZFC example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not œÉ-compact.  Hurewicz's problem  Hurewicz asked whether in ZFC his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property. In 2002, Chaber and Pol in unpublished note, using dichotomy proof, showed that there is a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not Menger. In 2008, Tsaban and Zdomskyy gave a uniform example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is Menger but not Hurewicz.  Characterizations   Combinatorial characterization  For subsets of the real line, the Hurewicz property can be characterized using continuous functions into the Baire space \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N}. For functions f,g\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N}, write f\\\\leq^* g if f(n)\\\\leq g(n) for all but finitely many natural numbers n. A subset A of \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N} is bounded if there is a function g\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N}such that f\\\\leq^* g for all functions f\\\\in A. A subset of \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N} is unbounded if it is not bounded. Hurewicz proved that a subset of the real line is Hurewicz iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is unbounded. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than the bounding number \\\\mathfrak{b} is Hurewicz.  Topological game characterization  Let X be a topological space. The Hurewicz game played on X is a game with two players Alice and Bob. 1st round: Alice chooses an open cover \\\\mathcal{U}_1 of X. Bob chooses a finite set \\\\mathcal{F}_1\\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_1. 2nd round: Alice chooses an open cover \\\\mathcal{U}_2 of X. Bob chooses a finite set \\\\mathcal{F}_2\\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_2. etc. If every point of the space X belongs to all but finitely many sets \\\\bigcup\\\\mathcal{F}_1, \\\\bigcup\\\\mathcal{F}_2,\\\\ldots , then Bob wins the Hurewicz game. Otherwise, Alice wins. A player has a winning strategy if he knows how to play in order to win the game (formally, a winning strategy is a function). A topological space is Hurewicz iff Alice has no winning strategy in the Hurewicz game played on this space.  G_\\\\delta-neighborhood characterization  A Tychonoff space X is Hurewicz iff for every compact space C containing the space X, and a G_\\\\delta subset G of C containing the space X, there is a \\\\sigma-compact set Y with X\\\\subset Y\\\\subset G.  Properties  * Every compact, and even œÉ-compact, space is Hurewicz. * Every Hurewicz space is a Menger space, and thus it is a Lindel√∂f space * Continuous image of a Hurewicz space is Hurewicz * The Hurewicz property is closed under taking F_\\\\sigma subsets * Hurewicz's property characterizes filters whose Mathias forcing notion does not add unbounded functions.

Archaeological investigations have found remains of 11th-century houses which would have been on the street. It was first recorded some time between 1120 and 1135, at which time it was known as a centre for coopers, from which its name derives. Over time, the market in Pavement spread onto the street. The south-western end of the street was widened in 1900, leading to the replacement of most Mediaeval buildings. From 1976, major Viking remains were found immediately south of the street, following the demolition of a cinema and confectionery factory. The site was then into the Coppergate Shopping Centre, opened in 1984. Layout and architecture View from the south-western end of the street The street runs north-east from the junction of Castlegate, Nessgate, King Street and Clifford Street, to end at the junction of Pavement, Piccadilly, Parliament Street and High Ousegate.

Ostensibly about railway logistics for the upcoming allied Spring offensive the majority of the conference was given over to a plan to bring British forces under overall French command. The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George was supportive of the proposal and arranged for the British war cabinet to approve it in advance of the conference, without the knowledge of senior British generals Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson. The latter were surprised when the proposal was presented by French General Robert Nivelle at the conference. The next day the two generals met with Lloyd George and threatened their resignations rather than implement the proposal. This led to the significant watering-down of the plan with greater freedom given to British commanders. The conference caused mistrust between the British civil and military chiefs and set back the cause of a unified allied command until Spring 1918, when the successful German Spring Offensive rendered it essential.  Background  General Nivelle in 1916 The conference of senior British and French political and military figures was arranged for 26 February 1917 to resolve issues in the co-ordination of railway logistics between the two armies in the lead up to a proposed Spring offensive. However, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George intended to use the opportunity to attempt to resolve what he saw as a lack of co-operation between the two armies. He had been persuaded of the need for this by French General Robert Nivelle during his visit to London in December 1916. Nivelle regarded British Field Marshal Douglas Haig's 1916 offensives (which included the Battle of the Somme) as wasteful and wished to bring both armies under a single command structure. Lloyd George, who was himself doubtful of Haig's competence, agreed with this view and set in place plans to bring the British Army under an overall French senior commander. The British Prime Minister had, in 1916, canvassed French General Ferdinand Foch for critical views of Haig and his superior Field Marshal Sir John French. Lloyd George arranged for the war cabinet to meet without the government military adviser Sir William Robertson ‚Äì a close ally of Haig - and the proposal was agreed. The cabinet's secretary, Maurice Hankey recalled that the plans \\"took my breath away\\".  Conference  The conference was attended by Lloyd George, Haig, Robertson, Nivelle, French Prime Minister Aristide Briand and French War Minister Hubert Lyautey. Railway logisticians attended the first part of the meeting but were quickly dismissed to allow the talks to turn to the question of command. Just prior to the conference Lloyd George had spent half an hour in private discussion with Briand in which he stated that he was willing for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF, the British Army in France and Belgium) to come under French command. Nivelle had been briefed to openly criticise Haig during the conference for his alleged failure to attack in support of French offensives. This gave Lloyd George an opening to request that Nivelle draw up proposals, for presentation later that evening, to improve the situation. Nivelle's plan would have brought operational, supply and administrative control of the BEF under French command from 1 March. There would have been no direct liaison between British commanders and their government, with all communications being via the French commander-in-chief. Haig would have been effectively supplanted as commander of British forces by a British chief of staff reporting to Nivelle. His role would have been reduced to that of following the orders of his superior and for administering army discipline which, for legal reasons, had to remain in British hands. The surprise revelation is said to have left Haig speechless and Robertson showing signs of having a fit. At the conclusion of the conference Haig signed his copy of the plans with the caveat \\"signed by me as a correct statement but not as approving the arrangement\\".  Subsequent events  General Robertson The next morning Lloyd George met with Haig and Robertson. He revealed to them that he had been aware of the plans and that they had already been approved by the war cabinet. Lloyd George instructed the generals to draw up a blueprint to implement the proposals by the next day. Haig and Robertson stated that the proposals would result in humiliation for the British Army and declared that they would prefer to be court martialed for disobeying orders rather than implement them. The two men threatened their resignations over the plans, an act which later caused Lloyd George to back down and allow concessions over the arrangement. Later that day Robertson confronted Nivelle over the plans. Nivelle claimed to have been surprised that Lloyd George had not consulted with the British generals before allowing the French to make their proposals. A follow-up conference in London led to the agreement of a watered-down version of the proposals with British troops only to follow the orders of their own commanders and for all communication from French forces to come via Haig. Haig would also have full freedom as to how to implement any orders from the French and have the right to appeal to the British government if he disagreed with them. The arrangement was set to expire at the conclusion of the Spring offensive. The blunt approach taken during the Calais Conference led to significant mistrust between the British generals and politicians and strained their working relationship to breaking point. The event led to significant set-backs in the implementation of a unified command for allied forces on the Western Front. This system, with General Foch appointed g√©n√©ralissime (commander-in-chief) of allied forces, was finally implemented as a response to significant German gains during the 1918 Spring Offensive.

The division was based in Lutsk in the years leading up to 1914. It fought in World War I and was demobilized in 1918.  History  The division was formed on 24 July 1806 as the 18th Infantry Division, one of four new divisions formed in an expansion of the army to control new regiments. It included the Tambov, Yakutsk, Nyslott, and Okhotsk Musketeer Regiments, all newly formed except for the Tambov Regiment, transferred from the 9th Infantry Division, in addition to the new 29th and 32nd Jaeger Regiments. The 18th was reorganized to include three brigades on 29 September 1809: the 1st with the Tambov and Yakutsk Musketeers, the 2nd with the Kostroma and Dnieper Musketeers, and the 3rd with the 28th and 32nd Jaegers. Its second or replacement battalions were assigned to the 4th Corps when corps were formed on 26 October 1810. The division was assigned the Konotop Recruit Depot when recruit depots were assigned to divisions on 16 March 1811, after musketeer regiments were redesignated as infantry earlier that year. The Vladimir and Aleksopol Infantry Regiments were transferred to it on 27 March from the 7th and 24th Divisions respectively, while its Yakutsk Infantry Regiment went to the 9th Division. The Aleksopol Regiment was soon transferred again, and by November the division organization remained the same as after the 1809 reorganization except that the Vladimir Regiment had replaced the Yakutsk in the 1st Brigade. As the army prepared for the 1812 French invasion of Russia, the division was assigned to the Third Reserve Army of Observation on 5 May, and became part of its Infantry Corps of General Sergei Kamensky by June. When the army again reorganized on 29 August 1814 after the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition, the division was part of the 7th Infantry Corps, which was assigned to the 2nd Army when the active forces were divided into two armies on 28 October. By October 1819 the division was reorganized to consist of the 1st Brigade with the Kazan and Vladimir Regiments, the 2nd with the Vyatka and Ufa Regiments, and the 3rd with the 36th and 32nd Jaegers. Though the division was one of the few divisions to retain its number during the renumbering of 20 May 1820, the Vyatka Regiment transferred to the 1st Brigade and replaced the Vladimir Regiment, the Perm Regiment replaced the Vyatka Regiment in the 2nd Brigade, and the 35th Jaegers replaced the 32nd in the 3rd Brigade. The third battalions of its regiments were assigned to the Kherson Military settlement by 1825. When the army was reorganized on 22 September 1829, it became part of the 5th Infantry Corps of the 1st Army with its 1st Brigade including the Kamchatka and Okhotsk Infantry, the 2nd the Yakutsk and Selenginsk Infantry, and the 3rd as before. It was renumbered as the 14th Infantry Division on 28 January 1833, with its 3rd Brigade of Jaegers disbanded and merged into the Kamchatka and Okhotsk Regiments, which were redesignated as Jaegers to form the 2nd Brigade; the 1st Brigade remained as before. The division would continue this structure for the rest of its existence, and gained its final title of the 11th Infantry Division on 26 April 1835. The division was based in Lutsk in the years leading up to 1914. It fought in World War I and was demobilized in 1918.

A Rothberger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers \\\\mathcal{U}_1, \\\\mathcal{U}_2, \\\\ldots of the space there are sets U_1 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}_1, U_2 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}_2, \\\\ldots such that the family \\\\\\\\{U_n:n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\\\\\} covers the space.  History  In 1938, Fritz Rothberger introduced his property known as C.  Characterizations   Combinatorial characterization  For subsets of the real line, the Rothberger property can be characterized using continuous functions into the Baire space \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N}. A subset A of \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N} is guessable if there is a function g\\\\in A such that the sets \\\\\\\\{n:f(n)=g(n)\\\\\\\\} are infinite for all functions f\\\\in A. A subset of the real line is Rothberger iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is guessable. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than \\\\mathrm{cov}(\\\\mathcal{M}) is Rothberger.  Topological game characterization  Let X be a topological space. The Rothberger game \\\\text{G}_1(\\\\mathbf{O},\\\\mathbf{O}) played on X is a game with two players Alice and Bob. 1st round: Alice chooses an open cover \\\\mathcal{U}_1 of X. Bob chooses a set U_1\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}_1. 2nd round: Alice chooses an open cover \\\\mathcal{U}_2 of X. Bob chooses a finite set U_2\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_2. etc. If the family \\\\\\\\{U_n:n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\\\\\} is a cover of the space X, then Bob wins the game \\\\text{G}_1(\\\\mathbf{O},\\\\mathbf{O}). Otherwise, Alice wins. A player has a winning strategy if he knows how to play in order to win the game \\\\text{G}_1(\\\\mathbf{O},\\\\mathbf{O}) (formally, a winning strategy is a function). * A topological space is Rothberger iff Alice has no winning strategy in the game \\\\text{G}_1(\\\\mathbf{O},\\\\mathbf{O}) played on this space. * Let X be a metric space. Bob has a winning strategy in the game \\\\text{G}_1(\\\\mathbf{O},\\\\mathbf{O}) played on the space X iff the space X is countable.

Prior to his arrest and conviction, Strecker was held in preventative detention in San Sebasti√°n prison in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. He is the first individual to be targeted for prosecution under Costa Rica's controversial new law, passed in 2012, that makes it illegal for a third party to profit on prostitution.  Early life David Strecker is a former softball pitcher who grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he is a member of the Minnesota Softball Hall of Fame. After retiring from his work as a construction contractor, Strecker relocated to Key West, Florida, where he began to make extended trips to various Latin American countries. Strecker later documented these trips in various written articles and photos on his CubaDave web site and Facebook and MySpace pages, where he provided information to readers about his experiences with prostitutes across Latin America. In a 2013 interview with the Miami New Times, Strecker admitted to being a sex addict, having slept with more than 2,500 women and taking part in prostitution in Cuba, Costa Rica, Colombia and the Dominican Republic, among other locations. A wall in his residence contained photos of women with which he had sexual relations more than 10 times. Arrest and trial Authorities in Costa Rica arrested Strecker on September 4, 2015 at Juan Santamar√≠a International Airport while he was attempting to return to the United States. Strecker was charged with promoting sex tourism in Costa Rica, a charged based upon a new 2012 law making it illegal to promote sex tourism. His arrest was precipitated by a complaint to Costa Rica's Organismo de Investigaci√≥n Judicial (OIJ) in August 2015 by the Fundaci√≥n Rehab, an NGO that combats human trafficking in Costa Rica. While the government was preparing its case against Strecker, he was held in preventive detention for 14 months, as he was deemed to be a flight risk. He was unaware a trial date had been set until the eve of the trial, from his public defender. Strecker maintained his innocence during the detention and through his trial, proclaiming himself to be a political prisoner. While he does not deny publishing images and articles about prostitution in Costa Rica, he claims that these articles did not actively promote sex tourism. He told the Florida Keys News that, ‚ÄúIn their mind, by me posting things or telling others how to safely do this, I‚Äôm promoting prostitution. There are lots of other things to do in Costa Rica. That part of it is only part of the trip, but they‚Äôre trying to make this look like that‚Äôs all my focus is.‚Äù. Strecker was unable to fund his own legal defense and, with the help of Dennis Eatmon, created a legal defense fund. According to his website CubaDave.com, Strecker was able to raise a total of $1500.00, and needed to raise an additional $1500.00 used to pay his legal expenses. Conviction In a trial that lasted only a week, on November 16, 2016 David Strecker became the first person convicted under Costa Rica‚Äôs new Sex Tourism Law. He was convicted by three judges in San Jos√©, Costa Rica by unanimous decision. Judge Vivian Obando berated Strecker during the sentencing hearing, telling him that his articles have done ‚Äúsocietal harm‚Äù to the country's external image. The evidence presented in the trial was principally derived from Strecker's own articles, photos, and various YouTube videos in which he described his sexual exploits. Strecker was sentenced to a five-year prison term for violating the 2012 law prohibiting the promotion of Costa Rica as a sexual tourism destination. Strecker was released on August 18, 2017 after having his conviction dismissed by an appellate court. On May 25th, 2017, an appellate court vacated the decision against David Strecker, citing fundamental flaws in Costa Rica's Law 9095 and serious flaws in the evidence presented in the case. The prosecution contested the decision. Mr. Strecker remained held in prison while awaiting the outcome of the prosecution's appeal. A.M. Costa Rica reported on August 18, 2017 that David Strecker has been acquitted and released.

He is the author of seventeen books including five novels and various works of shorter fiction, a play, two critical studies and a memoir, and he has contributed to twenty other books. His work has been translated, broadcast and anthologized, and taught at universities in France, Australia and Russia. Life and career John Herdman was born in Edinburgh and educated there at Merchiston Castle School, and then at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a double first in English in 1963 and afterwards did research in Scottish literature. At a later date he returned to Cambridge to study church history for a Diploma in Theology, and in 1988 was awarded his Cambridge Ph.D for his published critical work. In the late 1960s and 1970s he was much involved in Scottish nationalism, both political and literary, a period recalled in his memoirs Poets, Pubs, Polls and Pillar Boxes (Akros, 1999) and Another Country (Thirsty Books, 2013). He has held a Creative Writing Fellowship at Edinburgh University (1977‚Äì79), Hawthornden Writer‚Äôs Fellowships (1989 and 1995), and the William Soutar Fellowship in Perth (1990‚Äì91), and has been Writer in Residence at Champlain College, Trent University, Canada (1998). He has received two Scottish Arts Council Book Awards and four bursaries. He is married and lives in Edinburgh. Writing As a fiction writer, Herdman‚Äôs main publications have been Descent (1968), A Truth Lover (1973), Memoirs of my Aunt Minnie / Clapperton (1974), Pagan‚Äôs Pilgrimage (1978), Stories Short and Tall (1979), Imelda and Other Stories (1993), Ghostwriting (1995), Four Tales (2000), The Sinister Cabaret (2001), and My Wife‚Äôs Lovers (2007). A French edition of Imelda appeared in 2006. These works have been seen as continuing the tradition of James Hogg and R.L. Stevenson in Scottish fiction, but Herdman‚Äôs main affinities are perhaps with European writers of the nineteenth century and with Irish and European modernism. His fictions have a metaphysical flavour and a preoccupation with psychological duality, as well as strong elements of the surreal, the satirical and the grotesque. The books were widely commented upon in Scotland on publication, and studies of interest include Macdonald Daly‚Äôs introduction to Four Tales (Zoilus Press, 2000), Jean Berton‚Äôs articles on Ghostwriting in √âtudes √âcossaises nos. 8 and 9 (Universit√© de Stendhal-Grenoble 3, 2002 and 2003-4), and Ma√Øca Sanconie‚Äôs Postface to the French edition of Imelda (Quidam Editeur, 2006). Herdman has been interviewed by Macdonald Daly in Southfields six point one (1999), and by Isobel Murray and Bob Tait in Scottish Writers Talking 3 (John Donald, 2006). His plays Clapperton‚Äôs Day and Cruising were successfully produced on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1985 and 1997 respectively, the latter being published in 1997. As critic, Herdman has published Voice Without Restraint: Bob Dylan‚Äôs Lyrics and their Background (London and New York, 1982; Japanese translation, Tokyo, 1983), and The Double in Nineteenth Century Fiction (London, 1990, and New York, 1991), and contributed to various critical volumes on Scottish literary subjects. He has written very widely on modern and contemporary Scottish writers, including Hugh MacDiarmid, Sorley MacLean, David Lindsay, William Soutar, Fionn MacColla, Norman MacCaig, Tom Scott, Duncan Glen and D.M. Black. He edited two volumes of The Third Statistical Account of Scotland: Vol. 22 (The County of Berwick) (1992), and Vol. 28 (The County of Roxburgh) (1992). He is a past editor of Catalyst for the Scottish Viewpoint, and between 2004 and 2012 was co-editor (with Walter Perrie) of Fras and Fras Publications.

He decided to become an artist at an early age and, although he began by studying medicine, in 1869 he took classes at the State Drawing Academy in Graz with the landscape painter, Hermann von K√∂nigsbrunn.

He also made occasional trips to Italy and Belgium. He completed his studies in 1890 at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, with Gustav Sch√∂nleber, who acquainted him the Barbizon school of landscape painting. After that, he lived in Munich and Krems an der Donau. From 1907, he was a Professor of landscape and still-life painting at the Academy in Graz, where he was an exponent of the Viennese style known as \\"\\" (Mood Impressionism). He received numerous awards, including a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900). His memberships included the K√ºnstlerhaus Wien (from 1883) and the Hagenbund (from 1900). In 1927, shortly before his death, he was officially granted citizenship (B√ºrgerrechte) by the city of Graz.

Historical evidence According to the earliest surviving list of bishops of Mogontiacum (Mainz), Maximus was the second bishop of the city. That list derives from the 10th century Fuldaer Totenannalen, compiled between 919 and 923 under archbishop Heriger. Friedhelm J√ºrgensmeier: Das Bistum Mainz. Von der R√∂merzeit bis zum II. Vatikanischen Konzil. S. 14; Hans Werner Nopper, Die vorbonifatianischen Mainzer Bisch√∂fe, S. 49. It notes Maximus, as the successor to Aureus, probably martyred during the Hun campaign against the Burgundians in 436, which also affected Mogontiacum. On this hypothesis, Maximus could have acted as Aureus' successor as bishop from 436 onwards. Eugen Ewig argues that Maximus was also the last bishop of Mogontiacum during the Roman era, which ended with the Frankish takeover in 456. Eugen Ewig: Die √§ltesten Mainzer Patrozinien und die Fr√ºhgeschichte des Bistums Mainz. S. 160. Maximus' time as bishop was possibly followed by a vacancy, then by Sidonius as the first bishop of the Frankish era. Later versions of the list are composed of other bishops of Mainz (often historically unambiguous or only with vague dates assigned to them), and include Theonistus, after Aureus.

He died following a track accident at the Dudley Wood Stadium on Saturday August 20, 1966 in the final heat of the British League match against Sheffield Tigers. His off-track occupation was a plumber in his home town of Berriew, Powys, Wales. Career Born in Middletown, near Welshpool, Ivor Hughes started motorcycling with the local Clive Motorcycle Club, being a founder member, before turning to speedway with the purchase of a JAP machine at the end 1963 and after-the- meeting rides at Stoke. In 1964 with second-half outings at Cradley and Wolverhampton, he made his first team appearance riding for the Wolves in their match at Sunderland in June, winning his first ride and scoring 6 points. Three weeks later he made his Heathens debut at Dudley Wood. In 1965 he rode matches for both the Heathens and Exeter Falcons, having extended his speedway weekends by traveling down to Devon for the increased opportunities given by day-time track use prior to their Monday evening meetings. When the Heathens management realised his potential could be lost to them they offered Hughes a full contract and he completed the season with 12 team matches in the green & white of the Midlands club. In 1966, with a full commitment to breaking into the sport big time, the Welshman took out a bank loan to purchase a new ESO speedway machine plus the full kit of new leathers, boots and helmet, plus white gloves to complete his image make-over. Starting the season as reserve, he moved up into the team proper in May to partner his skipper Ivor Brown, and scored his first double figure result against Swindon, dropping one point to veteran Mike Broadbanks. He scored his first full maximum at the end of July and in the following meeting against Swedish visitors Vargarna ended the night by defeating the reigning World Champion, Bjorn Knutsson in the Scratch Race Final. The Welshman followed this with another double figure score in the next home match in August, again against Swindon. A week later he was unbeaten going into the final heat of the match against Sheffield Tigers when 3 of the 4 riders came down exiting the first bend. Ivor Hughes was hit from behind by an opponent's machinery, the skull injury he received proving fatal: he died 2 days later in the Dudley Guest Hospital, age 27. At his funeral in home town Berriew the church was full to overflowing, and over 160 wreaths lined the churchyard pathway. The congregation came from both the speedway world, - riders, promoters, officials and fans - , and the local community, to whom Ivor Hughes was known not only as their newly acclaimed speedway star but as goal-keeper of their Berriew football team. (He had played professionally for Leyton Orient, Stoke and several Welsh clubs in the preceding decade before turning to speedway.)

Pseudonyms under which she wrote included Georg Rehberg, Arnold Brand and Frida Lang. Life Family provenance and early years Frida Abramovna Ichak was born into a working class Jewish family in Marijampolƒó, a midsized multicultural town halfway between K√∂nigsberg and Vilnius, today in Lithuania but at that time in Congress Poland, part of the Russian Empire. Abraham Ichak, her father, had an office job. Frida was the eldest of her parents' nine recorded children. She attended an all-girls' school in nearby Kaunas and embarked on an apprenticeship in garment making, subsequently working in the same trade in order to help support the family. During this period one source describes her as an autodidact - finding time to educate herself outside and beyond the basic requirements for making clothes. Student years abroad In the first part of 1899 she enrolled as a student at the Philosophy Faculty of Z√ºrich University where she studied Philosophy, (or according to one moderately respectable source, Philology). She was a student at Z√ºrich between 1899 and 1903. It appears that she interrupted her studies in Z√ºrich for a term in 1900 so as to study Physics at Berlin University. It was at Z√ºrich that she received her doctorate in 1903 or 1906. Some sources, citing articles that she subsequently published, indicate a largely scientific focus for her university studies.German wikipedia cites various sources - none accessible online - in support of the contention that her studies were more concerned with science than with philosophy. Mostly these are essays and articles subsequently produced by Frida Ichak herself: * Frida Ichak: Aus dem Haushalte der Natur: (die Lehre von der Energie). Hillgers illustrierte Volksb√ºcher, Bd. 86, Berlin/ Leipzig 1907. * Frida Ichak: Optik. Hillgers illustrierte Volksb√ºcher, Bd. 100, Berlin/ Leipzig 1908. * Frida Ichak: Das Perpetuum mobile. Aus Natur und Geisteswelt, Bdch. 462, Leipzig/ Berlin 1914. * Georg Rehberg: Untersuchungen zum Durchbiegungsverhalten zweischichtiger Dentalgipsproben in Abh√§ngigkeit zur linearen Abbindeexpansion. Wissenschaft in Dissertationen; Bd. 51, Marburg 1995. The title of her doctoral dissertation implies a mathematical-scientific focus: \\"√úber die Ausnahmestellung der W√§rme unter den Energieformen\\" (loosely: \\"The exceptional properties of heat as a form of energy\\"). She managed, with difficulty, to finance her studies only by working, as before, in garment manufacturing. It was while a student in Z√ºrich that Frida Ichak first met, among other politically like-minded individuals, the exiled Russian political activist, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyano (Lenin). They would remain in touch. Politics and marriage Frida Ichak relocated in 1906, to Frankfurt where she joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). She moved again in 1908, to Berlin where she was politically active and worked as a Maths teacher. It was here that she met the Galician anarcho-communist expressionist writer Ludwig Rubiner. They married towards the end of 1911 while on a visit to London. Through her husband she came into contact with a circle of anarchist-artists. Very soon she was collaborating with her husband to produce translations of Russian novels, for instance those of Gogol. There is a lack of agreement between the sources as to where they were based for the next few years, but the Rubiners appear to have been living in Paris during 1913 and the first part of 1914, then relocating to Berlin. War erupted in July 1914 and by May 1915 they were living together in Z√ºrich: Switzerland was less directly affected by the fighting than the \\"great powers\\", Germany, Russia, Britain and France. The Rubiners were members of the \\"Zimmerwald\\" Leftwing group based in Z√ºrich, and close to the group's intellectually formidable leader, the Russian exile Lenin. During the war Frida Rubin and her husband continued to work as translators, their contributions including Tolstoy translations into German. Frida Rubiner also produced, in 1918, the first German language version of Lenin's State and Revolution. The Rubiners remained politically engaged during their wartime years in Switzerland. A surveillance report filed in 1918 by Swiss authorities and the German embassy refers to a belief on the part of the German General Staff that the Rubiners were the focus in Z√ºrich of a group \\"central to the international revolution\\". The same report described Frida Rubiner as a \\"rabid Bolshevik [who likes to disguise herself as] a poet's pussycat\\" (\\"rabiate Bolschewistin [die sich gern als] Dichtergattin [tarne]\\"). Their association with Lenin (by now creating revolution in St. Petersburg and then Moscow) had not gone unremarked. On the other hand, despite employing detectives, mail intercepts and house searches, the authorities in Z√ºrich failed to find compelling evidence against the Rubiners. Communist, revolutionary and widow In the Autumn of 1918 Frida Rubiner visited Vienna: her motives, according to her own reports, were more artistic than political, and she probably returned to Z√ºrich before the end of the year. Some (though not all) sources indicate that one or both of the Rubiners were expelled from Switzerland at the end of 1918. In February 1919 they returned to Berlin, and while Ludwig Rubiner took a job with a publishing house, his wife embarked on a trip to Kaunas and Vilnius to visit relatives in the war torn former western territories of the Russian empire. She (probably) participated - possibly without any \\"official mandate\\"  in the founding congress of the Communist International (Comintern) which took place in Moscow early in March 1919. She had certainly been an early member - some sources say one of the (many) co-founders earlier that year - of the Communist Party of Germany. Germany's military defeat was followed by a series of revolutions across the country, many drawing inspiration from the Russian revolution. Frida Rubiner participated in the briefly successful Munich Soviet (\\"Workers' state\\"). The precise nature and extent of her contribution remains unclear, but it is recorded that, adopting the name \\"Friedjung\\", she became a member of the soviet's propaganda committee. She was arrested and, after several months held in \\"Investigative custody\\", convicted of high treason and sentenced on 9 December 1919 to a twenty-one month jail term. In the event, like many others detained under similar circumstances, she was released much sooner, emerging from Stadelheim Prison early in 1920. Her husband died in a Berlin clinic during the night of 27/28 February 1920. One source states that Ludwig Rubiner died because of a lung disease that lasted six weeks, while another states simply that he died during an influenza epidemic. Their marriage had been childless. Journalist and party activist Between 1920 and 1922 Frida Rubiner lived in Vienna where she worked as a critic, correspondent and contributing editor for communist newspapers, notably the Vienna edition of Rote Fahne (Red Flag). Between 1922 and 1924 she was based in Moscow, working as a correspondent for the multi-lingual Marxist magazine Inprecor. During this time she was also a member of a Soviet Communist Party cell and sat on the influential Executive Committee of the Communist International. Meanwhile, beyond the world of political activism, by the early 1920s she had already translated into German works by the revolutionary communicators Trotsky, Bukharin and Radek.Wolfgang Leonhard: Die Revolution entl√§√üt ihre Kinder. Ullstein Verlag, , p. 254. In 1924 the party ordered her back to Germany where she took over as political editor of the Berlin based Rote Fahne (Red Flag) newspaper. A new \\"hard left\\" leadership under Ernst Th√§lmann had recently taken control of the party, and while this had led to defections and expulsions of members, this new party r√©gime, with its less critical view of the Soviet Union, was one with which Frida Rubiner herself was in closer sympathy. She remained at the Rote Fahne till 1927 and also, during these years, undertook various important party propaganda roles. She spent some time in Thuringia in order to lead a propaganda offensive against and the \\"Lenin League\\" (\\"Leninbund\\"). In 1925 Rubiner was a founding member of the \\"Working Community of Communist Authors\\" (\\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft kommunistischer Schriftsteller\\"). In 1928 she took over, briefly, as head of the National Party Academy, shortly before it relocated from Dresden to Fichtenau on the edge of Berlin. However, she left the post in summer 1929, and, at her own request, she returned to the Soviet Union. By November 1929 she at settled in Moscow. In the Soviet Union During the late summer of 1929 Rubiner undertook a river cruise, taking in the Volga and other river systems. A product of this adventure, published in 1930, was her book \\"The great river. An unromantic Volga journey\\" (\\"Der gro√üe Strom. Eine unromantische Wolgafahrt\\"). Between November 1929 and 1930 she was employed in the Academic Department of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in Moscow. Her work involved further translations into German of Lenin's writings. However, as she later recalled, the institute at that time was controlled by David Riazanov and a Menshevik-Trotskyite clique. The Soviet political leadership by this stage was increasingly divided between the backers of Stalin and those whom Stalin perceived - in many cases correctly - as potential rivals for power. As a backer of the Stalin faction Rubiner was necessarily engaged in what she later described as an active struggle (\\"einen aktiven Kampf\\") against the non- Stalinists still exercising influence at the institute. After a year the Communist Party Central Committee transferred her to the Central Committee administrative apparatus. Her job here, during 1931/32, is variously described as \\"instructor\\", \\"propagandist\\" or \\"head of political work among German workers\\". In 1932, at the grandly titled \\"first world congress\\" of the International Red Aid (IRH - workers' welfare) organisation, Rubiner was elected to a senior secretarial post with IRH, which she held between December 1932 and August 1933. Later she moved to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) where between 1932 (or 1933) and 1935 she headed up a department in the Press section. In the wake of the murder of Sergey Kirov at the end of 1934 the ECCI underwent a general \\"personnel purge\\", and Rubiner was the subject of a denunciation from a cell within the ECCI criticising her \\"insufficient vigilance\\", based on the assertion that she had numbered among her acquaintances ECCI colleagues identified as \\"enemies of the people\\". The reprimand was soon cancelled by the relevant Moscow Committee control commission. Through the Stalinist purges of the later 1930s, any surveillance to which Rubiner was subject seems to have been relatively benign. In 1936 she acquired Soviet citizenship. Between 1936 and 1939 Rubiner served as a press department chief in the Soviet Literature Agency, responsible for providing the \\"bourgeois foreign press\\" with material on the Soviet Union. From 1939 till 1941 she returned to work as a contributing editor, this time with the Moscow-based Publisher for Foreign Language Literature, as \\"German editor, Category 1 for Marxist Classics (Lenin/Stalin)\\", as she later identified the role. From a Soviet perspective, the Great Patriotic War (Second World War) between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany began only in June 1941. Between 1941 and 1945 Frida Rubiner worked in the political central administration of the Red Army as head of a re-education programme (\\"Umschulungsprogramm\\") for German prisoners of war. She was also involved in the Soviet sponsored National Committee for a Free Germany (\\"Nationalkomitee Freies Deutschland\\" / NKVD ), focusing on radio propaganda broadcasting. After the war ended, formally in May 1945, she remained initially in Moscow, working again with the Publisher for Foreign Language Literature and also, between July 1945 and January 1946, continuing her involvement with the NKVD. Also during 1945/46 she was teaching at a Communist Party school near Moscow. With the war over, a large area surrounding Berlin was administered as the Soviet occupation zone, where a group of committed communists who had spent the war in Moscow, carefully refining the planning for a postwar Germany, were by now preparing the ground for a new kind of German state. Two months after the contentious creation of a new kind of German Communist Party, the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), in June 1946 Frida Rubiner was ordered back to Germany, possibly at the request of the German communist leaders working with Walter Ulbricht in the Soviet zone of Germany. In the Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic Almost immediately on her return to Germany, in July 1946 Frida Rubiner was installed as Dean of the Faculty for Basic Questions of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism at the Party Central Committee's \\"Karl Marx\\" party academy in Berlin-Liebenwalde (relocated later to Berlin-Kleinmachnow). Her appointment combined both administrative and teaching duties. She also continued with her party journalism and translation work. At the start of 1948 she fell ill and returned, for a period, to Moscow, spending much of the ensuing year in Soviet hospitals. By the middle of February 1949 she was back in Germany where a couple of months later Leipzig University marked her seventieth birthday by awarding her an honorary doctorate. She returned to Moscow for medical treatment after being badly injured by a fall on the stairs, but by the time she died on 22 January 1952Hermann Weber Damals, als ich Wunderlich hie√ü.

He was one of the few Norwegian Jews who survived deportation to a concentration camp. He was son of Israel Leib Sachnowitz (born 31 March 1880 in Russia, died 1 December 1942 in Auschwitz, Poland) and Sara Sachnowitz (born 15 June 1882 in Riga, died 16 October 1939 in Larvik, Norway). Sachnowitz was one of 772 Jews to be deported to Auschwitz. He was arrested together with other men in the family on 26 October 1942. Sheriff Gran in Stokke arrested them and sent them to Berg concentration camp. The deportation to Germany happened on the German transport ship in November 1942. Only 34 of the deported Jews survived the stay in Auschwitz and the other concentration camps. Sachnowitz attended the death march from the camp in Buna on 18 January 1945, and they walked 80 km the first day. He estimated that his group consisted of up to 100,000 prisoners, most of whom died under the march. From Gliwice they were sent with train which went all over the present-day Czech republic and Austria and finally arrived in the camp at Dora at Nordhausen after approximately 10 days. The prisoners at Dora and Buchenwald worked in underground factories with building V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. Sachnowitz was a witness of the many bodies, which each only weighed 35‚Äì40 kg, which were burnt outside the camp in huge fires or sent to the crematorium at Buchenwald. From Dora Sachnowitz and his comrades were sent by foot to Bergen-Belsen. Sachnowitz was at the end of the war transferred to Bergen-Belsen, which was freed by British forces. Sachnowitz was the only surviving Norwegian in Bergen-Belsen and he was on 28 April 1945 evacuated together with other prisoners to a hospital in Eindhoven. From there he was sent to a hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, and received proper treatment. He lost his father, three sisters and four brothers in Auschwitz. His mother died when they were younger.

These games may or may not include additional microtransactions, or may sell additional content in the form of expansions instead of asking for an ongoing subscription fee. Microtransactions are becoming evermore entwined with the Buy-to-play revenue model as most recent games allow for some sort of additional purchase. For example, buy-to-play titles Mass Effect 3 and Dead Space 3 allow players to purchases extra content in the form of story expansions or special in-game gear. Buy-to-play can be contrasted with Free-to-play (F2P), where users are granted access to a fully functional game (usually with limitations), but must pay microtransactions to access additional content. Some studies have been completed on the success of the free-to-play revenue model and also gamers' perception of this method. The results of one study shows that players are often satisfied with purchases made in free-to-play games, however, they believe a lot of content is overpriced. The study also displayed that free-to-play game developers create restrictions in order to encourages more purchases. Pay-to-play (P2P) is a model in which a subscription payment is required on an ongoing basis, in order to use a service. When comparing the three revenue models, the free-to- play model is slowly rising in popularity as the buy-to-play and pay-to-play models are decreasing in relative popularity. This trend can be roughly shown by the amount of World of Warcraft subscribers over the years. Since 2011, the number of subscribers has been decreasing with the exception of a few small spikes. Overall, the buy-to-play model is sure to stick around for a long period of time as it remains one of the most popular methods of acquiring games, but trends point to it adopting some methods from the free-to-play and pay-to-play models. Game mechanics Buy-to-play games require a one time fee to install and play. Some games, such as ArenaNet's Guild Wars 2 uses in- game advertising or \\"Cash Shops\\" to provide income for buy-to-play games, which usually offset the subscription fee of a pay-to-play game.

It was fought by the British Royal Navy against French privateers who were supporting the Jacobite rebels. Background Following the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden on 16 April 1746, two French privateer ships, the Le Mars and the La Bellone arrived at Loch nan Uamh and anchored there on 30 April 1746. As they were privateers, their emblem was a black cockade which also happened to be the emblem of the British-Hanoverian supporters and as such the Jacobites on shore fired upon them. However, the privateers raised the French flag and the mistake was realized and sorted out. Le Mars was reluctant to unload her supplies (the Loch Arkaig treasure) as the British Navy was approaching and she took on board some escaping Jacobites including James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth and Sir Thomas Sheridan. The Skirmish On 2 May 1746 three British ships crept into the loch. As the British Government ships approached Captain Rouillee of the Le Mars decided to stay at anchor, but Captain Lorry of the La Bellone set sail. This allowed the Royal Navy's to give Le Mars a broadside at close quarters which caused great loss of life: Nearly a score of privateers were killed and according to eyewitnesses her decks were awash with blood. The crew panicked and had to be forced back to duty. The La Bellone and HMS Greyhound then attacked each other and the mast of the La Bellone was broken with a broadside. There was an attempt to board the La Bellone but she gave the Greyhound two broadsides. The Greyhound had to move out of range and this allowed Le Mars to set sail. tried to stop Le Mars but a volley from La Bellone disabled her. Le Mars was then led by La Bellone out to a bay at the head of Loch nan Uamh, where Le Mars started her repairs, and La Bellone engaged the British ships. Hundreds of spectators came to the shore to watch the battle, whom HMS Greyhound fired upon to try and stop them carrying away the gold and cargo that had been unloaded by the French ships. along with HMS Greyhound and HMS Terror tried to board the French ships, but Baltimore's captain sustained a head wound and her rigging was shattered. She also lost her anchor and two of her masts. The Baltimore then headed for The Minch to get help while the La Bellone hit the Greyhound's main mast and set fire to her hand grenades. The Le Mars was in a bad state having been hit six times above the water line, seven times below the water line and with three feet of water in her hold. Le Mars had also suffered 29 men killed and 85 men wounded. Aftermath The French ships escaped, but another French ship returned in September and successfully rescued the Jacobite leader Charles Edward Stuart who had been in hiding. Both French privateers were captured the following year by the Royal Navy.

High-throughput next-generation sequencing has become a popular technique in transcriptomics, which represent a snapshot of gene expression. In eukaryotes, making phylogenetic inferences using RNA is complicated by alternative splicing, which produces multiple transcripts from a single gene. As such, a variety of approaches may be used to improve phylogenetic inference using transcriptomic data obtained from RNA- Seq and processed using computational phylogenetics. Sequence acquisition There have been several transcriptomics technologies used to gather sequence information on transcriptomes. However the most widely used is RNA-Seq. RNA-Seq RNA reads may be obtained using a variety of RNA-seq methods. Public databases There are a number of public databases that contain freely available RNA-Seq data. Assembly Sequence assembly RNA-Seq data may be directly assembled into transcripts using sequence assembly. Two main categories of sequence assembly are often distinguished: # de novo transcriptome assembly - especially important when a reference genome is not available for a given species. # Genome-guided assembly (sometimes mapping or reference-guided assembly) - is capable of using a pre-existing reference to guide the assembly of transcripts Both methods attempt to generate biologically representative isoform-level constructs from RNA-seq data and generally attempt to associate isoforms with a gene-level construct. However, proper identification of gene-level constructs may be complicated by recent duplications, paralogs, alternative splicing or gene fusions. These complications may also cause downstream issues during ortholog inference. When selecting or generating sequence data, it is also vital to consider the tissue type, developmental stage and environmental conditions of the organisms. Since the transcriptome represents a snapshot of gene expression, minor changes to these conditions may significantly affect which transcripts are expressed. This may detrimentally affect downstream ortholog detection. Public databases RNA may also be acquired from public databases, such as GenBank, RefSeq, 1000 Plants (1KP) and 1KITE. Public databases potentially offer curated sequences which can improve inference quality and avoid the computational overhead associated with sequence assembly. Inferring gene pair orthology/paralogy Approaches Orthology or paralogy inference requires an assessment of sequence homology, usually via sequence alignment. Phylogenetic analyses and sequence alignment are often considered jointly, as phylogenetic analyses using DNA or RNA require sequence alignment and alignments themselves often represent some hypothesis of homology. As proper ortholog identification is pivotal to phylogenetic analyses, there are a variety of methods available to infer orthologs and paralogs. These methods are generally distinguished as either graph-based algorithms or tree-based algorithms. Some examples of graph-based methods include InParanoid, MultiParanoid, OrthoMCL, HomoloGene and OMA. Tree-based algorithms include programs such as OrthologID or RIO. A variety of BLAST methods are often used to detect orthologs between species as a part of graph-based algorithms, such as MegaBLAST, BLASTALL, or other forms of all-versus-all BLAST and may be nucleotide- or protein-based alignments. RevTrans will even use protein data to inform DNA alignments, which can be beneficial for resolving more distant phylogenetic relationships. These approaches often assume that best- reciprocal-hits passing some threshold metric(s), such as identity, E-value, or percent alignment, represent orthologs and may be confounded by incomplete lineage sorting. Databases and tools It is important to note that orthology relationships in public databases typically represent gene-level orthology and do not provide information concerning conserved alternative splice variants. Databases that contain and/or detect orthologous relationships include: * DIOPT * Ensembl Compara * GreenPhylDB * HaMStR * HomoloGene * InParanoid * MultiParanoid * OMA * OrthoDB * OrthologID * OrthoMCL * OrtholugeDB * PhylomeDB * TreeFam * eggNOG * metaPhOrs Multiple sequence alignment As eukaryotic transcription is a complex process by which multiple transcripts may be generated from a single gene through alternative splicing with variable expression, the utilization of RNA is more complicated than DNA. However, transcriptomes are cheaper to sequence than complete genomes and may be obtained without the use of a pre-existing reference genome. It is not uncommon to translate RNA sequence into protein sequence when using transcriptomic data, especially when analyzing highly diverged taxa. This is an intuitive step as many (but not all) transcripts are expected to code for protein isoforms. Potential benefits include the reduction of mutational biases and a reduced number of characters, which may speed analyses. However, this reduction in characters may also result in the loss of potentially informative characters. There are a number of tools available for multiple sequence alignment. All of which possess their own strengths and weaknesses and may be specialized for distinct sequence types (DNA, RNA or protein). As such, a splice-aware aligner may be ideal for aligning RNA sequences, whereas an aligner that considers protein structure or residue substitution rates may be preferable for translated RNA sequence data. Opportunities and limitations Using RNA for phylogenetic analysis comes with its own unique set of strengths and weaknesses.

This swirling motion improves the air-fuel mixture and enhances power and torque, while at the same time lowering fuel consumption and decreasing emissions. The flaps can be actuated with pneumatic or electric power. Furthermore, the position of the flap can be controlled continuously with a feedback controller or just kept either fully closed or open. Use of a tumble flap improves the lean burn ability of a spark-ignition engine.  Operation  The set point of the tumble flap is adjusted by an electrical or vacuum-activated servo mechanism which is under the control of the engine management system. Tumble flaps are open or closed depending on engine operating states (related to engine speed and load), engine temperatures, combustion modes (characterized by air-fuel ratio), catalytic converter heating or cold start active or inactive etc. In gasoline direct injection, stratified charge mode is used for light-load running conditions, at constant or reducing road speeds, where no acceleration is required. In this charge mode, the air-fuel mixture is concentrated around the spark plug by means of the specifically produced air flow and a special geometry of the piston, while pure air is placed near the cylinder walls. Tumble flaps are used to realize this stratified charge. The flaps remain closed during the stratified charge mode. A switchable tumble system is normally used to direct a targeted air flow. The so-called \\"tumble plate\\" divides the air inlet channel into an upper and lower half. An upstream flap allows air flow either only over the upper part or over the entire cross- section. At higher engine speeds and torques, the tumble flap is opened to achieve a better degree of filling. During this homogeneous mode of combustion, the engine functions like a conventional fuel injection engine, but with higher efficiency due to the higher compression. The tumble flaps are also actuated to improve cold engine idling. During scavenging the flaps are opened in order to draw much fresh air into the cylinder.

Fauna  The expanse of Aucilla WMA and its diversity of habitats provides a home to a large diversity of animal species. Mammals range from Florida black bears and bobcats to North American river otters and white-tailed deer. The property is part of the Great Florida Birding and Wildlife Trail due to its abundance of warblers, limpkins and wood storks, along with many other migratory and resident bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are represented by species such as eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, gopher tortoises and American alligator s.  History  Evidence of Aucilla Wildlife Management Area's history dates back at least 12,000 years. Bones of prehistoric mammals such as mastodons and giant ground sloths have been found in the Wacissa River, Aucilla River and sinkhole ponds located on the property. Arrow points, pottery and human remains point to the heavy use of this area by Native Americans over the past several thousand years. Slaves modified an existing channel that connected the Aucilla and Wacissa River in an attempt from their masters to enhance access to the Gulf of Mexico from northern markets. Seminole Indians hid out in the dense swamps during offensive campaigns during the Seminole Wars. In the early 1900s, the area saw increased human use as its old-growth bald cypress and longleaf pine was heavily logged.  Recreational Activities  The size and composition of Aucilla Wildlife Management Area allow for a range of recreational activities. The Aucilla and Wacissa Rivers are two of the most popular paddling streams in the Florida Panhandle. The Aucilla River passes karst formations and is considered to be a more challenging paddle. The clear, spring-fed Wacissa River is more popular with tubers and those seeking a more relaxing paddle. The Aucilla Sinks Trail, along with portions of the Florida National Scenic Trail, give hikers access to karst features like sinkholes and solution holes. Goose Pasture Campground along the Wacissa River contains a number of campsites available on a first-come, first-served basis. The sloughs and rivers of Aucilla WMA contain strong populations of largemouth bass, Suwannee bass and bream. Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer and, especially, feral hogs are abundant in the area and hunters may pursue them during the appropriate seasons.

Unusually, there are lines of hydrogen and absorption components in many lines creating P Cygni profiles. Overall, the emission is weaker than stars of similar spectral type, and it has often been suggested that WR 3 has a type O binary companion. However, there are no other signs of a companion and it is thought to be a single star with a spectral type of WN3-hw. The \\"h\\" and \\"w\\" indicate that hydrogen is present and the emission is weaker for the class. Ordered by right ascension, WR 3 was the third star in the Sixth Catalogue of galactic Wolf- Rayet stars. WR 1 and WR 2 are also both early WN stars in Cassiopeiae. WR 3 is a massive and luminous star. The presence of hydrogen in its spectrum suggests that it is younger than hydrogen-free WR stars and may still be fusing hydrogen in its core. The emission lines of heavy elements in its spectrum are produced by strong convection and powerful stellar winds rather than complete loss of the outer layers of the star.

Background Chief Agho Ogbedeoyo the Obaseki Of Benin, acted as the Oba of Benin during the interregnum, 1897-1914 As Head of Administration when Oba Ovonramwen was exiled. Agho was the last of his father, Ogbeide's children. Ogbeide held the Bini Ine title under Oba Adolo. He was originally from Agbor. The Ine was the head of the palace society of Ibiwe and was responsible for raising the heir apparent and princes. When he was about 25 years old, he got into some trouble in the village of Iguovinyoba, when he was entangled with a married woman. He thereafter left for Benin City to start a new life and there he met Crown Prince Idugbowa, later Oba Ovonramwen Nogbaisi who took Agho under protection and a friendship between the two men ensued. A young Agho became a trader for Prince Idugbowa. Ovonramwen's ascendancy, Agho's trading growth, and award of the Obaseki title When Prince Idgubowa became Oba Ovonramwen, Agho enjoyed a monopoly in trading palm oil and kernels for European products such as rum, matches, salt, clothing, silks, and other imports. Consequently, Agho brought great wealth to Oba Ovonramwen and himself and was rewarded as the head servant of the Benin royal house charged with settling minor household disputes. Oba Ovonramwen also rewarded Agho with his first wife, Etuohun and granted him the Obaseki title which was then incorporated into the Iweguae title holding society. Obaseki means \\"the Oba's favour is more valuable than mere success in trade\\", in 1889. Oba Ovonramwen further enhanced Obaseki's status by gifting him one hundred slaves who had been war captives. Fall of Benin and change in relationship with Ovonramwen Obaseki played a crucial role in the events leading to the Fall of Benin from the Punitive Expedition of 1897. He had organized a defence of Benin and accompanied Oba Ovonramwen during his escape from British rocket fire. Ovonramwen instructed Obaseki in April 1897 to survey Benin in the aftermath of the British bombardment. Obaseki was discovered by the British and was prevented from returning to Ovonramwen because the British saw him as useful for the new political order they were to impose. Alfred Turner, the British Resident, appointed Obaseki to the Council of Chiefs in September 1897. Paramount Chief of Benin Oba Ovonramwen stood trial in August for actions leading up to the Punitive Expedition, was found guilty by the British, deposed, and exiled to Calabar leading to a leadership vacuum that the British filled by making Obaseki the de facto head of the newly constituted Benin Native Council because of Obaseki's administrative skills and political acumen. Chief Agho Obaseki was a paramount Chief in the Benin Empire Iyase of Benin Ovonramwen died on January 13, 1914, paving the way for Prince Aiguobasimwin (later Oba Eweka II) to become Oba. The British authorities, however, broke with tradition by appointing Obaseki, the Iyase of Benin (Chief Adviser to the Oba) much to the dismay of the newly installed Oba Eweka II. Consequently, a power struggle ensued between Oba Eweka II and Obaseki, the new Iyase of Benin. The Iyase overshadowed the Oba under the new British political dispensation and even according to the British who backed him, was 'certainly most dictatorial and arrogant in his behaviour'. New Yam Festival palaver Obaseki embraced Christianity in 1917 and consequently stopped participating in palace rituals such as the opening of the New Yam Festival. Since yams could not be harvested without the Iyase participating, hard times followed and the British had to intervene. The Oba retorted that the festivities could not commence without the Iyase's participation and the Iyase, in turn, countered that his new religion compelled his non participation. Oba Eweka II was thus forced to open the festivities without the Iyase, humiliated by publicly apologizing to Obaseki, and in an act of reconciliation, the Oba gave his daughter, Princess Comfort Ebose Eweka, to Obaseki in marriage. Obaseki now had as wives, the daughters of 2 successive Obas (first Ovonramwen who married off Orinmwiame while in exile, and now Eweka II). Death and legacy Obaseki suffered from Pneumonia and died on September 9, 1920. His sons are Chief Aiyamekhue Jackson Obaseki (Esama of Benin Kingdom) a title held by the richest man in the Benin Empire, Chief Downson Obaseki (The Obaruyiedo Of Benin Kinddom), Wilson Aigbedo, Agboifo, Humphrey, and Gaius Ikuobasoyenmwen who later became an Action Group chieftain. Accounts of his life and political career are contained in two books 'Obaseki of Benin (African Historical Biographies Series)' and 'The Nemesis of Power: Agho Obaseki and Benin Politics 1897-1956' authored by Nigerian historian and leading authority on Benin history, Professor Philip Igbafe.

On 9 May 1746, almost a month after the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden, a skirmish took place at Loch Ailort, Moidart between a group of Jacobites from the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald who were led by their chief, the Young Ranald MacDonald, against a British- Hanoverian Government force. It was one of the last armed conflicts of the Jacobite rising. Background The Young Ranald MacDonald is supposed to have gone to France shortly after the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746. However, it is clear that he secretly lingered in his own country for at least eighteen months after, mainly in the wilds of Moidart, which were apparently fraught with the greatest peril. At this time the Western Highlands of Scotland were coming under the attention of the Royal Navy and also the Campbell of Argyll Militia who supported the Government. This attention was started by Captain John Fergusssone and the shore parties of his bomb vessel . Furgussone first cruised the Sea of the Hebrides and The Minch and then worked his way north, taking prisoners at the Isle of Canna and the Isle of Barra. He then proceeded east and burnt everything of value on the Isle of Raasay. The skirmish On May 9, Fergussone sailed up the mainland Loch Nevis and burnt the new house of MacDonald of Barisdale. On the same day when Fergussone searched the caves of Loch Ailort, he came under fire from 500 men who were under the command of Young Clanranald.

He is the leader of a political movement he founded called Ishema Party and a key figure in the opposition to President Paul Kagame. Nahimana Thomas is also the leader of \\"New Generation\\", a movement that seeks change and democracy in Rwanda using nonviolent methods. Early life Nahima is of Hutu ethnicity, one of the three ethnicity found in Rwanda. He studied in Rwanda and France and holds Master degrees in Law, Philosophy and Theology. He attended seminary first in Nyundo, then in Nyakibanda and was ordained a catholic priest on July 18, 1999. He served as a priest in Nyamasheke District, Hanika, and Muyange. He taught at Saint Aloys Junior Seminary of Cyangugu and he has been the President of the diocesan Just and Peace Commission in Nyamasheke, Cyangugu, from 1999 to 2005. Exile and political career He has been living in exile in France since 2005 stating that he feared for his safety, and he holds dual Rwandan and French citizenship. Criticism Some media close to the current Government of Rwanda led by General Paul Kagame, alleged that he fled the country after embezzling money from a microfinance group. However the Cyangugu Catholic Church Bishop considered that information completely false and fabricated, a result of a smear campaign against Father Thomas Nahimana, as an Opposition Leader. In 2011, the Catholic Church in Rwanda, under the pressure of the current Rwandan Government, distanced its organization from father Thomas Nahimana and Fortunatus Rudakemwa upon the proclamation of Bishop Jean Damascene Bimenyimana of Cyangugu Diocese for \\"instigating divisionism and promoting the Genocide ideology\\". Not only that but some members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the ruling political party in Rwanda, which is led by Rwanda's current President Paul Kagame, have accused father Nahimana of being a genocide denier, from comments he has made while abroad, a serious charge that carries years of imprisonment if one is convicted. The current government of Rwanda has not charged the father of any wrongdoing. 2017 election In November 2016, Nahimana Thomas and his close aids (33 year old Candidate Campaign Manager Mr Venant Nkurunziza and 36 year old Candidate Principal Spokesperson Mrs Claire Nadine Kansinge with her seven month old baby Kejo Skyler) attempted to return to Rwanda to partake in the upcoming 2017 presidential election but they were refused entry into Rwanda by Paul Kagame's government. They arrived in Kenya, and there they were informed that they could not board Kenyan Airways and complete the last leg of their trip because Kigali did not want them on Rwandan soil. On January 22, 2017, Nahimana attempted to return to Rwanda to run for the Presidency in the August 2017 elections. He would be the sole opponent against Paul Kagame who will run for a third term after the Rwandan Constitution was changed to allow a third term. Once again Nahimana was denied entry to Rwanda by the Rwandan Directorate of Immigration on the basis of a series of complex passport and visa issues.

It is a strong oxidizing agent for organic oxidation reactions, such as in Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidations of ketones. It is the most reactive of the organic peroxy acids, allowing it to successfully oxidise relatively unreactive alkenes to epoxides where other peroxy acids are ineffective. It can also oxidise the chalcogens in some functional groups, such as by transforming selenoethers to selones. It is a potentially explosive material and is not commercially available, but it can be quickly prepared as needed. Its use as a laboratory reagent was pioneered and developed by William D. Emmons. Properties At standard ambient temperature and pressure, trifluoroperacetic acid is a colourless liquid with a boiling point of 162 ¬∞C. It is soluble in acetonitrile, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, and sulfolane, and readily reacts with water. Like all peroxy acids, it is potentially explosive and requires careful handling. It is not commercially available, but can be made in the lab and stored for up to several weeks at ‚àí20 ¬∞C. Some preparative methods result in mixtures containing residual hydrogen peroxide and trifluoroacetic acid, and heating such a mixture is extremely hazardous; the hydrogen peroxide can be decomposed using manganese dioxide for safety before heating. Preparation Trifluoroperacetic acid can be easily prepared by an Organic Syntheses process of treating trifluoroacetic anhydride with a concentrated (90%) aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide: : \\\\+ -> \\\\+ As the anhydride will form trifluoroacetic acid in contact with water, an excess of the anhydride also serves to remove the solvent from the peroxide reactant: : \\\\+ -> 2 A more dilute hydrogen peroxide solution (30%) can be used to form trifluoroperacetic acid for some reactions from trifluoroacetic acid. : \\\\+ -> \\\\+ In order to avoid the danger of handling pure or highly concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide ‚Äì urea can be used to give the peracid. This method involves no water, so it gives a completely anhydrous peracid, which is an advantage when the presence of water leads to side reactions during certain oxidation reactions. : \\\\+ -> \\\\+ \\\\+ In cases where a pH buffering agent is needed for a synthesis and where the presence of water is tolerated, another approach has been developed. Reacting trifluoroacetic anhydride with sodium percarbonate, , yields trifluoroperacetic acid and sodium carbonate, obviating the need for an additional buffer. :3 \\\\+ 4 -> 6 \\\\+ 4 \\\\+ 3 Trifluoroperacetic acid can also be generated in situ, allowing it to react promptly with the target substrate rather than pre-synthesizing a batch of the reagent for later use. Uses (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene, Trifluoroperacetic acid is primarily used as an oxidising agent. In September 1953, the Journal of the American Chemical Society published work by William D. Emmons and Arthur F. Ferris reporting that this reagent, generated in situ, was capable of oxidising aniline to nitrobenzene. Over the following two years, Emmons reported a preparative method for this reagent and published six further manuscripts in this journal on its applications; Emmons is remembered in part as the pioneer and developer of trifluoroperacetic acid as a laboratory reagent, which has since become useful as a reagent for many different types of synthetic reactions. One example is the formation of the hypervalent iodine compound (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene, which is used to carry out the Hofmann rearrangement under acidic conditions. The hypervalent compound is accessible in two ways, and which is chosen usually depends on what materials are available: it can be prepared from its acetate analogue by an exchange reaction, or by reacting iodobenzene with a combination of trifluoroperacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid: center Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation Generalised Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of linear and cyclic ketones Trifluoroperacetic acid is one of the strongest reagents used for Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidations, as a consequence of its high acidity relative to similar peracids and peroxides. This reaction converts ketones to either straight-chain esters or lactones, and is named for Adolf von Baeyer and Victor Villiger, who first reported it 1899. The reaction is believed to proceed via a Criegee intermediate and demonstrates good regioselectivity and chemoselectivity for the position of oxygen atom insertion, along with retention of stereochemistry at the adjacent position, as can be seen in the following example. The disodium phosphate () is added as a pH buffer to prevent the highly acidic trifluoroacetic acid byproduct from causing hydrolysis or transesterification of the ester product. 500px Epoxidation The Prilezhaev reaction involves the conversion of an alkene to an epoxide using a peracid as the oxidant and was first reported in 1909. The reaction has been used as the final step of the synthesis of scopine, a tropane alkaloid. In this approach, a [4+3] cycloaddition mediated by diiron nonacarbonyl is used to construct the bicyclic skeleton, the hydroxyl functional group is then introduced by diastereoselective reduction of the ketone with diisobutylaluminum hydride, and the preparation completed with a Prilezhaev trifluoroperacetic acid epoxidation. 600px The high reactivity of trifluoroperacetic acid relative to other peroxy acids allows it to successfully oxidize relatively electron-poor alkenes such as 1-hexene and Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated esters such as methyl methacrylate, substrates that are generally resistant to peroxy-acid epoxidation. Including additional buffered trifluoroacetic acid in the mixture gives a vicinal hydroxy‚Äìtrifluoroacetate structure instead of an epoxide, which can be converted to the diol by treatment with acidic methanol, such as in the following conversion of 1-dodecene to 1,2-dodecanediol. 600px In the case of an allyl alcohol compound with a proximate carbonyl functional group, the epoxide can undergo a ring- expansion reaction to form a dioxolane. The process below was used as part of the total synthesis of neosporol, a natural product: 700px The preparation of the isomeric compound sporol involved a similar dioxolane formation. In this case, the use of trifluoroperacetic acid derived from hydrogen peroxide, which therefore presumably contained traces of water, gave mostly a hemiacetal rather than the closed-ring dioxolane. The use of the urea complex, which gave a water-free material, successfully gave the dioxolane as the major product. The dioxolane is expanded to the 1,3-dioxane system found in sporol at a later step in the synthesis. Heteroatom oxidation Functional groups containing heteroatoms in low oxidation states can be oxidised by trifluoroperacetic acid. Common cases include the oxidation of iodine (for example, the formation of the hypervalent iodine compound from iodobenzene mentioned earlier), nitrogen, sulfur, and selenium. In the case of nitrogen-containing compounds, known transformations include oximes and aromatic primary amines to nitro compounds (even with electron-withdrawing substituents, for example, pentafluoroaniline to pentafluoronitrobenzene), nitrosamines to nitramines, formation of aromatic N-oxides and aromatic azine N-oxides, and conversion of nitroso compounds to nitro compounds or nitramines. For example, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and trifluoroperacetic acid oxidises the nitroso-substituted pyrimidine 4,6-diamino-5-nitrosopyrimidine-2-thiol to its nitro analogue while also removing the thiol moiety by oxidative hydrolytic desulfurization: 500px In the case of chalcogen elements, sulfide moieties (R‚ÄìS‚ÄìR) can be oxidised by trifluoroperacetic acid to sulfoxide (R‚ÄìS(O)‚ÄìR) and/or sulfone (R‚ÄìS(O)2‚ÄìR) forms, depending on the conditions used. In the analogous selenium system, trifluoroperacetic acid oxidation of selenoethers (R‚ÄìSe‚ÄìR) produces selones (R‚ÄìSe(O)2‚ÄìR) without the formation of the related selenoxides (R‚ÄìSe(O)‚ÄìR) as an isolable product, a reaction which is particularly effective when the R is an aryl group. A general approach to the formation of sulfinyl chlorides (RS(O)Cl) is the reaction of the corresponding thiol with sulfuryl chloride (). In cases where the sulfenyl chloride (RSCl) results instead, a subsequent trifluoroperacetic acid oxidation affords the desired product, as in the case of 2,2,2-trifluoro-1,1-diphenylethanethiol: center The trifluoroperacetic acid oxidation of thiophene illustrates competing pathways for reaction, with both S-oxidation and epoxidation being possible. The major pathway initially forms the sulfoxide, but this chemical promptly undergoes a Diels-Alder-type dimerisation before any further oxidation occurs‚Äîneither thiophene-S-oxide or thiophene-S,S-dioxide are found among the products of the reaction. The dimer can then be oxidized further, converting one of the S-oxide moieties to an S,S-dioxide. In the minor reaction pathway, a Prilezhaev epoxidation results in the formation of thiophene-2,3-epoxide that rapidly rearranges to the isomer thiophene-2-one. Trapping experiments demonstrate that this epoxide pathway is not an alternative reaction of the S-oxide intermediate, and isotopic labeling experiments demonstrate that a 1,2-hydride shift (an NIH shift) occurs and thus that a cationic intermediate is involved. The choice of trifluoroperacetic acid preparation method is important as water suppresses the minor reaction pathway, likely because it acts as a competing base. 500px Oxidation with acidic rearrangement The use of trifluoroperacetic acid with boron trifluoride causes oxidation of alkenes and aromatic rings with concomitant rearrangement of the molecular skeleton. For alkenes, the reaction gives a ketone product, though the mechanistic process is not simply epoxidation followed by a BF3-catalyzed Wagner‚ÄìMeerwein rearrangement: center For aromatics, an example demonstrated in an Organic Syntheses report is the conversion of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbenzene to 2,3,4,5,6,6-hexamethyl-2,4-cyclohexadienone: center Oxidative cleavage of arenes  In addition to simple oxidation of aromatic rings to form carbonyl compounds (see ), trifluoroperacetic acid can fully cleave the carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds within the ring. Unlike other oxidations of alkylaromatic structures, which yield benzoic acids and related compounds by cleavage of the alkyl chain at the reactive benzylic position, trifluoroperacetic acid causes an \\"inverse oxidation\\", cleaving the aromatic ring itself while leaving the alkyl group intact. 350px This selectivity for certain types of bonds allows it to be used to decompose complex mixtures of hydrocarbonds, such as coal, in order to determine structural details. Aromatic systems containing heteroatoms are resistant to this ring-opening as heteroatom oxidation occurs preferentially and deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack by the peroxy acid. For example, purines, pyridines, and quinolines instead form N-oxides, while sulfur systems like octafluorodibenzothiophene are converted to sulfones. Aromatic systems with ring-activating substituents can be oxidised to form phenols instead of undergoing a ring-opening reaction. Mesitylene, for example, reacts with trifluoroperacetic acid to form mesitol (2,4,6-trimethylphenol). Researchers attempting to form a lactone by Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation of 7-oxodeacetamidocolchicine were unable to prepare the desired product, but did achieve oxidation of the aromatic ring to produce a phenol-derivative in high yield: 350px Notes References Trifluoromethyl compounds Organic peroxy acids Reagents for organic chemistry ","title":"Trifluoroperacetic acid"},{"id":"52821472","text":"Secma F16 Rear end The Secma F16 is a French micro sports car made by Secma.

It is designed to float buildings, roadways, and utilities in a few feet of water. The self-adjusting floating environment draws from existing technologies used to float concrete bridges and runways such as Washington's SR 520 and Japan's Mega-Float. It also absorbs the shock of earthquakes, allowing buildings and their related communities to remain stable. Arx Pax is working with Republic of Kiribati and Pacific Rising to solve for sustainable development challenges associated with rising sea levels. Arx Pax, the company involved in this technology has proposed building a ‚Äúfloating village‚Äù project in north San Jose's Alviso hamlet, deploying a group of pontoons beneath the buildings to protect the development from floods and earthquakes. Originally developed for earthquakes as an alternative to Base Isolation the floating foundation decouples the structure from the earth with a simple patented method consisting of three parts. According to the patent, \\"Three part foundation systems can include a containment vessel, which constrains a buffer medium to an area above the containment vessel, and a construction platform. A building can be built on the construction platform. In a particular embodiment, during operation, the construction platform and structures built on the construction platform can float on the buffer medium. In an earthquake, a construction platform floating on a buffer medium may experience greatly reduced shear forces. In a flood, a construction platform floating on a buffer medium can be configured to rise as water levels rise to limit flood damage.\\" References See also * Arx Pax Labs, Inc. * Sustainable development * Evergreen Point Floating Bridge * Very large floating structure Emerging technologies ","title":"SAFE Building System"},{"id":"52821909","text":"Dakowy may refer to the following places in Poland: *Dakowy Mokre *Dakowy Suche ","title":"Dakowy"},{"id":"52821934","text":"The Pehuenche are an indigenous people of Chile and Argentina.

He was educated at the parish school of Kilmegan, Co. Down, and at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. Life in the United States In 1848 he went to America, graduated (1849) at Washington College, Lexington, Virginia, and studied theology at Princeton, New Jersey, under Charles Hodge, D.D. (1797‚Äì1878). He organised (1852) a presbyterian mission at Philadelphia, gathered a congregation in Franklin House Hall, was ordained its pastor in 1853, and obtained the erection (1856) of Westminster Church for its use. He got into controversy on Arminianism with Albert Barnes (1798‚Äì1870), a Philadelphia presbyterian of liberal views. Ministry in Ireland On a visit to Ireland he accepted a call to Lower Gloucester Street congregation, Dublin,A history of Presbyterianism in Dublin and the south and west of Ireland, pages 232-3 and was installed there in August 1863. On the death (1866) of John Edgar, Watts was elected to the chair of systematic theology in the Assembly's College, Belfast. He was a keen theologian, of very conservative views, opposed to the tendency of much modern criticism, and especially to the influence of German exegesis. He studied current speculations with some care, in a spirit of uncompromising antagonism. His writings were acceptable to the older minds in his denomination, and were in some measure successful in arresting tendencies which he combated with confident vivacity. In matters where he considered that no theological interest was involved he was not so conservative; he advocated the use of instrumental music in public worship, though this was against the general sentiment of Irish presbyterians. He was Moderator of the General Assembly from 1879 to 1880. His health suffered from overwork, and after the close of the college session, April 1895, he completely broke down. He died at College Park, Belfast, on 26 July 1895, and was buried on 29 July in the city cemetery. Family He married (1853) Margaret, daughter of William Newell of Summerhill, Downpatrick, who survived him with a son and two daughters. His eldest son, Robert Watts, presbyterian minister of Kilmacreenan, co. Donegal, died on 4 Dec. 1889. Works Among his numerous publications may be named: *1.

By 1893 she was back in New York City at the Veltin School for Girls on the Upper West Side. She did well in china painting, and later also studied the painting of miniatures. In 1899 she traveled to Europe with her neighbors, the Fabers; on her return she painted miniatures on commission from family and friends. She married Malcolm McIntyre, a mechanical engineer, in 1910, and ceased painting after Lois, the couple's only child, was born in 1917. Her work was shown at the National Academy of Design as part of exhibitions by the American Society of Miniature Painters in 1915 and 1916; after the family moved to Riverside, Connecticut, she exhibited in local libraries several times.

Of Mice and Magic: a History of American Animated Cartoons. Von Hoffmann Press, Inc., 1980. p. 404 offers for it (and other contemporary Bosko shorts) only an ambiguous release date of 1931‚Äì1932. It was, like most Looney Tunes of its time, directed by Hugh Harman; its musical direction was by Frank Marsales. Summary A skate-clad Bosko leaps and prances upon the ice, his dog Bruno barking rhythmically, here and there narrowly avoiding sliding into patches of yet-unfrozen water; the poor canine cannot keep up with his master forever and eventually slides into the frigid pond. The dog's howling catches Bosko's attention and, as Bruno sinks, our hero wonders aloud desperately what he should do. But the lost creature pops mockingly out of a nearby hollow log, taunting Bosko, who breaks a branch from a nearby tree and tosses it to the wind for Bruno to fetch with great enthusiasm. Coming upon the stick, Bruno is spooked by the sound and movement coming from a covered basket: running back to alert his master, the dog bumps into a young tree and is forthwith buried in snow. Undeterred, the animal continues back to the basket, now accompanied by Bosko, who warns his friend to stay back. But, finding the contents of the basket to be harmless, Bosko invites Bruno to check under its cover: a baby in a bonnet pops out, squeezing Bruno's nose when the animal comes too close. Repelled, Bruno's plight is lovingly laughed at by Bosko, who merrily orders Bruno to carry the basket home. Off skates Bosko, Bruno and baby behind; the infant cries as Bosko scats a lullaby. Back home and by a roaring fire, Bruno rocks the baby in his cradle as Bosko plays a gentle theme on a violin. Still, the baby cries; for all Bosko's plucking and Bruno's grinning, still, the baby cries. Frustrated, the dog storms off, taking an unlucky seat upon the hot stove. Behind aflame, Bruno leaps about in anguish, quenching the fire at last with a bucket of water. At this, the whiny infant laughs! But this mirth is short-lived: the hollering springs afresh and Bosko, abandoning his fiddle, takes up a fife, intoning \\"The Waxies' Dargle\\" to Bruno's percussive accompaniment. When this avails naught, Bosko tries verbally to comfort the foundling, who complains in song. Bruno again storms off, this time to the bathroom; he slams the door, jostling a lintel-mounted cuckoo clock, which falls from its perch, hits the dog on his head, and mocks the creature's resultant daze with a timely \\"cuckoo! cuckoo!\\" The baby cries. Bosko tickles his charge and then leaps for the piano; he intersperses his performance with shadow puppetry. Bruno reenters, happily joining the musical act by donning a lampshade as though it were a hoop skirt. Finally, the baby seems happy. Bosko dances off, skating upon a rug up to his stove, popping open the oven-door briefly to reveal a live bird in a roasting pan. Our hero skips back, finally sliding into a decorative column, knocking over a small fish bowl, which flips over upon his head to the giggles of his audience.

It took place February 4‚Äì7, 1943, during Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá's Chetniks' 1943 cleansing campaign (conducted against the order of supreme Chetnik command). The massacre was aimed at establishing Chetnik control over territories held by the Sand≈æak Muslim militia. After a short battle with the Muslim militia, Chetniks captured Bukovica and killed over five hundred civilians.  Background   Geography and demography  Bukovica is a rural area of Pljevlja municipality located in northern Montenegro, and is part of the Sand≈æak region. To the north lay the Bosnian municipalities of ƒåajniƒçe and Foƒça. Bukovica is and contains over 30 hamlets with 1 to 10 houses. Prior to the start of World War II, the population of Bukovica was predominantly Muslim, with a substantial Serb population.  Usta≈°e Muslim militia in Sand≈æak  At the end of April 1941 and into the beginning of May, Croatian Usta≈°e forces captured Sand≈æak. Political representatives of the Muslim population requested that the territory of Sand≈æak should be annexed by the Independent State of Croatia. Thus the Sand≈æak Muslim militia was established in all regions of Sand≈æak, including Pljevlja. After withdrawal of the Usta≈°e from Sand≈æak in September 1941, the region came under control of Italian forces as part of Italian governorate of Montenegro. In April 1942, Italians established a battalion of Muslim militia in Metaljka, near ƒåajniƒçe, composed of about 500 Muslims from villages near Pljevlja and ƒåajniƒçe. Soon after, a command post of Muslim militia was established in Bukovica, near Pljevlja. It was commanded by Latif Moƒáeviƒá, the president of Bukovica municipality. From the end of May 1942, his units attacked and killed local Serbs. In December 1942, around 3,000 Muslims attacked the Serbian village of Buƒëevo and several surrounding villages near Sjenica, burning down Serb houses and murdering Serb citizens. According to Chetnik sources, Muslims were preparing to expel Serbs who lived on the right bank of Lim, Pljevlja, ƒåajniƒçe, and Foƒça.  Order of Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá  On January 3, 1943, Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá issued an order for the \\"cleansing of Usta≈°e-Muslim organizations\\" from ƒåajniƒçe region with the explanation that Usta≈°e and Sand≈æak Muslim militia forces had continued to attack and kill Serb civilians, rob Serb-populated villages and rape women and girls. Stating that the total number of their armed forces was 2,500, Mihajloviƒá issued his order to: * Mile≈°eva Corps, commanded by Vojislav Lukaƒçeviƒá and Railiƒá Radoman, * Drina Corps, commanded by Bajo Nikiƒç * Durmitor brigade, commanded by Nikola Bojoviƒá ƒêuri≈°iƒá's report of 13 February 1943 informing Mihailoviƒá of the massacres of Muslims in the counties of ƒåajniƒçe and Foƒça in southeastern Bosnia and in the county of Pljevlja in the Sand≈æak.  ƒêuri≈°iƒá's January raids of revenge  On January 5, 1943, Montenegrin Chetniks, commanded by Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá, attacked 33 villages predominantly populated with Muslims in the region of Lower Bihor. They pursued raids of revenge against Sand≈æak Muslims, many being innocent villagers, with the goal of settling accounts with Muslim militias. A group commanded by Lukaƒçeviƒá began their attack on January 5, 1943. As soon as they attacked, Italian forces tried to intervene. On the same day a unit commanded by Rade Korda burned 15 houses and killed 15 people. The unit commanded by Mira≈° Saviƒá began to attack on 6 January. On 10 January, ƒêuri≈°iƒá reported that the Chetniks under his command had burned down 33 Muslim villages, killed 400 Muslim fighters, and had also killed about 1,000 Muslim women and children in the region of Bjelo Polje. According to some sources, Italians wanted to reward Chetniks because they had agreed to participate in the Case White operation against Communists. This allowed Chetnik attacks on the Muslim population to occur in Sand≈æak and Montenegro. Chetnik forces began with preparation for this attack on February 1, 1943. At the end of January 1943, Muslims from Kalinovik in eastern Herzegovina advised Muslims from Bukovica not to allow communists to misuse them against Serbs, like Usta≈°e had misused them in 1942. This advice was not followed and some Muslims from this region continued to terrorize Serbs from Bukovica and neighboring places. After a short battle with Muslim militia, Bukovica fell under Chetnik control.  Casualties  An incomplete list of 576 victims of the Chetnik attack on Bukovica municipality was published in Prilog u krvi Pljevlja 1941‚Äì45.godine (1969) by the SUBNOR (Union of Veterans of the People's Liberation War). 443 of the listed victims were children under the age of 18. Many of the men escaped, believing that civilian villages would not be in danger. Many civilians were tortured before being killed; a number of women and girls were raped. According to an incomplete list, Chetniks burned 1,171 houses and 468 other buildings. On March 1, 1943, Latif Moƒçeviƒá sent a report to the 1st Alpine Division Taurinense, informing them about this massacre. He stated that the number of victims in Bukovica was about 500 civilians. The Chetniks killed Pavle ƒêurkoviƒá, a notable person from Bukovica, because he was opposed to the massacre of Muslims. On February 16, 1943, Usta≈°e reported to their ministry of external affairs that Latif Moƒçeviƒá, a detachment commander of Muslim militia from Bukovica, and some other militia members were captured by Italians in ƒåajniƒçe. According to this report, Alija Had≈æimusiƒá, a commander of Foƒça detachment of Muslim militia, was killed in the battle near ƒåajniƒçe. Usta≈°e reported that the Muslim militia was surrounded near ƒåajniƒçe, with insufficient ammunition, being \\"on the edge of annihilation.\\"  Aftermath  On February 28, 1943, there was a conference in Prijepolje attended by Italian Lieutenant General Luigi Mentasti, who was commander of Italian forces in Montenegro. Mentasti asserted that Italian forces were not responsible for the Bukovica massacre, citing the centuries- long conflict between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. In turn, one million Serbs murdered mostly by Muslims on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia which included Bosnia and Hercegovina. He also accused the population of Bukovica of providing haven to a communist agent, an accusation that was denied by the mufti ≈†eƒáerkadiƒá from Pljevlja. Mentasti explained that Italian forces could not guarantee the security of Muslims in Pljevlja and recommended that they follow the example of Muslims from Berane and Bijelo Polje who signed agreements with Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá and Chetnik General ƒêukanoviƒá. During the war, communists established a commission for the investigation of war crimes of occupying forces and their collaborators. After the war, this commission investigated the massacre committed by Chetniks in villages of the Pljevlja municipality and emphasized that it was committed by Chetniks commanded by Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá and his subordinate officers with the approval of the commander of the 1st Alpine Division Taurinense. This commission composed a list of 95 Muslims and 59 Orthodox Christian war criminals in Pljevlja during the war. Seventeen former Chetniks were accused of committing the Bukovica massacre.

Published on May 31, 2016, the novel focuses on a group of former bandmates from the 1980s and their children living in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn in the present day. The novel explores the relationships between these central characters, paying specific attention to the passing of time, the interplay between the past and the present, and the bonds formed by young, old, and parental love. The novel debuted at number 14 on the New York Times Hardcover Bestsellers list for the week of June 19, 2016, and remained on the list for approximately two weeks. Modern Lovers is Emma Straub's fourth published book, following the novels Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures, The Vacationers, and a collection of short stories titled, Other People We Married. Plot summary Modern Lovers follows Elizabeth, Andrew, and Henry Marx, a family living in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, and their friends Zoe, Jane, and Ruby Kahn-Bennet over the course of a full summer. Elizabeth, Andrew, and Zoe met at Oberlin College in the 1980s and formed a punk rock group called Kitty's Mustache with their mutual friend, Lydia Greenbaum. During this period of time, Elizabeth wrote the lyrics to a song, called, \\"Mistress of Myself,\\" which the band often played. The band dissolved when Lydia chose to quit school and begin her own music career. Lydia's private rendition of, \\"Mistress of Myself,\\" was wildly successful, and she soon became a major star, eventually dying of a drug overdose at 27. After Lydia's departure from Oberlin, Elizabeth, Andrew, and Zoe graduated and moved to Ditmas Park, where they began to form families of their own. Her death years later impacted each of them in a unique way. In the present day, Elizabeth is working as a real estate agent, Zoe as the co-owner of a restaurant, Hyacinth, and Andrew is trying to figure out his next career. All three are struggling with middle age. Zoe is frustrated with the lack of passion in her marriage to a woman named Jane, and not for the first time, begins to contemplate divorce. Jane, on the other hand, wishes to work on the relationship instead of giving up. Both are concerned with Elizabeth's not- quite-platonic relationship with Zoe. While working through their marital strife, Zoe and Jane attempt to encourage their daughter, Ruby, a recent high school graduate, to retake the SAT's in order to improve her results enough to get into college. Ruby, completely disinterested, agrees to take an SAT preparatory class. There, Ruby and Henry, Elizabeth and Andrew's son, begin to bond and eventually start to date, developing a fast and furious summer romance. In contrast, through co-managing Hyacinth, Zoe and Jane begin to rekindle their relationship and rediscover their lost passion through their mutual love of food. Elizabeth and Andrew tackle their own share of marital struggles during the course of the novel. Elizabeth wrestles with the concept of feeling passive in the development of her own life, while Andrew, never able to create his own career, feels the loss of youth so acutely he becomes involved with a new, cultish organization formed down the street from their house. Called EVOLVEment, the organization operates out of a run-down house which they use as part yoga studio, part juice bar. Operating without permits or licenses, the endeavor is completely illegal, unbeknownst to Andrew for most of the novel. Andrew's involvement with EVOLVEment begins to strain his relationship with Elizabeth, which is further compounded by Elizabeth's desire to help a producer create a film about Lydia, while Andrew, harboring a secret about the former star, wants to leave the past alone. These conflicts leave both characters debating the sustainability of their relationship, as well as how they ended up together in the first place. Main characters Elizabeth Marx--Elizabeth is a middle aged real estate agent living in Ditmas Park with her husband Andrew, son Henry, and cat Iggy Pop. Elizabeth is restless in her marriage and concerned about her husband's increasing secrecy. At Oberlin College in the 1980s, Elizabeth was the guitarist for Kitty's Mustache, a punk rock band she formed with Andrew and her friends Zoe and Lydia. She is the lyricist of the hit song, \\"Mistress of Myself\\" made popular by Lydia after the dissolution of the band. At Oberlin, Elizabeth developed feelings for Zoe, which were never acted on, and which become crucial as the novel progresses in the modern day. Andrew Marx--Andrew is a middle aged man living in Ditmas Park with his wife Elizabeth, son Henry, and cat Iggy Pop. Andrew comes from a wealthy family, and partially as a result, has jumped from job to job throughout his life, never forming a true career. At Oberlin College in the 1980s, Andrew was involved with Kitty's Mustache and dating Elizabeth; however, he was also carrying on a secret affair with Lydia. In the present day, Andrew becomes involved with EVOLVEment, an illegal yoga studio and juice bar, as part of a mid-life crisis. Zoe Kahn-Bennet--Zoe is the co-owner of Hyacinth, a restaurant she owns with her wife, Jane. She lives in Ditmas Park with Jane, their daughter Ruby, and their dog. Zoe is concerned about her relationship with her daughter, Ruby, as well as Elizabeth's dependence on their friendship. Throughout the novel, Zoe and Jane struggle with rekindling their romance, contemplating divorce repeatedly. At Oberlin College in the 1980s, Zoe was involved with Kitty's Mustache. Jane Kahn-Bennet--Jane is the co-owner of Hyacinth, a restaurant she runs with her wife, Zoe. Jane is a chef, and loves her occupation. She often uses her skills in the kitchen to bond with her daughter, Ruby, and uses her love of food to reignite the passion in her relationship with her wife, Zoe. Jane's main concern is making her marriage work: while Zoe contemplates divorce, Jane spends time trying to identify how to repair their marriage. Lydia Greenbaum-- Lydia is the former drummer of Kitty's Mustache, a band she formed at Oberlin College in the 1980s along with Elizabeth, Zoe, and Andrew. While at Oberlin, Lydia began an affair with Andrew, who was dating Elizabeth at the time. Elizabeth remained unaware of this affair until the present day. In the novel, it is insinuated that Lydia falls in love with Andrew, and that her feelings were not reciprocated. Lydia eventually left Oberlin before graduating. Afterward, she began her own musical career, releasing a recording of, \\"Mistress of Myself,\\" that launched her to stardom. Eventually, Lydia developed a drug addiction, and died as a result of an overdose at the age of 27. A movie is being made about her life throughout the novel, which factors prominently in the plot. Harry Marx--Harry is the son of Elizabeth and Andrew. He is 17 years old, and in love with Ruby, who lives nearby. Harry and Ruby bond during an SAT preparatory class he takes the summer after his junior year of high school, and they begin a relationship, which quickly becomes serious. Their relationship is contrasted with those of their parents throughout the novel. Ruby Kahn-Bennet--Ruby is the daughter of Zoe and Jane. She is 18 years old, and has little interest in pursuing a college degree after graduation. Instead, she spends the summer after graduation working at her parents' restaurant while taking an SAT preparatory class. During this time, she falls in love with Henry, who is also attending her SAT class, and they begin a relationship that quickly becomes serious.  Reception  Modern Lovers was reviewed in publications such as the New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, Slate, Vogue, The Financial Times, and NPR, among other outlets. In general, the novel received favorable reviews, many of which praised Straub's depiction of middle age and suburban life. Michio Kakutani of the New York Times wrote, \\"She [Emma Straub] captures the jagged highs and lows of adolescence with freshness and precision, and the decades-long relationships of old college friends with a wry understanding of how time has both changed (and not changed) old dynamics,\\" while Carol Memmott of The Washington Post observed, \\"Like ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúModern Family,‚Äù ‚ÄúModern Lovers‚Äù celebrates the updated look and feel of familial love and all of its complexities. Straub's clever and perceptive observations on growing up are gentle reminders that coming of age isn't just for kids.\\" Modern Lovers was featured on the New York Times Hardcover Bestseller list from June 19, 2016, until June 26, 2016.

It is used to measure the frequency of occurrence of new instances of infection within a population during a specific time period. \\\\text{Rate of infection} = K \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\text{the number of infections}}{\\\\text{the number of those at risk of infection}} The number of infections equals the cases identified in the study or observed. An example might by HIV infection during a specific time period in the defined population. The population at risk are the cases appearing in the population during the same time period. An example would be all the people in a city during a specific time period. The constant, or K is assigned a value of 100 to represent a percentage. An example would be to find the percentage of people in a city who are infected with HIV: 6,000 cases in March divided by the population of a city (one million) multiplied by the constant (K) would give an infection rate of 0.6%. . Calculating the infection rate is used to analyze trends for the purpose of infection and disease control. An online infection rate calculator has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that allows the determination of the Streptococcal A infection rate in a population. Clinical applications Health care facilities routinely track their infection rates according to the guidelines issued by the Joint Commission. The healthcare-associated infection (HAI) rates measure infection of patients in a particular hospital. This allows rates to compared with other hospitals. These infections can often be prevented when healthcare facilities follow guidelines for safe care. To get payment from Medicare, hospitals are required to report data about some infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Hospitals currently submit information on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), MRSA Bacteremia, and C. difficile laboratory-identified events. The public reporting of these data is an effort by the Department of Health and Human Services. For meaningful comparisons of infection rates, populations must be very similar between the two or more assessments.

The genus is known from fossil leaves found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington state, United States and a similar aged formation in British Columbia, Canada. Discovery Tsukada leaf fossils have been identified from two locations in Western North America, the 49 million year old Klondike Mountain Formation near Republic, Washington and at the One Mile Creek locality near Princeton, British Columbia. Fossil pollen identified as from the Nyssaceae genus Nyssa has been identified from the related Okanagan Highlands Hat Creek Amber in central British Columbia. Ages for the Okanagan Highland locations are, in general, Early Eocene, with the sites that have current uranium-lead or argon‚Äìargon radiometric dates being of Ypresian age, while the undated sites or those given older dates being possibly slightly younger and Lutetian in age. Taxonomy Tsukada was described from a group of type specimen leaves, the holotype UW 71095, along with two paratypes UW 39187 and UW 71081 were part of the paleobotanical collections of Burke Museum. Additionally the counterpart to specimen UW 39187 was preserved in the University of California Museum of Paleontology collection as UCMP 9302. Working from these specimens, collected in the Republic, Washington area in the early 1980s, the fossils were studied by Jack A. Wolfe of the University of California and Wesley C. Wehr of the Burke Museum. They published their 1987 type description for the genus and species in a United States Geological Survey monograph on the North Eastern Washington dicot fossils. The genus name Tsukada was coined as a patronym recognizing the Quaternary paleoecology and biogeography work of University of Washington palynologist Matsuo Tsukada. The specific epithet was not explained by Wolfe and Wehr. Tertiary leaf veins of Tsukada branch in an angled-opposite system, distinct from that of the \\"dove tree\\", Davidia involucrata, where the tertiary vein system is formed from right angle-right angle branching. Additionally the side bracing veins are looped in Tsukada, while those in D. involucrata are straight and more robust. The glands of the teeth in Tsukada are shorter and less distinct. Wolfe and Wehr noted some aspects of the leaf structure, such as the tertiary vein structure and occasional camptodromus secondary branches, are seen in the family Escalloniaceae and not in other Cornales species. They suggested that if Tsukada were of \\"low grade leaf morphology\\" to Davidia then the two genera might have been closer in relation to Escalloniaceae than to the Cornales. However molecular phylogeny in the years after Wolfe and Wehrs description of Tsukada has shown Davidia to be a member of the Cornales, and placed in to the family Nyssaceae. At least one fossil from the One Mile Creek flora has a distinct fossil insect gall on the leaf midrib. The ovoid gall has multiple chambers and several circular exit holes along its margin. There have not been recorded galls on specimens of the living Davidia. The galls are most similar to those of the Cecidomyiidae gall midges, and its suggested the gall was caused by a cecidomyiid species. Description Leaves of Davidia involucrata Leaves of Tsukada have a simple pinnate vein structure, with secondary veins that are craspedodromous, reaching all the way to the leaf margins. There are no intersecondary veins crossing between the major secondary veins, while the tertiary veins run at acute angles to the secondary veins with some of the tertiary veins branching. The quaternary vein structure has an overall reticulated patterning that forms generally four sided areolae. The margin of the leaves is toothed, with at least one tooth to each secondary vein reaching the margin. The teeth are entered by a secondary vein near the middle and the tips of the teeth show an indistinct glandular region at the tip. There are six pairs of secondary veins, with each pair branching from the middle primary vein at approximately a 45¬∞ angle. The veins each curve broadly from the primary vein towards the leaf margin and, with the exception of the basal secondary pair, forking once from the lower side of the vein. The veins that fork from the secondaries angling out to the margin as a craspedodromous vein that reaches the margin, or as a camptodromous vein that curves right before reaching the margin. The basal secondary vein pair is weakly formed, angling off the primary vein at an 80¬∞ angle and each have seven external veins branching off the basal side. The petiole of the leaf is slightly cordate, being bracketed on each side by the leaf blade.

Bishop Mathias Loras, the first Bishop of Dubuque, founded the a Catholic institution of higher education in his residence in 1839. St. Raphael's Seminary, primarily for the education of priests, was probably the first college established in what would become the State of Iowa. with The Brothers of Christian Instruction, a French teaching order recruited to the diocese of Loras, contributed their services to the seminary. The school was expanded in 1850 when he began the construction of three new buildings on Table Mound that he named Mount St. Bernard College and Seminary. The Rev. Andrew Trevis, who was later influential in the development of Sacred Heart Cathedral in Davenport, was the rector at the time the building was constructed. The three-story limestone combination Federal and Greek Revival structure was designed by local architect Hugh V. Gildea. It was built for $10,000, which was a lot of money for the diocese at that time. It is unknown when the frame, gable-roofed barn with a stone foundation was built. A number of factors conspired to close Mount Saint Bernard, including economic conditions and a lack of clergy. Another factor was the Provincial Council of St. Louis decided in 1856 that one seminary in the St. Louis Province, of which the Diocese of Dubuque was a part, was enough. Loras, who spent a good deal of time here even working in the fields, decided to close the school. The students were sent to other seminaries while the clergy who taught here were placed in parishes. The archdiocese continued to maintain the buildings until 1900. In 1937 a cross of galvanized steel was erected on the property in 1937 in honor the centennial of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. Beginning in 1963 it was illuminated with a turquoise colored light funded by the local Knights of Columbus. The old seminary building has been converted into a residence. It and the barn were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

He may have been a descendant of Sir Thomas Stewart, Master of Mar. Early life and ancestry David Thompson was born in Corstorphine, a village in the Kingdom of Scotland. His father was the Reverend Richard Thomson (c. 1564-1606), who had received an ecclesiastical appointment from James VI of Scotland (reigned 1567‚Äì1625). The identity of David's mother is unknown. His stepmother (Richard Thomson's second wife) was Agnes Foulis. Richard Thomson was a son of Bernard Thomson and Agnes Balzert. His paternal grandparents were Alexander Thomson (d. 1587) and Janet Gourlay. His great- grandparents were Alexander Thomson (c. 1460-1513) and Margaret Forrester. This Alexander died in combat during the Battle of Flodden (1513). Margaret was reportedly a great-granddaughter of John Forrester of Corstorphine, who had served as Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland. Alexander Thomson (c. 1460-1513) was thought to be a son or grandson of Thomas Stewart, Master of Mar. The name Thomson is a Scottish patronymic surname, and literally means \\"son of Thomas\\". Thomas Stewart was a son of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar (d. 1435), grandson to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, and great-grandson of Robert II of Scotland and Elizabeth Mure. David Thompson is first mentioned in 1602, when he received a bursary to attend the University of Edinburgh and study philosophy. As a teenager David Thompson traveled to the New England Colonies, as part of the Popham Colony (in Maine) in 1607. He returned to England and married Amias Cole, the daughter of a shipyard owner, and they had three children, Ann, Priscilla, and John, before Thompson returned to New England. In England, Thompson came to know Squanto before his return to Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Thompson sailed with Squanto to New England in 1619. Thompson helped rescue a stranded Native American boy on the Isle of Shoals during his 1619 trip, and the boy was given to Thompson as a servant by the local sachem. Background of founding the New Hampshire colony The colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on the division in 1629 of a land grant given in 1622 by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason (former governor of Newfoundland) and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named \\"New Hampshire\\" by Mason after the English county of Hampshire, one of the first Saxon shires. John Mason sent David Thompson to set up the first settlement. David Thompson first settled at Odiorne's Point in Rye (near Portsmouth) with a group of fishermen from England in 1623, just three years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. The settlers built a fort, manor house and other buildings, some for fish processing, on Flake Hill at the mouth of the Piscataqua River, naming the settlement \\"Pannaway Plantation\\". In 1623 the English explorer Christopher Levett, an associate of Gorges and a member of the Council for New England, wrote of visiting Thompson at his Pannaway Plantation. Early historians believed the first native-born New Hampshirite, John Thompson, was born there; later he was found to have been baptized at St. Andrew's Parish in Plymouth, England, in 1619. Disappearance after moving to Boston David Thompson had been sent by Mason, to be followed a few years later by Edward and William Hilton. Thompson moved his family to an island in Boston Harbor (today called Thompson Island in his honor) in 1626, and he may have had a fur trading post on the island prior to moving there. The Thompsons became some of the first European settlers of Boston, Massachusetts. David Thompson disappeared in 1628 and was never heard from again. Some historians theorize he was the victim of foul play. Others suggest that he accidentally drowned in Boston Harbor. Thompson's widow, Amias (1596‚Äì1672), remarried to Samuel Maverick of Noddle's Island. Thompson's son later successfully recovered ownership of the island from the town of Dorchester, before another party acquired it.Ralph E. Thompson and Matthew R. Thompson.

Location Another view of Burncourt Castle Burncourt Castle is located 5.4 km (3.4 mi) northwest of Ballyporeen, on the west bank of the River Tar. History The castle was originally known as Everard's Castle, and was built by Richard Everard, 1st Baronet (d. 1650), son of politician and judge Sir John Everard. When Richard married Catherine Plunkett in 1620, his father awarded him a large estate around the River Tar. Around 1639 Sir Richard some of his land and began to build a fortified house. It was complete in 1641, and had 26 gables and seven chimneys. Archeological investigation found a cow skeleton in a pit that extended under the east wall of the castle. The cow appeared to have been killed and dismembered and left as a protective votive offering ‚Äì the flanks were placed next to each other and the head placed on the upper backbone. The Everards took up residence just as the Irish Rebellion of 1641 began. In 1642 Sir Richard joined the Catholic Confederates at Kilkenny and became a member of the Supreme Council. Sir Richard's wife Catherine remained at the castle. In 1649, as Oliver Cromwell's Roundheads advanced on Everard's Castle, Lady Catherine burned it down, earning it the name of the Burned Court. Sir Richard Everard went on fight at the Siege of Limerick (1650‚Äì51), but was captured and hung in 1651 by Henry Ireton. Burncourt was abandoned. According to tradition Burncourt was seven years in building, seven years lived in and seven days burning. In the early 18th century, the painter Anthony Chearnley built a house adjoining the Burncourt ruin. The excavation also showed that there was no remaining debris from the castle burning, meaning that the roof slates and lead flashings were salvaged/looted for use elsewhere. Building The castle has a rectangular centre block and large square towers at each corner. Whilst architecturally a most impressive building, there is little of great interest except for the long line of corbels over the entrance on the south side, visible here, and the floral motifs on the hood over the doorway which I have also photographed. Burncourt Castle is a large gabled fortified house, with a central block four bays long and four storeys high including basement and attic. It has four large square flanking towers, each five storeys. Along the front are corbels for a machicolation which runs the full length of the centre block. There is a fine central doorway with a hood mould and decorated label stops. The castle has mullioned and transomed windows with good square hood moulds. There are fireplaces in the east wall, the north wall and within the flanking towers. Parts of the bawn, with a corner turret, can still be seen nearby. The cellar floor was cobbled with cobblestones of irregular sizes, and covered with a ceiling high.

Sugar cane in Australia  Sugar cane was first brought to Australia in 1788, but subsequent plantings at Sydney, Port Macquarie and Norfolk Island failed to be commercially viable. Captain Louis Hope grew a cane crop successfully in Queensland in 1862. By 1864 the first commercial sugar mill in Australia had been established by him at Ormiston and interest in growing sugar cane spread rapidly, encouraged by the Queensland Government. By 1867 an estimated 2000 acres were under cane in the Brisbane area and by the end of the decade, cane had also been successfully established further north at Maryborough, Mackay and Bundaberg, where the warmer climate proved more suitable.  History  William Clark had experimented with sugar cane growing at Bli Bli in the 1860s, but in 1869 a group of Quakers took up land near the junction of the Mooloolah River and Sippy Creek, planted sugar cane and erected a crushing mill. This project was abandoned after severe flooding in the 1870s, but cane was grown successfully in other parts of the district including Buderim, where in 1876 Joseph Chapman Dixon, one of the Mooloolah growers, established a mill in order to process his own cane and that of neighbouring farms. In 1881 the Buderim Mountain Sugar Mill was established and also served many small farms, but both mills had failed by the end of the decade. In 1893, the Sugar Works Guarantee Act was passed. This provided capital for the erection of central sugar mills in districts with many small farms by offering loans to incorporated companies, so that growers could develop their own mills. The Moreton Central Sugar Mill Company was formed in December 1894. Land bounded by the North Coast railway line on the west and Gympie Road on the east was purchased for a mill site at the small settlement of Nambour. Erection of a mill by Caskie and Thompson began in late 1895. In order for the mill to be successful, it was essential to establish an efficient means for bringing the harvested cane in from surrounding farms to be crushed. Tramway networks carrying wagons drawn by steam locomotives had been used effectively in other Queensland sugar districts since the 1880s, so possible routes for a tramway network were surveyed as part of the planning for the Moreton Mill. A two-foot (610mm) gauge was chosen for the sake of economy, speed not being an important factor in the running of the tramway, though the wagons were at first pulled by horses. In 1897 the first tramlines were constructed east to Perrin's Barn and west to the foot of the Perwillowen Range and the first harvest was crushed at the mill.  Closure  The Moreton Central Sugar Mill ended crushing operations in late 2003 and was demolished in 2006. Prior to the mill's closure, Finasucre (Belgium) bought Bundaberg Sugar Ltd. Between 1980 and 2003 more than 1,000 hectares of cane land in Maroochy Shire were lost to urban development and other uses. This meant that some cane was being brought to the mill from 60 or 70 kilometres away. As it is important that cane is crushed soon after harvesting to maintain its sugar content, this had an adverse effect on the functioning of the mill. The price of sugar also fell and a crisis was reached in 2002. It was decided that Moreton Mill would close. Its last crush took place on 3 December 2003. The majority of the tramlines were removed by Bundaberg Sugar as part of an agreement with landowners from whom the tramline corridor was leased. The section of line covered by this entry represents its use as a transport system for both cane and passengers and as an unusual feature of the Nambour. The former Moreton Mill Site was purchased by Coles who have developed a multi-storey shopping complex trading under the title 'Nambour Mill Village'.  Railway  The main cane tramway is laid directly into the centre of the roadway and runs through the central business district of Nambour. It is of a 2-foot (610 mm) gauge and travels between the road reserve in front of the former mill site in Mill Street, across the Currie Street intersection and down Howard Street to the marshalling yards where it continues to other parts of the region. After the mill's closure the majority of the rail network was removed and locomotives were auctioned or donated to the Nambour & District Historical Museum Association. Steam locomotives were utilised at the mill until the 1980s but at the same time were also operating Diesel and V8 petrol locomotives. The former Howard Street Marshalling Yards were purchased by Aldi Supermarkets who have developed an Aldi Supermarket on the location.  Cane Farming  The mill's tramway network connected the many farms to the mill, ensuring quick transportation. The farms stretched from the Nambour region to areas near Coolum Beach, Valdora and Noosa. By 1967, when the Sunshine Coast was officially named, the mill's tramway was 70 miles long, as it required to receive the maximum amount of local sugar.

Having captained the South Australian State team against Western Australia in Adelaide in 1918, she remained its captain from 1920 to 1936. Tazewell was selected in the Australian team (Australia women's national hockey team) in 1925, 1928, 1929 and in 1930-36. In 1930 the team entered the Empire Tournament in South Africa, and toured Britain and Europe. In 1935, she captained Australia against New Zealand in Melbourne. Next year she was vice-captain when Australia played at the International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations tournament in the United States of America. She retired from playing hockey in 1940, but continued coaching Aroha, Woodlands Church of England Girls' Grammar School (who became champions under her guidance), Adelaide Girls' High School and the South Australian team (1946‚Äì51). Sports administration career During a sporting administration career that spanned four decades to the 1960s, she was a member of the South Australian executive, selection and umpires committees. Tazewell was president of the All-Australian Women's Hockey Association (now Hockey Australia) in 1920 and State delegate in 1920-65. After World War II she helped to convert an almond and orange orchard into the Women's Memorial Playing Fields at St Mary's, Adelaide; the grounds were dedicated to Australian nurses who had perished in Banka Strait, off Sumatra, in 1942. Tazewell was a delegate to the International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations in 1953 and 1959. In 1972 she retired as an umpire. Awards and recognition Her name is inscribed in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in Melbourne and she was an inaugural inductee to the Hockey Australia Hall of Fame. Hockey SA have named an umpiring award after her - the \\"Evelyn Tazewell Outstanding Umpire Service to Women‚Äôs Hockey\\" - which is presented annually at the Hockey SA Awards Night. Her Australian blazer and hockey stick are displayed at the State Hockey Centre (South Australia) in Adelaide.

It has a single hairy leaf and a greenish-yellow and red flower on an unusually tall spike, considering the small size of the flower. Since its discovery in 1923 and collections made in 1923 it was thought to be extinct, until rediscovered in 1986.  Description  Caladenia cristata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. It usually produces a single flower wide and long, on the end of a stalk tall. The flowers are greenish- yellow and red with a brownish labellum. The dorsal sepal is erect, lance- shaped and about long. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, wider than the dorsal sepal, spread widely and taper to a point. The petals are a similar shape to the sepals but narrower and about long. The labellum is brownish-red with a smooth edge and curves downward near the tip. There are densely crowded, tall, red-tipped calli in the centre of the labellum. The column is almost as long as the labellum and curves forward with two wide wings. Flowering occurs from August to late September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia cristata was first formally described by Richard Sanders Rogers in 1923 and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia from a specimen found in the Murchison district by \\"Dr. E.S. Simpson\\". The specific epithet (cristata) is a Latin word meaning \\"tufted\\" or \\"crested\\" referring to the tall labellum calli.  Distribution and habitat  The crested spider orchid was thought to be extinct when no specimens were seen after a collection made in 1932. Plants found in 1977 were initially thought to be C. cristata but were later recognised as a new species, Caladenia voigtii. Specimens were found near Miling nine years later and the species is now known to occur between Pithara, Wongan Hills and Watheroo in the Avon Wheatbelt and Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic regions, growing on higher ground above salt lakes and flats. Conservation Caladenia cristata is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. Surveys carried out by volunteers in 2011 located 932 plants at three of the previously known populations, but 867 were at a single location and none was found at the other three. The main threats to the population are rising salinity, grazing by rabbits and goats, weeds and habitat degradation.

Notecard from Republican brain-storming session on which \\"Repeal and replace\\" slogan originated, March 2010  Background  President Donald Trump and many Republicans have vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare; President Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2017, his first day in office, that according to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer would \\"ease the burden of Obamacare as we transition from repeal and replace\\". Spicer would not elaborate further when asked for more details. On January 12, 2017, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to pass an FY2017 budget resolution, S.Con.Res. 3, that contained language allowing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the budget reconciliation process, which disallows a filibuster in the Senate. In spite of efforts during the vote-a- rama (a proceeding in which each amendment was considered and voted upon for about 10 minutes each until all 160 were completed) that continued into the early hours of the morning, Democrats could not prevent \\"the GOP from following through on its repeal plans.\\"  Plans  Several media outlets have reported widespread opposition in Congress and the American public against repealing the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. Barack Obama has stated that ‚ÄúThe Republicans will own the problems with the health care system if they choose to repeal something that is providing health insurance to a lot of people‚Äù.  Early proposals  According to obamacarefacts.com, a website supportive of the Affordable Care Act, the proposed CARE Act reverts many of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. Senator Rand Paul has said he plans to introduce a replacement plan during the week of January 9, 2017. One key provision in his coming plan is to offer cheaper, less robust insurance plans for people. Senators Susan Collins (Maine) and Bill Cassidy (La.) introduced their plan, the Patient Freedom Act of 2017, on January 23, 2017, which would offer states the option to retain the Affordable Care Act, if they chose, or receive a block grant to be used on an alternative plan they prefer. House legislation =American Health Care Act= CBO estimated in May 2017 that the Republican AHCA would reduce the number of persons with health insurance by 23 million during 2026, relative to current law. AHCA (Republican healthcare bill) impact on income distribution, as of the year 2022. Net benefits would go to families with over $50,000 income on average, with net costs to those below $50,000. Those earning over $200,000, the top 6%, would get about 70% of the benefits. CBO projections of persons without health insurance under 65 years of age (%) under various legislative proposals and current law. A comprehensive plan to replace the Affordable Care Act was announced by the House Republican leadership on March 6, 2017. It retains many features of the Affordable Care Act, but replaces ACT's system of subsidies with tax credits and federally-funded Medicaid coverage with a system of block grants to states based on the nature and number of recipients served. Conservative critics such as Rand Paul characterized the plan as \\"Obamacare Light\\" and continued to advocate total repeal, while other Republicans such as Cory Gardner from states which had accepted Medicaid expansion expressed worry about whether the new plan would adequately fund services for Medicaid patients. The United States House Committee on Ways and Means approved one portion of the bill on March 9, 2017 after an all-night session. The second portion of the bill was also approved March 9 by the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce on a party-line vote. On March 13 the Congressional Budget Office released its evaluation of the proposal. It projected a rise in uninsured by 24 million by 2028, but savings of $337 billion over ten years. In 2018, most of the reduction would be caused by the elimination of the penalties for the individual mandate, both directly and indirectly. Later reductions would be due to reductions in Medicaid enrollment, elimination of the individual mandate penalty, subsidy reduction, and higher costs for some persons. By 2016 the CBO estimates that the average amount paid for medical insurance would decrease by about 10%. That results from increased prices for older patients and reduced credits which is predicted to increase the proportion of younger people in the pool and reduce the proportion of older people. The bill was approved by the House Budget Committee 19 to 17 on March 16, 2017. Three members of the Freedom Caucus, Dave Brat (Va.), Mark Sanford (S.C.) and Gary Palmer (Ala.) voted against it. It went next to the House Rules Committee, then to the full House. The bill, once it passed the House, would go to the Senate under budget reconciliation rules. Thus, only material which affects the budget can be included and only a simple majority vote will be required in the Senate. Despite his vow not to get involved into day-to-day politics former President Obama became a part of the discussion on March 23, 2017 (the seventh anniversary of ACA and one day prior to the vote on the American Health Care Act) by hailing among other things 20 million more people insured, preexisting conditions covered, young people staying on their parents' plans until 26, lowered costs for women's health care and free preventive care as progress due to the Affordable Care Act. On March 24, 2017, the Bill was withdrawn by Speaker Paul Ryan (with the endorsement of President Donald Trump) after failing to gain enough support in the House of Representatives. On May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted in favor of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and passing the American Health Care Act with a narrow vote of 217 to 213, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation.\\"House Republicans repeal Obamacare, hurdles await in U.S. Senate\\", Reuters. Retrieved May 6, 2017. The Senate has indicated they will write their own version of the bill, instead of voting on the House version. =Other legislation= On March 7, 2017 Pete Sessions sponsored an alternate proposal to repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act entitled the \\"World's Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017\\". The bill's current format removes the ACA's individual mandate, which taxed individuals without health insurance. Moreover, it maintains some aspects of the ACA including ensuring insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, allowing children to stay on their parents' health care until they are 26 years old, and banning the use of lifetime spending limits by insurance companies.  Senate legislation  In response to the passage of the AHCA in the House, Republican leadership in the Senate stated that they would draft their own version of the legislation instead of bringing the House's version to a vote. Thirteen senators began meeting behind closed doors to draft the legislation. The group was criticized for not including women senators. In a meeting of the Senate Finance committee, Senator Claire McCaskill asked chairman Senator Orrin Hatch why no congressional hearings had been held on the proposed legislation. Video of the exchange went viral. In addition to forgoing normal hearings and legislative markup, Senate Republicans instituted new rules to limit the ability of reporters to ask senators about the legislation. When asked if Senate Republicans planned to release the text of the bill to the public, a Senate aide told Axios, \\"We aren't stupid.\\" According to Don Ritchie, Historian Emeritus of the Senate, such a secretive process has not been seen in the Senate in over a hundred years. On June 16, 2017, a bi-partisan group of seven current governors sent a letter to Senate Majority and Minority Leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer criticizing the House's legislation and requesting a bi-partisan effort in the Senate to reform healthcare. The signatories include Governors John Kasich (Ohio), Steve Bullock (Montana), Brian Sandoval (Nevada), John Bel Edwards (Louisiana), John Hickenlooper (Colorado), Charlie Baker (Massachusetts), and Tom Wolf (Pennsylvania). On July 18, 2017, the healthcare bill in the Senate collapsed following the defections of Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas, making them the third and fourth Republicans to defect. President Donald Trump expressed his disappointment and indicated he would \\"let Obamacare fail\\". On July 25, a procedural vote was passed by the Senate to begin debate on the healthcare bill, 51‚Äì50 with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie. The same day, the bill was soundly defeated 43‚Äì57, with nine Republicans defecting and no Democrats or Independents voting for the bill. As the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was stalled, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scheduled a vote on a partial-repeal amendment. This too was defeated, 45‚Äì55, with 7 Republicans defecting. Subsequently, a \\"skinny repeal\\" of the healthcare bill was voted on in the early hours of July 28. The decisive vote against their own party's bill was cast by Senators John McCain, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski; their vote along with the Democrats defeated the bill 49‚Äì51. On September 13, 2017, an amendment to the American Health Care Act, commonly known as Graham-Cassidy, was submitted. The bill is sponsored by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, with Bill Cassidy of Louisiana as a co- sponsor. A spokesman for the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that a vote is planned for, before September 30 which is the deadline to pass bills under budget reconciliation. Rand Paul and John McCain have indicated that they will vote against the bill. On September 26, 2017, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate would not vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill. ; Senators drafting the legislation * Mitch McConnell (R-KY) * John Cornyn (R-TX) * John Thune (R-SD) * John Barrasso (R-WY) * Lamar Alexander (R-TN) * Mike Enzi (R-WY) * Orrin Hatch (R-UT) * Ted Cruz (R-TX) * Mike Lee (R-UT) * Tom Cotton (R-AR) * Cory Gardner (R-CO) * Rob Portman (R-OH) * Pat Toomey (R-PA) References Proposed legislation of the 115th United States Congress Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act replacement proposals Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act replacement proposals Legislation attempting to reform or repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ","title":"2017 Affordable Care Act replacement proposals"},{"id":"52823119","text":"Mac Sumner (March 27, 1940 - May 7, 2007) was an American politician who served in the Oregon House of Representatives from 2005 until 2006.

In British Punjab, he and others defied British laws, looted pro-government rich people and fought against the oppression of the authorities. They saw themselves as the nationalist freedom fighters struggling for the cause of freedom but the government had labelled them as dakoo (dacoits).  Early life  Nizam Lohar was born in 1835 during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh to a poor Muslim family in the Tarn Taran district, which is located in between Lahore and Amritsar, part of British India at that time. By profession, he was a blacksmith who used to make weapons for the government and lived with his mother and a sister. From an early age, he opposed British governance in India. His family and friends were not very happy about this and advised him to stay away from such kind of ideology.  Rebellion  British imperial expansion in the form of the East India Company in the 1850's caused hatred and opposition among many natives, including Nizam. During this period, momentum of freedom fighters and their plans of waging a unified struggle against the foreign and pro-foreign rule elements were gaining considerable grounds. It is believed that Nizam once got into an argument with a British official who insulted India and as a result, the quarrel heated up and Nizam ended up killing him after which he joined Jeet Singh and Malkeet Singh, both prominent proponents of the Babbar Akali Movement. He supported the movement by producing and providing required weapons and also started attacking government personnel and pro-government rich people and distributing their money and valuables to the local poor people, just like the Robin Hood, who was a heroic outlaw in the English folklore. As a result, his strict surveillance was started by the British police on the denouncement of his activities of meeting and supporting rebels of 'Tehreek-e-Jang-e-Azadi' or the Independence Movement, which led him to stay outside of his home most of the times and sometimes evaded the authorities through the use of the Changa Manga (based on the names of the two dacoits, Changa and Manga, who escaped British prison and disappeared in the forest, looting travellers) jungle as a safe haven. One day, in his absence, several weapons were taken into possession from cellar in his home by the police. It is also suggested that the police captain Coll had raped his sister, which led her mother to death and Nizam to murder Captain Coll next night at the police station along with the murder of SP Ronald and other officers after few days. Soon he became a local hero and received support from the community. Later he freed Jabru (who belonged to Kasur) and Sooja Singh from British captivity who became his friends. They started a movement together called ‚ÄòPunjab Se Jao (Go From Punjab)‚Äô, which attracted many outlaws and rebels, and planned for a bloody revolution against the 'servants' of the British targeting large sum of officers in fairs and gatherings across Punjab. Meanwhile, Nizam went to see Sooja‚Äôs ill mother, who he considered as her own mother and came to know of Sooja‚Äôs affair with a Machan which was affecting Sooja's attention towards his mother and the movement. Nizam confronted him with anger and had a row over his passions affecting the movement and his own personal life. Machan started provoking Sooja‚Äôs integrity over Nizam's perceived authority upon knowing this, leading Sooja to denounce Nizam‚Äôs whereabouts and intentions at a police station.  Death  Acting upon Sooja's piece of information, the police surrounded Nizam's place and there was a crossfire between police and Nizam for 48 hours and later he died. Furious with anger over the betrayal of his son, Sooja‚Äôs mother murdered him in front of Jabru and told him to remain a witness of this murder and the motive behind. Due to a huge number of people willing to attend, it is believed that British authorities set a fee of 2 rupees per attendee on Nizam's funeral and gathered a revenue of 35000 rupees at that time, as about 18,000 people attended the funeral (1000 of them paid only 1 rupees each).  In popular culture  The story of Nizam Lohar has appeared many times, in many different variations, in popular modern works. The following are some of the notable depictions in film and television:  Films  * Nizam Lohar: starring Neelo, Yasmeen & Allaudin; directed by Jamil Akhter (1966). * Nizam Daku: starring Yousaf Khan, Sultan Rahi & Salma Mumtaz; directed by Waheed Dar (1979). * Nizam: starring Naghma, Sudhir & Sultan Rahi; directed by Sudhir.

It is located approximately 5 miles from the mouth of the Hillsborough River, about 1 mile above the Hillsborough Avenue bridge in what is now the neighborhood of Seminole Heights. It is a full service shipyard with wet slips and a Travelift for hauling vessels from the water. History In the 18th century the watershed for the Hillsborough River was covered in old growth forest of bald cypress, longleaf pine, and sand live oak. After the construction of Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River settlers began moving into what would be the Tampa area . While the area of the river near the mouth were populated and a center of trade, the need arose for a shipyard where local craft could be built and existing craft could be hauled, repaired and maintained. The shipyard was first established in 1843, as far upriver as was navigable on good solid ground. This allowed the shipyard to be surrounded by good quality shipbuilding material, as well as protect it from storms and weather. A massive wharf was built for the loading of local cargo, but the primary function of the shipyard was servicing and repairing riverboats, skiffs, barges, and local sloops. The site was equipped with a machine shop, wood shop, a marine hardware store, and railways for hauling vessels from the water. James McKay, a schooner captain, was one of the first owners of the shipyard and used the facilities to maintain his cargo and trading vessels, including steamships, schooners, sloops, skiffs, and barges. McKay was heavily invested in Tampa, owning a general store and a sawmill. He also owned two schooners that he used in the cargo trade with Cuba, Central America, and South America. McKay was elected mayor of Tampa in 1859. During the American Civil War in 1863, Union forces attacked and burned two ships: the steamship \\"Scottish Chief\\" and the sloop \\"Kate Dale\\" that were moored at the shipyard for maintenance work and to load cargo for their roles as blockade runners, both ships owned by James McKay. This was the only major skirmish Tampa saw during the Civil War and is referred to as the Battle of Fort Brooke. In 1909, the Federal government funded the dredging of the Hillsborough River to twelve feet from the mouth to Jean Street Shipyard (then known as the Tampa Steam Ways Co.). Around this time the shipyard was bought by Harry C. White, who renamed the site to \\"White's Marine Ways and Boatworks\\" in 1928. During the 1920s and early 1930s the shipyard was one of the many small boat builders in Tampa to build racing powerboats, of which many races and regattas were held along the Hillsborough River.http://www.jeanstreetshipyard.com In 1947, Harry White sold the shipyard to Clinton J. Johnson who founded \\"Johnson's Boat Works\\", \\"Johnson Sails\\" (now known as JSI and currently operating out of St Petersburg), and \\"Hillsborough Yacht Storage, Inc.\\" on the same site. Charley Morgan got his start in the sailing industry working afternoons and weekends while he was in high school for Johnson Sails at Jean Street Shipyard. He later went on to building the Brisote, a 27' yawl in which he raced from St. Petersburg, FL to Havana, Cuba at age 17. After getting out of high school he started his own sail company, eventually going to design many sailing vessels, owning his own sailboat production company Morgan Yachts, and even designing and building an America's Cup contender. Since the 1970s, Jean Street Shipyard has been used primarily for the repair and storage of boats. It remains in operation to this day with a working TraveLift and repair shop, as well as marine hardware store.

Inc. after Verizon acquired Yahoo's Internet business. Verizon completed its acquisition on June 13, 2017, and put the assets under a new subsidiary named Yahoo! Holdings within its newly created division, Oath. After the transaction, Yahoo! Inc. had no operating business but retained its cash holdings, partnership investments and bond portfolio, as well as certain patents that Verizon did not purchase. It reorganized as an investment fund and changed its name to Altaba Inc. on June 16. The only Yahoo! - branded interest held by Altaba was its stake in the joint venture Yahoo! Japan, which it sold to the SoftBank Group in late 2018.  History   1994‚Äì2017: Yahoo! Inc.  In January 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo, who were Electrical Engineering graduate students, created a website named \\"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\\". The Guide was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In April 1994, Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web was renamed \\"Yahoo!\\". The word \\"YAHOO\\" is a backronym for \\"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\\" or \\"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.\\" The yahoo.com domain was created on January 18, 1995. Yahoo! grew rapidly throughout the 1990s and diversified into a web portal, followed by numerous high-profile acquisitions. The company's stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble and closed at an all-time high of US$118.75 in 2000; however, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached an all- time low of US$8.11 in 2001. Yahoo! formally rejected an acquisition bid from the Microsoft Corporation in 2008. In early 2012, the largest layoff in Yahoo!'s history was completed and 2,000 employees (14 percent of the workforce) lost their jobs. Carol Bartz replaced co-founder Jerry Yang as CEO in January 2009, but was fired by the board of directors in September 2011; Tim Morse was appointed as interim CEO following Bartz's departure. Former PayPal president Scott Thompson became CEO in January 2012 and after he resigned was replaced by Ross Levinsohn as the company's interim CEO on May 13, 2012. On July 16, former Google executive Marissa Mayer, became the CEO of the company. The media reported on Yahoo!'s interest in the video streaming site Hulu on May 26, 2013. Under Mayer's leadership, Yahoo!'s bid is worth between US$600 and $800 million, as a variety of options that consist of different circumstances were put forward by the company. As of May 28, 2013, Yahoo!'s videos attract 45 million unique visitors a month, while Hulu has 24 million visitors‚Äîthe combination of the two audiences can place Yahoo! in the second-most popular position after Google and its subsidiary YouTube. Data collated by comScore during July 2013 revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo! websites during the month in comparison to Google websites‚Äîthe occasion was the first time that Yahoo! outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not incorporate visit statistics for the Yahoo!-owned Tumblr website or mobile phone usage. On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach in which hackers stole information associated with at least 500 million user accounts in late 2014. According to the BBC, this was the largest technical breach reported to date. Specific details of material taken include names, email addresses, telephone numbers, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, dates of birth, and encrypted passwords. The breach used manufactured web cookies to falsify login credentials, allowing hackers to gain access to any account without a password. On December 14, 2016 a separate data breach, occurring earlier around August 2013 was reported. This breach affected over 1 billion user accounts and is again considered the largest discovered in the history of the Internet. On June 13, 2017, following the departure of Marissa Mayer, Thomas J. McInerney was appointed chairman and CEO of Yahoo! Inc.  2017‚Äì2019: Altaba Inc.  On June 16, 2017, the company that remained after Verizon Communications purchased the core Internet businesses of Yahoo! Inc. was renamed Altaba Inc. The new company, listed by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a \\"non-diversified, closed-end management investment company,\\" immediately began trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol AABA. In September 2018, Altaba settled three lawsuits relating to Yahoo's data breaches for $47 million. On September 17, 2018, Altaba announced the sale of their stake in Yahoo Japan Corporation for $4.3 billion. On the same day, Altaba announced a $5.75 billion repurchase program. On April 3, 2019, Altaba announced in a press release that it would sell its stake in Alibaba Group and shut down. The company would shut down in the fourth quarter of 2019. On October 2, 2019, Altaba stopped trading on the Nasdaq at the close of the day, and pursuant to its Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution, filed a certificate of dissolution in Delaware (where Altaba is domiciled), on October 4. A small amount of funds will be withheld for potential Chinese taxes on the sale of its stake in the Alibaba Group.  Assets  Altaba owned Excalibur IP, a patent company, controlled a significant minority interest in Alibaba Group (16.3%) until it sold its stake in 2019, and maintained investments in Hortonworks, Gomaji, Envestnet, Rimage Corporation, SeatGeek, Protagenic Therapeutics, Eastman Kodak Company, and Paperless Post. The Fund‚Äôs external investment advisors included BlackRock Advisors, LLC and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. The company divested itself of all holdings in Snap Inc.
