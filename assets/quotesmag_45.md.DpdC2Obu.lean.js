Early life Nichols grew up in Maine and attended the Massachusetts Memorial School of Nursing and earned a bachelor's degree in nursing from Case Western Reserve University. She worked at Boston Children's Hospital before joining the United States Navy. Nichols said that in her early days as a nurse, she felt that her opinions were sometimes ignored because of her race, and she said that these experiences pushed her to become a nurse leader. Career At the U.S. Naval Hospital in St. Albans, Queens, Nichols was a head nurse. After leaving the Navy Nurse Corps, Nichols moved to Wisconsin, where she worked as a nurse at St. Mary's Hospital in Madison. In 1970, Nichols became president of the Wisconsin Nurses Association. As of 2013, she was still the only black president in the organization's history. Nichols earned a master's degree at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison.

Since 2002, he has been Special Consultant to the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China. Education and government career Chau was born in 1943 in Hong Kong. He was graduated from the St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong in 1961 and the University of Hong Kong in 1967 and joined the Hong Kong government on the same year. During his early career, Chau was involved in the formulation of Hong Kong's foreign trade policies, establishing and negotiating the bilateral textiles arrangements between Hong Kong and importing countries under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), at the time when Hong Kong textiles industry was booming. In 1979, Chau was appointed as Hong Kong's permanent representative to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and served until 1984. After he returned to Hong Kong in 1984, he continued to serve in many positions, including Regional Secretary for Hong Kong and Kowloon in the City and New Territories Administration and Secretary for Health and Welfare from 1988 to 1989. In that capacity, he was also an official member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. In 1990, his position dropped as the Director-General of Trade, where he responded with \\"a step back after a year a boundless as the sea and sky\\". After a year, he was re-promoted to Secretary for Trade and Industry from 1991 and 1995 and Secretary for Broadcasting, Culture and Sport from November 1995 to March 1998. In 1990, he famously commented on Singapore by noting that Singapore had \\"advantages\\" over Hong Kong's in implementing unpopular policies to tackle the economic downturn (such as wage cuts) because the People's Action Party has nearly complete control over parliament, the media, trade unions and the people. He further added: \\"Of course we are different from Singapore. The opposition parties in Singapore do not raise opposition. If they do raise opposition, the might be arrested...our legislative council has 60 opposition members.\\" The Straits Times replied with a bitter editorial that denounced Chau's \\"misinformed and inaccurate comments.\\" He was appointed again as Secretary for Trade and Industry in March 1998 in which the position was renamed Secretary for Commerce and Industry in July 2000.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Whittier House stands in a rural area of southern Danville, on the west side of Greenbanks Hollow Road a short way north of the Greenbanks Hollow Covered Bridge. It is a single-story wood-frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with plain cornerboards and a narrow frieze. The center entrance has a Georgian surround, with sidelight windows and pilasters beneath a corniced entablature. The interior retains many features original to its period of construction, although its original large central chimney was replaced early in the 19th century. It follows a typical Georgian central chimney plan, with a narrow entry vestibule with winding stair, and parlor spaces on either side. These are noteworthy for the Georgian paneling on the end walls. At the time of its National Register listing in 1984, it lacked all modern amenities, including plumbing and electricity. with David Whittier, the builder of this house, was one of the first settlers of Danville, who was granted in 1786. Whittier was from Methuen, Massachusetts, and likely styled this house after a form common to northeastern Massachusetts from the late 17th to mid-18th century. The gambrel roof form gave the upper level additional space, and conveyed a sense prosperity amid more conventionally built gabled Capes that were more common in northern Vermont. Greenbanks Hollow, where he built, was for some years a small thriving community, with a sawmill and gristmill. The mills burned in the late 19th century, leaving little more than foundations nearby.

Security forces identified the vehicle as a threat as it approached a checkpoint, causing the attackers to leave their car, detonate their explosives and open fire with AK-47 rifles. Gunfire broke out between police and the men suspected to have orchestrated the attack. Two terrorists were shot dead at the scene, while a third terrorist is thought to have escaped. Kurdish police officer Fethi Sekin, who identified the vehicle shouting \\"Terrorists!\\" and stopped the attack by triggering the gunfight, was killed after shooting at least one of the suspects.

Early life Owen was born in Pickering Brook, Western Australia (on the outskirts of Perth), to Mary Ellen (n√©e Passmore) and Oliver Edward Owen. He graduated from the University of Western Australia in 1923 with a diploma in agriculture, and later returned to university to complete a Bachelor of Science degree, which he received in 1934. Owen began working for the Agriculture Department in 1924, initially at the head office in Perth. He was later based for periods in Kalamunda, Manjimup, and Mount Barker. Owen worked for the Agriculture Department until entering parliament in 1944. He was also a part-time lecturer in horticulture at the University of Western Australia between 1935 and 1941, and from 1942 to 1944 was seconded to the federal Department of Commerce and Agriculture as an inspector of canned fruits and vegetables.Raymond Cecil Owen ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

He stood as an \\"Independent Country\\" candidate, and polled 59.95 percent of the two-candidate-preferred vote to defeat Labor, Nationalist, and Country Party candidates. Owen ran as an independent at the 1947 state election, but lost his seat to Gerald Wild of the Liberal Party. Later in the year, he was elected to the Darling Range Road Board, which became the Shire of Kalamunda in 1961. He served as a councillor until 1965, including as either road board chairman or shire president for most of that time. In 1949, Owen formally joined the Country Party. He stood in the new seat of Darling Range at the 1950 state election, and was elected by a narrow margin over a Liberal candidate. He increased his majority in 1953, and was re-elected unopposed in 1956 and with a large majority in 1959. However, at the 1962 election, Owen lost his seat to the Liberal Party's Ken Dunn in a three-cornered contest. On first preferences, Dunn beat Owen by just a single vote. He successfully petitioned the Court of Disputed Returns for the election to be overturned, but was again defeated by Dunn at the resulting by- election. Owen attempted to reclaim the seat at the 1965 state election, but was defeated a third time. Later life After leaving parliament, Owen retired to his orchard. He was president of the Western Australian Fruitgrowers' Association from 1967 to 1970, and also contributed articles to agricultural journals. Owen died at a nursing home in Bicton in January 2003, aged 97. He had married Flora Margaret Hewison in 1933, with whom he had four children.

In some belief systems, Wen Shen is identified as a single entity who commands wen spirits; in others, the term is used for a grouping of several distinct deities. Description The earliest mention of a group of pestilence gods in Chinese mythology is from the Li wei xi ming zheng , an apocryphal Confucian commentary dating from the Han dynasty. This describes three sons of the Emperor Zhuanxu, all three of whom died at birth and became spirits of disease. Over time, these spirits became conflated with the \\"five wet ghosts\\" of the Longyu hetu and formed the basis for later groupings of pestilence gods. The term Wen Shen is used to refer to the Five Commissioners of Pestilence . The Five Commissioners, who governed Heaven's Ministry of Epidemics, were Zhang Yuanbo , Liu Yuanda , Zhao Gongming , Zhong Shigui , and Shi Wenye . The first four were associated with the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter respectively) while Shi Wenye was associated with the center and was the superior god of pestilence. In the Zhengyi wensi bi dushen dengyi , which dates from the Tang dynasty, the five gods are associated with the points of the compass. In traditional Chinese folk beliefs, Wen Shen was believed to release plagues and pestilence upon the world in punishment for the misdeeds of humanity and prayers or offerings were necessary to placate them. Sometimes the placatory rituals would be performed by an entire community. An alternative to offerings was to use a model boat to symbolically carry the pestilence away; this was a tradition of the Wen Shen cult in Taiwan. As another alternative, the Taoist exorcist Lu Shizhong claimed that the deities could be exorcised by simply calling their name three times. Many temples were established to honor and propitiate these deities. In 1960, there were over such 730 temples recorded in Taiwan alone. Crab apples were regarded as talismans against Wen Shen.

It is a governing system of rules, structures and institutions that guide, control, and lead supply chains, through policies and regulations, with the goal of creating greater efficiency. Governing systems are put into place by different actors, such as international organizations and individual firms, within the global supply chain. The global supply chain is the process of transforming raw materials into an end product, which often occurs in several different countries, moving products and services from producers to consumers. Through increased globalization and international codependency, this process is expanding. This has led to the idea that there should be governing system in place to help guide these global supply chains to perform more efficiently. There is not always a distinction made between supply-chain management and global supply-chain governance though they are fundamentally different. Supply-chain management (SCM) is the actions taken to manage the system from within. It deals with the flow of materials through the global supply chain to ensure that the system produces efficiently per capita. Both systems are working to improve the efficiency of the global supply chain, the difference is that SCM deals with the products in the system and their efficiency in the system. SCG focus on the system as a whole and the interactions between firms. While the objective to SCG is to govern supply chains to operate in an efficient manner, not all actors implement the same models of governance to do this. The main conflicting models of governance strategy differ in how they understand the global supply chain. They put emphasis on different external and internal factors and how these differences affect policy decisions. These policies may come up against barriers in several different ways, such as when attempting to integrate policies across different cultures. While there are barriers to effective SCG, there are also facilitators that help in its promotion, such as collaborative planning across firms.  Objectives  Governance strategies are defined as a ‚Äúfirm‚Äôs objective to attain operational and strategic efficiencies through collaboration among internal functions and with other firms‚Äù. The various stakeholders that work together to encourage good governance are looking to ensure sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility in the international system. These stakeholders have vested interest in the capacity of the system to be sustainable and thus lobby for governance strategies that will support this goal. Different types of stakeholders will support the system in different capacities. Activists groups supporting a variety of causes are often engaged in promoting good governance. A guideline for ‚Äògood governance‚Äô has been developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This outline was created in reference to democratic governance and the governance of human development. However, the principals are applicable to the global supply chain as well. The five main principal that are identified as critical for good governance are; legitimacy, direction, performance, accountability, and fairness. Legitimacy is the principal that the governance strategy is built on a consensus of participation. Corporations must allow stakeholders to be involved in the policy formulation process in the global supply chain and their objectives and concerns must be represented in the final governance strategy. Direction refers to the strategic vision that the corporation has for the supply chain. It identifies what the true goal of a governance strategy is (cost reduction, corporate social responsibility, etc.). Performance measures the responsiveness of the institutions and the underlying structure that is being governed. It is a measure of effectiveness and whether the outcomes observed are desirable. Corporations must engage in this so they can verify that they are being successful at every level of the global supply chain. Accountability refers to the transparency of the policy as well as the process in which it was developed. Fairness considered the impartially of the governance strategy and an evaluation of the winners and losers. Within the global supply chain good governance looks like corporations at every level of production and distribution having autonomy within the governance formulation process. Everyone one of these good governance principles contributes to a sustainable and well functioning global supply chain.  Benefits  Corporations will engage in a governance strategy in order to achieve greater benefits from the global supply chain. While these decisions are most often in search of cost reduction strategies there are also some corporations that consider environmental factor and good corporate social relationships when creating a global supply-chain governance strategy. O'Shea, Golden, and Olander identify risks from global supply-chain disruptions as another of the primary pressures that influence governance strategy formulation and implementation. Supply of resources is critical in the global supply chain and any risks to the availability of resources must be seriously considered. Climate change and extreme weather patterns have a growing impact on the supply of key supply- chain inputs, this forces firms to take action in terms of preserving these resources and innovating around the problem (i.e. Finding a substitution). Environmental considerations being made in global supply-chain governance are also often an attempt to promote good corporate social relationships. Corporations wanting to engage in strong corporate social relationships may look to organizations such as the World Social Forum for governance advice. The world social forum is a civil society organizations that criticizes corporate governance organizations for their profit driven perception of the system creates winners and losers. The world social forum advocates for the groups that they feel are oppressed or exploited by the global supply chain. In the global supply-chain decision making is primarily profit driven. The strategies promoted by the World Social help to mitigate possible exploitation and ensure that corporations are implementing ethical as well as profitable governance strategies.  External pressures  The global supply chain is a complex and intricate system where goods are produced and distributed internationally. It is a system made up of a wide variety of actors and the interactions and cooperation of these actors determines the efficiency and effectiveness of this system. The ideology behind creating governance strategies to support this system is to improve the efficiency and to hold actors accountable to a certain standard. Governance strategies will look different depending on the actors and the situation they are created to guide. Each strategy must be created specifically for the situation and will be a result of the balance of powers between actors. The efficiency of the global supply-chain governance cannot be commented on as a whole, each corporation will instate their own governance strategy. That being said there is a basic theoretical understanding that supports the merits of having a governance strategy in place and encourages actors to take part in one. O‚ÄôRourke argues that there are two main external pressures being placed on actors in the global supply chain that contribute to the formulation of governance strategies. Regulatory pressures are placed on corporations engaging in the global supply chain to ensure best practises. Ranging from trade regulations to sustainability goals these pressure are enforced throughout the international community. Failing to uphold agreements at this level will affect a firm‚Äôs reputation and credibility. International institutions may not hold a lot of direct power but as a result of international legitimacy they have the ability to enforce regulations. Governance strategies can arise out of these regulations in order to uphold international ideas of best practice among actors. Competitive pressures are highly determinant in the global supply chain. Decisions made are primarily profit based and so governance strategies are highly dependent on what competition does. Lesson drawing between firms is a highly effective way for innovation to spread throughout the system and best practices to be identified. This can also be somewhat restrictive as regulator chill may result in the abandonment of some governance strategies. The final goal of these pressures is to create sustainability within the system meaning that it is a system that can withstand political, economic, social, environmental, and whatever challenges that it may face.  Just in Time  Just in time is a demand driven global supply-chain governance model. Corporations use this model to eliminate wastefulness in the global supply chain. While the model strives to save money there are other inherent benefits. The main objective of the Just in Time model is to eliminate the need for stocking inventory at every level of production in the global supply chain. By supplying materials only when they are needed corporations save on the cost of storage and the potential for overproduction of a product is eliminated. This models gives individuals within the global supply chain the autonomy to get the specific amount of stock.  Walmart's success  Walmart‚Äôs rise to dominance has been attributed to the global supply-chain governance strategies that have been employed. As the corporation has grown and the global economy changed around it, Walmart has consistently implemented successful global supply-chain governance strategies that ensure the highest profit is achieved. Walmart began by cutting out as many links in the supply chain as possible. By working directly with manufacturers Walmart was able to eliminate the cost of dealing with a middleman. Walmart also follows a model called Strategic Vendor Partnership where it they are ensure the lowers price by entering into a long-term partnership with the producer. This is a mutually beneficial partnership protecting the interesting of both actors. By streamlining this process of collaboration the corporation is able to secure a sustainable and efficient global supply chain.  Integration  Global supply-chain governance becomes more efficient with greater integration both internally and externally. Internal integration is defined as integration within a firm‚Äôs boundaries whereas external integration occurs \\"between a firm and its external partners, which highlights the importance of buyer/seller cooperation.\\" Internal integration focuses on coordination and collaborative efforts between all the different departments of the firm, such as HR and Marketing, Purchasing and Manufacturing etc. It is the unity of the firm. External integration focus is on its relationship with its partners and occurs when \\"two or more companies share the responsibility of exchanging common planning, management, execution, and performance measurement information.\\" This type of integration helps to establish competitiveness in the global business environment by allowing firms \\"to pool resources, exploit complementary skills and share information across firms.\\" External integration can be seen in the Just in Time model, where inventory is eliminated at the unnecessary levels of production. Firms that chose to have inventory at every level do not do this for efficiency but because of a lack of external integrated governance across the supply chain. Integration can be seen by firms involved in global supply chains as beneficial and thus worth the effort to implement. Studies have found that both integration types are beneficial to efficiency but when firms only focus on internal integration and ignore external integration, sub-optimal performance is likely to occur. Without the teamwork of external integration efforts, internal integration only focuses on individual efficiencies despite being a part of a larger supply chain.  Barriers to integration  Several explanations for why internal and external integration efforts within supply- chain governance may come up against barriers. Ellinger, Keller and Hansen argue the following are barriers to integration. Attempting to create a more integrated structure is limited when there is insufficient knowledge. Internal integration is limited when insufficient knowledge exists across different functions of the firm. External integration is limited when insufficient knowledge exists across different firms and levels of the supply chain. Lack of communication internally and across the entire supply chain is another barrier to integration. Poor working relationship is also an issue to integration efforts. When conflict or power struggles exists between different functions of the firm or between different levels of the supply-chain integration becomes challenging. Barriers can occur when there is not agreement on end goals between the different areas attempting to integrate. Finally, lack of direction from senior management can disrupt the efficiency of integration both internally and externally. These barriers to integration are found in the structuring and governing of global supply chains. Other barriers exist in the actual implementation of these systems. Such as ‚Äú lack of trust, failure to understand the importance of supply-chain integration, fear associated with losing control, misaligned goals and objectives, poor information systems, short-term as opposed to long-term focus, and supply- chain complexity issues‚Äù. Though these barriers to implementation are more an issue for supply-chain management, rather than supply-chain governance.  Facilitators of integration  Many of the barriers to integration efforts can be resolved and become facilitators to internal and external integration. Rickey, Roath, Whipple and Fawcett outline some of the facilitators to integration both internally and externally. Internal integration can be facilitated by encouraging inclusive communication within the firm, reducing inter-firm conflict and encourage strong working relationships, structure the different functions of the firm to foster joint accountability and encourage senior management involvement. External integration can be facilitated by encouraging collaborative efforts. By encouraging interdependence, firms are better able to eliminate inefficiencies because they both depend on each other. Common goals and objectives also facilitate this. Effective communication and information sharing also help to facilitate external integration through strong firm relationship.  Benefits to integration  Efficiencies are created when integration is done effectively. The benefits to creating greater integration allows for the same benefits that come from implementing supply-chain governance strategies in a broader sense (as integration is a part of that governance strategy). Disruptions in the supply chain are lessened, inventories are reduced to only exist at the necessary levels, unnecessary middlemen and levels of the supply chain are eliminated, transportation costs lessen, cycle times are improved, and customer service levels are heightened.

Completed in in a classical architectural style, it is the oldest purpose-built Greek Orthodox church in England and since 1980, a grade II listed building for its ‚Äúspecial architectural or historic interest‚Äù.Anon (1980) Historic England listed building no: Greek Church of the Annunciation and attached former Presbytery, historicengland.org.uk the church provides liturgies on Sundays and acts as a hub for a community of an estimated 2,500 Greek diaspora, particularly Greek Cypriots, British Cypriots and Greek students in Manchester.Yannopapas, John (2009) A church hall annexe is used for a Greek community school with over 100 pupils studying the culture of Greece, history of Greece and Greek language. The church hall is also used to celebrate events in the calendar of saints and the liturgical year such as Easter, Christmas and other traditions of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Architecture, building and artworks The church building is located on the Bury New Road (A56) in Broughton, Salford, and was designed by the architects Clegg & Knowles who also designed many of the commercial warehouses in Manchester. The foundation stone for the Church of the Annunciation was laid in 1860 and the building was finally completed a year later in with a classical basilica. The icons on the iconostasis were painted by Theodoros Vryzakis, a key figure in Greek academic art of the 19th century whose work is also exhibited in the National Art Gallery ‚Äì Alexandros Soutzos Museum in Athens, Greece. The Pevsner Architectural Guide for Lancashire describes the carving in the church as ‚Äúuncommonly well done‚Äù and the main building as: The church was initially built with a domed ceiling and a mural depicting Christ Pantocrator painted by C. D. Duval in but this was replaced by a pitched roof in after dry rot destroyed the original. The front of the church is made of channelled ashlar with a three bay Corinthian order portico with a modillion cornice. The sides of the church have Corinthian pilasters, windows with pediments and the original polygonal apse can be found at the back of the building. Renovations to the stainless steel roof, slating, lintels, leadwork and masonry were funded by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund with work undertaken from 2009 onwards. The church building was first listed by Historic England on and under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest. An annexe was built to accommodate a school and serves as a church hall for other events. Administration and clergy The church is part of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. the Manchester community is served by The Reverend Presbyter Demetrios Kontelides, who succeeded the Archimandrite Nicolaos Sergakis. Several priests (œÄŒ±œÄŒ¨œÇ) have served the Greek community in Manchester since 1800, most notably Protopresbyter (Archpriest) Konstantinos Kallinikos (ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÇ ŒöŒ±ŒªŒªŒØŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ) from to his death in . Kallinikos was honoured with the title of Grand Oikonomos (ŒúŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÇ ŒüŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ) by the Patriarch of Constantinople, awarded an honorary doctorate of Theology from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and granted the Order of the Redeemer for his services by George I of Greece. History of Manchester's Greek community The Greek community in Manchester was started in the early 19th century by emigrants from the Aegean island of Chios after the Chios massacre. Many of the first immigrants were traders of mastic who fled Turkish oppression during the Greek War of Independence. In April the community passed a vote for the creation of a Greek centre of worship in Manchester. From 1843 to 1860 improvised churches were used for worship, including sites on Waterloo Road in the Strangeways area, a venue on Cheetham Hill Road and a chapel on Wellington Street. The growing Greek and Cypriot community in Manchester meant that a more permanent residence was required and a site in Broughton was acquired where building work started in 1860. From the 1950s to 1970s the community grew further as more Greek-Cypriots emigrated to Manchester from Cyprus, some in response to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and ongoing Cyprus dispute. there were an estimated 2,500 Greeks in Manchester, part of a total of 340,000 Greek nationals and people of Greek ancestry living in the UK recorded by the United Kingdom Census 2011 and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Around 150 to 200 people attend Sunday services at the church in Broughton. The church celebrated its 150th anniversary on Sunday Archdiocese, Thyateira (2010) with a sermon by the Archbishop of Thyateira Gregorios (Theocharous).

With the success of forr√≥ on the nights of the city of S√£o Paulo, a movement emerged in the city to meet the demand of the nightclubs and the adolescent public, who identified immediately with the dance and the contagious rhythm of the style. The members: Josivaldo, Dezinho, Tato, Alem√£o, and Valdir performed the songs of Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro, mixing the so-called \\"forr√≥ universit√°rio\\" or \\"forr√≥ p√©-de-serra\\" with the roots of Northeastern music. By 2001, the group had more than 1 million copies sold in Brazil.  History  Falamansa's history begins in 1998, the last day of registration for the 3rd Mackenzie Music Festival. Tato, now the band's author and vocalist, was a forr√≥ DJ and already had some compositions of his own. Decided to inscribe one of them (\\"Asas\\") at the festival. However, he did not have a band. Four days later Falamansa, which had not existed before, was among the 20 summons of the 160 groups enrolled in the festival. Tato remembered Alem√£o a DJ friend who played zabumba. German, in turn, called the neighbor, Dezinho, who played triangle. Along with them, a flautist and a bass player who were part of the band's first lineup. They rehearsed two evenings and \\"Asas\\" won the second place in the event. Then came the experienced Josivaldo Leite, Waldir do Acorde√£o, who had already played with names like Oswaldinho do Acorde√£o and Jorge de Altinho. It was then complete the formation of the band that never changed. A Brazilian publisher called Deckdisc listened to the independent CD they recorded in January 2000 and released Deixa Entrar, distributed by Abril Music. The band started playing every Tuesday at the Remelexo house in Pinheiros, S√£o Paulo. They released \\"Essa √© pra voc√™\\" in 2001. In 2003, the group released the third album of their career. Simples Mortais, as it was titled, has as its flagship the song \\"100 Anos\\", which won a music video. The fourth album, \\"Um dia perfeito\\", was released in 2004, with unpublished songs like \\"Tempo de paz\\" and some re-recordings such as \\"Sete Meninas\\" by Dominguinhos, which was already part of the band's repertoire. In 2005 the MTV CD and DVD came to stores. The material, recorded on February 19 at Via Funchal, in S√£o Paulo, was attended by names such as Dominguinhos, in \\"Sete Meninas\\" and \\"Forr√≥ do Bole Bole\\"; Zeider, from Planta & Raiz, in \\"Gostas de Amor\\"; And the Meninos do Morumbi, in \\"Homem de A√ßo\\".

The event fomented controversy due to its alleged association with members of the alt-right, and triggered violent protests outside the venue while the event went on as scheduled inside. In addition to the MAGA3X event, the \\"DeploraBall\\" name has also been used to refer to additional events for Trump supporters in Washington, D.C. and other locations. The name is a play on Hillary Clinton's \\"basket of deplorables\\" comment made during her 2016 presidential election campaign. Background \\"DeploraBall\\" was conceived in early November 2016 by a marketing team as a brand name for various parties and events celebrating the election of Donald Trump. Among the organizers were Jack Posobiec, Jeff Giesea, and Mike Cernovich. The loosely organized GOTV group MAGA3X became one of the first sponsors of a DeploraBall event, which MAGA3X originally announced would be held on January 19, 2017 (the night before the Trump inauguration), at the Clarendon Ballroom in Arlington, Virginia. After MAGA3X had sold over 500 tickets, the Ballroom declined to host the event, stating that no event contract had been signed and that the venue had decided not to issue a contract \\"due to the suspicious actions of the organizers\\" in selling tickets before a contract was in place. However, event organizers alleged that the Ballroom had acquiesced to pressure from Hillary Clinton supporters. The Ballroom subsequently became \\"overwhelmed\\" with harassing phone calls and threats, although Arlington County police said there were no \\"credible\\" threats. MAGA3X then announced that the event would move to the National Press Club. Following the change of venue, one of the original organizers, Tim Treadstone (known online as \\"Baked Alaska\\"), was reportedly banned from the DeploraBall by Cernovich and Giesea after posting \\"anti-Semitic and racist comments\\" on Twitter, sparking an online argument with another organizer, Mike Cernovich. White supremacist Richard Spencer, who had recently made news for leading a group Nazi salute during a pro-Trump conference at a restaurant, was also uninvited from the event. Cernovich subsequently told TMZ that racist gestures, such as the Nazi salute, were banned from the event. Images of Pepe the Frog were also banned. Other MAGA3X organizers also made statements disavowing any affiliation between the DeploraBall and white nationalism. The organizers' limitations on speech and banning of Treadstone and Spencer were criticized by some alt-right members as bowing to mainstream pressure. Both the outgoing and the incoming presidents of the National Press Club stated that the club would hold the private event in honor of the incoming President Trump \\"as we have for incoming presidents of both parties for decades,\\" but would neither endorse nor sponsor the event. Event On the evening of January 19, 2017, the MAGA3X DeploraBall event was held at the National Press Building (the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the National Press Club). The event had sold out its 1000-ticket capacity in advance. Although journalist Milo Yiannopoulos had been invited, he did not attend. Political consultant Roger Stone arrived at the venue, but left without entering the event after learning the organizers had not provided sufficient tickets for his family members accompanying him. The event was broadcast live by Right Side Broadcasting Network. To mark the conclusion of DeploraBall, Scott LoBaido painted a \\"live-speed\\" portrait of Donald Trump. A second Washington, D.C.-area inaugural ball dubbed \\"Gays for Trump DeploraBall Gala\\" was held at the Bolger Center Hotel in Potomac, Maryland on the following evening, January 20, 2017. The event was attended by over 200 people. Another \\"Gays for Trump DeploraBall\\" was planned to be held on July 4, 2017. However, the event was renamed and pushed back to July 1. Additional inaugural events using the DeploraBall name took place in other US locales, including California, North Carolina, Arizona, and Ohio. According to the official DeploraBall marketing website, over 50 DeploraBall events were held nationwide and in three countries around the time of the Trump inauguration. Attendees included Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke, activist James O'Keefe, businessman Martin Shkreli, and social media personalities Mike Cernovich, Jim Hoft, and Gavin McInnes. A similarly named inaugural celebration called the \\"Deplorables Inaugural Ball\\" was organized by Deplorables Nation and took place at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center on the evening of January 19, 2017. Protests A few weeks before the DeploraBall, members of Project Veritas infiltrated meetings of the protest groups DisruptJ20 and the DC Antifascist Coalition, and filmed members discussing plans to disrupt and \\"crash\\" the DeploraBall. According to an affidavit released by police, three people associated with the protest groups plotted to get into the National Press Club and tamper with the sprinkler system to release butyric acid, acting as a stink bomb, over the DeploraBall attendees. At least one conspirator had purchased tickets to the event, which were cancelled by the organizers upon seeing the Veritas videos. After the videos became public, a spokesperson for the protest groups claimed that their members knew Veritas was monitoring them, and deliberately fabricated the alleged DeploraBall plot, which they did not intend to actually carry out, in order to distract the Veritas infiltrator from their real protest plans. The video led to the arrests of three men involved in the plot, all of whom later pled guilty to conspiracy charges. During the evening of January 19, hundreds of anti-Trump protesters demonstrated outside the National Press Building. Protesters clashed with police in riot gear, who formed a human shield to protect DeploraBall attendees as they arrived and entered the building. Protesters also threw bottles at attendees who were leaving the venue. One Trump supporter suffered a head injury after being hit by a protester. Ellison Barber of local CBS affiliate WUSA-TV reported that she had seen \\"at least four fights\\" outside the venue. A young boy at the protest, later identified by TMZ as the 11-year-old son of actor Drew Carey, told a Fox News reporter at the scene that he had started a fire in the street near the venue. Police eventually used pepper spray to disperse the protesters. References External links * 2017 in Washington, D.C.

This makes it difficult to identify areas of needs, coordinate activities of advocacy groups, and to make informed decision about policy direction. In effect, there is continued neglect of mental health issues as well as the many challenges that results from it in spite of existing government policy. About 20 million Nigerians suffer from mental illness. A good number of them go without professional assistance. The World Health Organization estimates that only about three percent of the government's budget on health goes to mental health. Mental health policies Nigeria's mental health policy was first formulated in 1991. Its components include advocacy, promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. In 2003, a bill for the establishment of Mental Health Act was introduced by Sen. Ibiabuye Martyns-Yellowe and Sen. Dalhatu Tafida but was later withdrawn in April 2009. Four years later, precisely on March 20, 2013, the bill was re-introduced to the National Assembly by Hon. Samuel Babatunde Adejare and Hon. Solomon Olamilekan Adeola. The Bill protects the rights of persons with mental disorders, ensure equal access to treatment and care, discourage stigma and discrimination and set standards for psychiatric practice in Nigeria. The bill makes provisions for access to mental healthcare and services, Voluntary and involuntary treatment, Accreditation of professional and facilities, Law enforcements and other judicial issues for people with mental illness, Mechanisms to oversee involuntary admission and mechanism to implement the provision of Mental health Legislations. Over 13 years since the bill was introduced to the National Assembly, it is yet to be passed into law. In the absence of this act, traditional and spiritual healers relate most mental illness to spiritual attacks, with no diagnoses. This has created avenues for the dehumanization and extortion of mentally challenged in the country. On 18 February 2016, a neuro psychiatrist Dr. Memumah Yusuf Kadiri appealed to Nigerian lawmakers to expedite action on the mental health bill pointing out that Nigerians still see mental health as a taboo because the country still adheres to the lunatic act of colonial legacy. Mental hospitals in Nigeria The first mental hospitals in Nigeria are the Calabar Lunatic Asylum in southeastern Nigeria, and Yaba Lunatic Asylum in southwestern Nigeria. The latter, renamed Yaba Mental Hospital in 1961, and again given its current name Yaba Psychiatric Center in 1977, admitted its first batch of 14 patients (8 women and 6 men) on 31 October 1907. The Yaba Lunatic Asylum which was situated in the former headquarters of the Nigeria Railways. In 1915, it became overcrowded, and some cells in Lagos prison were turned into Lunatic Asylum. Dr. Crispin Curtis Adeniyi-Jones, a Nigerian Physician and also an official of the Lagos Medical Service became the first Director of the Lagos Lunatic Asylum. Presently, there are only 130 psychiatrists in Nigeria, which has a population of 174 million.

A second, unofficial camp was set up to the east of the N216 by the curve at exit 2 in 2015. The road is regularly blocked by the migrants with felled trees and other objects in an effort to stop the vehicles to enable them to hide aboard. In response, HGV drivers have been spotted attempting to run over migrants approaching their vehicles on the road. In 2016, plans were announced to build a long wall on either side of the N216 to prevent migrants accessing the road and to improve the surroundings for drivers. The proposal is a joint Anglo-French project, estimated to cost ¬£1.9m. Local residents have dubbed it \\"the Great Wall of Calais\\". Construction was completed by the end of the year, but by this point the Jungle had been completely evacuated.

EIFA is a school for children aged 21 months to 18 years old, from Early childhood to Key Stage 5. Its curriculum is accredited by the Mission La√Øque Fran√ßaise and the French National Ministry of Education and it is overseen by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. EIFA is inspected by OFSTED and the French Inspecteur des Ecoles du Minist√®re de l‚ÄôEducation Nationale. EIFA prepares its pupils for the IGCSE and the French Brevet Exams. EIFA has three locations situated in Central London, catering for local and international families. There are two school buildings on Portland Place, London and one on Duchess Street, London, all located in Marylebone.  History  EIFA opened its doors in January 2013 in a temporary building situated at 55 Harley Street, London. Its first pupil intake was 23 children from Nursery to Year 6. The school then moved in May 2013 into its current building at 36 Portland Place, London. By September 2013, the school grew to 130 pupils. In September 2015, EIFA expanded its offering to a Senior School from Year 7 to Year 11, then housed again in a temporary building at 126 Harley Street, London. The Senior School was then moved in April 2016 to its current premises in Duchess House. With the addition of the IB Diploma Programme, the Senior School goes up to Year 13. EIFA extended its offering to a day nursery in September 2016 and named it ‚ÄúLittle EIFA‚Äù. The 36 Portland Place premises is home to Little EIFA.  Curriculum  Little EIFA is a day nursery for children aged 21 months and above. It follows the Early Years Foundation Stage and like the rest of the school, Little EIFA is French-English bilingual. All nursery staff, teachers and teaching assistants, are native French or English speakers. Children learn through play in a bilingual environment and quickly become fluent in both languages. From Nursery to Year 6, each class has two form teachers: a native qualified English teacher and a native French qualified teacher who work as a team. They teach the French national Curriculum which is enriched with elements from the National Curriculum for England. The combined two curricula provide a bilingual programme that marries academic rigour with cultural, artistic and humanitarian enrichment. The language of instruction is equally dispensed in both English and French. From Year 7 to Year 11 in Senior School, subjects are taught equally in French and English. In Year 10, pupils can take the French Brevet exams or sit the IGCSE exams in Year 11 under the Cambridge Assessment International Education body or Edexcel. Non-native French speaker pupils who are more proficient in French can also take the Dipl√¥me d‚ÄôEtude de la Langue Fran√ßaise exams (DELF). The IB Diploma Programme will be taught in Year 12 and Year 13, starting in September 2020, and pupils will be able to obtain a bilingual IB diploma at the end of that two-year programme. IB diploma is wildly accepted by over 2,000 universities around the world. The Brevet, IGCSE and IB diploma examinations are all externally assessed by their relevant national bodies. In its recent 2018 inspection, EIFA was awarded ‚ÄúOutstanding‚Äù by OFSTED for the Personal Development, Behaviour and Welfare of its pupils and staff.  Demographics  In 2019, EIFA counted over 310 pupils who are spread between its three premises. EIFA‚Äôs pupils and staff come from 40 different countries and there are over 30 different languages spoken at the school.

He was born in Waenfelen, a cottage in Pentre Galar near Crymych, in the Preseli Hills of North Pembrokeshire, the third son of John Morris Davies and his wife Ann. After his parents and his two brothers died while he was a child, he moved to Llanfyrnach to live with his mother's sister. He attended Gland≈µr Independent chapel, Llanfyrnach, where, influenced by the minister, O. R. Owen, he began preaching himself on Whit Sunday 1906. He graduated in Hebrew from University College, Cardiff in 1913, then studied Theology at the Memorial College, Brecon. In 1916 he was ordained to the ministry at Capel Als, Llanelli. He served Capel Als as its minister for over forty years, until his retirement in 1958. He was chair of the Union of Welsh Independents in 1957. A popular poet, he won the Chair at the National Eisteddfod in 1932, and won the cywydd competition four times. He was also a frequent adjudicator. R.

Baxter (born 17 January 1949 in Portland, Oregon), United States is a scholar and teacher in communication studies, best known for her research on family and relational communication. Her work is focused on relationships: romantic, marital, and friendly. She is best known for her Relational Dialectics theory. Background Baxter attended Madison High School and graduated in 1964. Dr. Baxter stayed in Portland during her college years and attended Lewis & Clark College, where she studied communications. She received a bachelor's degree in 1971 and continued her studies with Speech- Communication at the University of Oregon, where she received her master's degree in 1972. In 1975, Baxter received a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in Speech-Communication. She is currently a professor at University of Iowa in Communication Studies. Dr. Baxter started her work as a professor at the University of Montana and served her time there from 1975 to 1976. From 1976 to 1989, she was a faculty member in the Communications Department at Lewis & Clark College, where she had received her undergraduate degree. During the last two years at Lewis & Clark, she was the Associate Provost. Dr. Baxter then moved to California where, from 1989 to 1994, she taught in the Rhetoric and Communication Department as well as the Human Development Graduate Group at the University of California-Davis. In 1994, she moved to Iowa where she started her career as a Communication Studies professor at the University of Iowa. From 2000 to 2010, she was the F. Wendell Miller Professor, where she held the maximum period of professorship. In 2004, Dr. Baxter was the secondary appointment in the College of Public Health, Department of Community & Behavioral Health at the University of Iowa. In 2012, she became a Collegiate Fellow in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Scholarly work Dr. Baxter's work focuses on researching family and relational communication. Relational Dialectics Theory, which was created by Baxter and Barbara Montgomery, has been mentioned in books and scholarly journals and received awards. Relational Dialectics Theory is recognizing that all communication is the interplay of differences. Baxter has been awarded for her work in communication and dedication to teaching. In one of her published articles, \\"Problematizing the Problem in Communication: A Dialogic Perspective,\\" Baxter discusses the problems within dialogue. She compares her thoughts on dialogue to Mikhail Bakhtin‚Äôs dialogism. She also compares her ideas with relational dialectics with an interview conducted by Em Griffin, an author of A First Look at Communication Theory. She believes that differences in relationships are what give it a wholeness, where as Bakhtin‚Äôs reference to dialogue isn‚Äôt used in \\"the sense of a happy, pleasant experience\\". For Baxter‚Äôs study on family communication, Topic Expansiveness and Family Communication Patterns discovers individual‚Äôs binary decision in engaging disclosure or avoidance within communication. The study used 122 parents and their children to find communication patterns of avoidance, like sexual issues and topics of drinking/drugs, money, and educational progress. The topics were relative to friendships and everyday activities that would change the dialogue. The four topics of adolescent dating, family relationship rules, family relationship concerns, and traditions were the final grouped topics. Parental Rule Socialization for Preventive Health and Adolescent Rule Compliance looked into family rules rather than their communication pattern. Rules like nutrition, exercise, and sun protection in 164 families were examined. The outcome of this study showed that parents reported higher rule articulation than their children within the three topics. In 2014, another study was published about family communication. The study Discursive Constructions of the Meaning of \\"Family\\" in Online Narratives of Foster Adoptive Parents examined normativity of families, seeing if shared genetics established as a legitimate family. The study showed that it was the importance of dialogue of families that defined a \\"family\\", rather than how the family is constructed. Leslie Baxter spent her career teaching and conducting research at universities around the Western part of the United States. One study to examine college student‚Äôs communication was to look at how 109 Midwestern university students used their health communication on a daily basis. The results were that impact of health communication varied by every topic, channel, relationship, and purpose whether that were to seek help for their health or have interpersonal communication (face-to-face, phone, and/or email). Romantic relationships are another topic Dr. Baxter has researched. In one study done with William Wilmot, they used fourteen categories of tests in which lovers test the seriousness of their significant other‚Äôs commitment. They finalized results of women relying on secrets tests more often than men. For example, introducing their lover as \\"my boyfriend\\". They also concluded that men and women used different kinds of tests. A study done with Daena Goldsmith looked at communication in dating couples. They researched taboo subjects and what couples avoid talking about.

Her research primarily focuses on how images and space communicate messages in public culture through perceptions of beauty and critical theory. McAlister received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa, and an M.A. in communication and B.A. in anthropology from Boise State University. She is currently an associate professor of communication at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. McAlister was also the editor of Women's Studies in Communication, an international academic journal founded by the Organization for Research on Women and Communication (ORWAC). Early life and education Joan Faber Mcalister was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. She attended Boise State University, from which she received a B.A. in anthropology in 1994 with an emphasis in cultural studies and ethnography. In 1996 she completed her M.A. in communication at the same institution. Faber received her Ph.D. in rhetorical studies from the University of Iowa in 2005 with a special certificate in the project on the rhetoric of inquiry. Scholarly work McAlister's research focuses primarily on how images and space communicate messages in public culture through perceptions of beauty and critical theory. Her research using critical theory confronts ideological, societal, and structural binds found in culture and literature. McAlister focuses on analyzing topics including Congressional hearings, popular films, national news coverage, magazine advertisements, reality television, urban planning, and architecture. She approaches these documents with a focus on the relationship between social location and rhetoric, i.e.: how different individuals are placed in power and how the factors of class, gender, race, and sexuality impact these individuals. Her research is concerned with the different factors that are impacting cultural performance and create a sense of belonging that could have detrimental outcomes. She focuses on a concept of \\"home\\" being more than just a physical location. McAlister has stated that home is \\"about relationships between you and your environment [...] between your desires and your limitations [...and] associations between regional identities and cultures.\\" Collecting the Gaze McAlister's essay Collecting the Gaze: Memory, Agency, and Kinship in the Women's Jail Museum, Johannesburg discusses the views of Walter Benjamin in the Women's Jail museum in Johannesburg, South Africa. Benjamin was a German-Jewish philosopher who died in 1940 at the Women's Jail while avoiding deportation to either a French concentration camp or to Nazi Germany. The Women's jail is now a site that rests on the grounds of a former racially segregated prison that was in use from 1020 to 1983, during which apartheid laws sought to assure the dominance of white people. Those who resisted often faced repercussions, drawing a parallel between the Women's Jail and a Nazi regime. The Women's Jail holds visible memories of former inmates, directing the tourists' gaze through haunting collections of personal items such as newspaper clippings. Benjamin's collection often included very personal items such as wedding photographs, shoes, and quotes that were placed where women had once lived and worked, to present more depth into their personal experiences. McAlister then discusses how feminist critics of visual and public memories have concerns about the use of the gaze and the ability it has to change subjects into objects that then create a uniform story. The male gaze, in feminist theory, is associated with objectifying, defining, and exploiting females into objects for sexual pleasure to be viewed. The \\"tourist gaze\\" is a way of viewing culture as a commodity and can shift tragic sites of trauma into a site that offers pleasure at the expense of others' pain, often with a consumerist goal. McAlister discusses how the gaze of visual and memorial culture causes concern about re-establishing hierarchical systems of race, class, gender, and sexuality that construct identities either through places of public memory or through the objectification of females. She also discusses how the Women's Jail displays the daily life of the prisoners such as the humiliating conditions that menstruating inmates were forced to live through. This includes exhibits detailing how inmates were not allowed to wear undergarments and were forced to push their thighs together or utilize shoe laces to hold pads in place while working. This shows the notable different between the experiences of female and male prisoners which provides visitors with a different gaze into the particular details of daily life while being incarcerated. McAlister's article discusses how the Women's Jail asks visitors to share the responsibility to collect and preserve the past in order to change views of both the past and the future. Lives of the Mind/Body McAlister's article Lives of the Mind/Body: Alarming Notes on the Tenure and Biological Clocks seeks to draw attention to the biological clocks that women are encouraged to constantly worry about throughout their careers. It discusses the idea that women are torn between achieving academically, in McAlister's situation, and keeping reproductive \\"expiration dates\\" to themselves. If women pay too much attention to their biological clocks in order to begin a family they will seemingly struggle to stay at the same pace as their male colleagues. McAlister discusses her fear that bringing children into her life would cause her to be viewed as feminine and motherly which would contradict her outward professional persona as a scholar. She noted that having children was often viewed as being uncommitted to academic work by her male colleagues who were published or more revered. It was only after discussing this dilemma with her advisor, a well-established scholar, that McAlister decided to have children. After gaining this approval, the article discusses how McAlister conceived her first child who was stillborn on April 3, 2000. She later had a daughter and twins (one male and one female) who altered both her physical and academic life. While she continued to pursue a tenured position, McAlister found that she needed to keep her bodily connections with her babies private. For example, she discusses hiding in a corner of a conference room to prepare for her \\"job talk\\" when in fact she needed time to breast pump. She discusses how asking for time for this specific task would have made her seem potentially less fit for the position she was ultimately offered. The article also discusses the biological clock point-of-view in McAlister's missing many \\"firsts\\" from first steps to first words while working on her dissertation and pursuing her scholarly goals. The article concludes by underlining the need to draw attention to how scholarly discourse is gendered and requires more discussion on what defines productivity.

C. Harris is the head of the Molecular Genetics and Carcinogenesis Section and chief of the Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis at the Center for Cancer Research of the National Cancer Institute, NIH. Harris graduated from University of Kansas with a BA in zoology in 1965, and an MD in 1969. He was an internal medicine intern at UCLA hospital in 1969. He did research and completed his medical oncology training at NCI and Washington Veterans Hospital. Since 1981, he has been head of the Molecular Genetics and Carcinogenesis Section and chief of the Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis. He is also a lecturer of medicine and oncology at Georgetown University School of Medicine. He has published more than 700 journal articles and has been awarded 30 patents. His current research focuses on precision medicine of cancer and aging. He is internationally recognized for his paradigm-shifting research on environmental, genetic and epigenomic causes of human carcinogenesis. His research career spans over half a century. During this time, he has made significant breakthroughs in our understanding of environmental mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Through this research, and his extensive service to the national and international scientific community, Harris has made, and continues to make, an exceptional contribution to the improvement of human health. He is also a co-author of the international spy novel High Hand using a pseudonym Curtis J. James. Research Harris has made many major discoveries in cancer research. One of the most notable is his seminal work describing the first-known molecular link between an environmental carcinogen, aflatoxin B1, and a specific mutation at codon 249 of the p53-encoding TP53 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (Nature 350:427, 1991 and web of science).Hsu, I., Metcalf, R., Sun, T. et al. Mutational hot spot in the p53 gene in human hepatocellular carcinomas. Nature 350, 427‚Äì428 (1991). https://doi.org/10.1038/350427a0 This discovery was truly paradigm-shifting and helped shape the field of Environmental and Molecular Epidemiology. It was selected by the AACR as a Centennial Landmark in Cancer Research. In addition, his paper on the TP53 mutation spectrum is the among the most highly cited in the biomedical research field, with over 9,000 citations and web of science (Science 253:49, 1991). These findings have had, and continue to have, a major impact in cancer risk assessment and biomarker discovery for cancer prevention, diagnosis and prognosis. These advances have been a cornerstone to molecular medicine and the improvement of health outcomes. A major strength of Harris' research strategy are his insightful and innovative investigations of mechanistic, translational, and functional links between population and basic science research. When the focus of cancer research was on in human vitro and in vitro animal models, he pioneered investigations of carcinogen metabolism, DNA damage, and DNA repair and mutagenesis in humans and in human tissues (e.g., Science 194:1067, 1976; Cancer Res 44:2855, 1984).Izumu, I., Mineura, K., Watanabe, K. et al. Characterization and chemosensitivity of two cell lines derived from human glioblastomas. J Neuro-Oncol 17, 111‚Äì121 (1993). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01050213 Many of these significant studies were among the first to highlight the deleterious effects of tobacco carcinogens and their damage to human health (e.g., Cancer Res. 33: 2842‚Äì2848, 1973; Nature 247: 48‚Äì49, 1974, Nature 252: 68‚Äì69, 1974), providing an evidence base for tobacco control policies. Moreover, he led the development of first-in- kind in vitro models of human bronchial epithelial cells from patient explants (e.g., Cancer Res. 36: 1003‚Äì1010, 1976, Nature 252: 68‚Äì69, 1974). This work was pivotal to the investigation of cellular transformation, and these models continue to be used in research today, a testament to their foundational role in human mutagenesis and carcinogenesis research and the pioneering nature of Harris' research. In parallel, he has extensively investigated p53 functions in the regulation of DNA repair, apoptosis, senescence, and tumorigenicity (e.g., Nat Genet. 10:188, 1995; Nat Med. 4:137,1998; Nat Cell Biol 11:1135, 2009; Nat Cell Biol, 12: 1205, 2010)Nat Genet. 10:188 and recently a microbiome ‚Äì TP53 mutation interaction in human lung cancer, Genome Biology:19: 123‚Äì29, 2018. Decades prior to the recent discovery of mutant TP53 cells in esophageal tissue (Cell Stem Cell 25:321-41, 2019; Science 362:911-17, 2018), Drs. Peter Cerruti and Curtis Harris, using the novel and highly sensitive TP53 mutational load assay, discovered TP53 mutant DNA in non-malignant lung and plasma in tobacco smokers (PNAS 97: 12770‚Äì5, 2000; Science 264: 1317‚Äì19, 1994; Cancer Res. 66: 8309‚Äì17, 2000). In the past decade, Harris has been a leader in the study of not just TP53 mutations, but TP53 isoforms and their important contributions to senescence, aging and cancer (Fujita K, et al., Nat Cell Biol 11:1135‚Äì41, 2009; Mondal A, et al., J Clin Invest 123:5247-57, 2013; Turnquist C. et al., Cell Death Differ 23: 1515‚Äì28,2016; Hirokawa I. et al., Cell Death Differ 24: 1017‚Äì28, 2017; Von Muhlinen N., et al., Oncogene 37: 2379‚Äì93, 2018; Mondal, AM. et al., Cell Death and Dis 9: 750‚Äì804, 2018; Turnquist C. et al., Neuro Oncology 21: 474‚Äì85, 2019). These recent discoveries transcend many disciplines, increasing their potential to impact human health, specifically in terms of neurological degenerative diseases and premature aging. Collectively, Harris' studies substantively contribute to both our understanding of environmental mutagenesis and carcinogenesis as well as how these discoveries can translate to improve human health. Translational Discoveries in Cancer Biomarkers: Harris' strategy is to identify mechanistic and statistically independent biomarkers of cancer risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic outcome, with the validation of results in multiple ethic and geographic cohorts. One mechanistic facet of these studies is chronic inflammation, a feature of the internal exposome (initially described by Chris Wild, Cancer Epi Biomarkers Prev 14: 1847, 2005) and an established cancer risk factor. He discovered that increased levels of circulating interleukins are predictors of cancer risk, diagnosis, and prognosis of lung cancer patients (JNCI 99:1401, 2007; JNCI 103:1112, 2011). He also identified microRNAs associated with both diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer (Cancer Cell 9:189, 2006; Clin Cancer Res 17: 1875, 2011) and prognosis and therapeutic outcome of colon cancer (JAMA 299:425, 2008). These were pioneering studies that have since been validated in many studies around the world. In addition, he discovered that combinations of DNA methylation, microRNAs, and proteins (e.g. inflammation-related) produced by human lung, colon, and esophageal carcinomas are robust cancer prognostic classifiers (PNAS 106:12085, 2009; Clin Cancer Res 15:5878, 2009; Clin Cancer Res 15:6192, 2009; Clin Cancer Res 16:5824, 2010; Clin Cancer Res 17:1875, 2011; Int J Cancer 132:2901, 2013; Cancer Res 73:3821, 2013, J of Thoracic Oncology, 10: 1037‚Äì1048, 2015). Importantly, these studies identified early-stage lung and colon cancers that have poor prognoses due to the likelihood of undetected micro-metastasis. Harris continues to innovate. Over the past ten years, he has conducted several first-in-kind studies of the human metabolome and how it contributes to cancer risk assessment, cancer diagnosis and the accurate identification of early stage lung cancer patients at high-risk of tumor recurrence (Cancer Res. 74: 3259‚Äì3270, 2014; Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention 25(6); 978‚Äì86, 2016). Moreover, in a representative example of his integrative methods, he is now forging a new direction in the field by trying to understand the mechanistic foundation between the metabolome with lung cancer. Accomplishments His accomplishments have earned him the ACS.AACR Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarker and Prevention Award, AACR Princess Takamatsu Award, the Oschner Award relating to Smoking and Health from the American College of Physicians, the Deichmann Award from the International Union of Toxicology, the Environment Mutagenesis and Genome Award, and the Distinguished Service Medal‚Äîthe highest honor of the U.S. Public Health Service. In addition to these important pioneering findings, Harris' contribution to the field has extended to participation on numerous Boards, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs, and international advisory boards. These roles speak to the high esteem in which is opinion is held around the world. Moreover, it demonstrates his deep commitment to the improvement of human health by translating and communicating science to the public domain. He has been an expert witness at hearings concerning OSHA Regulations on the Identification, Classification and Regulation of Toxic Substances Posing a Potential Occupational Carcinogenic Risk, a member of the technical review committee for the USPHS Surgeon General Report on Harmful Effects of Smokeless Tobacco and was a contributing a to the Surgeon General's 2004 seminal report on the Health Consequences of Smoking. Harris has also been a member of the Scientific Advisory Council at IARC. Moreover, he has demonstrated a steadfast from the 1980s to the present commitment on the Advisory Committee and honored consultant to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima Japan, an organization dedicated to understanding the health consequences of radiation exposure among survivors of atomic bombs. These highlights are just a few examples of his outstanding contributions in the application of the principles and techniques of environmental mutagenesis and genomics to the protection of human health. He cofounded the Aspen Cancer Conference, a non-profit organization, in 1985 with Dr. Ben Trump where he serves as chairman of the board of directors. His exceptional record of research accomplishment has been well-recognized by the scientific community with over 90,000 citations and H-index of over 140. He is a valued collaborator with both American and international scientists. In addition to receiving the awards mentioned above, he continues to be invited to present keynote and distinguished lectures at international conferences, including the AACR Frontiers of Cancer Prevention and AACR Chemistry in Cancer Research, most recently at the 11th Annual APRU Global Health Conference. He has served in elected leadership posts in the scientific community, including Chairman of the Program Committee of the AACR Annual Meeting; member of the AACR's board of directors, Nominating Committee and many Award Committees; and chairman of the board of directors and Chairman of the Scientific Program Advisory Board for the Keystone Symposia of Molecular and Cellular Biology. He is also since 1984 to recent the Editor-in Chief of the journal Carcinogenesis. He is an outstanding mentor and has successfully mentored more than one hundred and seventy young scientists. Moreover, he has trained a new generation of scientists in the field of environmental and molecular epidemiology, a field he pioneered. For these accomplishments, he received the NCI Outstanding Mentor Award. He has successfully intertwined cancer epidemiology with pioneering studies of chemical carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, cellular transformation, and precision medicine, thereby uniquely advancing all of these fields. He has promoted human health by proving evidence-based recommendations for the control of carcinogens and by being a thought leader.

He is an expert on brain mechanisms of consciousness and on altered consciousness in epilepsy. As director of the Yale Clinical Neuroscience Imaging Center(CNIC) he leads multi-disciplinary research and is also well known for his teaching contributions in neuroanatomy and clinical neuroscience. Biography Blumenfeld was born in California, grew up in New York and began his career in Bioelectrical Engineering at Harvard University (1984). His passion for science would lead him to Columbia University where, working with Eric Kandel and Steven Siegelbaum, he obtained his PhD (1990) in Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and his MD (1992). He completed his internal medicine internship at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center(1993) and entered the field of neurology completing a three-year residency program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston (1996). But it wasn't until he completed his fellowship in Epilepsy working with Susan and Dennis Spencer and with David McCormick at Yale University's School of Medicine that he would find his true calling. The main goal of Blumenfeld's career has been to understand the processes of diminished consciousness in seizures, enable recovery of mental function during and after seizures, and to advance treatments thereby improving the lives of people living with epilepsy. His laboratory explores the brain when consciousness is impaired by epileptic seizures using advanced brain imaging methods, electrical measurements and testing of behavior. By understanding the processes of awareness, attention and arousal Blumenfeld hopes to restore normal consciousness to patients with epilepsy and other brain disorders. Scientific contributions Professor Blumenfeld has studied brain networks in different kinds of seizures as well as normal brain function. Using EEG and fMRI at the same time during an absence seizure his research team is able to determine why children with absence seizures become unconscious. Temporal lobe seizures are the most common form of localized epilepsy. Blumenfeld proposed the ‚ÄúNetwork Inhibition Hypothesis‚Äù which posits that temporal lobe seizures disrupt awareness, attention, and information processing because of depressed arousal function in the brain. In support of this theory, his research team has found sleep-like changes in the brain during these types of seizures. Using state-of-the-art technology, they are able to reveal the processes of these changes, and to test new treatment approaches including deep brain stimulation to restore normal consciousness. One crucial goal is the prevention of epilepsy before it begins. Blumenfeld found important evidence that early and effective medical treatment of both animal models and human patients with absence epilepsy improves long-term outcome. This is a major shift from current treatment strategies which view seizure medications as suppressing the symptoms, not the underlying disease. Through active collaborations with Fahmeed Hyderhttp://medfaculty.yale.edu/about/fahmeed_hyder.profile?source=news (also at Yale) Blumenfeld's direct recordings of the electrical activity of brain cells improves the analysis of indirect neuroimaging measurements of brain functions by fMRI. Dr. Blumenfeld and his team have been able to determine that so called generalized tonic-clonic seizures are in fact localized to specific bilateral cortical-subcortical networks. These findings may help produce targeted therapies with better effectiveness and fewer side effects. Other important innovations in Blumenfeld's work include using virtual-reality driving simulation during video/EEG monitoring to evaluate driving safety in patients with epilepsy. In addition, his research group developed a prospective bedside testing battery, the Responsiveness in Epilepsy Scale (RES). These testing methods provide better information to patients and physicians making decisions about driving, and may help identify brain areas crucial for impaired awareness in epilepsy. Dr. Blumenfeld has also developed two new approaches to target epilepsy surgery to the correct location in the brain: 1. 3D color movies of the brainwave (EEG) show where the seizures start, making safe and effective surgery much more feasible. 2. Innovative analysis methods with SPECT blood flow imaging that can pinpoint the region for surgical planning. Using powerful brain imaging methods and electrical recordings Blumenfeld recently found that normal conscious perception of visual stimuli is accompanied by a cascade of activity moving through the brain in less than one second. These pictures provide a new view of how the brain normally processes information to create a conscious experience. Teaching contributions As author of the widely acclaimed textbook Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases (Sinauer Assoc, Inc) Blumenfeld has inspired many students to study the brain's structure and function and to enter the fields of neurosciences, neurology, neurosurgery and related disciplines. The textbook is used in over half the medical schools in the United States and throughout the world.

If the firm's CEO is not a founder or the founder CEO is succeeded, the firm is said to be led by a non-founder CEO or successor CEO. Research has highlighted differences between founder and non- founder CEOs that influence firm performance. These differences include: stock performance, equity stake in the firm, managerial incentives, research and development investment, and outlook towards mergers and acquisitions. According to some scholars, such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, founder CEOs outperform their non-founder CEO counterparts in both stock performance and market valuation. They tend to take a long-term view and consider their firm their lifetime achievement, resulting in them holding a larger equity stake in their firm than non-founder CEOs. Darius Palia, S. Abraham Ravid, and Chia- Jane Wang developed this idea further, concluding that founder CEOs become less influenced by managerial incentives as they continue to devote resources to their firm, whereas the opposite is true for non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs are less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performance according to managerial incentives. Scholars such as Joon Mahn Lee, Jongsoo Jays Kim, and Joonhyung Bae, concluded that founder CEOs continually invest in new projects and explore new knowledge to benefit the firm in the long-term. This suggests that a link between founder CEOs and a greater innovation investment. In terms of mergers & acquisitions, Fahlenbrach, along with other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs partake in a greater number of acquisitions within their core business line each year, as they have a greater risk tolerance. it is suggested that this additional risk taken on by founder CEOs stems from overconfidence at the CEO level, which some scholars have measured through their tone in tweets, regarding both earnings calls and personal statements, and their option exercise behavior relative to non-founder CEOs. Founder CEO succession can occur through both voluntary and involuntary means. American academic Noam Wasserman found that in the majority of founder CEO successions, the founder is forced to step down by investors. Founder CEOs who successfully execute new product development or enter into negotiations with potential outside investors for additional capital have a higher likelihood of being replaced than those who are not as successful with product development and/or do not to raise additional capital. Indicated by several scholars, like Wasserman, as the CEO becomes successful in product development, the needs of the firm expand and a mismatch between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward is likely to occur, thus increasing the probability of succession. Founder CEOs are generally succeeded by someone from outside of the firm. Founder CEO comebacks have occurred whereby the founder CEO was replaced and later returned to their role as CEO. Eleven percent of the large capitalization firms in the United States are led by founder CEOs, including well-known companies such as Facebook, Netflix, FedEx and Amazon. A person or several people can be founders of a firm. The founders earn the 'founder' title only once the firm becomes operational, at which point their founder role ends. Founders do not have a particular role once the business is established, but their influence inevitably continues as they designed the firm's blueprint impacting structures and decision-making going forward.  Negative and positive contributions to firm performance  Within research, several differences have been identified between how firms are led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs. Differences identified include stock performance, equity stake, managerial incentives, innovation investment and participation in mergers and acquisitions. In November 2009, Fortune Magazine named Steve Jobs, founder of Apple Inc., the CEO of the decade. The six runners-up, all founder CEOs, were: Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Martha Stewart, Bernard Madoff, Sergey Brin and Oprah Winfrey.  Stock performance  According to some scholars, such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, firms led by founder CEOs outperform those led by non-founder CEOs, in both stock performance and market valuation. Between 1993 and 2002, an equally weighted portfolio consisting of companies led by founder CEOs would have earned an annual benchmark-adjusted return of 8.3%. In other words, an excess abnormal return of 4.4% annually. As of March 2016, 16 companies in the S&P; 500 still have founder CEOs, who have been with the company for at least five years. In aggregate, these companies have generated a five-year average return of 170%, significantly greater than the 56% five-year S&P; 500 gain. Of these companies, 14 have outperformed the market over the past three years. These companies include: Facebook, Netflix, Under Armour, Nvidia, Amazon.com, Starbucks, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, L Brands, VeriSign, FedEx, Salesforce.com, Akamai Technologies, Intercontinental Exchange, and SanDisk.  Equity stake  Fahlenbrach, like other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs have a larger equity stake in the firm, potentially reducing the principal agent problem. Founder CEOs consider their firm their lifetime achievement and therefore take a long-term view. This approach results in the optimal shareholder-value maximizing strategy.  Managerial incentives  Incentive structures do differ for firms led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs as a result of different pay-performance sensitivity, as concluded by several scholars including Palia, Ravid, and Wang. A statistically significant relationship is present between these two variables for firms led by non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs tend to be less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performances according to their payment incentives. Meanwhile, this relationship is insignificant for founder CEOs, who become less influenced by pay incentives as they devote more time and energy to their firm. This founder CEO attachment to their firm results in lower salaries, which can be seen in a study completed by Noam Wasserman on 528 ventures between the years 1996 and 2002. The results of this study concluded that 51% of founder CEOs make either the same salary or one that is lower than someone who reports to them. Additionally, the results showed that founder CEOs receive 20% less in cash compensation than their non-founder CEO counterparts with similar experience.  Innovation investment  Scholars have indicated that founder CEOs experience greater innovation performance than non-founder CEOs, who tend to be risk averse. Extant research attributes these differences in innovation investment to founder CEOs taking a long-term approach, continually investing in new projects, and exploring new knowledge. Thus suggesting that founder CEOs are not as concerned with job security or impacted by short term performance, as a result resources are dedicated to the long-term. Lee, Kim, and Bae found that the existence of a founder CEO is correlated with a 31 percent increase in the citation-weighted patent count before controlling for research and development spending and a 23 percent increase after controlling for research and development spending.  Mergers and acquisitions  Fahlenbrach, along with others concluded founder-CEOs have a greater risk tolerance and partake in a greater number of acquisitions per year than non- founder CEOs. The acquisitions that founder-CEOs make do not diversify their portfolio because their acquisitions tend to be within their core businesses. Joon Mahn Lee, Byoung-Hyoun Hwang, and Hailiang Chen suggested that the additional risks taken on by founder-led firms stem from overconfidence at the CEO level. = Founder CEO overconfidence = Founder-CEOs overconfidence may have negative or positive effect on their firms. In a study completed on the S&P; 1500 firms by Lee, Hwang, and Chen, it was concluded that founder CEOs use fewer negative words in both personal tweets and statements regarding earnings. This optimism was observed to exist at the executive level as well. Founder CEOs also provide more optimistic earnings estimates than their non- founder counterparts. Investors are unaware of this overconfidence bias among founder CEOs and take them at face value indicating no discount taken into consideration in the financial markets. In a 1988 study completed by researchers at Purdue University, this overconfidence was seen when 3,000 entrepreneurs, founders, claimed there was an 81% chance of success for them and only a 59% chance for peers. One in three of these entrepreneurs believed they had a 100% success rate going forward. Additionally, options, which are tied to firm performance, were taken into account in Lee, Hwang, and Chen's study to measure overconfidence as most CEOs, founders or non-founders, are compensated in options to an extent. When analyzing option-exercise behavior using the value of vested in-the-money options to the total compensation, they concluded that founder CEOs had a significantly greater ratio. By comparison, they concluded that non-founder CEOs generally exercise their options immediately when they become exercisable in-the-money to receive cash and remove their compensation linkage to future performance. Founder CEOs, however, hold off on exercising their in-the-money options as they are overly optimistic about the firm's future performance.  Founder CEO succession   Occurrence  Wasserman concluded within the first three years of business operation, 50% of founder CEOs step down. The following year, another 10% step down and, by the time the firm has an initial public offering, less than 25% of founders still hold the CEO position. This being said, the decision to step down is not always voluntary, four out of five founder CEOs are forced to relinquish their role as CEO by investors.  Events affecting replacement likelihood  As indicated in Wasserman's study and others, founder CEOs experience higher turnover when they: # Successfully execute product development. Thus, the quicker the founder CEO leads the firm to success in product development, the quicker they will be replaced. As the needs of the firm expand with product development, a mismatch is likely to occur between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward. # Enter negotiations with potential investors for additional capital. As personal investors (family and friends), angel investors, and venture capitalists invest in the firm, founder CEOs must often give up some control. It is also possible that potential investors will make their investment in the firm contingent upon the appointment of a new CEO. This occurs when the investors do not trust the founder CEO's ability to lead the company longer term. The likelihood of this happening is higher when the amount of capital needed is higher and outsiders have a larger equity stake in the firm, giving them more control in these decisions.  Founder CEO successor origin  Wasserman concluded that founder CEOs are almost always replaced by someone outside the organization (outside successor) opposed to someone inside (inside successor). Smaller and younger firms turn to tend to turn to outsiders, whereas in larger firms the board of directors is disinclined to appoint an outsider successor CEO unless the firm has experienced poor past performance. Relative to inside successors, outside successors are known to make more changes within the firm altering the firms overall business strategy, earn higher compensation and achieve higher inter- organizational status.  Founder CEO comeback  A founder CEO comeback can be defined as a founder CEO who relinquishes their role as CEO and later returns to the position. A study completed by Ryan Krause, Abhijith G. Acharya, and Jeffrey G. Covin, on fourteen high-profile Fortune 1000 comeback firms, including Apple, Starbucks, Gateway, Dell, Charles Schwab, Peoplesoft and Google, identified five key conditions attributable to a founder-CEO comeback. The conditions include: poor performance, unplanned succession, founder on board, founder ownership, and interdependent board.

She was the first female Professor of Greek in the United Kingdom, teaching at Bedford College, London from 1909 to 1950. She researched the work of Plato, pioneering the use of stylistic analysis to conclude that he had not written all the work previously attributed to him. She was active in the Classical Association and became its first woman president in 1958. She was also an active Unitarian and campaigned especially against alcohol, becoming the president of the Unitarian Temperance Association, the Unitarian Assembly and the Unitarian College. Early life and education Dorothy Tarrant was the daughter of a Unitarian minister, the Reverend William Tarrant, who edited The Enquirer ‚Äì the fortnightly newspaper of that denomination. His wife, Alice n√©e Stanley, gave birth to her on 7 May 1885 in Wandsworth. She was educated at home before attending Wandsworth high school from 1895 and the Clapham High School from 1898. She sat the external examination of London University for Classics while still at school, placing in the first class. She then won a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge which she attended from 1904, reading for the Classical Tripos. She passed parts one and two in 1907 and 1908, achieving first class honours in both. She also won the Agnata Butler prize, the Therese Montefiore prize and the Gilchrist fellowship for research. As Cambridge University did not grant degrees to women, she took her bachelor's degree at Bedford College, London, which had been founded as a ladies' college by Unitarian women. She graduated in 1906 and then took her master's degree three years later for her thesis on the genesis of Plato's theory of ideas. Her doctorate was awarded by London University much later in 1930. Classical scholarship Tarrant was appointed to the faculty of Bedford College in 1909, progressing from assistant lecturer to lecturer in 1921 and university reader in 1929. In 1936, after her doctorate, she became head of the department and Professor of Ancient Greek ‚Äì the first woman to hold such a post for this subject in Britain. She retired in 1950 to become a professor emerita and honorary fellow of Bedford College. She became an honorary fellow of Girton College in 1955 and Manchester College, Oxford in 1969. She served as President of the Hellenic Society in 1953‚Äì56. She was a frequent contributor to learned journals including The Classical Quarterly and The Journal of Hellenic Studies. Her work especially focussed upon Plato and she analysed his style in detail, concluding that the Hippias Major ‚Äì the Socratic dialogue on the nature of beauty ‚Äì must have been written by another author. She was involved with the Classical Association for many years, from reading a paper on The Art of Plato to the London branch in 1926 to becoming the first female President in 1958, at the age of 73. The association's annual general meeting was held in Nottingham that year, where she gave the presidential address, The Long Line of Torchbearers, which recounted many writers of the classics, illustrating this by comparing how translators such as Alexander Pope and Andrew Lang had translated the Odyssey. She also lectured to the general public, from passengers on Mediterranean cruises to the women convicts at Holloway prison.  Dorothy Tarrant Fellowship  In 2016 an annual Fellowship with special lecture was established in honour of Tarrant, a 'pioneering figure in UK classics', at the Institute of Classical Studies, University of London. The Fellowship is awarded to academics from universities outside of the UK with research interests in any aspect of classical studies. Recipients for 2017-18 include Professor Anthony Corbeill (University of Virginia) and Professor Joshua Katz (Princeton University). Recipients for 2018-19 include Professor Margaret Malamud (New Mexico State University) and Professor Sara Monoson (Northwestern University). Personal life and religion Tarrant was a devout Unitarian like her father, campaigning especially against alcohol. She was the president of the Unitarian Temperance Association from 1948 to 1951 and then president of the Unitarian Assembly from 1952 to 1953. She attended the Unitarian College, Manchester from 1955 to 1958 and was its president from 1961 to 1963. Her final years were spent in Wandsworth but she was still active in old age and she died aged 88 of pneumonia at St James' Hospital, Balham on 4 September 1973.

It protects an area of restinga, mangroves and dense rainforest on the coast of S√£o Paulo. The park provides an important ecological corridor from the coastal restinga to the Serra do Mar State Park further inland. Location The Restinga de Bertioga State Park is in the municipality of Bertioga, S√£o Paulo. It has an area of . It contains sambaquis, shell and bone mounds formed by fisher-hunter-gatherer peoples, that date back five thousand years. The park fully protects the Itaguar√© and Guaratuba rivers, and about of the Itaguar√©, Itagu√° and Borac√©ia beaches. Background Brazil's Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened types of forest in the world. About 7% of the original forest cover remains in the state of S√£o Paulo, of which about 5.98% is on the coast. The state has preserved a large area in the Serra do Mar State Park, the largest Atlantic Forest park in Brazil. However, forest in the coastal region is under great pressure. The 2006 management plan of the Serra do Mar State Park identified the great importance to that park of conserving the continuous areas of restinga in the Bertioga and S√£o Sebasti√£o region. The well-preserved vegetation provides an important ecological corridor leading to the plateau of the Serra do Mar. Borac√©ia and Barra do Una are rich in birds and amphibians, including large numbers of endangered species. History The area now covered by the park was placed under to \\"provisional administrative limitation\\" on 30 March 2010 to allow for a period of study of the ecosystems. This bans activities that may cause environmental damage while the area is under study and prevents a race to occupy the land. The study identified the need to protect the \\"Bertioga Polygon\\" of , including part of the municipality of S√£o Sebasti√£o. It was chosen because it contains examples of flora that are poorly represented among conservation units in SP, with a high level of threat to its integrity and strong social support for its protection. A public consultation was held on 7 October 2010 attended by over 300 people, and lasting for five hours. The Restinga de Bertioga State Park was created by state decree 56.500 of 9 December 2010. The area had been adjusted to exclude the Guarani indigenous area, urban locations or areas in the process of urbanization, and the results of final studies after the public consultation of 7 October 2010. Areas occupied by federal or state highways, high voltage lines and Petrobras pipelines were excluded from the decree. Flame-crested tanager (female) Environment Studies carried out by WWF- Brasil and the team preparing the Serra do Mar State Park management plan determined that the park area is an important biological corridor between the coastal marine areas, the restinga and the Serra do Mar. Its protection plays a basic role in guaranteeing long-term viability of the ecology and gene flows. The park contains examples of mangroves, restinga and dense lowland rainforest. It contains 98% of the remaining Baixada Santista restinga forest. It holds 53 species of bromeliads, one third of the total found in the state. 44 plant species are threatened with extinction. There are 117 species of mammals, of which 25 are medium or large in size. There include cougar (Puma concolor), deer, South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides), howler monkeys, collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) and white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). There are 69 species of bats, of which six are endangered in the state and one internationally. There are 93 species of reptiles and amphibians, of which 14 are endangered and 14 rare. 117 bird species have been identified, of which 37 are endemic and 9 endangered. BirdLife International considers the area an \\"Important Bird Area\\", critically important for conservation and biodiversity of birds in the long term. Visiting A trail in the park In February 2015 the park opened two ecotourism trails operated in partnership between the Municipality of Bertioga and the Forest Foundation and regulated by an Emergency Plan for Public Use, created with the park's Consultative Council to meet tourist demand. Accredited monitors accompany visitors in the trails. Both trails are primarily designed to provide access to the restinga and understanding of this rare biome. In the first year of operation visits to the trails were limited to 50 people in the morning and 50 in the afternoon, scheduled through tourist agencies and operators in the town of Bertioga. Unauthorized entry is prohibited. The Guaratuba Trail is in the Costa do Sol district, accessed through the Condom√≠nio Guaratuba. It includes the Cachoeira de Guaratuba, a waterfall. The √Ågua Trail is in the Praia district, in the \\"dry mangrove\\" location, accessed by the old Palmares heart of palm factory. It emphasises environmental education, and also passes the cable line of the Itatinga Hydroelectric Power Plant and the Guaranduva River iron bridge.

The film was released at the peak of the refugee crisis in Europe in 2015/16. Synopsis Director Michael Graversen‚Äôs film investigates what happens to one of the many unaccompanied minor refugees who disappear in Europe after their asylum claim is rejected. Over the course of four years the director follows the faith of the young afghan Wasiullah from the careless days at the children's asylum centre in Denmark to the illegal life through Europe where Wasi ends up in a homeless existence in Italy. The dream of one day returning to Denmark is what keeps Wasi going until he breaks down in the end and loses his memory. Reception and impact  Dreaming of Denmark premiered at CPH:DOX and was nominated for a F:ACT Award. It was broadcast in a primetime slot on Danish national TV DR1. After the release in Denmark the film hit the headlines in danish media and sparked debate about the conditions of the unaccompanied minor refugees in Denmark. The director Michael Graversen has since regularly appeared in the public debate in Denmark advocating for the rights of young and child refugees as well as traveling internationally with the film speaking about its subject to the press and participating in debate panels. Danish film magazine EKKO wrote in a review of the film: \\"What is at stake in the portrait, is the human consequences of a youth growing up as a shadow existence with nothing to cling on to than the hope to be let. Wasis Sisyphean existence is a profound input in the refugee debate and Dreaming of Denmark is something as rare as an important film.\\". The film has been selected to several international film festivals and won the Amnesty Award at Giffoni International Film Festival. Huffington Post wrote after the Greek premiere at Thessaloniki Documentary Festival where the film was a part of a highlighted segment focusing on films about the refugees crisis: \\"My favorite was Michael Graversen‚Äôs Dreaming of Denmark, which directly puts you in the shoes of an Afghan teenager who, unable to get residency in Denmark and afraid to be deported, leaves Denmark with nothing on his back to find a new life in Italy\\". When the film was screened on the national Austrian broadcasting channel ORF it was followed by an hour long debate about human rights and ABC News interviewed the director focusing on the plight of children seeking asylum. In 2016 the director was awarded the Salaam Film Prize 2016 for his work filming the unaccompanied minors in Denmark not only in Dreaming of Denmark but also in the predecessor No Man's Land (2013) set before the refugee crisis. Not all the reactions towards the film has been positive. After the TV broadcast in Denmark the director participated in a chat at the newspaper Ekstra Bladet's website. Some users took offence of the directors portrayal of a refugee. The broadcast was two days after one of the terrorist attacks in Paris and some users meant that the director had the blood of the victims on his hands making an emphatic film about a refugee as refugees could also be terrorists.

And then, he hates the truth or good with a bitter hatred, because it disturbs the darkness of the false peace with which he would envelop himself.

Life  Wendt was born in K√∂slin in 1889. After completing Volksschule, Wendt completed an apprenticeship as a glazier and was additionally taught at the Fortbildungsschule. Subsequently, he worked as a glazier's assistant. In 1910 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and in 1912 was married. From March 1915 to 1918, Wendt took part in World War I. In 1918, Wendt was obliged to give up his old profession because of medical condition sustained during the war. From then on, he worked as an office worker at the Ortskrankenkasse, starting in 1921 at the district office of Wedding. After the November Revolution of 1918, Wendt temporarily joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), a breakaway party composed of left-wing SPD members. From 1919 to 1920, Wendt was a member of the provincial parliament of Brandenburg. In the years 1921 to 1929 he was also a district and city councillor in Berlin. Since 1925, he had served as a city councillor-at-large in the Berlin district of Sch√∂neberg, where he belonged to the SPD district council. In the federal election of May 1928, Wendt was elected to the Reichstag as a candidate for the SPD for the electoral district 3 (Potsdam II), a position which he held until the September 1930 election. After a two- year absence from the parliament, Wendt returned to the Reichstag for his old constituency with the Reichstag election in July 1932. From July 1932, Wendt was also party secretary of the SPD for the district of Berlin-Sch√∂neberg. After the Nazi seizure of power in the spring of 1933, Wendt was arrested and placed in \\"protective custody\\" from July to December 1933 in the Brandenburg concentration camp.Martin Schumacher (Hrsg.): M.d.R.

From 1934 to 1943, Wendt made a living as the owner of a coal business in Berlin-Steglitz. During these years, Wendt and his family were subjected to routine harassment by the Nazi regime, including the removal of their arbour owing to \\"lack of proper attitude\\". In these years he was supported by, among others, Paul L√∂be and Julius Leber, among others, in whose coal company Wendt occasionally found shelter. In 1944, Wendt reported to the Wehrmacht in order to protect himself against the wave of arrests of politicians from the Weimar Republic launched by the Nazi regime.Eberhard Kolb (Hrsg.), Albert Grzesinski: Im Kampf um die deutsche Republik.

He led the creation of the Asian University for Women located in Chittagong, Bangladesh in 2006.  Early life  Kamal Ahmad with visitors from Terre des Hommes (France) in front of his first thatched bamboo school house, 1979 Ahmad was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh to a family of educators. At age 14, Ahmad established a series of internationally funded afternoon schools for adolescents who served as domestic workers in Dhaka. The first of his schools was set up on the side of an abandoned public road near the campus of the University of Dhaka. The Juvenile Literacy Programme that he started with international funding was possibly the first non-governmental initiative in the area of informal education for children in Bangladesh. Ahmad moved to the U.S. in 1980 to attend Phillips Exeter Academy. At Exeter, he led the Third World Society and the Student-Faculty Committee on Corporate Responsibility which focused on the question of corporate divestment from apartheid-era South Africa. Ahmad entered Harvard College in 1983. As a freshman, Ahmad founded and managed the Overseas Development Network, a consortium of 70 university student groups across the United States dedicated to the promotion of international development projects. In 1987, Ahmad won TIME Magazine's second annual College Achievement Award for \\"20 of the most outstanding juniors in America.\\"  Family  Ahmad's father was Professor Kamaluddin Ahmad, a famed biochemist who pioneered the study of biochemistry and nutritional sciences in the Indian subcontinent. Professor Ahmad established one of the region's first biochemistry departments at the University of Dhaka in 1957. Ahmad's grandfather, M.O. Ghani was one of the first Bengali-Indian Muslims to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry from the United Kingdom. He went on to become Founder-Vice Chancellor of Bangladesh Agricultural University in Mymensingh, Vice Chancellor of the University of Dhaka, Pakistan's Ambassador to Tanzania and other East African countries, and an independent Member of Parliament in Bangladesh.  Career  Kamal with AUW students. Following graduation from Harvard College in 1988, Ahmad served on the staffs of the World Bank; Rockefeller Foundation; UNICEF; and the General Counsel of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, Philippines. In 1993, Ahmad entered University of Michigan Law School. In 1998, Ahmad conceived and co-directed the World Bank/UNESCO Task Force on Higher Education & Society. In September 2006, the Parliament of Bangladesh ratified the landmark Charter of the Asian University for Women. The Charter endowed the University with institutional autonomy, academic freedom, and embedded it in the principle of non-discrimination. In 2005 and 2006, the Open Society Foundations and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided the start-up funds which enabled AUW to become operational in 2008.  Asian University for Women  Located in Chittagong, Bangladesh, Asian University for Women (AUW) is the first of its kind -- a regional liberal arts university dedicated to the education and leadership development of women drawn from diverse socio-economic backgrounds from across Asia and the Middle East. AUW is chartered by the Parliament of Bangladesh as an independent international university. To date, over $100 million in private philanthropic support has been contributed to this initiative. In addition, the Government of Bangladesh has granted 140 acres of land for a purpose-designed campusCharter of the Asian University for Women art. 4. http://asian-university.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/02/AUW_Charter.pdf. At its core, AUW is organized to overcome communal identities and recognize our common human predicament and potential. AUW also promotes a preferential option for educating women who are first in their family to enter university. In founding AUW, Kamal pioneered a number of unconventional approaches to education, including targeted recruitment of women from some of the region‚Äôs most oppressed and underserved communities, including Rohingya refugees, Bangladeshi textile factory workers, and women from remote highlands and creating a standards rubric that is flexible at entry but uncompromising at exit. Kamal developed the triad of ‚ÄúCourage, Outrage at Injustice, and Empathy‚Äù as key indicators of leadership potential, which has informed the University‚Äôs search for talent among incoming students. As of 2020, AUW draws students from 18 countries and has spurred a new network of almost one thousand rising women leaders from across the region in its alumnae. Kamal has advocated for the use of performing arts as an instrument for asserting AUW‚Äôs secularity as well as for community building in a diverse setting.  Awards and affiliations  Kamal Ahmad at Angkor Wot, 2018 Ahmad is a recipient of a number of awards including the United Nations Gold Peace Medal & Citation Scroll, given by the Paul G. Hoffman Awards Fund for \\"outstanding contribution to national and international development.\\" In 2002, Ahmad was elected as a \\"Global Leader for Tomorrow\\" by the World Economic Forum. Ahmad was also given the John Phillips Award from Phillips Exeter Academy, his alma mater. The award is given to \\"an alumnus or alumna of the Academy, still living at the time of nomination, whose life demonstrates John Phillips' ideal of goodness and knowledge united in noble character and usefulness to mankind.

She was sometimes billed under just her first name, Haleloke.  Biography  Kahauolopua was born on February 2, 1923, in Hilo, Hawaii, into a musical family, her mother being active in Hilo music circles. She sang in glee clubs in high school but her studies at the University of Hawaii were cut short by World War II. Kahauolopua was a featured vocalist on the radio show Hawaii Calls, hosted by Webley Edwards, from 1945 to 1950. Kahauolopua then came to the attention of Arthur Godfrey who brought her to New York, where she appeared frequently on his shows, dancing the hula as well as singing, and in a number of Hawaiian extravaganzas staged by Godfrey. In contrast to the typical Hawaiian \\"ha'i\\" (falsetto) voice use by many Hawaiian singers of the time, Kahauolopua sang in a husky alto. Kahauolopua cut a number of records, usually accompanied by Godfrey and his ukulele and the Archie Bleyer Orchestra, and sometimes by The Mariners vocal group. She was the only Hawaiian musician on her album Hawaiian Blossoms. Godfrey became infamous for peremptorily firing employees, such as Julius LaRosa, fired on the air, and in April 1955 he fired Kahauolopua (along with Marion Marlowe, The Mariners, and three writers). This occasioned some criticism in the press. Kahauolopua then retired from show business at a fairly young age, to the small rural town of Union City, Indiana to live with her friends the Paul Keck family. She died in her adopted town on December 16, 2004.

She is known for writing plays on Appalachian themes and history, which have been performed in several states. __TOC__ Life and career Battlo was born and raised in Kimball, in McDowell County, West Virginia. Her parents were Italian immigrants who moved to West Virginia to work in the coal mines. After attending Welch High School in Welch, Battlo earned a B.A. and an M.A. at Marshall University where she studied history, drama, and literature, and minored in philosophy. Battlo has also completed 35 hours of classical studies at William and Mary. She launched her writing career by publishing two volumes of poetry, Bonsai and Modern Haiku. At the request of a local theatre group, Battlo wrote her first plays, A Highly Successful West Virginia Business and Caves. The group turned to Battlo, whose poetry had established her as a writer, for new plays because they could not afford the royalties for most established playwrights. Her West Virginia plays attempt to dispel widely held stereotypes of Appalachian people and West Virginians. Battlo said, \\"These people are not caricatures, not ‚Äòmammy Yokums, not hillbilly stereotypes. These are people I live with. They‚Äôre real. They watch CNN. They know what‚Äôs going on in the world. They just haven‚Äôt lost touch with their roots.\\" From 1987‚Äì1989, Battlo served as Writer-in-Residence for Theatre West Virginia, in Beckley, where she continues to teach playwriting workshops. Many of Battlo's plays focus on historical themes. #8 tells the story of a Jewish family shortly before the Holocaust. Between Two Worlds was written to celebrate the centennial of West Virginia author Pearl S. Buck's birth. The play The House on Second Street is about the Lizzie Borden murders. With help from a West Virginia Humanities Council seed grant, Battlo researched the 1921 murder of \\"Smilin'\\" Sid Hatfield, which became the basis for the 2000 play The Terror of the Tug. The Terror of the Tug is performed every summer by McArts, the McDowell County community arts organization, which Battlo founded and directs. Battlo established the Globe Stage in McDowell County, which is a replica of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Battlor is also the founder of Coal Camp Creations, under the auspices of McArts. Coal Camp Creations brings together West Virginia artists and craftspeople to produce artistic statues out of coal mined in McDowell County. Critical response and awards Scenes from Battlo's plays Frog Songs and Shakespeare: Love in Series were included in Linda Pinnell's textbook Getting Started in Theater. The House on Second Street was a finalist in the 1998 Forest-Shiras Competition. The play #8 was a finalist for Camel-Sea and a finalist for the Eugene O'Neill National Playwright's Competition in 1990, and was optioned by Off-Broadway Stage Arts. Her plays have been performed throughout Appalachia. Companies that have staged Battlo's works include: the Tennessee Stage Company, the Southern Appalachian Repertory Theater in North Carolina, and Theater West Virginia and the Charleston Stage Company, both in West Virginia.

Cape Verde was a colony of Portugal from its colonization until 1975. Because the archipelago is inside the Atlantic Ocean, fish is very important in Cape Verdean cooking. Overview One of the most important aspects of Cape Verdean culture is the beverage grogue, a strong rum made from distilled sugar cane on the islands of Santo Antao and Santiago. The beverage is made in towns such as Paul on Santo Antao and Cidade Velha on Santiago using a trapiche. A variation of the drink is ponche (punch) which is sweetened with condensed milk or sugarcane molasses. Due to the intoxication on consuming grogue, it is consumed by many Cape Verdean musicians seeking inspiration. Corn and beans are staples of Cape Verdean cuisine. Also popular are rice, fried potatoes, cassava and vegetables such as carrots, kale, squash, fish and meat such as tuna, sawfish, lobster, chicken, grilled pork and eggs. One legacy of the Portuguese on the islands is olives and Alentejo wines which are still imported. Cachupa, a stew is considered the national dish of Cape Verde which includes mashed maize, onions, green bananas, manioc, sweet potatoes, squash and yams . Manioc balls are one of the most common in Cape Verde. Maria Augusta Carvalho (2013). Comeres de √Åfrica Falados em Portugu√™s. Casa das Letras. p. 129. Seafood dishes include baga and b√∫zio cabra, made out of the bubonian conch (Persististrombus latus). In December 2002, the Cape Verdean government prohibited the killing of turtles by law, per their participation in the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1995 e a Conven√ß√£o sobre Comercio Internacional de Esp√©cies de Fauna e Flora Selvagem Amea√ßadas de Extin√ß√£o (CITES). The dish once popular on Santiago Island named turtle steak slowly no longer consumed.

With the assistance of Jacob Mestel. Volume 2. Warsaw: Elisheva. columns 1054-1057. Litman led a popular traveling theater troupe around Europe, performing highly satirical songs while costumed as a male Khosid. Because she frequently performed costumed as a young boy or as a male dandy, she is considered a proto-Drag King performer. Pepi Litman made numerous 78rpm recordings which capture her energetic and virtuosic singing style, and which also stand as a document of Jewish life in Eastern Europe.  Early life  Litman was born to poor Jewish parents in Tarnopol, a city in eastern Galicia (now in Ukraine). The region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where Jews were relatively free to work and travel. However, a poor Jewish girl with no dowry faced very limited prospects in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe, usually working uncompensated all her life to support her parents, husband, children and in-laws. In her youth, Litman worked as a maid in a theatrical boarding house run by the parents of Max Badin, an actor who later appeared in American Yiddish films. Since she had a good singing voice she soon got involved with the itinerant Yiddish vaudevillians known as the Broderzingers. The Broderzingers are credited with creating the earliest form of secular Yiddish theater in East European pubs, cafes, and wine gardens. Their performances combined elements of the traditional rabbinical court jester, the badkhn or wedding jester, and the Purimshpil [traditional holiday plays, usually performed privately by amateurs]. Besides providing comic entertainment, the Broderzingers were influenced by the Jewish Enlightenment, or Haskalah, to advocate modernization, education and emancipation for Jews. Some Broderzinger songs satirized Khosidism; others were sung from the point of view of working-class proste yidn [Yiddish: simple folk] such as nightwatchmen, water carriers, gravediggers, housemaids and beggars. Pepi married a Broderzinger, Jacob Litman or Littman, who ran his own travelling theatre troupe. After his death she took over the troupe herself, touring around inns, small towns, health spas, cities and even private homes in Russia, Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Rumania.  Eyewitness Accounts  According to eyewitness accounts cited by Zalmen Zylbercweig's Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater (Lexicon of the Yiddish Theatre), Pepi Litman spoke several languages, frequented literary Yiddish circles, and observed Jewish law as much as she could on the road, by keeping kosher and lighting Shabes candles. Jacob Mestel, a co-editor of the Leksikon, called her \\"a chansonette in Khosidic trousers.\\" Zylbercweig quotes another eyewitness account: \\"Dressed as a Khosid, in a big fur hat above curly peyes framing her round, full feminine face, in a wide unbuttoned coat with short trousers, white socks and pumps, with her hands twirling her peyes, she would burst from behind the curtains singing; and instantly, like lightning, set the audience on fire, both on the floor and in the balconies‚Äîas choirboys and merchants, tailors and doctors, maids and madames caught on to her melodies and sang along with her. \\"Pepi Litman had a masculine voice, deep and hoarse, but anyone who once heard her 'Yismekhu' could never forget it.\\" In 1910, journalist M. J. Landa reviewed Litman's performance in Lemberg, Poland as part of a \\"Zydowska Kabaretu\\" [Polish: \\"Jewish Cabaret\\"]. Landa wrote: \\"She was the 'star' of the program.....The moment she stepped on the stage, dressed as a Galician youth, with skull cap and ringlets, the whole atmosphere of the room was different. It was dominated by a personality.....Frankly, I do not think I have heard a female comic singer with a voice of greater power and possibility. I preferred it to the cultured voice of the lady in a black evening dress who crooned operatic airs with ease and effect, and afterward wheedled members of the audience into buying her portrait postcards. Pepi Littmnn's voice is a rich, clear mezzo of operatic fullness and breadth and there are moments when it is quite thrilling. At others, again, it sounds almost harsh ‚Äî this when she is engaged in repartee with her audience. She banters and expostulates with her hearers, always good humoredly and seems to take as much delight in her singing and in her patter as they do. She is the incarnation of the joyous spirit of the Jew, with moments of pathos and sentiment. Listening to her singing of \\"Shabbos After Table\\" and \\"Kol Yisrael Chaverim,' and also an amusing ditty about the Messiah coming in an automobile, I forgot that I was in Galicia‚Äîforgot the horrible depressing poverty with which I had been surrounded for some days....\\"  Career & Associates  From about 1905 to 1930, Litman performed in Germany (especially in spa towns like Marienbad and Karlsbad), Hungary (in Budapest), Poland (especially in Lemberg/Lviv), Russia (especially in Odessa), and probably in America, since she recorded several 78RPM discs in New York. She performed comic songs, often in a Germanized form of Yiddish called daytshmerish. She recorded a number of songs, both in Lemberg, Budapest, and in New York. Pepi Litman also worked closely with Broderzinger, author and composer Shloyme Pryzament. During World War I, Litman primarily performed in and around Odessa, where she found a following in literary circles. She was frequently a guest of Yiddish writer and editor David Frishman and author Mendele Mocher Sforim.  Death  Litman returned to performing in Vienna in 1928, mapping out a route that included Karlsbad, Marienbad, and Poland. She became quite ill after this tour, and, after a stay at the Rothschild Hospital, she died on 13 September 1930. Her funeral was arranged by the Vienna Yiddish Artists Union and her burial plot was donated by the Jewish community.

Since 2015, after being forced into exile, Bader and Darwish settled in Berlin and travel the world recounting their experiences and demanding justice for the Syrian population.  Activism and arrest  As a journalist and human rights activist, Bader works on exposing the detention and torture of journalists in war-torn Syria. She has been particularly vocal on activists‚Äô arrests and the violations of human rights committed by the Bashar al-Assad regime. In February 2012, she was among 14 CMFE staff members, including its director Mazen Darwish and prominent activist Razan Ghazzawi, who were arrested during a raid on their offices by the Syrian Air Force Intelligence services. Some were released a few days later, and, in 10 May 2012, eight more were released, among them Bader, to face trial for 'possession of banned publications'. Darwish was released in August 2015 along with colleagues Hussein Gharir and Hani al-Zitani.

They had believed it was a Boko Haram encampment. The bombing left at least 115 people dead, including six Red Cross aid workers, and left more than 100 injured. Background Boko Haram is a jihadist group of insurgents that demands Sharia law in Nigeria. They have been active in the Rann area, and Nigeria's military had mounted an offensive in 2016 that forced the group out. However, Boko Haram fighters returned after the region's rainy season ended, allowing them to travel more easily, and in December had attacked a military facility in the area. Incident Early reporting said that the Nigerian military had received information that Boko Haram forces were gathering in preparation for an attack on a military target. Major General Lucky Irabor, the commander of Nigerian forces fighting Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria, said that he had ordered an airstrike on the location where the militants were believed to be gathering. The airstrike took place sometime during the day‚Äîreports varied from about 09:00 local time to early in the afternoon ‚Äîand left at least dozens dead. According to M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF), which operated in the bombed camp, at least 50 people had been killed, while an official from Borno working in the recovery effort told the Associated Press that at least 100 were dead. A Red Cross spokesman said that six of its aid workers were among the dead. MSF said that up to 200 had been injured, with more expected to die overnight due to limited medical facilities and doctors in the remote area, and large scale rescue forces not expected to arrive until 18 January. On 18 January 2017, a Red Cross statement said that the number of dead stood at about 70, with 90 or more wounded remaining in Rann, 46 of whom were \\"severely injured\\". On 20 January, MSF said that they had confirmed 90 fatalities, and had received local reports that the final toll could be up to 170. An emergency services official in Nigeria said on 24 January that the number of dead had reached 115 confirmed; while other reports had said that 236 were killed, the official said that the larger number was the total of dead and injured. Response The United Nations (UN) and Red Cross jointly deployed a helicopter mission carrying medical personnel and of supplies, which arrived late on the 17th and evacuated eight Red Cross workers. Additional UN helicopters deployed to aid in evacuations, while MSF said that its workers in Chad and Cameroon were preparing to receive the victims once they had been stabilized for transport from Rann. Some of the injured were airlifted to Maiduguri. General Irabor, conceding for the first time in the fighting against Boko Haram that a government attack had resulted in civilian casualties, said that \\"[u]nfortunately, the strike was conducted, but it turned out that other civilians were somewhere around the area and they were affected\\", while President Muhammadu Buhari said that the incident had been a \\"regrettable operational mistake\\". The military planned to begin an investigation into the actions of the pilot flying the mission and the commanders involved in order to determine whether the airstrike had been an operational error. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, called the event a \\"very tragic and unfortunate incident\\" and promised a thorough investigation. On 24 January, an Air Force spokesman said that the investigation would be concluded by 2 February, though he did not say whether the military would release its findings. Mausi Segun, a member of the Human Rights Watch in Nigeria, said that regardless of intent, the group considered the bombing a crime, saying that \\"[e]ven if there is no evidence of a willful attack on the camp, which would be a war crime, the camp was bombed indiscriminately, violating international humanitarian law.\\" Hugues Robert of MSF said \\"This was a very densely populated place that was full of civilians who already lived there and internally displaced persons who had come there,\\" while The Economist criticized the bombing for occurring in the camp even though it was under army control at the time.

The original home of Tullamore Dew Irish whiskey, the distillery closed in 1954, having endured financial difficulties for many years, like many Irish whiskey distilleries of the early 20th century. The Tullamore Dew brand was later sold to John Powers & Co., now part of Irish Distillers, with production transferred to the Midleton Distillery. In 2010, the brand was purchased by William Grant & Sons, who invested ‚Ç¨35 million in the construction of a new distillery in Tullamore. The new Tullamore Distillery opened in 2014, bringing production of the whiskey back to Tullamore following a break of sixty years. In 2012, a whiskey museum, the Tullamore Dew Visitor Centre, opened in a restored former bonded warehouse belonging to the old distillery on Bury Quay.  History   Early years  Daniel E. Williams, the Manager and later owner of Tullamore Distillery, whose initials gave rise to Tullamore Dew. In the 1780s, there were over thirty registered distilleries in operation in County Offaly, then called King's County, with two operating in Tullamore. Those in Tullamore were run by a George Hamilton, and a Joseph Flanagan. However, due to the effects of a change in excise duties in 1779, the number of registered distilleries in operation decreased significantly, so that by 1818 only two registered distilleries remained in operation in the entire county, both in the town of Birr. In 1823, excise regulations were significantly reformed, leading to renewed investment in distilling. One of the new investors was Michael Molloy, who in 1829, established a new distillery on the site of Joseph Flanagan's previous operation on Bridge Street, which had operated from at least 1784 to the early 1800s. At the time, Molloy's family, well known merchants in the town, also ran a grocery and wine merchants business on Bridge Street. In the 1830s, Molloy expanded the distilling operation, purchasing an adjoining mill on Patrick Street, and by 1832, the distillery had an output of over 20,000 gallons per annum. In 1846, Molloy died unmarried, leaving the distillery and ¬£15,000 to his five nephews. Subsequently, the distillery was sold by the Court of Chancery to Molloy's brother Anthony for ¬£2,700. When Anthony died, he bequeathed the distillery to his nephew Bernard Daly, one of the five nephews who had originally inherited it in 1846. In 1886, the distillery was visited by Alfred Barnard, a British historian who remarked that it had been significantly modernised and expanded by Daly since he had inherited it, with the standard of whiskey produced there being similar to that produced by the noted Dublin houses of the time. The whiskey he noted, was \\"Old Pot Still\\" and \\"sold all over Ireland, but principally in Dublin, whilst a large quantity goes to Liverpool, London, and Australia\\". Barnard reserved particular praise for some of the eight-year old whiskey which he tasted on his visit. At the time, the distillery had a workforce of one-hundred, an output of 270,000 gallons per annum and held over 900,000 gallons of whiskey maturing in bond. Barnard remarked that at the time the Daly's owned a large estate in Terenure near Dublin, where Daly spent most of his time, with running of the distillery being superintended by his son (Captain Bernard Daly), his nephew B. Mara, and his son-in law Charles Comyn, but under the general management of Daniel E. Williams.  Tullamore Dew  When Bernard Daly himself died in the 1887 shortly after Barnard's visit, the distillery passed to his son Captain Bernard Daly. However, Daly did not concern himself much with the running of the distillery, leaving this to the distillery's General Manager Daniel E. Williams. Under Williams, the distillery expanded, and prospered, launching the whiskey which still bears his initials, Tullamore Dew, under the slogan \\"Give every man his Dew\\". In 1903, the distillery was incorporated under the name B Daly & Co. Ltd., with both Captain Daly and the Williams family having shares in the company. However, in 1931, the Dalys left the business and the distillery came under complete control of the Williams family.  Irish Mist  The Coffey Still which was installed in Tullamore in 1948 was later moved to the Kilbeggan Distillery as a museum exhibit. Like many Irish distilleries, the company suffered in the early part of the 20th century, due to the advent of competition from blended Scotch whisky, and the curtailment of exports to the British Empire and the United States during Prohibition and the Anglo- Irish Trade War. In fact, the distillery closed in 1925 to cut costs, staying closed for thirteen years, before reopening again in 1937. Faced with struggling sales in the 1940s, Desmond E. Williams, a descendant of the original D. E. Williams, began into alternative products, such as heather wine, a drink reputedly enjoyed by old Irish chieftains, which was made from a combination of whiskey, heather honey and other herbs. Unable to find an extant original recipe in Ireland, Williams wondered if Irish emigrants, such as those that left Ireland in the Flight of the Wild Geese in 1691, or after the Great Famine had carried the recipe overseas with them, and sent out word that he was interested in finding such a recipe. As luck would have it, an Austrian War refugee appeared in Tullamore in 1948 with a family recipe of Irish origin. Better than Williams' own reconstructed recipe, the result was Irish Mist, the first modern whiskey liqueur to be launched in Ireland. The same year, a Coffey Still was installed alongside the existing pot stills, allowing the production of grain and blended whiskeys.  Closure  Irish Mist was a roaring success for the distillery, however, with whiskey sales still languishing, the company decided to focus its limited resources on the liqueur. As a result, in 1953, the company was renamed the Irish Mist Liqueur Company, with distilling operations ceasing in Tullamore a year later, in 1954. In the 1960s, with the whiskey for use in Irish Mist running low, the company entered into an arrangement with John Powers & Son, whereby Powers would take ownership of the Tullamore Dew brand, in exchange for providing whiskey for use in the Irish Mist liqueur. Thus, sealing the fate of the distillery. Although the distillery has now been closed and replaced with a new site on the outskirts of Tullamore, many of the original buildings are still in existence, though their function has changed. These include: * Bob Smyth's Bar and Lounge, Patrick's Street - former millhouse * D. E. Williams House, Patrick Street - former head office * Tullamore Dew Visitor Centre, Bury Quay - former bonded warehouses In the 1980s, the nearby Kilbeggan distillery, which had closed in 1958 (though it has now re-opened), was converted to a museum. As its original pot stills had been sold, three of the four pot stills at Tullamore, along with the Coffey Still were purchased, and brought to the museum, where they are now displayed as exhibits.  Visitor centre  The Tullamore Dew Visitor Centre In 2012, a former bonded warehouse belonging to the original distillery was renovated and reopened as a whiskey museum and visitor centre. The visitor's centre includes a bar, restaurant and gift shop, and also operates conference facilities. The centre offers guided tours and tutored tastings ranging from 50 minutes to 5 hours in duration.

Magnet fishing, also called magnetic fishing, is searching in outdoor waters for ferromagnetic objects available to pull with a strong neodymium magnet. The hobby is a combination of environmentalism and treasure hunting. The magnets used are strong enough to remove large debris such as discarded bicycles, guns, safes, bombs, coins and car tire rims from bodies of water, but many who engage in the hobby are hoping to find rare and valuable items as well. Magnet fishers have also been known to return stolen safes to their owners after a number of years. It is thought magnet fishing was initially started by boaters using magnets to recover fallen keys from the water. Alt URL The hobby has been adopted by celebrities such as English rugby player James Haskell. Potential harms Some environmentalists worry that removing objects can stir up sediment that contains toxic materials, or disturb archaeological sites. Some magnet fishers have retrieved dangerous objects, including loaded guns and unexploded ordinance.Casting about for a new pastime during the pandemic? With magnet fishing, \\"it's all about the find\\" Magnet fishing and the law Depending on the jurisdiction, anything of value may belong to the local government, not the finder.  England & Wales  Magnet fishing is subject to local regulations concerning outdoor waters. It is legal but the Canal & River Trust, which owns most of the UK's canals, has bylaws prohibiting people from removing material from the canal and rivers it owns so fishers may be subject to a ¬£25 fine, to magnet-fish, or remove any material from canal or inland navigation under the control of the Canal & River Trust in England or Wales, other than the Lee and Stort Navigation, Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, and River Severn Navigation. The Trust \\"expressly prohibit[s]\\" the practice although it refrains from legal action against first-time offenders. In 2018, a child magnet-fished a sawn-off shotgun out of the Titford Canal in Oldbury, West Midlands.  Hamburg  In Hamburg, magnet fishing without a permit is punishable by fine.

This type of sampling is most useful for pilot testing.  Definition  A convenience sample is a type of non-probability sampling method where the sample is taken from a group of people easy to contact or to reach. For example, standing at a mall or a grocery store and asking people to answer questions would be an example of a convenience sample. This type of sampling is also known as grab sampling or availability sampling. There are no other criteria to the sampling method except that people be available and willing to participate. In addition, this type of sampling method does not require that a simple random sample is generated, since the only criterion is whether the participants agree to participate.  Applications  Convenience sampling is not often recommended for research due to the possibility of sampling error and lack of representation of population. But it can be handy depending on the situation. In some situations, convenience sampling is the only possible option. For example, a college student who is doing a term project and wants to know the average consumption of coke in that college town on Friday night will most probably call some of his friends and ask them how many cans of coke they drink, or go to a nearby party to do an easy survey. There is always a trade-off between this method of quick sampling and accuracy. Collected samples may not represent the population of interest and therefore be a source of bias. In the example above, if said college town has a small population and mostly consists of students, and that particular student chooses a graduation party for survey, then his sample has a fair chance to represent the population. Larger sample size will reduce the chance of sampling error occurring. Another example would be a gaming company that wants to know how one of their games is doing in the market one day after its release. Its analyst may choose to create an online survey on Facebook to rate that game. The major challenge of this approach will be reaching to the people who play games. As social media is a vast place, it's always difficult to collect samples from the population of interest. Most people may not be interested or take the survey seriously while completing it, which results in sampling error. The survey may be improved greatly if the analyst posts it to fan pages dedicated to game-lovers. He may find a lot more people in that group who would be inclined to judge and rate the game critically.  Advantages  Convenience sampling can be used by almost anyone and has been around for generations. One of the reasons that it is most often used is due to the numerous advantages it provides. This method is extremely speedy, easy, readily available, and cost effective, causing it to be an attractive option to most researchers. Expedited data collection When time is of the essence, many researchers turn to convenience sampling for data collection, as they can swiftly gather data and begin their calculations. It is useful in time sensitive research because very little preparation is needed to use convenience sampling for data collection. It is also useful when researchers need to conduct pilot data collection in order to gain a quick understanding of certain trends or to develop hypotheses for future research. By rapidly gathering information, researchers and scientists can isolate growing trends, or extrapolate generalized information from local public opinion. Ease of research For researchers who are not looking for an accurate sampling, they can simply collect their information and move on to other aspects of their study. This type of sampling can be done by simply creating a questionnaire and distributing it to their targeted group. Through this method, researchers can easily finish collecting their data in a matter of hours, free from worrying about whether it is an accurate representation of the population. This allows for a great ease of research, letting researchers focus on analyzing the data rather than interviewing and carefully selecting participants. Ready availability Since most convenience sampling is collected with the populations on hand, the data is readily available for the researcher to collect. They do not typically have to travel great distances to collect the data, but simply pull from whatever environment is nearby. Having a sample group readily available is important for meeting quotas quickly, and allows for the researcher to even do multiple studies in an expeditious fashion. Cost effectiveness One of the most important aspects of convenience sampling is its cost effectiveness. This method allows for funds to be distributed to other aspects of the project. Oftentimes this method of sampling is used to gain funding for a larger, more thorough research project. In this instance, funds are not yet available for a more complete survey, so a quick selection of the population will be used to demonstrate a need for the completed project.  Disadvantages  Even though convenience sampling can be easy to obtain, its disadvantages usually outweigh the advantages. This sampling technique may be more appropriate for one type of study and less for another. Bias The results of the convenience sampling cannot be generalized to the target population because of the potential bias of the sampling technique due to under-representation of subgroups in the sample in comparison to the population of interest. The bias of the sample cannot be measured. Therefore, inferences based on the convenience sampling should be made only about the sample itself. Power Convenience sampling is characterized with insufficient power to identify differences of population subgroups.

The goal of new constitutionalism is to separate the democratic and economic practices by shifting economic aims from the regional and national level to the global level through constitutional framework. The purpose of this shift is to create global supremacy and promote a free capitalist system. Central ideas of neoliberalism have been advanced to create policies and practices to achieve global governance. New constitutionalism provides power to the private realm and limits power of state governance and public corporations. The transferring of power creates an informal self-regulatory setting allowing for the dismissal of public scrutiny and transparency. New constitutionalism has reshaped the structure of control to allow ‚Äúlocking in‚Äù mechanisms to occur to prevent intervention from the democratic realm and to enhance economic objectives. This protects markets from regional interference and allows global influence in order to promote imperialism. The development of new constitutionalism is the result of globalization and the growing need for global hegemony. Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism. The World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the European Union are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy. New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic Stephen Gill. The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the Russian Revolution and the Cold War as well as the progress of globalization through technological means. Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the global financial crisis of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath. Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.  Origins  New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the ‚Äúworldwide market revolution.‚Äù The end of the Cold War represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation. This shift was reiterated by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declaring the depletion of socialism and the rise of conservatism and liberalism. As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, transnational corporation and the expansion of the world market. The Great Depression and the aftermath of World War II reflected the need for reform. Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by Cutler, A., & Gill, S. In New constitutionalism and world order. Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. . Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the United States and the Soviet Union allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order. Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting executive and legislative branches of government using constitutional framework.Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) \\"Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism.\\" Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies 23, no. 1: 95-125. New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the 2007 global financial crisis as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.Schneiderman, D. (2014). How to govern differently: neo-liberal, new constitutionalism and international investment law. Edited by Cutler, A., & Gill, S. In New constitutionalism and world order. Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 159-175. .  Framework  There are four main policies to define new constitutionalism. The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers. These international economic agreements or ‚Äúconstitutions‚Äù resemble political constitutions and thus ensure sovereignty. The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability. Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence. This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces. This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency. Economic liberation is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement. The World Bank advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation. Thirdly is creating ‚Äúlocking in‚Äù mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions. This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy. Agreements are formulated to ‚Äúlock in‚Äù neoliberal content through legal guarantees and sanctions. These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous. Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability. New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to international corporations and private entities creating a ‚Äúdouble‚Äù legal standard. This concept diminished the ‚Äúwatchdog‚Äù and gives the flexibility for self-regulation. This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the nineteenth century which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions. Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency. Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.Cutler, C. (2011).

Toronto: University of Toronto Press.  Institutions  At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance global governance by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free capitalist society. These institutions policies will ensure economic growth at the global level.Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by Cutler, A., & Gill, S. In New constitutionalism and world order. Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195.  Global  The World Trade Organization (WTO) is a prominent figure in governing the global economy. Formally it was the responsibility of General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade built on neoliberal principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism. The World Trade Organization represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism. The WTO main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy. Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the WTO as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction. The WTO represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a world economy, by doing so provides protection to the private sector. Stephen McBride describes the World Trade Organization as having ‚Äúquasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.‚Äù The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.  Regional  The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism. President Ronald Regan referred to the North American Free Trade Agreement as a ‚Äúnew economic constitution.‚Äù Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms. The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations. By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore public services in free trade.  Criticisms  Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within nation states. This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control capitalism politically, democracy and socially. The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level. New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations. Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society. Human rights, environmental concerns and public services are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern. New constitutionalism favours the elitists providing preferential treatment and widening the social gap. International financial institutions, investors and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy. There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but humanitarian concerns as well. The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their sovereignty as independent nations. Australia has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many South America states have begun to exit the global regime completely. Canada and the United States have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.

However, 4D printing adds the dimension of transformation over time. It is therefore a type of programmable matter, wherein after the fabrication process, the printed product reacts with parameters within the environment (humidity, temperature, etc.,) and changes its form accordingly. The ability to do so arises from the near infinite configurations at a micrometer resolution, creating solids with engineered molecular spatial distributions and thus allowing unprecedented multifunctional performance.  Printing techniques  Stereolithography is a 3D-printing technique that uses photopolymerization to bind substrate that has been laid layer upon layer, creating a polymeric network. As opposed to fused- deposition modeling, where the extruded material hardens immediately to form layers, 4D printing is fundamentally based in stereolithography, where in most cases ultraviolet light is used to cure the layered materials after the printing process has completed. Anisotropy is vital in engineering the direction and magnitude of transformations under a given condition, by arranging the micromaterials in a way so that there is an embedded directionality to the finished print.  Fiber architecture  One of the composite polymers that Tibbits et al. printed, reacting when submerged underwater. Most 4D printing systems utilize a network of fibers that vary in size and material properties. 4D-printed components can be designed on the macro scale as well as the micro scale. Micro scale design is achieved through complex molecular/fiber simulations that approximate the aggregated material properties of all the materials used in the sample. The size, shape, modulus, and connection pattern of these material building blocks have a direct relationship to the deformation shape under stimulus activation. = Hydro- reactive polymers/hydrogels = Skylar Tibbits is the director of the Self- Assembly Lab at MIT, and worked with the Stratasys Materials Group to produce a composite polymer composed of highly hydrophilic elements and non-active, rigid elements. The unique properties of these two disparate elements allowed up to 150% swelling of certain parts of the printed chain in water, while the rigid elements set structure and angle constraints for the transformed chain. Tibbits et al. produced a chain that would spell \\"MIT\\" when submerged in water, and another chain that would morph into a wireframe cube when subjected to the same conditions.  Cellulose composites  Thiele et al. explored the possibilities of a cellulose-based material that could be responsive to humidity. They developed a bilayer film using cellulose steraroyl esters with different substitution degrees on either side. One ester had a substitution degree of 0.3 (highly hydrophilic) and the other had a substitution degree of 3 (highly hydrophobic.) When the sample was cooled from 50 ¬∞C to 22 ¬∞C, and the relative humidity increased from 5.9% to 35%, the hydrophobic side contracted and the hydrophilic side swelled, causing the sample to roll up tightly. This process is reversible, as reverting the temperature and humidity changes caused the sample to unroll again. Understanding anisotropic swelling and mapping the alignment of printed fibrils allowed A. Sydney Gladman et al. to mimic the nastic behavior of plants. Branches, stems, bracts, and flowers respond to environmental stimuli such as humidity, light, and touch by varying the internal turgor of their cell walls and tissue composition. Taking precedent from this, the team developed a composite hydrogel architecture with local anisotropic swelling behavior that mimics the structure of a typical cell wall. Cellulose fibrils combine during the printing process into microfibrils with a high aspect ratio (~100) and an elastic modulus on the scale of 100 GPa. These microfibrils are embedded into a soft acrylamide matrix for structure. The viscoelastic ink used to print this hydrogel composite is an aqueous solution of N,N-dimethylacrylamide, nanoclay, glucose oxidase, glucose, and nanofibrillated cellulose. The nanoclay is a rheological aid that improves liquid flow, and the glucose prevents oxygen inhibition when the material is cured with ultraviolet light. Experimenting with this ink, the team created a theoretical model for a print path that dictates the orientation of cellulose fibrils, where the bottom layer of the print is parallel to the x-axis and the top layer of the print is rotated anticlockwise by an angle Œ∏. The curvature of the sample is dependent on elastic moduli, swelling ratios, and ratios of layer thickness and bilayer thickness. Thus, the adjusted models that describe mean curvature and Gaussian curvature are, respectively, H = c_1 \\\\frac {\\\\alpha_\\\\parallel - \\\\alpha_\\\\perp}{h} \\\\frac {\\\\sin^2(\\\\theta)}{c_2 -c_3\\\\cos(2\\\\theta) + m_4\\\\cos(4\\\\theta)} and K = -c_4 \\\\frac {(\\\\alpha_\\\\parallel - \\\\alpha_\\\\perp)^{2}}{h^{2}} \\\\frac {\\\\sin^2(\\\\theta)}{c_5 -c_6\\\\cos(2\\\\theta) + m_4\\\\cos(4\\\\theta)} Gladman et al. found that as Œ∏ approaches 0¬∞, the curvature approximates the classical Timoshenko equation and performs similarly to a bimetallic strip. But as Œ∏ approaches 90¬∞, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control the effects of anisotropy and break lines of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more. = Thermo-reactive polymers/hydrogels = Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), or pNIPAM, is a commonly used thermo-responsive material. A hydrogel of pNIPAM becomes hydrophilic and swollen in an aqueous solution of 32 ¬∞C, its low critical solution temperature. Temperatures above that start to dehydrate the hydrogel and cause it shrink, thus achieving shape transformation. Hydrogels composed of pNIPAM and some other polymer, such as 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate (4HBA,) exhibit strong reversibility, where even after 10 cycles of shape change there is no shape deformation. Shannon E. Bakarich et al. created a new type of 4D-printing ink composed of ionic covalent entanglement hydrogels that have a similar structure to standard double- network hydrogels. The first polymer network is cross-linked with metal cations, while the second is cross-linked with covalent bonds. This hydrogel is then paired with a pNIPAM network for toughening and thermal actuation. In lab testing, this gel showed a shape recovery of 41%-49% when the temperature increased , and then was restored to 20 ¬∞C. A fluid controlling smart valve printed from this material was designed to close when touching hot water and open when touching cold water. The valve successfully stayed open in cold water and reduced the flow rate of hot water by 99%. This new type of 4D-printed hydrogel is more mechanically robust than other thermally actuating hydrogels and shows potential in applications such as self-assembling structures, medical technology, soft robotics, and sensor technology.A schematic of an interlocking SMP component.An interlocking and self-folding SMP mimicking the folding procedure of a USPS mailbox.  Digital Shape- Memory Polymers  A time-lapse of an SMP gripper that Qi Ge et al. developed for grabbing and releasing an object. Shape-memory polymers (SMPs) are able to recover their original shape from a deformed shape under certain circumstances, such as when exposed to a temperature for a period of time. Depending on the polymer, there may be a variety of configurations that the material may take in a number of temperature conditions. Digital SMPs utilize 3D-printing technology to precisely engineer the placement, geometry, and mixing and curing ratios of SMPs with differing properties, such as glass transition or crystal-melt transition temperatures. Yiqi Mao et al. used this to create a series of digital SMP hinges that have differing prescribed thermo-mechanical and shape memory behaviors, which are grafted onto rigid, non-active materials. Thus, the team was able to develop a self-folding sample that could fold without interfering with itself, and even interlock to create a more robust structure. One of the projects include a self-folding box modeled after a USPS mailbox. Qi Ge et al. designed digital SMPs based on constituents with varying rubbery moduli and glass-transition temperatures with extremely high-failure strains of up to 300% larger than existing printable materials. This allowed them to create a multi-material gripper that could grab and release an object according to a temperature input. The thick joints were made of SMPs for robustness, while the tips of the microgrippers could be designed separately to accommodate a safe contact for the object of transport.  Stress relaxation  Stress relaxation in 4D printing is a process in which a material assembly is created under stress that becomes \\"stored\\" within the material. This stress can later be released, causing an overall material shape change. = Thermal photo-reactive polymers = This type of polymeric actuation can be described as photo-induced stress relaxation. This technology takes advantage of temperature driven polymer bending by exposing the desired bending seams to focused strips of intense light. These bending seams are printed in a state of stress but do not deform until exposed to light. The active agent that induces bending in the material is heat transmitted by intense light. The material itself is made of chemical photo-reactive polymers. These compounds use a polymer mixture combined with a photoinitiator to create an amorphous, covalently cross-linked polymer. This material is formed into sheets and loaded in tension perpendicular to the desired bending crease. The material is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light, as the photoinitiator is consumed it polymerizes the remaining mixture, inducing photoinitiated stress relaxation. The portion of material exposed to the light can be controlled with stencils to create specific bending patterns. It is also possible to run multiple iterations of this process using the same material sample with different loading conditions or stencil masks for each iteration. The final form will depend on the order and resulting form of each iteration.  Current applications  Miao et al. Parts A, B, and C indicate cell growth on the soy scaffold compared to different materials. Part D indicates cell growth on differing infill densities within the soy scaffold.  Biomedical  Dr. Lijie Grace Zhang's research team at the George Washington University created a new type of 4D-printable, photo- curable liquid resin. This resin is made of a renewable soybean-oil epoxidized acrylate compound that is also biocompatible. This resin adds to the small group of 3D-printable resins and is one of the few that are biocompatible. A laser 3D-printed sample of this resin was subjected to temperature fluctuations from -18 ¬∞C to 37 ¬∞C and exhibited full recovery of its original shape. Printed scaffolds of this material proved to be successful foundations for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) growth. This material's strong qualities of shape memory effect and biocompatibility lead researchers to believe that it will strongly advance the development of biomedical scaffolds. This research article is one of the first that explore the use of plant oil polymers as liquid resins for stereolithography production in biomedical applications. Research team of Leonid Ionov (University of Bayreuth) has developed novel approach to print shape-morphing biocompatible/biodegradable hydrogels with living cells. The approach allows fabrication of hollow self-folding tubes with unprecedented control over their diameters and architectures at high resolution. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by employing two different biopolymers (alginate and hyaluronic acid) and mouse bone marrow stromal cells. Harnessing the printing and post-printing parameters allows attaining average internal tube diameters as low as 20 Œºm, which is not yet achievable by other existing bioprinting approaches and is comparable to the diameters of the smallest blood vessels. The proposed 4D bioprinting process does not pose any negative effect on the viability of the printed cells, and the self-folded hydrogel-based tubes support cell survival for at least 7 days without any decrease in cell viability. Consequently, the presented 4D bioprinting strategy allows the fabrication of dynamically reconfigurable architectures with tunable functionality and responsiveness, governed by the selection of suitable materials and cells.  Possible Applications  There are some existing techniques/technologies that could potentially be applied and adjusted for 4D printing.  Cell Traction Force  Cell Traction Force (CTF) is a technique wherein living cells fold and move microstructures into their designed shape. This is possible through the contraction that occurs from actin polymerization and actomyosin interactions within the cell. In natural processes, CTF regulates wound healing, angiogenesis, metastasis, and inflammation. Takeuchi et al. seeded cells across two microplates, and when the glass structure was removed the cells would bridge the gap across the microplate and thus initiate self-folding. The team was able to create vessel-like geometries and even high throughput dodecahedrons with this method. There is speculation that utilizing this technique of cell origami will lead to designing and printing a cell- laden structure that can mimic their non-synthetic counterparts after the printing process has completed.  Electrical and Magnetic Smart Materials  The electrical responsive materials that exist today change their size and shape depending on the intensity and/or direction of an external electric field. Polyaniline and polypyrrole (PPy) are, in particular, good conducting materials and can be doped with tetrafluoroborate to contract and expand under an electric stimulus. A robot made of these materials was made to move using an electric pulse of 3V for 5 seconds, causing one leg to extend, then removing the stimulus for 10 seconds, causing the other leg to move forward. Research on carbon nanotubes, which are biocompatible and highly conductive, indicates that a composite made of carbon nanotube and a shape memory specimen has a higher electrical conductivity and speed of electro-active response than either specimen alone. Magnetically responsive ferrogels contract in the presence of a strong magnetic field and thus have applications in drug and cell delivery. The combination of carbon nanotubes and magnetically responsive particles has been bioprinted for use in promoting cell growth and adhesion, while still maintaining a strong conductivity.  Commerce and transportation  Skylar Tibbits elaborates on future applications of 4D-printed materials as programmable products that can be tailored to specific environments and respond to factors such as the temperature, humidity, pressure, and sound of one's body or environment. Tibbits also mentions the advantage of 4D-printing for shipping applications - it will allow products to be packaged flat to later have their designed shape activated on site by a simple stimulus. There is also the possibility of 4D-printed shipping containers that react to forces in transit to uniformly distribute loads. It is very likely that 4D-printed materials will be able to repair themselves after failure. These materials will be able to self-disassemble, making their constituent parts easy to recycle.

The son of Micajah Townsend and Elizabeth Platt, he graduated from Princeton University in 1766, and received a master's degree in 1769. Townsend studied law, was admitted to the bar, and began a practice in White Plains. He was appointed secretary of Westchester County's Committee of Safety, and in June 1776 he was commissioned as a captain and appointed to command a company in the New York militia. He served until November 1776, when his company was disbanded. After his militia service, Townsend relocated to Brattleboro, Vermont. Initially a supporter of New York's government in its ongoing dispute with local residents concerning jurisdiction over Vermont, Townsend later became a supporter of the Vermont government's claims. From 1781 to 1787 he was judge and register of probate for Windham County. From 1781 to 1788, Townsend served as Vermont's Secretary of State. After resigning his offices, Townsend continued to practice law in Brattleboro. In 1801, Townsend sold his Brattleboro home and land to Royall Tyler, and moved to Guilford. In 1802, he moved again, this time to Farnham, Quebec, Canada. He farmed and practiced law, and continued to reside in Farnham until 1816, when he moved to Clarenceville. In Clarenceville, Townsend resided with his son, the Reverend Micajah Townsend. Townsend died in Clarenceville on April 23, 1832. He was buried at Saint Georges Anglican Cemetery in Clarenceville.

Macy. The film is based on the novel A Swell-Looking Babe by Jim Thompson. Plot Sonny lives with his intellectually disabled older brother Leroy and works as a bellhop in a hotel, struggling to pay back a loan to Jack Cougar, the head of hotel security. Sonny is attracted to Monique, a hotel guest who says she is from Paris and slits her wrists in front of him as a cry for help. He is warned not to have sex with the guests because the hotel manager Mr. Stillwell wishes to run a respectable business and regain the third star that the hotel has lost, yet Monique continually tempts him aggressively. After he relents and has sex with her, she suddenly stands up and begins screaming. Sonny punches her out in a panic and flees the room. Del, a former bellhop now working for local gangster Lenny Ish and staying in the room next to Monique, tells Sonny that he will take care of the situation. Sonny sees Del and Cougar forcibly removing Monique from the hotel and tells Del that he does not want her to be killed by Cougar. Del says that she could be paid to keep quiet for $5,000 and invites Sonny to take part in a heist of Lenny Ish's high-stakes poker game at the hotel, promising to give Lenny 10% of the total haul of $700,000. Monique visits Sonny one night and confesses that she is actually from Montreal, was hired by Del to be a hostess at the poker game, and was then hired to seduce Sonny and scream that it was rape in order to force him into participating in the heist. The heist takes place the Tuesday night before the Wednesday poker game. Cougar takes the keys to the hotel safety deposit boxes from the poker players at gunpoint. The other two bellhops, Bascomb and Billy, are supposed to take a break to eat and leave Sonny alone at this time but have decided to just eat at the front desk instead. Del arrives and forces Bascomb to hand the stolen keys to Sonny but during the handover the keys are dropped and mixed up. Bascomb and Sonny hurriedly try the forty keys in each of the forty lock boxes. Sonny closes the security door and locks himself and Bascomb in the lock box room. Billy attempts to talk Del and Cougar out of the heist but is shot dead by Cougar. Cougar shoots Bascomb through the mail slot in the door then pushes the gun through it and tells Sonny to finish him off as he and Del leave the hotel. Sonny, wearing gloves, uses the gun to kill Bascomb. Sonny puts his share of $70,000 in a child's backpack and gives it to his brother to drive home. He takes the remaining money from Bascomb's corpse and puts it in a bag, which he sends up to Monique's room in the elevator. An interrogator questions Sonny at the police station, telling him that no losses were declared by the robbed guests due to the illegal nature of the planned poker game. Sonny insists that he was not involved and is released. He receives a call from Del claiming that Monique is demanding the money and that Sonny is to leave it in the trunk of a specific Cadillac for them, but Sonny knows that he is lying about Monique. Sonny admits to Monique that he killed Bascomb and they make plans to run away together with his share of the money. Sonny is confronted by Del and Cougar at the drop-off and they insist that Monique demands Sonny's share as well. Sonny angrily tells them that Monique is with him. When Cougar puts a gun to Sonny's head, Monique comes out from her hiding spot and shoots Cougar. Del runs away with the money and Monique chases after him and shoots him. Sonny finishes him off with another bullet. Monique wipes the gun clean and they return home to Leroy. Lenny Ish and one of his enforcers confront Sonny at his home and demand the money. Ish explains that he had planned to be robbed in exchange for part of the money but that Del and Cougar betrayed him. Sonny and Monique give him the money, which Ish says he will loan to Mr. Stillwell to pay off the victims of the heist in exchange for a controlling interest in the hotel. They leave Sonny alive, telling him that he will get a bellhop's cut. Monique then departs, leaving Sonny and Leroy alone again.

Following the prohibition of SPD on 22 June 1933 her political work ended for the time being. During this time, the personal situation of the Strohsahl family worsened, harassing controls by the National Socialists increased. The supervisory school authority retroactively changed the passed high school diploma of her daughter Ruth from \\"good\\" to \\"poor/fail\\" which made her flee to the UK. With the prohibition of the \\"Alte Liebe\\" on 16 March 1933 John Strohsahl was unemployed. Anna Strohsahl supported her family during World War II as a house maid and a seamstress.  Postwar period and death  On 22 November 1945, the British military government mandated Strohsahl and 29 other unencumbered city delegates to manage Cuxhaven until the free elections on 13 October 1946.

The fire lasted for two weeks, and caused ¬£2million worth of damage. During the fire, James Braidwood, superintendent of the London Fire Engine Establishment, was killed. House of Commons reports cited multiple failures in fire prevention, and the fire led to the 1865 Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act, which established the London Fire Brigade. Blaze Tooley Street on 23 June 1861 The fire started on 22 June 1861, at Cotton's Wharf on Tooley Street, near to St Olave's Church, Southwark, and was first noticed around 4p.m. Cotton's Wharf was around , and contained around 5,000 tons of rice, 10,000 barrels of tallow, 1,000 tons of hemp, 1,100 tons of jute, 3,000 tons of sugar and 18,000 bales of cotton at the time of the fire. and unsafe jute and hemp storage in Cotton's Wharf and nearby wharves helped spread the fire. The cause of the fire is believed to have been spontaneous combustion, and it has been suggested that someone smoking in the wharves may have started the fire. Whilst Cotton's Wharf was classed as good for fire protection, the surrounding buildings were less well protected, which enabled the fire to spread quickly. The London Fire Engine Establishment (later the London Fire Brigade) were alerted by 5p.m. A local distiller acted as temporary fire marshal until the London Fire Engine Establishment arrived, as his distillery had two private fire engines. A number of other private fire engines were also used. By 6p.m., 14 fire engines, including one steam engine, from the London Fire Engine Establishment were at the scene. The Fire Establishment's river fire engine was unable to draw water from the River Thames as it was low tide and so the river was too shallow. The fire was so great that the river fire engine was forced to retreat. The firefighters were also inhibited when the spice warehouses caught fire, and distributed spices into the air. The Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire (which was later merged into the London Fire Brigade) also assisted with controlling the fire. Statue of James Braidwood, who died during the fire. Around 730 p.m., a section of a warehouse collapsed on top of James Braidwood, the superintendent of the London Fire Engine Establishment, killing him. Another firefighter was killed in the same incident. Braidwood had been giving his firefighters their brandy rations at the time of the collapse. Around 10 hours after the fire started, it was stabilised and confined to a single area. The fire took two weeks to put out, during which time around 20 police officers remained present at the scene. Over 30,000 people watched the fire burn. The fire caused damage to buildings up to away from Cotton's Wharf, and destroyed of land. The range of the fire spanned from St Olave's Church to Battle Bridge Stairs. During the fire, tallow and oil from the wharves spilled into the River Thames, destroying four sailing boats and numerous barges. London Bridge station also caught fire in the blaze, but the fire was put out by the station's private fire engines. The fire could be seen from up to away. In total, the damages from the fire were around ¬£2 million. In his diary, Arthur Munby described the scene as: > \\"For near a quarter of a mile, the south bank of the Thames was on fire: a > long line of what had been warehouses, their roofs and fronts all gone; and > the tall ghastly sidewalls, white with heat, standing, or rather tottering, > side by side in the midst of a mountainous desert of red & black ruin, which > smouldered & steamed here, & there, sent up sheets of savage intolerable > flame a hundred feet high.\\" The fire has been described as the worst London fire since the Great Fire of London. Aftermath An 1862 House of Commons report into the fire noted the lack of availability of water when the fire started, as the area did not have a hydraulic pump as other areas such as West India Dock did, and the water company only supplied water to houses in Tooley Street for 90 minutes a day. An 1867 House of Commons report also criticised the ineffectiveness of the allegedly fire proof floors, and general fire protection in the South London District. It recommended that oil should not be stored in places where it could flow. According to the 1862 House of Commons Report, insurance companies lost over ¬£1 million from the fire. It is believed that one of the owners of Cotton's Wharf was insured for ¬£400,000, and the Royal Insurance Company lost ¬£75,000. It was the first time that most insurance companies had lost money since they had started having private fire engines. Following the fire, insurance companies changed the way they insured wharves, and their fire insurance policies, to encourage safer storage of goods. They also raised their insurance premiums by between 50 and 100%. The fire and insurance premium rises led to the 1865 Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act, which established the London Fire Brigade. The Act also mandated that iron doors be used as these were less flammable, and recommended that they be shut at all times, which was not the case during the Tooley Street fire. The fire also contributed to the establishment of many new fire insurance firms. These included the Commercial Union and Mercantile companies; and in 1867 the Reinsurance Company in London who specialised in insuring damaged buildings was also established. The wharves destroyed in the Tooley Street fire were rebuilt as separated buildings, to make them safer from fire in future. A plaque to commemorate the fire, and memorialise James Braidwood, is located on Battle Bridge Lane, on the corner of Tooley Street. Other fires on Tooley Street An 1836 fire destroyed Topping's Wharf on Tooley Street, and an 1843 fire on Tooley Street destroyed St. Olave's Church. In 1891, there was another large fire which took 19 days to extinguish, and was described as the worst fire since the 1861 Tooley Street fire.

Notes on the Bible - Micah 4. London, Blackie & Son, 1884. Reprint, Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998. that is, the place where Messiah as \\"the lamb of God\\" should be born.Migdal Eder and the Lord's first coming in the Book of Micah. This teaching by Rabbi Mike L Short. * \\"The stronghold (ophel, \\"the hill\\") of the daughter of Zion\\": The name \\"Ophel\\" is affixed to the southern spur of Moriah, opposite to the Mount Zion, from which it was separated by the Tyropoeon Valley. It was fortified by Jotham () and Manasseh (), and on it were the king's house, i.e. the old palace of David, and \\"the tower that lieth out,\\" or the upper tower (see ). This is probably the \\"flock tower\\" mentioned in the text (compare , where Ophel and the watch tower are named together); and it is so called as having been originally a place of refuge for flocks, or of observation for shepherds. Micah uses the two expressions to represent the power and dominion of Jerusalem. The propriety of the use of the term \\"flock tower\\" is seen when we remember that David was a shepherd before he was king, and that the Israelites are the sheep of the Lord's pasture. The reference to a flock in the prceeding verses may also have influenced the prophet's thought. Owing to a slight variation in the reading, the LXX. renders Ophel by Œ±·º∞œáŒºœéŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, \\"dark;\\" so Jerome, \\"nebulosa;\\" Aquila, œÉŒ∫ŒøœÑœéŒ¥Œ∑œÇ: Symmachus, ·ºÄœÄœåŒ∫œÅœÖœÜŒøœÇ. These translators would refer the term to the ruinous condition of the tower. The first dominion shall come, i.e. the former, original empire, such as it was in the days of David and Solomon, and which had been lost in later times. The LXX. adds, ·ºêŒ∫ ŒíŒ±Œ≤œÖŒª·ø∂ŒΩŒøœÇ: and hence the Greek expositors explain the passage as referring to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

He also served on the board of directors for the Children's Health Council and was one of the founders of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.  Mackay Homes   Early years  In 1948 John Mackay built the first commercial building in downtown Menlo Park, California (on Santa Cruz Avenue). He founded the home building company Mackay Homes in 1950.  Design  Mackay homes in the Modernist tract style are examples of Modernist architecture that has come to be known as \\"California Modern\\". These homes typically feature glass walls, post-and-beam construction, enclosed patios and open floor plans in a style indebted to Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. The Mackay homes were designed by Anshen & Allen, the same architects who worked with Joseph Eichler. The homes were known for their wonderful light and use of outdoor living space. Mackay's have raised foundations and forced air heating, unlike Eichler's slab foundations and radiant heating. Mackay Homes built homes in other architectural styles as well, but they are best known for their California Modernist homes.  History  In the 1950s, Mackay-manufactured homes often represented moving from farmland or remote locations into the newly developed suburbs. For some, this was a dream that had spanned multiple generations and ushered them closer to middle class. Joseph Eichler's son Ned Eichler stated in a 2001 interview, \\"There were Kaufman and Broad, there was Mackay Homes, and there were local builders wherever we were building,\\" when asked about competition in the residential building market in the early years. Mackay homes were built for 30 years, and included over 15,000 apartments, homes and office parks in 13 states. Many of the developments were located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

It is now a 501 c4 nonprofit advocacy organization. Their mission is to encourage African American women to be more involved in politics so that action can be taken to address their oppressions. The goal of the organization is to focus on the intersectionality of issues pertaining to race and gender by encouraging African American women to become involved in the political process. Dezie Woods-Jones was elected the first president of the organization in 1970. Woods dedicated her life to addressing issues concerning education, poverty, female empowerment, and disenchantment. BWOPA focuses on addressing its three branches: operations, political advocacy, and education.  History  Black Women Organized for Political Action was founded in 1968 after expanding from a smaller group called the Bay Area Women for Dellums. The group was formed by 12 women in the Bay Area of California. Until 1970, the group functioned under co-chairs. In 1970, however, they elected their first president Dezie Woods-Jones.  Leadership  Dezie Woods-Jones was the first president of Black Women Organized for Political Action. In addition to her involvement in BWOPA, she was a community activist for over 40 years. In her years of activism, she served as a city council member in Oakland, Vice Mayor of Oakland, and president of BWOPA for 30 years. Through her involvement, BWOPA's political action resulted in the election of other women who were the first African American women representatives in their areas.  Mission  Black Women Organized for Political Action‚Äôs mission is to motivate and support African American women to involve themselves in the political process. They provide leadership training to help women develop strategies, articulate injustices to African American women, and form networks. The core issues of their focus are health, education, criminal justice, and economic security. * Health - BWOPA strives to raise awareness of the health disparities in the health system and advocate for political action that will give African American women more accessible health care. Their goal within the health sector is to spread awareness and advocate for policies to increase access to quality care. * Education - BWOPA advocates for political action that will increase the rates of African American high school graduation and college completion rates. They are focused on improving access to early education, safe school environments, high-quality education, and more support for funding for schools. * Criminal Justice Reform - BWOPA is concerned with reducing the high rates of African American incarceration by providing alternatives to incarceration for youths, encourage rehabilitation and assistance in reintegrating after incarceration. * Economic Security - BWOPA aims to reduce the disparity of African American unemployment rates by providing job training, financial education, and support for entrepreneurship.

Built by William Grant & Sons at a cost of ‚Ç¨35 million, the distillery officially opened in September 2014. It is the first new distillery to have been constructed on a greenfield site in Ireland in over 100 years, and the first to operate in Tullamore since 1954. Construction of the distillery is proceeding on a phased basis. When first constructed, the distillery initially had the capacity to produce up to 1.8 million litres of pot still and malt whiskey per annum using four pot stills. However, provision has been made for the installation of a further two pot stills in the distillery, which would double this capacity to 3.6 million litres per annum. Following an additional ‚Ç¨25 million investment, a grain distillery and bottling plant were added in 2017. The installation of a grain distillery means that the distillery can now produce all three components (pot still, malt, and grain whiskey) of its Tullamore D.E.W. blended whiskey on-site.  Background  In 1829, the Old Tullamore Distillery was established in Tullamore. In the late 1800s, the General manager, and later owner of the distillery, Daniel E. Williams, launched a whiskey named Tullamore D.E.W., whose name was taken from his initials, D.E.W. Although the whiskey gained significant success, the distillery later closed in 1954 having suffered financial difficulties. However, the brand was kept alive. In 2010, William Grant & Sons purchased the brand, the second largest Irish whiskey brand globally, from its then owners, the C&C; Group. At the time, Tullamore D.E.W. was produced under contract by Irish Distillers at the Midleton Distillery in County Cork. As expansion of the brand was limited by their capacity to obtain spirit from Irish Distillers, William Grant & Sons opted to construct their own distillery in Tullamore, the brand's original home.

Degree of social support has been shown to influence the onset and course of certain psychiatric disorders such as clinical depression or schizophrenia. The SSQ was approved for public release in 1981 by Irwin Sarason, Henry Levine, Robert Basham and Barbara Sarason under the University of Washington Department of Psychology and consists of 27 questions. Overall, the SSQ has good test-retest reliability and convergent internal construct validity. Overview The questionnaire is designed so that each question has a two-part answer. The first part asks the interviewee to list up to nine people available to provide support that meet the criteria stated in the question. These support individuals are specified using their initials in addition to the relationship to the interviewee. Example questions from the first part includes questions such as ‚ÄúWhom could you count on to help if you had just been fired from your job or expelled from school?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhom do you feel would help if a family member very close to you died?‚Äù. The second part asks the interviewee to specify how satisfied they are with each of the people stated in the first part. The SSQ respondents use a 6 -point Likert scale to indicate their degree of satisfaction with the support from the above people ranging from ‚Äú1 - very dissatisfied‚Äù to ‚Äú6 - very satisfied‚Äù. The Social Support Questionnaire has multiple short forms such as the SSQ3 and the SSQ6. History of the SSQ The SSQ is based on 4 original studies. The first study set out to determine whether the SSQ had the desired psychometric properties. The second study tried to relate SSQ and a diversity of personality measures such as anxiety, depression and hostility in connection with the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. The third study considered the relationship between social support, the prior year‚Äôs negative and positive life events, internal-external locus of control and self- esteem in conjunction with the Life Experiences Survey. The fourth study tested the idea that social support could serve as a buffer when faced with difficult life situations via trying to solve a maze and subsequently completing the Cognitive Interference Questionnaire. Scoring The overall support score (SSQN) is calculated by taking an average of the individual scores across the 27 items. A high score on the SSQ indicates more optimism about life than a low score. Respondents with low SSQ scores have a higher prevalence of negative life events and illness. Scoring is as follows: 1\\\\. Add the total number of people for all 27 items (questions). (Max. is 243). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Number Score, or SSQN. 2\\\\. Add the total satisfaction scores for all 27 items (questions). (Max is 162). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Satisfaction score or SSQS. 3\\\\. Finally, you can average the above for the total number of people that are family members - this results in the SSQ family score. Reliability According to Sarason, the SSQ takes between fifteen to eighteen minutes to properly administer and has ‚Äúgood‚Äù test-retest reliability. Validity The SSQ was compared with the depression scale and validity tests show significant negative correlation ranging from -0.22 to -0.43. The SSQ and the optimism scale have a correlation of 0.57. The SSQ and the satisfaction score have a correlation of 0.34. The SSQ has high internal consistency among items. Linkages The SSQ has been used to show that higher levels of social support correlated with less suicide ideation in Military Medical University Soldiers in Iran in 2015. A low level of social support is an important risk factor in women for dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramps. Low Social Support is the strongest predictor of dysmenorrhea when compared to affect, personality and alexithymia. Related Surveys  SSQ3  The SSQ3 is a short form of the SSQ and has only three questions. The SSQ3 has acceptable test-test reliability and correlation with personality variables as compared to the long form of the Social Support Questionnaire. The internal reliability was borderline but this low level of internal reliability is as expected since there are only three questions.  SSQ6  The SSQ6 is a short form of the SSQ. The SSQ6 has been shown to have high correlation with: the SSQ, SSQ personality variables and internal reliability. In the development of the SSQ6, the research suggests that professed social support in adults may be a connected to ‚Äúearly attachment experience.‚Äù The SSQ6 consists of the below 6 questions: 1\\\\. Whom can you really count on to be dependable when you need help? 2\\\\. Whom can you really count on to help you feel more relaxed when you are under pressure or tense? 3\\\\. Who accepts you totally, including both your worst and your best points? 4\\\\. Whom can you really count on to care about you, regardless of what is happening to you? 5\\\\. Whom can you really count on to help you feel better when you are feeling generally down-in-the-dumps? 6\\\\. Whom can you count on to console you when you are very upset? Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List includes 40 items (questions) with four sub-scales in the areas of Tangible Support, Belonging Support, Self-Esteem Support and Appraisal Support. The interviewee rates each item based on how true or false they feel the item is for themselves. The four total response options are ‚ÄúDefinitely True‚Äù, ‚ÄúProbably True‚Äù, ‚ÄúProbably False‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDefinitely False‚Äù.

C. O. Benjamin (March 31, 1855 ‚Äì October 2, 1900) was a journalist, lawyer, and minister in the United States. He was an editor or contributor to numerous newspapers throughout the country, and may have been the first black editor of a white paper when he became editor of the Daily Sun In Los Angeles. He was also possibly the first black man admitted to the California bar, and may have been admitted to the bar in twelve states. In 1900 he was working as a prominent lawyer in Lexington Kentucky when he was beaten for helping register black voters by a white man who opposed his efforts. Later that day he was killed by the same man. Early life and education Robert Charles O'Hara Benjamin was born in St. Kitts on March 31, 1855. He attended compulsory schools until the age of eleven when he was sent to England for private tutoring, and then enrolled in Trinity College, Oxford University where he studied for three years. He left Oxford without receiving a degree and made a two year tour of the East Indies including Sumatra and Java. After returning to England, he sailed to New York City, arriving April 13, 1869. Ten days later he took a six month cruise to South America and the Caribbean as a cabin boy on the Lepanto captained by Cyrus E. Staples. The tour stopped in Venezuela, Cura√ßao, Demerara, and the West Indies. In the fall of 1869 he returned and settled in New York City.Simmons, William J.

In this position, he befriended J. J. Freeman, editor of the Progressive American, and Benjamin was made city editor of that paper. Around this time he was naturalized as a US citizen. In 1876, he campaigned for Republican presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, who would win. As a result of his political efforts, Benjamin was appointed letter carrier in the New York Post office. After nine months, he resigned and moved to Kentucky where he worked as a school teacher in various places and began studying law. Among his tutors were ex-Congressman Reed and Kentucky politician Dave Smith. He then moved to Decatur, Alabama where he became principal of a public school, and then to Brinkley, Arkansas and finally Memphis, Tennessee. In Memphis, he continued to study law, now under Josiah Patterson. With Patterson's help, he was admitted to the bar in January 1880.

The role of doorkeeper dates back to the 1300s, when the Palace of Westminster also served as a court and they served as prison guards. Over time their role changed to that of messengers from Parliament to the king. They wear a uniform of a black long-tailed coat, white bow tie, and a silver-gilt waist badge of office. Underneath each badge hangs a figure of Mercury, the messenger of the gods, symbolic of this early role. House of Commons In the House of Commons there are 37 doorkeepers who serve as part of the Department of Chamber and Committee Services (DCCS) in the section of the Serjeant-at-Arms. Currently, their principal role is the security of the House of Commons, and each doorkeeper is equipped with a book containing the names and photographs of all 650 MPs. Since the tradition that the reigning monarch is barred from entering the House of Commons also extends to police officers as sworn servants of the Crown, the doorkeepers are responsible for the physical security of the house, receiving the same training as the police in restraining and removing any members of the public. The doorkeepers also deliver messages, copies of Hansard, enquiries from Hansard editors, and the \\"green cards\\" ‚Äì notes from members of the public who have come to see their MP. When the House is not in session they have duties relating to visitors to Parliament. As well as maintaining the security of the chamber, galleries and committees of the House of Commons, the doorkeepers also have ceremonial duties. When the Commons is in session the Principal Doorkeeper and his deputy occupy two chairs on either side of the main entrance. The Principal Doorkeeper sits in the right-hand seat, which contains the original division bell, though an electronic system is now is use. When the house divides to vote members have eight minutes before the doorkeepers close and lock the doors to the chamber preventing anyone from entering. However at the end of each sitting the original bell is rung, and the two doorkeepers simultaneously shout \\"Who goes home?\\". The Principal Doorkeeper's seat also contains a box of snuff, which has been there for the use of members and officials ever since smoking was banned in the chamber in 1693. During the State Opening of Parliament when Black Rod summons the House of Commons to attend, the doors to the Commons chamber are ceremonially closed by the doorkeepers in his face. They then strike the door three times, and only then are they allowed to enter. House of Lords In the House of Lords there are 24 doorkeepers who serve in the Department of Black Rod. The Principal Doorkeeper and his doorkeepers work in teams, each managed by a senior doorkeeper. Their responsibilities include maintaining good order and security in and around the chamber, providing a reception facility at the Peers' Entrance, and managing members of the public wishing to view the proceedings. They also provide a message and letter board service for peers, and are trained in first aid. They also attend some committees of the house, and participate in ceremonial occasions, such as the State Opening of Parliament.

Banking as a service (BaaS) is an end-to-end process ensuring the overall execution of a financial service provided over the web. Such a digital banking service is available on-demand and operates within a set time- frame. Description As a value network, BaaS aims at seamlessly integrating as many service providers as needed into one comprehensive process to complete a financial service in an effective and timely manner. It is implied that a BaaS would include certain features in addition to providing a financial service. There must be means for managing, deploying and delivery of the services' environment. The services must of course be in legal compliance with the banking laws in the regions where it is made available, with (at least) one entity within the process possessing a banking license. Of utmost importance is the assurance that proper mechanisms are in place to provide security, such as strong authentication and additional measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access throughout the entire process. These security mechanisms must be in compliance with laws of data protection for the jurisdictions involved. With the proliferation and acceptance of BaaS, the emergence and rapid growth of FinTech can be expected. FinTech is ‚Äúa business that aims at providing financial services by making use of software and modern technology.‚Äù API-based stack This stack can be used with a licensed bank as foundation, a BaaS as middleware, and an ecosystems of FinTechs on top. Skinner suggested a 3-layer representation of the BaaS stack. In this stack, the underlying infrastructure-as-a-service is provided by a traditional, licensed and regulated bank. Above this bank would be the centralized Middleware layer that Skinner refers to as \\"bank as a service\\". Added on to the bank as a service is a group of decomposed banking services consisting of an ecosystem of FinTech startups and service providers. With this technology, based on the BaaS-platform, it is possible to create FinTech banks, which could improve banking processes and provide increased convenience for banking clients. In such a constellation, FinTech banks are enabled to compete directly with banks by offering core-banking services without having to build all the products that would be needed. The API-based bank as a service platform serves as the back-end that hosts standalone independent FinTech startups and integrates seamlessly with any existing back-office of traditional banks. This allows non-banks to easily and cost-effectively launch additional financial products and expand into additional markets. Cloud- based stack Dynamic development and growth in the world of FinTech have made the API-based Bank-as-a-Service stack obsolete in contexts where tech- companies, now own licenses to operate as regulated banks, thus eliminated the reliance on classic banks. Embracing the new developments in financial technology and services, the Banking-as-a-Service stack can be redefined in analogy to the Cloud stack. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) The infrastructure as a service (IaaS) layer provides basic infrastructure services through an IaaS provider. A majority of these services would be available on demand and do not necessarily need to be FinTech services (like Amazon Web Services or OVH). This layer would include the server and communication hardware (physical layer). Banking as a platform (BaaP) At the top of the IaaS model would be banking as a platform provider (BaaP). The BaaP would be a bank that is fully licensed or use an external regulated bank‚Äôs licensed banking services. The decomposed banking services (FinTech SaaS) are in essence, plugged into this layer. Data-security plays a crucial role in the BaaP. There is a need for monitoring functions that will enable seamless and secure operations across applications and domains through secure authentication. FinTech SaaS FinTech SaaS (software as a service) refers to all atomic or composite software-based financial services that are available on-demand. When these services are provided through a BaaP, they will need to be compliant with the BaaP‚Äôs API specifications. The services may either be physically deployed in the BaaP's domain or work externally. This gives the potential for the ability to plug financial services from other banks into the BaaP to create new composite application services. The result is that traditional banking services can now be virtualized and dispatched via composite application services. This does, however, present a challenge in verifying that none of the plugged-in services will violate regulations that have been imposed by banking authorities. HuaaS Humans as a service represents the top layer of the proposed revision of the BaaS stack. While at the onset this layer may not seem especially important, as FinTech services continue to grow as a segment in the financial service market, services performed by Cloudworkers will take on increased importance. This is a behind the scenes component that end-users will be unable to discern between a complete automated service and one that includes HuaaS. Potential consequence The consequence of having a decomposed stack is that there are multiple ways that the customer‚Äôs front-end could be presented. One way would allow the BaaP provider to appear directly as a bank to its customers. This necessitates the provision of a front-end user interface to the end-customers including user authentication and other features. The bank would appear as any other online bank where all banking services are presented and seamlessly integrated in a single user interface. Another option is that the bank will operate as a white label bank, which will then have a software as a service provider on top of the BaaP operating as the front-end to the end-customer. White label banking can be an answer to the challenge platform providers face in attaining customers. It can be used to offer banking services in environments where a large group of users already exist, including chains of grocery stores, hypermarkets or existing online portals. Integrated BaaS structure vs. single service offering A single service provider is at a greater risk of failure than a provider that offers a larger portfolio of services. Using an integrated BaaS structure efficiently provides an end-to- end value proposition that frees the service provider from having to develop all the needed peripheral services, including authentication and other security services. Those who adopt the BaaS structure are able to provide a higher level of trust than a smaller provider might do. Security Cyber- crime remains a constant and serious threat to the banking industry. The introduction of additional entrance gateways by offering increased amounts of composite online services does increase the risk for cyber-crime. It is important that each service to be properly firewalled to prevent malicious intrusions. As such, this presents a challenge to a satisfactory user experience if the user needs to constantly be authenticated while performing an online transaction across several domains or applications. Instead, the many domains and apps that are used need to be interwoven in such a way that once a user has been authenticated, this authentication will carry through as he conducts his transaction. This can be accomplished through the 3 degrees of freedom in digital banking, involving: * Identity federation across domains * Identify propagation across apps * Level of authentication Regulations Banking is a closely regulated industry throughout the world and online banks utilizing BaaS are no exception. Europe In Europe, BaaS for FinTechs is overseen by the Payment Services Directive (PSD, 2007/64/EC) and its 2nd amendment (PSD2) that was adopted in November 2015. Banking licenses are overseen by competent national authorities in accordance to Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013. The eIDAS Regulation provides requirements for authentication and electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions throughout the entire end-to-end process. Additional oversight for financial and insurance transactions are provided through Directive 2004/39/EC and Directive 2016/97/EU. USA In the United States, banks are highly regulated at both the state and federal levels. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for much of this regulation. Asia Asia has a strong disadvantage because of its high fragmentation of jurisdiction areas compared to Europe. FinTechs can plug into the national Banking-as-a-Service hub to provide their specific regulated and licensed face to their customers. Africa FinTechs in Africa have provided an original financing solution in a previously unserved and untapped banking market. Because it is primarily mobile-based, Africa FinTech is subject to national jurisdiction in regards to regulating financial markets and mobile telecommunications. Australia Australia‚Äôs government is behind in regulating FinTech in comparison to the European Payment Services Directive. Russia Russian banks are actively introducing BaaS, for example, the largest private bank Alfa Bank.

It holds the Guinness World Record for being the oldest continually operating law firm still in existence. Some of the documents retained by the firm have been used in the television series Downton Abbey to lend an air of authenticity to the show. History In 1570 a curate of the Tonbridge Parish Church by the name of Nicholas Hooper announced himself as a \\"scrivener and drafter of documents\\". He supplemented his ecclesiastical stipend by drafting wills and property bonds, and taking advantage of the expansion of merchant activity under the reign of Elizabeth I of England. Hooper's son John took over the practice in 1618, and the firm stayed in the family until John's descendant George Hooper died in 1759. After George Hooper's death the firm was acquired by Thomas Scoons of Tonbridge, who also controlled the Pantiles. He passed it to his son, William Scoons, who was joined by his own sons William Junior and John Scoons. In the 1850s the Scoons family died off, leaving the firm to a partner, Sydney Alleyne. The firm was known as Alleyne & Walker during the Victorian era. In 1890 it was taken over by John Thomas Freer, becoming Alleyne Morgan & Freer. In 1939 the firm was bought by another firm, Templar & Passmore. The firm acquired its current name in 1968. Frederick Alfred Snell, the son of the founder of one of the firms that merged to create the current firm, held the record for the oldest practising solicitor in England at his death at the age of 96 in 1954. Practice areas As of 2017, Thomson Snell & Passmore operates in the areas of wills, trusts, and estates, property law, and commercial law, as they have since 1570. In addition they offer a wide variety of modern services to both individuals and businesses. In recent years they have expanded their focus on commercial clients, with a 25.5% growth in income from commercial clients in the first half of 2016. During the same time period, the firm's private client practice grew by 7%. Growth continued in the latter part of 2016, despite concerns about the effect Brexit would have on the British economy.

It holds music for church services on Latin texts, set for two to eight parts, including a complete mass for eight voices.  History  Praetorius published 20 volumes of his collected music during his lifetime, one of them, Terpsichore containing secular French danses, the others devoted to sacred music on both German and Latin texts. The Protestant Reformers had not discarded the use of Latin liturgy in church services. Missodia Sionia is the eleventh volume, printed in Wolfenb√ºttel in 1611. The content is described on the cover: \\"Missodia Sionia / Continens / Cantiones sacras, ad Officium / quod vocant Summum, ante meridianum)\\" (Zionic chants for the mass / containing / sacred songs, for the service / called the Highest / before noon), specifying Kyrie, Gloria, Et in terra, and many others, for two to eight voices. The title page also mentions that use of Gregorian chant has been observed (Chorali cumprimis observata). George J. Buelow, a scholar of Baroque music, renders it: \\"In two to eight parts, polyphonic settings of the Mass Ordinary, Collects, Prefaces, various Amen and Gloria intonations, and songs for Compline\\". The parts of the mass are set for the different occasions of the liturgical year, and in various degree of difficulty, from two-part settings to eight parts. The first 15 pieces are set for four parts: 10 settings of Kyrie and 5 settings of Gloria. The second group of 21 pieces is scored for four to six parts: 14 settings of Kyrie and seven of Gloria. Another group (pieces 50 to 77) contains different settings of the chants around communion (Praefatio, Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei), and a complete mass for eight parts. Pieces 80 to 93 are 14 different settings of Amen in different modes and pieces 94 to 104 are ten settings of Gloria in different modes and an introit.

As part of the medieval city wall, it is connected to the Pulverturm (a tower, also preserved) via a reconstructed walkway. The outer gate remained in existence until the beginning of the nineteenth century, when it was demolished as a result of increasing traffic. Until the houses lining the south side of Johannisstrasse were demolished in 1968, the Johannistor remained the only western entrance to the old town of Jena.  History and description  The first written reference to the western gate tower dates to 1304. In the fifteenth century, it was reconstructed in the late Gothic style featuring the addition of a bay window. The tower features a square floor plan with dimensions of 7.72 m x 7.85 m; its total height is 31.70 m. The only access to the tower was from the ramparts of the city wall, over a narrow gate situated at a height of 7.75 m above ground. Inside, the upper storeys are accessed by means of ladders and stairs. Above the passageway of the gate is a stone vault, in the centre of which there is an opening for pouring. The other floors are finished with wooden beams and ceilings. The stone Turmpyramide, the pyramidal roof of the tower, has a height of 9.20 m and sits on the tower gallery, which is located at 22.50 m above ground. The tower has a total weight of 2,181 tonnes according to the building surveys. The tower spire, which was designed as a gabled flower, has always held a weather vane. The interior is illuminated mainly by narrow slit windows, and the top of the tower also features several openings to vent smoke. In the Middle Ages, the tower was used by the city guard, who were also tasked with providing fire protection for the nearby urban area. A bay window built upon stone consoles projects out from the tower facade; this is popularly called the \\"K√§sekorb\\" (cheese basket). A statue of a holy figure once adorned the tower; it was placed under a stone baldachin, the remains of which are still recognizable. A comprehensive renovation of the gate was performed in 1816, and the most recent renovation was completed in 2001.  Neighbourhood  Outside the gate was the Johannisvorstadt, one of four former suburbs of Jena. Further west, a trade route led to the nearby cities of Weimar and Erfurt along the route of #7 highway (still called Erfurter Stra√üe in Jena). After passing through or around the Johannisstor, one can reach St. Michael's Church via Johannisstra√üe. In the immediate vicinity of the Johannisstor is the Philistine fountain (built 2004) and the JenTower. Among students of the University of Jena, there remains a longstanding custom of avoiding the gate out of superstition, as it is claimed that if one passes through the gate one will not pass one's next exam.

His name also appears as Valentin Augustus Landry and Valentin-A. Landry. The son of Joseph-Auguste Landry and Olive Robichaud, he was born in Pokemouche, New Brunswick and was educated there and in Shediac and at Westmorland Grammar School, where he received a commercial studies diploma, and later continued his education at St. Joseph's College. He taught school in Weymouth and then earned his teacher's certificate from the normal school in Truro. Landry's great great grandfather Alexis Landry helped found Caraquet, New Brunswick. In 1870, Landry married Mary Lavinia Beckwith, also a teacher. The couple then taught school in Beaver River, Weymouth and Plympton. Landry ran for the Digby County seat in the provincial assembly in 1878 as a Liberal but withdrew to join the preparatory division of the normal school at Fredericton. From 1879 to 1886, he was a school inspector for, the first Acadian to hold such a post. In 1885, Landry helped found the newspaper Courrier des provinces Maritimes in Bathurst and served on its board of directors until 1887. In 1886, he moved to Digby, where he founded '; he moved the newspaper to Weymouth in 1889. In the same year, he established an English-language newspaper the Free Press with his wife. Landry moved L‚Äô√âvang√©line to New Brunswick in 1905. In 1910, to ensure the continued operation of the newspaper after attracting the opposition of the Catholic Church, he transferred its ownership to a separate company and relinquished the position of editor. The paper continued to operate until 1982. Letters written by √âmilie Leblanc under the name Marichette were published in Landry's newspaper until 1898 although, in April 1895, he expressed his opposition to providing a platform for women's views because he was opposed to women's suffrage. Landry also played an active role at several Conventions Nationale des Acadiens. His first wife died in 1910; he married her niece Mary U. Beckwith in 1913. Landry later died in Moncton at the age of 75.

The publication previewed upcoming storylines for popular television programs airing in Australia, featured interviews and a full weekly program guide. It was a long time rival to TV Week magazine until it was incorporated into that magazine in 1980.  History  \\"TV Times\\" evolved out of a magazine titled TV News, launched by the ABC in June 1958. It joined rival publications Television Preview, produced by the Television Owners Club of Australia and launched in 1957, and an Australian Consolidated Press magazine titled \\"TV Times\\". They were joined in July 1958 by a Sydney edition of TV Week, which had been publishing in Melbourne since December 1957 as TV-Radio Week. It was thought that four television titles in the market was unsustainable so ACP entered into a co-publishing deal with the ABC, which saw their respective magazines merged to become TV News-Times (soon simplified to TV Times). By the end of the year, Television Preview was incorporated into TV Week, leaving two rival publications in the market for the next two decades. TV Times notably gave far more space and cover stories to ABC programs than its rival. TV Times began a Melbourne edition in August 1959. Both TV Times and TV Week continued to expand publication as television launched in other capital cities and regional areas across Australia. By 1961, there were editions covering every capital city except Hobart, which received Melbourne editions plus a local supplement. TV Week introduced a viewer-voted awards from 1958 called the \\"Logie Awards\\" (after John Logie Baird), so TV Times created the rival Australian Film and Television Awards called the \\"Sammy Awards\\" from 1976. While TV Times was arguably regarded as more informative, TV Week began to lead by adding matte colour internal pages in 1962, while TV Times did little to stay ahead. In July 1968, when TV Week moved to a larger format, to match that of TV Times, it immediately looked superior to its rival with glossy colour pages and a cleaner layout. Even when TV Times became a full-colour publication, the quality was considered inferior to that of TV Week. In 1979, Southdown Press introduced a local version of the American \\"TV Guide\\". In 1980, the ABC elected to end its agreement with ACP, which purchased the ABC's interest in TV Times. ACP entered into a partnership with News Limited, with TV Times immediately being incorporated into TV Week and the Australian version of TV Guide also incorporated that year. The revamped publication continued to be known as TV Week but was now a joint venture between Australian Consolidated Press and Southdown Press (later Pacific Publications).

The algorithm is based on the quantum phase estimation algorithm and on Grover's search algorithm. Counting problems are common in diverse fields such as statistical estimation, statistical physics, networking, etc. As for quantum computing, the ability to perform quantum counting efficiently is needed in order to use Grover's search algorithm (because running Grover's search algorithm requires knowing how many solutions exist). Moreover, this algorithm solves the quantum existence problem (namely, deciding whether any solution exists) as a special case. The algorithm was devised by Gilles Brassard, Peter H√∏yer and Alain Tapp in 1998.  The problem  Consider a finite set \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n of size N=2^n and a set B of \\"solutions\\" (that is a subset of \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n ). Define: : \\\\begin{cases} f : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\right\\\\\\\\}^n \\\\to \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & x \\\\in B \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x otin B \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{cases} In other words, f is the indicator function of B. Calculate the number of solutions M = \\\\left\\\\vert f^{-1}(1) \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\vert B \\\\vert.  Classical solution  Without any prior knowledge on the set of solutions B (or the structure of the function f), a classical deterministic solution cannot perform better than \\\\Omega(N), because all the N elements of \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n must be inspected (consider a case where the last element to be inspected is a solution).  The algorithm  Quantum counting circuit Setup The input consists of two registers (namely, two parts): the upper p qubits comprise the first register, and the lower n qubits are the second register. Create superposition The initial state of the system is 0\\\\rangle^{\\\\otimes p}0\\\\rangle^{\\\\otimes n}. After applying multiple bit Hadamard gate operation on each of the registers separately, the state of the first register is :\\\\frac{1}{2^{p/2}}(0\\\\rangle + 1\\\\rangle)^{\\\\otimes p} and the state of the second register is :\\\\frac{1}{2^{n/2}}(0\\\\rangle + 1\\\\rangle)^{\\\\otimes n} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}}\\\\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}x\\\\rangle an equal superposition state in the computational basis. Grover operator Because the size of the space is \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n \\\\right\\\\vert = 2^n = N and the number of solutions is \\\\left\\\\vert B \\\\right\\\\vert = M , we can define the normalized states: : \\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N-M}} \\\\sum_{x otin B}{x\\\\rangle}, \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad \\\\beta\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{M}} \\\\sum_{x \\\\in B}{x\\\\rangle}. Note that : \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{N-M}{N}}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{M}{N}}\\\\beta\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}}\\\\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}{x\\\\rangle}, which is the state of the second register after the Hadamard transform. Geometric visualization of Grover's algorithm shows that in the two-dimensional space spanned by \\\\alpha\\\\rangle and \\\\beta\\\\rangle, the Grover operator is a counterclockwise rotation; hence, it can be expressed as : G = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos \\\\theta & -\\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\theta & \\\\cos \\\\theta\\\\end{bmatrix} in the orthonormal basis \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha\\\\rangle, \\\\beta\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}. From the properties of rotation matrices we know that G is a unitary matrix with the two eigenvalues e^{\\\\pm i \\\\theta}. Estimating the value of \\\\theta From here onwards, we follow the quantum phase estimation algorithm scheme: we apply controlled Grover operations followed by inverse quantum fourier transform; and according to the analysis, we will find the best p-bit approximation to the real number \\\\theta (belonging to the eigenvalues e^{\\\\pm i \\\\theta} of the Grover operator) with probability higher than \\\\frac{4}{\\\\pi^2}. Note that the second register is actually in a superposition of the eigenvectors of the Grover operator (while in the original quantum phase estimation algorithm, the second register is the required eigenvector). This means that with some probability, we approximate \\\\theta, and with some probability, we approximate 2\\\\pi - \\\\theta; those two approximations are equivalent.  Analysis  Assuming that the size N of the space is at least twice the number of solutions (namely, assuming that M \\\\leq \\\\tfrac{N}{2} ), a result of the analysis of Grover's algorithm is: : \\\\sin {\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{M}{N}}. Thus, if we find \\\\theta, we can also find the value of M (because N is known). The error : \\\\frac{\\\\vert \\\\Delta M \\\\vert}{N} = \\\\left \\\\vert \\\\sin^2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta + \\\\Delta \\\\theta}{2} \\\\right) - \\\\sin^2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} \\\\right) \\\\right \\\\vert is determined by the error within estimation of the value of \\\\theta. The quantum phase estimation algorithm finds, with high probability, the best p-bit approximation of \\\\theta; this means that if p is large enough, we will have \\\\Delta \\\\theta \\\\approx 0, hence \\\\vert \\\\Delta M \\\\vert \\\\approx 0 .  Uses  Grover's search algorithm for an initially-unknown number of solutions In Grover's search algorithm, the number of iterations that should be done is \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{N}{M}}. Thus, if N is known and M is calculated by the quantum counting algorithm, the number of iterations for Grover's algorithm is easily calculated. Speeding up NP-complete problems The quantum counting algorithm can be used to speed up solution to problems which are NP-complete. An example of an NP-complete problem is the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which is the problem of determining whether a graph G=(V,E) has a Hamiltonian cycle. A simple solution to the Hamiltonian cycle problem is checking, for each ordering of the vertices of G, whether it is a Hamiltonian cycle or not. Searching through all the possible orderings of the graph's vertices can be done with quantum counting followed by Grover's algorithm, achieving a speedup of the square root, similar to Grover's algorithm. This approach finds a Hamiltonian cycle (if exists); for determining whether a Hamiltonian cycle exists, the quantum counting algorithm itself is sufficient (and even the quantum existence algorithm, described below, is sufficient). Quantum existence problem Quantum existence problem is a special case of quantum counting where we do not want to calculate the value of M, but we only wish to know whether M eq 0 or not. A trivial solution to this problem is directly using the quantum counting algorithm: the algorithm yields M, so by checking whether M eq 0 we get the answer to the existence problem. This approach involves some overhead information because we are not interested in the value of M. Using a setup with small number of qubits in the upper register will not produce an accurate estimation of the value of \\\\theta, but will suffice to determine whether M equals zero or not.

She began her career in Shelbyville, Missouri in 1851. She then taught at Liberty Female College and Lancaster schools before relocating to Illinois during the civil war and teaching at the Springfield High School. Returning to Missouri, she taught at Ingleside College in Palmyra, Missouri and at Hardin College in Mexico, Missouri. After completing nearly thirty years of teaching, she founded the Baird College in 1885, where she remained until her retirement in 1897. Early life Priscilla A. Davis was born in 1828 in Shelby County, Kentucky to Harriet M. (n√©e Bell) and Samuel E. Davis. She studied with private tutors in her youth and attended Julia A. Tevis's Science Hill Female Academy in Shelbyville, Kentucky. At the age of fourteen, she was converted to the Baptist faith through her grandfather Francis Davis and an elder, George Waller. Waller also performed Davis' marriage ceremony on March 12, 1846, when she married Jesse K. Baird in Shelby County. Five years after their marriage, the couple moved to Missouri, along with their three children: M. Belle (born 1847), Thomas D. (born 1849) and Itonia J. (born 1851). Career Baird began teaching at a private school in Shelbyville, Missouri around 1851 and remained at the school for four years. The institution was a Baptist school and she taught under the direction of elders W. F. Broadus and John L. Waller. The family then moved to Liberty in Clay County, Missouri, where Baird taught at the Liberty Female College, which was affiliated with the William Jewell College. She and her brother, John T. Davis each served as associate president of the college for four years, before Baird moved to Lancaster, Schuyler County, Missouri. She taught from 1860 to 1863 in Lancaster, but as the Civil War moved west, the family moved to Springfield, Illinois. Baird taught at the Springfield High School for seven years, while her husband, a surveyor by trade, served in the Confederate States Army. Jesse's exposure to the conditions during the war of camp life and long marches, caused health problems. Though he survived the war, he died at the age of 49 in 1871. While in Springfield, Baird was recruited to become the president of Ingleside College in Palmyra, Missouri, where she began work in 1873. She hired an ex-slave, Sina Banks as her cook. Banks would remain with her for the next thirty years. The business manager of the college was Homer T. Baird, with whom Baird would marry on April 25, 1875. In addition to administering the school, Baird taught arithmetic and history, though the fees charged were inadequate to cover the costs of running the establishment, according to one of her former pupils, Robert Coontz, who would become a rear admiral in the United States Navy. She remained at Ingleside for six years and tendered her resignation when she was appointed president of Hardin College and Conservatory of Music. The couple moved to Mexico, Missouri to take up the post and continued with Homer as business manager and Baird serving as the school principal and teacher. During her tenure at Hardin, the school grew from a small number of enrollees to having several hundred students and both of her daughters taught at the school. In 1885, the family moved to Clinton, Missouri, where they began operating a school they had founded known as Baird College. Within 2 years of its opening, the school had around 100 boarding students and 300 attendees, being taught art, elocution, languages, and music. Though it was a Christian-based school, it operated as non-denominational. Baird ran the school until 1897, when she decided to close it due to poor health. In 1903, the Bairds moved to Denver, Colorado, where her daughter Itonia was teaching French at West High School. In addition to teaching and administrating schools, Baird was active in church work and organized many Sunday school and Bible classes. She served as Secretary of the Missouri Baptist State Women's Association for many years. She also was a staunch supporter of education for women and girls and presented a paper at the World's Congress of Representative Women in Chicago in 1893, which received wide support. Death and legacy Baird died on October 13, 1904 in Denver, Colorado. Her three children all became prominent professionals. Her son Thomas D. Baird became a physician and at one time was the president of the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners. Her two daughters, Belle True and Itonia J. Baird both became educators.

This method is known as ‚Äúthe Catalyst of Vitality‚Äù, a truly unique technique of artistic immortality which involves using a physical DNA sample( hair, nail powder, ash, etc.,) in the oil mixture during the application of the oil onto the canvas. This revolutionary painting technique is a method of preserving the identity of the individual on a genetic level for future generations to come. She is the first documented artist known for applying this technique.

Trump lived here until age 4, when the family moved to a larger house adjacent to the property. It is located on Wareham Place near Henley Road. The Tudor-style house, built in either the 1920s or in 1940 (sources differ) by Trump's father, Fred Trump, is located in the upper- middle-class neighborhood of Jamaica Estates. The house was put up for sale in July 2016, during the presidential campaign. It was scheduled to be sold at auction in October 2016, but the seller took it off the market. While it was initially listed at $1.65million, in December 2016, the house was purchased by Manhattan real estate investor Michael Davis for $1,390,500. Davis initially remained anonymous, and having never seen the house, arranged to have it sold at auction on January 17, 2017, three days before Trump's inauguration on January 20. According to the terms of the auction, the seller had five days to consider the bids. According to The New York Times, it was last auctioned for $2.14million to \\"a limited-liability company represented by a law firm that specializes in Chinese foreign investment\\" in March 2017.

Baker (1921 ‚Äì July 29, 1998) was an American civil servant and employee of the Department of Recreation and Parks in She was known by a number of nicknames, such as Queenie, Queen of Fun, Baltimore's First Lady of Fun, \\"queen of the hill\\", and \\"Baltimore's oldest kid\\". In 1984, the recreation center in Patterson Park was named the Virginia S. Baker Recreation Center to honor Baker's years of service to the center and to the children of Baltimore. Baker started her career as a volunteer playground monitor at the old Patterson Park recreation center and was hired to work for the Department of Recreation and Parks right after graduating from Eastern High School in 1939. She held a variety of job titles in her 53 years of civil service. She was best known for the many events and programs she initiated as director of the \\"Adventures in Fun\\" office, an office in City Hall created specifically for Baker by former Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer. In an address to the Senate, U.S. Senator from Maryland and Baltimore-native Barbara Mikulski made a special tribute to Baker following her death in 1998. Baker died at age 76 due to complications from pneumonia. Biography Born in 1921 in Baltimore City, Maryland, Virginia S. Baker was raised in East Baltimore and lived in Baltimore for her entire life. As a kid, Baker was often known by her nickname Queenie, or sometimes kids in the neighborhood referred to her as \\"queen of the hill\\". As an adult, Baker was given more nicknames, such as Queen of Fun, Baltimore's First Lady of Fun, and \\"Baltimore's oldest kid\\", which were often used by reporters when Baker was mentioned in newspaper articles. Baker's father, an immigrant from Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), changed his surname shortly after arriving in the U.S. He changed it to Baker from Pecinka, a derivative of ‚Äì Czech for \\"baker\\". Her mother, Hattie Baker, was a Baltimore-native of Czech descent. Until Virginia Baker's father died in 1954, her parents ran a confectionery store in East Baltimore on the corner of Monument Street and Belnord Avenue where Baker spent much of her childhood. She also spent a lot of time roller-skating around the streets of Baltimore and coming up with contests, races, and other games to play with kids in the neighborhood. Baker's voice has been described as \\"quintessentially Baltimore\\" and she was a frequently invited guest on radio shows by disc jockeys that wanted to parody the speech patterns and mannerisms that are common stereotypes of Baltimoreans. According to a Baltimore Sun article on her life, Baker, who never married or had children, \\"counted generations of Baltimore youngsters as her own special brood\\". She had a stroke in 1992 and another in 1995, which led to her retirement from the Department of Recreation and Parks. On July 29, 1998, Virginia Baker died at age 76 due to complications from pneumonia. Career During her youth, Virginia Baker volunteered as a playground monitor at the old Patterson Park recreation center. After graduating from Eastern High School in 1940, she was hired to work for the rec center and soon became director of recreation. She was known for the numerous new activities and games she was constantly creating, especially different kinds of contests, in her ongoing efforts to keep city's youth active and engaged. One of her ideas that was copied around the country, was the \\"Kid Swap Shop\\", an event where kids were invited to trade their unwanted toys. Another notable creation was something she called the \\"Fun Wagon\\", which consisted of a basketball hoop on the back of a small trailer that was filled with toys. Baker generated much publicity for all of her events and was known for her talent at public relations. Maryland Senator and East Baltimore-native Barbara Mikulski, who previously served on the Baltimore City Council, said Baker made herself well-known to the council members with her frequent fundraising and advocacy efforts. Baker took them into the city neighborhoods and to community events where she had them participate in the same games and activities she planned for the kids, a strategy that, according to Mikulski, strengthened the city's community programs by helping Baker avoid some of obstacles of government bureaucracy. Baker held various positions in during her 53 years of civil service in Baltimore City. She officially retired in 1995 after having a second stroke. Adventures in Fun Baker is best known for the events and activities she came up with as director of the \\"Adventures in Fun\\" office, a City Hall office created specifically for Baker by former Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer. In this position, Baker re-purposed War Memorial Plaza in downtown Baltimore as a recreation center that also doubled as a stage for Schaefer, a widely popular mayor at the time who was elected to four terms in office. Baker's staff were featured several times in newscasts wearing chef's hats as they attempted to fry eggs on the sidewalks of downtown Baltimore during summer heat waves. Baltimore's annual chicken- clucking contest was also one of Baker's creations that came out of the Office of Adventures in Fun. Baker came up with the idea after seeing someone at work imitate a chicken, and immediately started planning the contest, looking for a date, and securing sponsors, such as fast-food companies, for what turned into a successful annual event. Legacy The Virginia S. Baker Recreation Center in Patterson Park, May 2019. In 1984, the Patterson Park recreation center was named the Virginia S. Baker Recreation Center in recognition of her many years of service to the city's youth. Writer Rafael Alvarez said Baker \\"deliver[ed] entertainment and exercise to three generations of Baltimoreans\\" and is \\"perhaps the only civil servant in America in charge of an office called Adventures in Fun\\". When Baker died in 1998, U.S. Senator from Maryland and Baltimore-native Barbara Mikulski paid special tribute to her in an address to the Senate that was printed in the Congressional record.

The power plant is composed of two units; a waste-to-power incinerator and a biomass plant. The official address is √òlstedvej 20-36, 8200 Aarhus N and it is managed by AffaldVarme Aarhus as a part of the Teknik og Milj√∏ (Technology and Environment) magistrate of Aarhus Municipality. The biomass facility supplies district heating to 20% of homes in Aarhus Municipality and it is one of the largest of its kind in Denmark.  History  The original waste-to-power incinerator colloquially known as Lisbjerg Forbr√¶ndingen, officially AffaldsCenter, was constructed in 1976-78 as a combined heat and power plant. The facility has been expanded and changed a number of times most recently from 2004 to 2007 In 2014 construction of a biomass plant, Biomassefyret Kraftvarmev√¶rk, began as an addition to the existing facility. The biomass plant is a part of wider plan of Aarhus Municipality to transition to renewable energy sources. It will primarily burn hay sourced from the local area. The two facilities share the same buildings and some of the infrastructure but are managed as separate units due to the differences in source and waste materials.  Architecture  The architect firm Friis & Moltke designed the initial facility in 1978 and have since been involved in most major changes and renovations. The largest design change occurred in 2004 following a contest held in 1999 and won by Friis & Moltke. The old buildings were encased in a shell of concrete, steel and glass which gives it a changing appearance depending on weather conditions. The overall design is divided in a \\"base\\" and a \\"glass shell\\" section. The base is a rigidly defined transport surface somewhat lowered into the terrain and partially hidden. The glass shell is placed on the base and is a glass structure encasing the original concrete structure while providing space for newer functions. A fissure in the shell makes room for the 110 meter chimney. The chaotic interior of boilers, pipes and machines can be discerned through the glass facade. Next to the power plant itself is a two story administration building, also with a glass facade, but in sharp contrast to the 4-5 times taller power plant structure. Friis & Moltke also designed the addition of the biomass plant which started construction in 2014 with completion in late 2016. The biomass plant is constructed in a similar style to the existing structure and the infrastructure is integrated i.e. one shared chimney. The power plant is situated in hilly, undulating terrain and it is designed to fit the lines and colors of the surrounding landscape. It is prominently situated on a 70 meters tall hill and is visible from afar.  Lisbjerg Forbr√¶ndingen  Lisbjerg Forbr√¶ndingen, also known as AffaldsCenter Lisbjerg, is the original waste-to-power facility which also contains a recycling station, toxic waste center and a number of waste disposal systems apart from the power plant itself. Annually it processes 670.000 metric tons of waste of which 225.000 tons is used for energy production. It can process 23 tons of was per hour and produces 76 MV heat for district heating and 18.9 MV electricity. Annually it produces 470.000 MWh heat and 120.000 MWh electricity. The waste products are 40.000 tons of slag, 2700 tons of metal recyclables and 7000 tons of waste from flue gas treatment. The flue gas waste is exported while slag is used in place of gravel for road fill.  Biomassefyret Kraftvarmev√¶rk  Biomassefyret Kraftvarmev√¶rk (Biomass combined heat and power plant), is the biomass plant added in 2016. Construction began in 2014 and was completed in 2016. The biomass plant annually processes 230.000 metric tons of hay and has storage for 3168 haybales which cover 66 hours of production. The biomass plant is rated for 37 MV of electricity production and 77 MV of heating (110 MW primary energy). The plant is designed primarily for hay but can use up to 50% wood chips. Some 4% of the burned matter is converted to ash which is sold as fertilizer for agriculture.

She is an assistant professor for the Communication Studies department at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She teaches graduate and undergraduate classes on communication theory, gender communication, relational communication, family communication, qualitative research methods, and interpersonal communication theory. Olson and co-authors Elizabeth A. Baiocchi-Wagner, Jessica M. Wilson-Kratzer, and Sarah E. Symonds published a book entitled The Dark Side of Family Communication. Loreen Olson is also the current editor of the Journal of Family Communication.  Education  Loreen Olson received her Bachelor of Arts degree at St. Cloud State University. She then went on to receive her master's degree at the University of California, Davis, and later received her Ph.D. from the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln.  Career  Olson was previously an associate professor at the University of Missouri, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, a graduate teaching assistant at the University of Nebraska, and a project coordinator at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. Her main focus of research is on interpersonal communication and organizational communication. Her other scholarly interests include the dark side of family and close relationships, intimate partner violence, and the luring communication of child sex predators.  Scholarly work  One of Loreen Olson's most noteworthy research publications is the book, The Dark Side of Family Communication. This book combines research and theories that look into the dark side of family communication, which involves the verbal and nonverbal messages that are deemed harmful, morally suspect, and/or socially unacceptable. Olson points out every family experiences some type of darkness in various degrees, which she refers to as \\"shades of darkness\\". The dark side of communication includes dark topics such as family incest, sibling violence, and intimate partner violence. Other topics that are deemed as less dark are also looked into such as parent/child conflict and the impact of narcissism on family members communicative behaviors. The text uses examples that show how negative interactions between family members may co-exist with positive ones or they might function in ways that are both positive and negative. Olson also examines the darkness at a dynamic level including the role of religion, traditional family values, the media, and the morality of family life. Loreen Olson also published an important scholarly journal article titled, Conflict and control: Examining the association between exposure to television portraying interpersonal conflict and the use of controlling behaviors in romantic relationships. The journal article presented a study that investigated the link between exposure to television that is high in interpersonal conflict and viewers' use of control in their romantic relationships. The results showed a relationship between exposure to interpersonal conflict television and relational control. The results also showed that the main relationship was moderated by what the viewers' perceived as realism on television. Olson also published the book chapter, \\"Violence, Aggression, and Abuse\\", in the International encyclopedia of interpersonal communication. The text looked into interpersonal aggression which includes acts of violence, emotional/psychological abuse, verbal aggression, rape, battering, bullying, incest, neglect, stalking, coercion, entrapment, and harassment. Interpersonal aggression is considered to be different examples of the dark side of interpersonal communication. Many times the terms abuse, aggression, and violence are used interchangeably. Due to this, Olson examined the different ways in which scholars understand and form ideas about abuse, aggression, and violence.

It provided for a reduction of Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) in the Assembly from 108 to 90 for the first election following the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election. History The Northern Ireland Act 1998, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom following the Good Friday Agreement, established the Northern Ireland Assembly and declared that each Assembly constituency would elect six members. In 2014, during consideration of the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the House of Lords added an amendment to the bill to reduce the number of MLAs based upon Northern Irish popular opinion that the Northern Ireland Assembly was too large. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons supported the amendment that provided the Assembly the power to vote to reduce itself in size providing there was sufficient cross-community support. The Democratic Unionist Party supported this and circulated a white paper proposing a reduction in MLAs and fewer departments in the Northern Ireland Executive. The deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness supported the proposal after Sinn F√©in had initially opposed the reduction.  Passage  In 2015 the bill was introduced into the Northern Ireland Assembly by the Alliance Party's Stewart Dickson. It provided that the number of members elected in each of the 18 constituencies would be reduced from six to five. The bill was passed unanimously with no dissenting votes. Royal assent was granted by Queen Elizabeth II on 22 July 2016 with the intent was that the bill would come into force at the next election for the Northern Ireland Assembly. In 2017, McGuinness resigned as Deputy First Minister because of Arlene Foster's decision to reject Sinn F√©in's calls that she step down as First Minister, following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. Sinn F√©in refused to nominate a successor, which caused the Northern Ireland Executive to collapse due to requiring cross-community support. Because of the collapse of the Executive, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, was obliged to dissolve the Assembly under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and called a snap election to be held on 2 March 2017. As a result, the implementation of the act was brought forward. This meant the 2017 Assembly election would be the first held under the Assembly Members (Reduction of Numbers) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 with 90 MLAs being returned instead of 108.

Scheduled to coincide with the 2017 Women's March, it was held on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump. The march was one of the largest public protests in Oregon's history with crowd estimates as high as 100,000 participants. No arrests were made during the demonstration. Plans for the Portland march began with a small group of women in Eastern Oregon on November 11, 2016, following Trump's election. Thousands of people expressed interest in attending the event on its Facebook page just days after its creation. Organizers wanted to focus on women's rights but were criticized for not addressing issues of diversity. On December 27, Oregon's liaison to the national Women's March overtook the original event page. A new page was created, inviting participation by a group of women who had complained about the lack of diversity. Margaret Jacobsen became the march's lead organizer on January 6, 2017. Sponsors of the event included the Oregon chapter of the National Organization for Women (Oregon NOW) and the Greater Portland NOW chapter, PDX Trans Pride, and a regional affiliate of Planned Parenthood. The NAACP of Portland withdrew its support, citing the original organizers' failure to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color. Following the march, the Oregon Department of Justice launched an investigation into a dispute between organizers over funds raised. Demonstration Motivation Southwest Naito Parkway before the noon rally Many participants marched to support women's rights and to reinforce protests against Donald Trump, even though it was not officially billed as an \\"anti-Trump\\" event. Leading up to the march, The Portland Mercury event description read: \\"Portland will absolutely be one of the cities engaging in this series of nationwide marches to show support for women's rights in the face of a serial sex-offender and his white supremacist friends entering the White House.\\" Shasta Kearns Moore of the Portland Tribune called the demonstration, \\"a reaction to the election of Donald Trump, and nearly all of the forces at work to upset politics in the 2016 presidential race were also in play in organizing the Portland march: social media, race, gender, the urban-rural divide, generational concepts of feminism and, most of all, lots of people feeling like they weren't being heard.\\" Organizers released a statement about the purpose of the demonstration: > The Women's March on Washington, Portland is aligned with the mission of the > national march, which is a national movement to unify and empower everyone > who stands for women's rights, human rights, immigrant rights, civil > liberties, and social justice for all. This is a non-partisan, permitted and > peaceful event where we march in solidarity with our partners and children > for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families ‚Äî > recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the strength of our > country. Oregon and Greater Portland NOW and Planned Parenthood Columbia > Willamette are two of our several sponsors and allies.  Logistics  Marchers at Tom McCall Waterfront Park, south of the Morrison Bridge Prior to the event, the Women's March on Portland was expected to attract between 20,000 and 30,000 participants, potentially the largest demonstration in the city's history. More than 50,000 people had said they planned to attend on its Facebook page. Unlike some events held in conjunction with the national Women's March, Portland's protest was permitted, and the parade route was made public beforehand. Preceding the march, which was billed as a family-friendly event, there was a rally for children and families, starting at 11:00 am. Speakers followed, along with chants, songs, and safety instructions for demonstrators with children. The protest was free to attend, but organizers were trying to raise $10,000 to cover event costs. Also preceding the march was a pro-labor rally at the South Park Blocks, after which 150 attendees joined the Women's March. Participants assembled near the Morrison Bridge at Tom McCall Waterfront Park, then marched through a 44-block area of downtown Portland around noon before returning to the park. With an estimated length of between , their route followed Southwest Naito Parkway to Jefferson Street, then Fourth Avenue to Pine Street. Marchers finished at Waterfront Park's Battleship Oregon Memorial, most of them dispersing by 3:30 pm. Impact Demonstrators in front of Pioneer Place on Southwest Fourth Avenue Protestors on Fourth Avenue Marchers at the end of the route, along Waterfront Park The march became one of the largest public protests in Oregon history. Following the protest, organizers said 100,000 people attended. The Portland Police Bureau said the demonstration was \\"easily one of the largest marches ever in Portland\\", and reportedly estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated. News outlets published crowd estimates ranging from 70,000 to 100,000 demonstrators. The Portland Tribune said: > The rain-soaked event took on a festive atmosphere. So many people attended > that it was impossible for everyone to see or hear speakers on the stage > south of the Morrison Bridge. At 1:15 p.m., the official start time of the > march, thousands were still crammed motionless in Waterfront Park. Local media outlets reported that, unlike other protests leading up to the march, there was a positive relationship between demonstrators and police. The Portland Tribune contrasted the event with the previous evening's protests and said the Women's March had a \\"carnival atmosphere full of smiles\\". The Oregonian Kale Williams called the crowd \\"jubilant, almost to a person\\". The Portland Mercury Dirk VanderHart described the event as \\"massive, jubilant, and lit\\", and called the crowd \\"a crush of wet, jubilant, Trump-hating humanity\\". Police said the march was \\"100 percent peaceful\\", and made no arrests. Sergeant Pete Simpson said, \\"This march was, we think, one of the largest in Portland history... and absolutely zero incidents or problems were reported. The credit really goes to the organizers for working with the city, meeting with the police bureau to help plan the route and allow us to get the proper resources in place.\\" According to TriMet, the public transit agency served \\"a record number of people in a short amount of time\\". MAX Light Rail riders experienced delays because of increased usage, and shuttle buses carried riders between the Providence Park and Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations. TriMet's bus services were also impacted, with passengers experiencing delays and detours as large crowds were bypassed. Increased demand caused the agency's ticketing app to stop working briefly just after noon. MAX Light Rail services resumed in the downtown core around 3:45 pm. TriMet services were altered the day before the Women's March because of anti-Trump protests in downtown Portland, but the agency did not anticipate service suspensions on the day of the march. Traffic backed up on Interstate 5 northbound, and was blocked by police on Southwest Naito Parkway near Tom McCall Waterfront Park and the Morrison Bridge. Leadership Organizers Demonstrators holding signs Signage referencing Pussy Riot Protestors carrying a banner Four women in Eastern Oregon initiated plans for a Portland demonstration on November 11, 2016, following the election of Donald Trump. Among them was Dara Glass, who described the group as \\"dots of blue in a sea of red\\". One of the organizers created a Facebook page announcing the event, and within a few days, thousands of people expressed their interest in attending. While 600 volunteers were recruited to help, the original organizers became frustrated as various groups began advocating for issues affecting them most. Leaders wanted to focus on women's rights; one of the original organizers explained, \\"It didn't matter what color you were, who you identified with. It was about the bigger picture.\\" Despite their inclusion of a woman to speak about rights for trans women and adding an opportunity for Black Lives Matter supporters to stage a die-in to the program, the original organizers were criticized for not addressing issues of diversity. Online arguing resulted in moderators removing personal attacks and other comments. The conflict was not unique to Portland: Eugene resident Constance Van Flandern, serving as Oregon's \\"official liaison\\" to the national Women's March on Washington, was told similar disputes were taking place in cities throughout the United States. Moore attributed the disagreements to \\"how different generations view feminism\\". Similarly, Rachel Monahan of Willamette Week commented, \\"The conflict in Portland reflected strife that also occurred among national women's march planners. An older generation of feminists disagreed with younger activists about whether there could be unity on women's issues without reference to discrimination against racial, ethnic and sexual identities.\\" On December 27, Van Flandern \\"stage[d] a hostile takeover\\" of the event's Facebook page and created a new one titled \\"Women's March on Washington: Portland\\". Her first nine invitations were extended to women who had previously complained about the lack of diversity. After the organizers in Eastern Oregon asked for assistance, Van Flandern appointed new administrators to the original Facebook group, removed blocks on previously banned individuals, and changed the graphics to mirror the new event page. In response, thousands more people said they planned to attend the demonstration. Margaret Jacobsen, a 29-year-old activist and writer identifying as a nonbinary polyamorist, joined the campaign on January 5, 2017, and became the march's lead organizer the following day. Rebekah Brewis, executive legal director of PDX Trans Pride, Nora Colie, Erica Fuller, and Kat Lattimer also served as organizers. Seeking to make the march inclusive for people of any age, gender, or physical ability, the new organizers released a statement which read: \\"The Portland team has also made sure to have diverse representation, and is working hard to make sure the Portland march is an event of inclusion, and that the voices of women of color are heard and centered during the event.\\" The women, along with mayor Ted Wheeler, police chief Michael Marshman, and members of the Portland Business Alliance, attended a press conference on January 18 during which organizers emphasized the importance of \\"self-policing\\". Wheeler said violence and vandalism would not be tolerated, and Marshman expressed the Bureau's support of the right to protest. Politicians Calling the march \\"an incredible day for Portland\\", Wheeler commented: \\"This has been a very positive, family friendly event. A lot of people out here expressing their First Amendment rights and doing so in a peaceful way. There is a strong value in this community to be engaged, active and expressive, and I strongly support that. We support peaceful protest.\\" Earl Blumenauer, the U.S. Representative for , attended the march instead of Trump's inauguration. Senator Ron Wyden attended Trump's inauguration and the Women's March in Washington, D.C. Partnerships and participant groups Protestors marching on behalf of GABRIELA USA, the national chapter of the Filipino organization, GABRIELA Women's Party Major sponsors of the event included the Oregon chapter of the National Organization for Women (Oregon NOW) and the Greater Portland NOW chapter, PDX Trans Pride, and Planned Parenthood's Columbia Willamette affiliate. The Planned Parenthood chapter had previously elected not to participate when early march leaders failed to incorporate the organization's issues into the event's platform. Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility also claimed to be a co-sponsor. The NAACP of Portland withdrew its support of the protest, accusing the original organizers of failing to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color. The group's president, Jo Ann Hardesty, said she was told that those issues, along with anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter messaging and signage, were \\"too political\\". As a result of the affiliate's criticism, the small group of women from Eastern Oregon who served as the original organizers of the Portland event were replaced with new leaders to \\"[give] a larger platform to women of color\\". After the NAACP chapter was made aware of the leadership changes, Hardesty explained: \\"I felt it was important that we not miss this teachable moment about what role of race and religion and class were playing in pulling this march together.\\" Furthermore, she told Willamette Week: \\"Putting a black woman's face at the beginning of the march doesn't fundamentally change the reason we withdrew our support. It's always been the case that if somebody suffers a racist incident, you're just supposed to suck it up and then, for the sake of unity, let's all join hands and pretend it didn't happen. I'm just at a place where I don't think that's healthy or wise anymore.\\" The executive director of the Women's Foundation of Oregon also participated in the march. Funding dispute Following the march, organizers had a dispute over approximately $22,000 in funds raised via T-shirt sales and direct contributions. Jacobsen said PDX Trans Pride agreed to serve as a fiscal sponsor, and accused the organization of keeping donations intended to support the event as well as future Women's March activities. Brewis insisted \\"The allegations are absolutely unfounded\\". There was no written agreement between the two groups. In March 2017, the Oregon Department of Justice confirmed a complaint had been filed; however, the department did not launch a formal investigation until January 2018, and questions started being referred to its criminal division. Reporting on the dispute, The Oregonian also noted that some donations thought to be tax deductions were possibly not because PDX Trans Pride did not have 501(c)(3) status at the time donations were being accepted. The paper also noted that PDX Trans Pride's website had gone dormant. The funding dispute, along with other disagreements between activist groups, was a main reason no Women's March was held in Portland in 2018.

Not that the curse of Balaam could in itself have hurt them; but, in proportion to his reputation, it would have infused great energy into their enemies: and its reversal must have struck a great panic into them and into others.

Even after they had seduced Israel, through Balaam's devilish counsel, Midian seems to have been stricken by God with panic, and not to have struck a blow Numbers 31:49.Barnes, Albert. Notes on the Old Testament. London, Blackie & Son, 1884. Reprint, Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998. * \\"Answered him\\": There ought to be a stop here. The answer of Balaam was the blessing which he was constrained to give, instead of the curse which he was hired to pronounce (compare ). Grotius explains it, \\"how Balaam answered, that the only way to injure thee was by tempting thee to idolatry and whoredom\\" ().Robert Jamieson, Andrew Robert Fausset; David Brown. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's Commentary On the Whole Bible. 1871. * \\"From Shittim unto Gilgal\\": The words are separated by the Hebrew accent from what went before. This is a fresh consideration, referring to mercies under Joshua, and may be made plainer by inserting \\"remember\\" (which has, perhaps, dropped out of the text), as in the Revised Version. Shittim was the Israelites' last station before crossing the Jordan, and Gilgal the first in the land of Canaan; and so God bids them remember all that happened to them between those places - their sin in Shittim (\\"Baal-peor\\") and the mercy then shown them (Numbers 25), the miraculous passage of the Jordan, the renewal of the covenant at Gilgal (). Shittim; the acacia meadow (Abel-Shittim), hod. Ghor- es-Seisaban, was at the southeastern corner of the Ciccar, or Plain of Jordan, some seven miles from the Dead Sea. Gilgal (see note on ). * \\"That ye may know the righteousness (righteous acts) of the Lord\\": All these instances of God's interposition prove how faithful he is to his promises, how he cares for his elect, what are his gracious counsels towards them (see the same expression, Judges 5:11; 1 Samuel 12:7).Joseph S. Exell; Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones (Editors). The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. Verse 8 : He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; :: and what doth the Lord require of thee, : but to do justly, : and to love mercy, : and to walk humbly with thy God? * \\"He hath showed thee\\"; literally, \\"one has told thee\\", or, \\"it has been told thee\\", i.e. by Moses and in the Law (, etc.). Septuagint, Œë·º∞ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∑Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒ∑ œÉŒøŒπ,\\"Hath it not been told thee?\\" What doth the Lord require of thee? The prophets often enforce the truth that the principles of righteous conduct are required from men, and not mere formal worship. This might well be a comfort to the Israelites when they heard that they were doomed to be cast out of their country, and that the temple was to be destroyed, and that the ritual on which they laid such stress would for a time become impracticable. So the inculcation of moral virtues is often connected with the prediction of woe or captivity. (For the prophetic view of the paramount importance of righteousness, see ; , etc., ; ; , etc.; see on .) * \\"to do justly\\": or \\"judgment\\";\\"judicium\\", V. L. Munster; \\"jus\\", Junius & Tremellius, Piscator. to exercise public judgment and justice, as a king, among his subjects; to do private and personal justice between man and man; to hurt no man's person, property, and character; to give to everyone their due, and do as he would desire to be done by; which as it is agreeable to the law of God, so to the light of nature, and what is shown, required, and taught by it:John Gill. John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible. Exposition of the Old and New Testament. Published in 1746-1763. * \\"to love mercy\\": \\"being merciful, out of love\\", \\"not of necessity, for God loveth a cheerful giver\\" . These acts together contain the whole duty to man, corresponding with and formed upon the mercy and justice of God ; . All which is due, anyhow or in any way, is of judgment; all which is free toward man, although not free toward God, is of mercy. * \\"to walk humbly with thy God\\": passive and active obedience towards God. The three moral duties here are summed up by our Lord (), \\"judgment, mercy, and faith\\" (in , \\"the love of God\\"). Compare .

He served in the Alaska House of Representatives in 2017, representing the 40th District in Alaska's North Slope region. A member of the Democratic Party, he caucused with the Democrat-led majority in the House of Representatives that includes independents and Republicans. Political career Westlake first ran for the House in 2014, mounting an unsuccessful Democratic primary challenge to Barrow Representative Benjamin Nageak, who caucused with the Republican-led majority caucus at the time. He ran again in 2016 and defeated Nageak in a very close election that was contested in court. A lower court ruled that 50 votes cast in Shungnak, a rural community that went overwhelmingly for Westlake, had been improperly cast and should not have been counted. The Alaska Supreme Court reversed the ruling however, making Westlake the winner. Westlake was unopposed in the general election. In December 2017, after seven female capitol staffers aired complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior by Westlake, he apologized. However when his impregnation of a 16-year-old in 1988, when he was 28, was about to be publicized, he tendered his resignation, effective within ten days.

She was sired by Sir Maugray and out of the mare Crain's Merry Lady. Her grandsires were Wilson's Allen and Merry Boy. She was dark in color and had an odd appearance as a foal, which led her owners to name her Strange Gal. As she grew she proved to be a gray, and faded in color fairly quickly; by 1954 her haircoat was pure white in color. Trained by Percy Moss, she began competing in horse shows as a three-year-old, and winning multiple shows. In 1952 she competed in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration for the first time and placed 5th in her age division. The next year she placed second in the mares class and was sixth out of ten horses in the World Grand Championship. In December 1953 she was sold to W. V. Garnier of Bastrop, Louisiana, and renamed White Star. Moss moved to Bastrop from Arkansas so he could continue training her. Ridden by Moss, who was only 23 years old at the time, she won the World Grand Championship in the 1954 Celebration.

As part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, it helps to preserve a variety of natural life forms and contributes to a diversity of plant and animal gene pools. Over half of the ecosystems in the United States exist within designated wilderness. The wilderness contains many contrasting features. A short distance separates scorched hillsides, stark rockpiles and dry forest on one side and exceedingly rich vegetation on the crest of the Blue Ridge on the other. The area is part of the Glenwood Cluster. Location and access Bridge for Appalachian Trail, crossing the James River, Virginia, fall 2017 James River Face Wilderness is located in the Jefferson National Forest several miles from Natural Bridge Station, Virginia. It is bounded on the northeast by the James River, on the west by Forest Service Road 35, and on the south by the Blue Ridge Parkway. There are several well maintained trails giving access into the wilderness. Among these are: * Appalachian Trail, 9.9 miles, 2400 feet elevation change, trailheads on US 130 and FS 35 * Balcony Falls Trail, 4.1 miles, 1850 feet elevation change, trailhead on FS 3093 * Belfast Trail, 2.8 miles, 1700 foot elevation change, trailhead on FS 35 * Gunter Ridge Trail, 5.1 miles, 1560 foot elevation change, trailhead FS 54 * Piney Ridge Trail, 3.5 miles, 1720 foot elevation change, trailhead on FS 54 * Sulphur Springs Trail, 2.7 miles, 1050 foot elevation change, trailhead on FS 35 Natural history The forest cover includes chestnut oak and various types of yellow pine. Northern red oak and hickories are found near Highcock Knob. The wilderness has sheltered coves with white oak, basswood and tulip poplar. Old growth trees are found in the watershed of Matt‚Äôs Creek and along the James River where the Appalachian Trail goes into the drainage of Matt‚Äôs Creek. Allegheny WoodratThe Allegheny woodrat has been observed in the wilderness at the rock outcrops of the Devils Marbleyard. The population of the woodrat is in decline. Among the hypotheses being considered for the decline are the loss of food sources, loss of habitat and mortality from parasites introduced by raccoons. The lower elevations of the wilderness have a long history of mineral development and logging. The area contains the former Francis T. Anderson's Glenwood Estate, regarded as one of the finest principalities in western Virginia. Anderson operated the Glenwood Iron Furnace, an enterprise that required thousands of acres of timber to produce the charcoal used in the iron furnace. The area was stripped of its timber, and then operators returned to log second and third-growth timber. Topography James River from AT bridge looking north, fall 2017 The wilderness has a complex topography with a peak Highcock Knob towering at an elevation of 3100 feet over the James River at 650 feet, a rock outcrop Devils Marbleyard composed of quartzite boulders the size of a schoolbus, many creeks with rapid descents and waterfalls, and the tall ridges Piney Ridge on the east and Gunter Ridge on the west. Management This wilderness was designated by congress in 1975 and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service as a part of the Glenwood-Pedlar Ranger Districts of the George Washington & Jefferson National Forests. There are some regulations to maintain the integrity of the area. For example, motorized equipment, motor vehicles and mountain bikes are prohibited, group size is limited to ten people, and limits are placed on camping. The wilderness is being monitored for clean air, with special concern for visibility, water quality and vegetation. Sulfur compounds produce a haze reducing visibility, an acidification of streams and a leaching of nutrients from the soil, and ozone creates visible injury to plant leaves reducing plant growth. Pollutants are created by many sources over a large geographic region.

It is written by Steven Moffat and was broadcast on 20 May 2017 on BBC One. \\"Extremis\\" received extremely positive reviews from television critics, with many praising Peter Capaldi's performance and Steven Moffat's script, though some commented on the complexity of the script. The Vatican calls upon the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) to investigate the Veritas, a book whose readers typically kill themselves after reading it. When the Veritas is translated and leaked online, the Doctor must uncover the dark secret that the book holds. It is the first of three loosely connected episodes called \\"The Monks Trilogy\\". Synopsis The Twelfth Doctor remains blind following the events of Oxygen and wears his sonic sunglasses to provide a limited form of sight while hiding his condition from Bill. He receives an email entitled Extremis that he views through his glasses. The Doctor is met by the Pope and members of the Holy See to help deal with a recently-translated text called the Veritas, that causes readers to end their own lives. The Doctor takes Bill and Nardole to a secret library inside the Vatican. They find that a translation of the Veritas has been emailed to CERN. Bill and Nardole discover a portal leading to a hub of other portals, linked to CERN and the White House, among other places. Meanwhile, the Doctor temporarily regains his sight using Time Lord technology and tries to read Veritas, but is forced to flee into a second portal with the translation when the skeletal, corpse-like Monks appear. He is unable to read the Veritas before again losing his sight. A Monk, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition Bill and Nardole enter the portal to CERN, finding all the scientists are prepared to kill themselves. A scientist demonstrates that every time he asks them for a random number, they, along with the other scientists, all say the same one. The two flee back to the hub. Nardole realises the portals are actually computer projections, and when he steps out of the projections, he disappears. A distraught Bill follows a trail of blood through a portal, finding herself in the Oval Office of the White House, where the Doctor is waiting. The Doctor explains that Veritas describes a \\"demon\\" planning to invade Earth by creating detailed simulations of it to practice invasion. Simulacra within these \\"shadow worlds\\" can discover the false reality as they can only come up with pseudo-random numbers due to the nature of computers, leading them to \\"commit\\" suicide to escape the simulation. He reveals that he, Bill, Nardole and everybody else are simply simulacra within a simulation. A Monk appears, and Bill disintegrates the same way Nardole did. The Doctor, aware he is a simulation, tells the alien that the Earth will be ready as he has been recording everything through his sonic glasses and emails the recording, titled Extremis, to his real-world self. The real Doctor finishes Extremis, and turns to the Vault behind him, revealed in flashbacks to hold Missy whom he had spared from execution but vowed to keep locked away for one thousand years. Through the Vault doors, he asks Missy for her help to fight the upcoming invasion. Continuity Nardole's presence with the Doctor throughout series 10 is explained as a continuation from \\"The Husbands of River Song\\", with River Song having ordered Nardole to prevent the Doctor from taking extreme actions after her death (going in extremis). Nardole is shown reading from River Song's TARDIS-styled diary, first seen in the Tenth Doctor story \\"Silence in the Library\\"/\\"Forest of the Dead\\", River Song's 'final' adventure. Missy alludes to the Doctor's 'retirement' on Darillium with River (\\"The Husbands of River Song\\") and offers her condolences regarding River's death. Outside references Upon entering the Vatican's secret library, Bill utters \\"Harry Potter\\", for which the Doctor scolds her. He later refers disparagingly to the lengthiness of Moby-Dick, saying: \\"Honestly, shut up and get to the whale!\\" The lead scientist from CERN tells Bill and Nardole \\"We will all go together when we go,\\" which is an apocalyptic-themed song by Tom Lehrer and the final track on the LP An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer. Nardole compares the simulated worlds to the holodecks of Star Trek and the video game worlds of Grand Theft Auto and Super Mario.  Production  Filming for \\"Extremis\\", as well as the following episode \\"The Pyramid at the End of the World\\", took place from 23 November 2016 to 17 January 2017.  Cast notes  Joseph Long, who plays the Pope in this episode, previously appeared as Rocco Colasanto in the episode \\"Turn Left\\". Tim Bentinck had previously played numerous roles in various Doctor Who audio productions. Broadcast and reception The episode was watched by 4.16 million overnight. The episode received 5.53 million views overall, and it received an Appreciation Index score of 82.  Critical reception  \\"Extremis\\" received extremely positive reviews from television critics, with many praising Peter Capaldi's performance and Steven Moffat's script, while calling the episode's story \\"unique\\" and \\"ambitious\\", though some commented on the complicated script. The episode currently holds an approval score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus reading \\"'Extremis' expertly juggles several of Doctor Who's more thought-provoking themes, enlivened by a sharp- witted script and a fast-paced plot.\\" Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club awarded an A to \\"Extremis\\", praising that the creativity and experimental aspect of the writing showcases Steven Moffat at his best. He compared the story's quality to some of Moffat's previous stories, such as \\"Listen\\" and \\"Heaven Sent\\", stating that the episode was an experimental success and that \\"the result is unlike anything else you're likely to find on television, and certainly unlike anything else Doctor Who has done before.\\" Wilkins also went on to praise Capaldi's acting in the episode, and how the character of the Doctor relates to Bill when making the revelation of the episode. Zoe Delahunty-Light of GamesRadar awarded a perfect score of 5 stars to the episode, asserting that \\"Doctor Who doesn't get better than this\\". She complimented how the episode played with complicated themes in a sophisticated manner, commenting on how the idea of a simulated world has been done before, but how Doctor Who took it further. She also complimented Michelle Gomez's portrayal of Missy, and how the character \\"is a far more complicated regeneration of the Master than we realised\\". Scott Collura of IGN gave \\"Extremis\\" a rating of 8.6 out of 10, saying the timing of the episode within the series was perfect to elaborate on the secret of the vault, while also following a larger and more complex story. He also stated that the return of Michelle Gomez as Missy was long overdue and of a particular note to the episode. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times also awarded a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars to the episode. The scenes with Missy were praised by him as \\"a gift for Michelle Gomez, a scene stealer\\", and the dynamic between the Doctor and Missy was also highlighted for being played with. The Monks were credited for being \\"bloody hideous\\", and were also compared to Moffat's previous creations such as the Silence for their worldwide silent invasion. They rounded up by labeling the episode \\"confident, breath-taking television from Steven Moffat\\". In contrast to the positive reviews, Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror felt that the problem with the episode wasn't the episode itself, but having to stop and think about the episode afterwards. He criticised the number of unnecessary twists in the episode and stated that the \\"reset\\" of the simulation undermined the events of the episode, and labelled the reveal of the vault \\"underwhelming\\", stating that \\"Extremis\\" was \\"two different half episodes that are really just setup for later\\". Despite this, Jackson complimented the theme of the Doctor's blindness and how it played into the episode, and how the scenes at CERN changed effortlessly between the comical and the horrified realisation, with certain parts of the episode being \\"outright creepy\\".

Knowledge regimes are beneficial for the implementation of public policy because they introduce new sets of data, research, theories, recommendations, and many other influential ideas directed towards an end goal of economic competition.Campbell, J. L., Pedersen, O. K. (2007). Knowledge Regimes and Comparative Political Economy. Socio-Economic Review, 13(4):679-701. These regimes became increasingly important following WWII when many capitalist societies were facing long periods of high inflation and economic stagnation associated with high levels of unemployment.Campbell, J. L., Pedersen, O. K. (2013). The National Origins of Policy Ideas. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press 2014. Following this era, knowledge regimes were used in the study of comparative political economies, which examined both policymaking regimes as well as production regimes. The information and policies that arises from knowledge regimes differs depending on the political economy that a state operates in. In a liberal market economy (LME) with a decentralized, open market, the knowledge regimes tend to be more market-oriented, meaning there are less external constraints from the government. In open markets there is more competition between companies and actors, resulting in a more adversarial environment. In an LME with a more centralized and closed market, there is nonpartisan state-involvement, all the while in a hostile environment. In coordinated market economies (CME) with decentralized, open states, there are strong associational institutional arrangements, which results in more consensus-oriented knowledge regimes whereas in a CME with a centralized closed market, policy changes come from within the state. Depending on the political economy of a state, there are four corresponding knowledge-producing organizations. The first organization is composed of scholars who have specific knowledge on a topic; these members tend to be university students and/or professors. Another organization is made up of advocacy research units with individuals who have dedicated their time to one given topic. A third organization includes the individuals closely associated with a political party who conduct research that will provide expert advice and analysis for party members. The last knowledge-producing organization includes state research units who are situated within the government and are readily available for members within the government at any given time. History The fall of the Golden Age Capitalist countries began acknowledging the importance of knowledge regimes following the end of the Golden Age; this period was characterized by economic stagflation, eventually leading to inflation throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Economic bubbles and crises occur as a result of the processes that countries previously adapted, typically over the past 30 years, which are ingrained into the economy and hard to alter.Perez, C. (2013). Unleashing a Golden Age after the Financial Collapse: Drawing Lessons from History. Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions, 6, 9-23. The high rates of stagflation that occurred in the mid 1960s after the end of the Golden Age created the questions of what the adequate policies would be in order to pursue macroeconomic goals of long-term economic growth. This era contradicted the traditional Keynesian policy ideas, which led many advanced countries to turn to the use of theories, data, and ideologies as tools in the fight over different economic policies. This placed heavy emphasis on the creation and use of knowledge regimes.  Neoliberalism and globalization  The end of the Golden Age introduced the era of neoliberalism, characterized by a decrease in public spending, lower taxes, and less state intervention. Through neoliberalism and neoliberal ways of operation, many capitalist countries began globalizing at increased rates, which brought about new forms of economic organizations, such as global outsourcing and international commodity chains. Given this level of globalization, knowledge regimes were developed to create new policies and advise firms on appropriate production measures. Varieties of capitalism Varieties of capitalism is used to describe is used to describe the way a firm operates in two differentiating political capitalist economies,Hall, P.A. and Soskice, D. (2001). \\"An Introduction to Varieties of Capitalism,\\" in P.A. Hall and Soskice (Eds). Varieties of Capitalism. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. placing the emphasis on the state-firm relationship rather than the state-citizen relationship. The two political economies that nations will operate in are either liberal market economies (LMEs) or coordinated market economies (CMEs). There are five sectors that firms address when developing relationships with the state, including industrial relations, vocational training and education, corporate governance, inter-firm relations, and employees. Firms use the five sectors to design different policies that are best suited for their political economy. Liberal market economies Liberal market economies operate in capitalist nations that use a system of hierarchy and competitive markets to determine relationships between firms and the state. LMEs operate in highly commodified economies whereby there individuals are particularly dependent on the sale of their own labour as a reliable source of income. The commodification of labour is strongly affected by the price signals that are indicated by the markets, and these fluctuating price levels lead to either an increase or decrease in a firm's willingness to supply and a customer's willingness to consume.Hubbard, R. G., O'Brien, A. P., Serletis, A., and Childs, J. (2013). Macroeconomics. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. In liberal market economies, firms will use market mechanisms to solve any issues incurred, specifically through the exchange of money by buyers and sellers, who have a well-rounded understanding of the value of trade-offs so as to ensure the most efficient distribution of goods and services within an economy. In a liberal market economy, firms require vocational education and training that is either individually funded or provided through on-the-job training to provide firm-specific education. These firms tend to focus their decisions on publicly accessible data of performance, allowing for greater venture capital and easily switchable assets that result in higher returns for investors. Due to the hierarchical nature of management, there are very few unions created in the work environment as labour is highly commodified and it is easy for a firm to hire and fire employees. The relationships between firms and employees operate on a contract basis. As a result of the individually funded vocational training, there is greater incentive to pursue individual success through innovation, which is generally funded by the larger venture capital opportunities. LMEs can also operate alternatively, contingent on the type of market a state follows. If an economy has a more decentralized and open market, knowledge regimes will tend to be me more market-oriented with less external constraints from the government, as is the case with United States; if an economy is more centralized with a closed market, there is more state-led involvement and guidance, much like Great Britain. =United States of America= The United States of America is a country with a liberal market economy, accentuated by decentralized government with a relatively open market. Through the open market, firms and investors are able to import and export different goods and services with very little interference from the government, allowing for the price levels of those goods and services to be set solely by the supply and demand in the economy. The political economy in the United States is run primarily by two political parties, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Since the United States is a highly decentralized state, the two main parties operate using privately funded resources, resulting in a distinct separation of power at the legislative and executive branches of government. The United States demonstrates how a decentralized open market economy tends to have more market-oriented knowledge regimes.Beland, D., and Cox, R. H. (2010). Ideas and Politics in Social Science Research (Eds). Oxford, United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. Through privately funded channels, individuals have a higher incentive to create knowledge regimes in attempt to influence the public policy making process. =Great Britain= Great Britain represents a group of countries (Wales, Scotland, England) that operate in an LME with a centralized, closed market. These countries follow a unitary system of government, whereby there is a single power dictating the operations of the country as a whole. The market system in Great Britain operates with greater state involvement and control, and the price levels of goods and services are more commonly dictated by government-imposed market tools, such as tariffs, taxes, and subsidies. The central authority holds power in both the legislative branch and executive branch of government, allowing the central authority to impose new policies and decisions without opposition from other political parties. As a result, knowledge regimes are publicly funded and not as common as they are in LMEs with an open market. State research units are more prevalent throughout Great Britain and are embedded throughout the civil society, creating more politically tempered knowledge regimes. Coordinated market economies Coordinated market economies (CME) are characterized by very little state involvement with firms focused on building close relationships between individuals in managerial positions and employees. Through the strong relationships created within the firm, there is a highly decommodified environment with a strong sense of social entitlement and separation from market dependency and state participation. When firms incur a problem of any sort, they use strategic interactions to create a feasible solution. These strategic interactions incorporate employees at every level of the firm so as to ensure opinions and viewpoints from all sectors are being taken into account; this typically allows for a stronger built solution. In addition, firms use strategic interaction to determine at which point the equilibrium should be set between the firm and their consumers, which establishes the appropriate combination between how much of a product is supplied and subsequently purchased. In a coordinated market economy, there is publicly subsidized training to support high-skilled education for greater industry-specific labour needs; this is a result of the multilateral decisions that are made through strategic interactions. Additionally, there is greater confidence instilled in potential investors through the promotion of dense networks. Through the structure of the market, there are several unions and long-term worker contracts, which ensures job security and decreases the likelihood of hostile takeovers. Due to the interaction and cooperation throughout multiple firms, there is greater society-wide success through innovative tendencies, such as the green energy industry in Germany. CMEs operate differently depending on if a state has a closed market or an open market. In a CME with a decentralized and open market, such as Germany, there tends to be strong associational institutional arrangements, producing more consensus-oriented knowledge regimes; a CME with a centralized and closed market, such as France, many policy changes are encouraged and led by state involvement. =Germany= Germany is a country with a coordinated market economy, characterized by a decentralized government with an open market system. Firms in this economy operate through well- established networks, while developing and maintaining relationships to promote and coordinate economic activity. There is very little state- involvement throughout the market, with the emphasis and responsibility being placed on the firms and corporations to set and adjust prices accordingly. Germany follows a proportional representation electoral system, creating a stronger consensus-based environment whereby policies are formulated at the regional level of government rather than the federal level. Through regional- based policy formulation tactics, there is a higher rate of scholarly research units affiliated with several different universities, churches, and other knowledge-producing institutions. There is also a stronger incentive for political parties to create their own party research units to be used for future elections and policy-making tactics. The knowledge regimes created throughout Germany represent the institutional tendencies that firms rely on, such as the negotiation among different political parties, problem-solving mediation, and general consensus building. = France = France is a country with a coordinated market economy, distinguished by a central government and a closed market. In France, the central government is the main actor when making economic decisions and solving financial problems; the government holds sole ownership of several of the main infrastructure sectors throughout the country, weakening state-firm relationships. With a central government, the same political party holds control of both the legislative and executive branches, resulting in much of policy making taking place at the national level. As a result of the highly centralized state, many of the knowledge regimes throughout France emerge from state-led research units, as individuals are given very few incentives or means to create or pursue their own research units. Other knowledge regimes emerge from scholarly research units that are funded through the central government. Knowledge producing organizations Knowledge regimes are organized in different ways depending on the type of political economy they are operating in. There are 4 common knowledge producing organizations, which correspond to either liberal market economies or coordinated market economies. These knowledge producing organizations also differentiate if a country has either a centralized or decentralized government, or if there is an open or closed market.Almirall, E., and Casadesus-Masanell, R. (2010). Open versus Closed Innovation: A Model of Discovery and Divergence. The Academy of Management Review, 35(1), 27-47.  Academic-style scholarly research units  Academic research units are made up of academia from many institutions. The most commonly found participants in these units are students and professors, however many firms with a coordinated market economy send their employees to these research units. These units are often publicly funded through the government, although they may be privately funded as well, and tend to be both politically and ideologically impartial. Academic research units are most common in liberal market economies with a decentralized government and open market. Prior to WWII, many of these research units were privately funded through philanthropic organizations, but following WWII, many governments began providing funding for academic research units by contracting out for policy research.  Advocacy research units  Advocacy research units are created by individuals who are independently motivated through their own values and morals. These research units are privately funded through organizations that directly correlate to the topic or issue being addressed through the unit. These research units are both politically and ideologically partisan in nature, and are more focused on discrediting research that has already been done by using the media to persuade politicians to alter certain policies. Advocacy research units are most common in political economies with decentralized states and open markets, as politicians are less likely to conform to political party standards and will seek advice through external resources.  Party research units  Party research units are independently funded research units on behalf of a specific political party. These units are both politically and ideologically biased towards the values of a political party, composed of individuals who conduct research on behalf of the leaders. Political leaders will use the research from these units to pursue designated policy goals that will generate as much public approval and support as possible. These research units are most common in economies that operate through highly decentralized governments with several different political parties running for office during an election.  State research units  State-led research units are the only form of research unit that does not directly involve the participation of the civil society when conducting research. These units are closely affiliated with specific government departments and ministries that conduct research on a very specific matter that is then reported back to the central authority. These research units operate in economies with centralized and closed markets and are publicly funded through the central government.

The species is known from Eocene sediments exposed in the US state of Montana. It is tentatively placed into the living Acer section Cissifolia. History and classification Acer lincolnense is represented by a fossil specimens that were recovered from a late Eocene, possibly Chadronian aged, outcrop of the Beaver Creek flora in Central western Montana. Although it is located north of the Ruby Flora, which outcrops in southwest Montana, the similarities in overall floral composition between the Beaver Creek, Ruby, and other Montana floras are interpreted by Wolfe and Tanai to indicate that the assemblages are coeval in nature. The age of the Ruby flora is considered to range from approximately to approximately or as young as , meaning a probable similar age for the Beaver Creek assemblage. The fossils were first studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. They determined that fossils belonged to an undescribed Acer species and published their 1987 type description for A. lincolnense in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name lincolnense is in recognition of Lincoln County, Montana where the type locality for the species is. At the time of description the A. lincolnense holotype specimen, number UCMP 9311 A & B, along with paratype leaf and paratype fruit were part of the University of California Museum of Paleontology collections. In addition to A. lincolnense, the Beaver Creek assemblage had five additional Acer species in 1987; Acer castorrivularis, Acer florissanti, Acer milleri, Acer salmonense, and Acer tiffneyi. A. lincolnense has leaf and fruit morphologies that Wolfe and Tanai considered similar to both Acer section Negundo and Acer section Cissifolia. The modification of the leaves into three leaflets due to deep lobation that reaches the primary vein is seen in both sections. A. lincolnense differs from extant members of those sections in that the leaflets do not attach to the primary vein with a petiole but are sessile with the leaflet base abutting the primary vein. the species is more similar to extant A. sect. Cissifolia in the size of the areoles, the shape of the margin teeth, and the morphology of the leaflet bases. The fruits of A. lincolnense are also closer to A. sect. Cissifolia, being notably curved along the upper margin of the wing, but the undulating wing venation is not seen in either section, rather is most often seen in Acer section Indivisa. Wolfe and Tanai noted they were uncertain of the section placement for A. lincolnense, but had inferred an ancestor of both A. sect. Indivisa and A. sect. Cissifolia lived in North America during the Eocene and A. lincolnense was a possible candidate for that species. Description The leaves of A. lincolnense are divided into three leaflets, with the lateral leaflets pinnately veined and ranging between in length. The leaflet blades rest against the primary vein of the leaf, lacking petiolules, and have an asymmetric base flaring out on the basal side while remaining narrow on the apical side. Each lateral leaflet has between 5 and 7 secondary veins that alternate between forking near the vein tip before reaching the blade margin, and curving upwards near the tip to join the next secondary vein up. The forking secondary veins brace the sinuses between the teeth on the blade margins. Overall the teeth of the leaflets are large and simple, though the largest of the teeth have to smaller subsidiary teeth. The terminal leaflets on the type specimens are incomplete, so length and width of them is not known. They have a symmetrical leaflet base that is acute in shape, the blade being an inverted v shape. The leaves have tertiary veins that form either an mix of acute angle-right angle structuring or right angle-right angle structuring with the veins spaced apart. The quaternary veins form a network of areoles that are irregular polygons. As with other species of Acer the fruits are a samara with a basal nutlet and apical wing. The nutlets are lancolate in outline with a narrow rounded apex, and a convex basal side. The nutlet is long by wide, with a scar where the fruit attached to a second fruit at an angle of 30¬∞. There is a thick vein running along the apical side of the nutlet and 7 loosely grouped veins running up the outer edge of the wing. The wing is long and wide with the outer edge broadly curving, and with undulating veins that diverge from each other at angles between 5¬∞ to 10¬∞. The veins curve slightly between leaving the proximal vascular group and reaching the inner wing margin, forking along the way.

He formerly served as a city councilman in Wasilla. Wilson was elected to the Senate at the age of 35. He narrowly defeated Representative Lynn Gattis in the Republican primary to succeed longtime Senator Charlie Huggins, who was retiring, in August 2016. He was endorsed in his campaign by the conservative Republican Assembly but did not run with the backing of the Alaska Republican Party. He was previously an unaffiliated voter, registering with the Republican Party less than a year before his primary victory. Upon being sworn in on January 17, 2017, Wilson became the first African-American elected to the Senate from Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Wilson is the eighth African-American to serve in the Alaska Legislature. Of those eight, he is the third Republican, the second senator, the first Republican senator and the first to represent an area of Alaska outside of Anchorage or Fairbanks.  Slapping Incident  On May 2, 2017, Wilson allegedly slapped Nathaniel Herz of the Alaska Dispatch News during an encounter in the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau. The event was recorded by Herz's smartphone as the reporter was questioning Wilson on his reaction to a recent article about a bill proposed by Wilson. Herz filed a police report that day. On December 12, 2017, The Alaska Office of Special Prosecutions declined to pursue charges against Wasilla Republican Sen. David Wilson for a May incident in which he allegedly slapped Anchorage Daily News reporter Nathaniel Herz. In a letter Tuesday to Juneau police, Chief Assistant Attorney General Andrew Peterson wrote that it is unlikely the state will be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Wilson acted with the specific intent to harass or annoy Herz, the standard for determining harassment in the second degree.  Harassment and Retaliation charges  Wilson was cleared of sexual harassment claims by a female legislative aide who claimed he placed a cell phone near her legs. He was, however, found responsible for retaliatory actions against the person who made the complaint by talking about it. Senate President Pete Kelly ordered that Wilson be given a probationary period, during which he would be restricted in travel, demonstrate he knows proper decorum and understands retaliation. (2018) Personal life Wilson was born in California and raised in a Christian household. He attended Alaska Pacific University, earning a degree in psychology, where he met his wife, Aleta.

He has held various government positions including Secretary for Constitutional Affairs from 1991 to 1994 and Secretary for the Civil Service from 1994 to 1996. He was Executive Director of the Trade Development Council (DTC) from 1996 to 2004 and chairman of the Operations Review Committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) until 2014. Government career He was born in Mainland China. He moved to Hong Kong and was educated at the La Salle College and the University of Hong Kong. He joined the Hong Kong government and had served in various bureaux and departments, including Home Affairs Department, Chief Secretariat, Trade Department, Marine Department and Constitutional Affairs Department. During his tenure of District Officer of Kowloon, he proposed compensation to the shoppers who were affected by the construction of the Mass Transit Railway on Nathan Road. He was appointed Secretary for Constitutional Affairs in 1991. During his service, he was responsible for promoting the constitutional reform package of the last Governor Chris Patten. Despite Patten's constitutional reform package was strongly opposed by the Beijing government, Sze defended the package and therefore was criticised by the Beijing authorities. He was appointed Secretary for the Civil Service in 1994. At the time expatriate civil servants could renew their contracts automatically, which was deemed as unfair to the Chinese civil servants. He abolished the system and implemented the localisation of the civil service on the eve of the handover. From 1992 to 1996, he was a member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong. He announced his retirement from the civil service in 1996, right before the handover. Later career After retiring from the government, Sze served as Executive Director of the Trade Development Council (DTC) from 1996 to 2004, the statutory organisation responsible for promoting and developing Hong Kong's external trade. During the SARS epidemic, he strengthened the sanitary measures in the July exhibition. He also abolished the pegged salaries of the staffs in DTC with the civil servants. He had also been chairman of the Operations Review Committee of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). At the time many high officials were involved in corruption cases, including Chief Secretary for Administration Rafael Hui, Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Timothy Tong and Chief Executives Donald Tsang and Leung Chun-ying. Sze ensured the public the ICAC would investigate all cases. Responding to Leung Chun-ying's comment on ICAC not apologising to the members of Executive Council, Franklin Lam and Barry Cheung after it found no evidence in their allegations, Sze said that \\"even indiscriminate complaints are better than [the public] making no complaints.\\" He was criticised by another Leung's ally, Executive Council member Cheung Chi-kong, accusing Sze of \\"encouraging\\" indiscriminate complaints to the ICAC and expressed worries that the agency would be overloaded with cases. He served on the committee until he retired and was replaced by Maria Tam in 2014, which was seen as a controversial pick by Leung Chun-ying. Sze has also held directorships in various companies, including the Lee Kum Kee Company, Swire Pacific Limited, Yangtzekiang Carment Limited and YGM Trading Limited. Family He has a brother, Sze Cho-sing who is an owner of a seafood trading company. Sze has a daughter named Karen, who is a psychiatrist. Honours For his public services, Sze was awarded Imperial Service Order (ISO) and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1990 and 1995 respectively. In 1997, he was appointed a non-official Justice of the Peace. In 2004, he was awarded Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon by the Emperor of Japan for his effort in promoting Hong Kong-Japan trade development and Gold Bauhinia Star (GBS) by the Hong Kong government.

The initial models were built by C&C; Yachts of Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, in Canada. The newest model, the C&C; 30 One Design, was built by USWatercraft, LLC under the C&C; brand, in Newport, Rhode Island until their entry into receivership in July 2017. Design The C&C; 30 series are all small recreational and racing keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. There have been four boats to carry the C&C; 30 designation, each a completely different design. Operational history In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"The C&C; 30 probably did more than any other boat to establish the 30 foot size range in the minds of many Canadian sailors. Like the C&C; 27, it also has to be considered a classic among the production fiberglass boats built in the country. In fact, its appearance and layout is very similar to the C&C; 27, just more of everything, including some extra elbow room down below. This is a well built boat with good performance, and it did much to elevate C&C; to the status of one of North America's premier sailboat manufacturers during the 1970s and 1980s.\\" Variants ;C&C; 30-1 (Mark 1) :This model was designed by Cuthbertson & Cassian, introduced in 1973 and over 800 were built.

Although more 27s were built, in excess of 1,000, over a similar 12-year production period, with four distinct design phases, the 27 underwent comparatively continual change in relation to the 30, having only the one design version. According to Steve Kiemele, of South Shore Yachts, \\"The 30 didn't need any changes, it held its appeal.

She is remembered for her geography textbooks. Early years and education Morton was born in Westbrook, Maine, 15 July 1852, the only daughter of William and Hannah Eliza Morton. Her parents were teachers in their earlier years, and she followed in that field. She was educated in Westbrook Seminary and began to teach at the age of 16. Career While teaching, Morton was impressed with the fact that many of the old methods of instruction were not productive of the best results, and she began at once to write articles for educational journals, advocating reforms, at the same time putting into practice the principles she advanced and securing results in her work. She taught in various parts of Maine. Her first article for the press was a prose sketch entitled \\"The Study of Geography.\\" In 1879, she was asked to be in charge of geographical science in Battle Creek College, Michigan. The idea of preparing a series of geographies gradually assumed shape in her mind, while her name was constantly appearing in print in publications east and west. In 1880, she published a volume of verse entitled \\"Still Waters\\" (Portland, Maine), which was well received. Many of her best poetical productions were written afterwards. She was also known as a writer of hymns noted for their religious fervor. They were set to music by composers, and the evangelist, Dwight L. Moody, used many of them in his revival work. Among those published in sheet form, the most popular were \\"The Songs My Mother Sang\\" and \\"In the Cleft of the Rock.\\" After three years of earnest work in Battle Creek College, Morton withdrew and began to gather material for her geographies. Hundreds of books were examined, leading schools were visited and prominent educators in America and Europe were interviewed as to the best methods of teaching the science. In 1888, her \\"Elementary Geography\\" was completed. It was published in Philadelphia as \\"Potters' New Elementary Geography, by Eliza H. Morton.\\" It had a wide sale, and an immediate call was made for an advanced book, which was written under the pressure of poor health, but with care and research. The higher book was also successful. As a practical educational reformer, Morton won public esteem. Her home was in North Deering, Maine. From 1894 to 1911, she served as business manager, secretary and treasurer of the Maine Tract Society, the Maine branch of Review and Herald Publishing Association of Washington, D.C. Morton was interested in missionary and sunshine work, and in philanthropic work for children. She was a member of the National Geographic Society and International Sunshine Society. Her religious affiliation was as a Seventh-day Adventist.

It is on the west side of the main east‚Äìwest route through Chinle, Indian Service Route 7. The 2.92 acre site is approximately 2 miles west of Canyon de Chelly National Monument, and is the core of a larger 160 acre parcel which is in held in trust by the U.S. Federal Government for the Navajos. It was originally set aside for the Franciscan Friars in 1903, and is now leased by the Roman Catholic Church, through the Diocese of Gallup, New Mexico. It includes the Our Lady of Fatima Church. The entirety of the historic district is defined by three historic buildings, one historic object and one historic site. The buildings were constructed between 1905 and 1925 and are the Friary, the Annunciation Mission Church, and the Workshop/Garage; the object is the church bell, which was cast in 1914; and the site is the church's cemetery, which was active between 1907 and 1935. The district is made up of two discontiguous parcels. The first parcel is 2.2 acres and contains the Friary, Church, Garage and Bell, while the second parcel is .72 acres and contains the cemetery. History The National Park Service has determined that the historical period for this district lasted from 1905 through 1956. In 1898 the Franciscan order established a presence in Navajo territory with the establishment of a church and mission at St. Michaels, Arizona. The Chinle Mission was the first outreach mission, established from St. Michaels. After St. Michaels was established, it was decided that Chinle would be the location of the next mission. Father Leopold Ostermann was sent to select in a prospective building site in 1902. Upon his arrival, the only permanent structures in the area were two trading posts: Garcia's Trading Post, and Sam E. Day's trading post at the mouth of Canyon de Chelly. In April 1903, the Navajos agreed to a proposal by the Franciscan order to build a church and other buildings on land which had been set aside by the Federal government. The Franciscans arrived in Chinle in 1903 when Father Leopold Ostermann held his first service on September 23. Prior to that, on June 20, 1903, the Secretary of the Interior granted authority (Land Authority 88189) for the U.S. Indian Agent of the Navajo Agency, George Hayzlett, \\"to set aside 160 acres of land for the temporary use and occupancy of the Roman Catholic Church for missionary and educational purposes...\\" Ostermann and Brother Placidus Buerger took up residence in Chinle in a rented stone building. Ostermann was nickname ‚ÄôE√©‚Äôneishoodii Tsoh, the \\"Stout Priest,\\" by the local Navajos. Historical Period Map of the Historic District ‚Äì buildings considered historic are shaded gray The building site was selected on August 15, 1905, and ground was broken for the friary the following day. The construction of the friary was done primarily by Indians, supervised by Buerger and Ostermann. The friary was designed by Father Anselm Weber, Superior at St. Michaels Mission, and constructed in 1905, of adobe block on a sandstone block foundation. Buerger left in November due to failing health, from which he would die three months later on February 19, 1906. While not finished, Ostermann moved into the friary in January 1906. The friary was completed at some point in 1906. Also in 1906, on September 14, a well was dug reaching fifteen feet below ground, and a windmill was erected, which provided the friary's water through a tank and gravity-flow system. Called the \\"windmill well\\", it was seven feet in diameter, twenty feet deep, and it lay to the west of the friary. The well was filled in at some point during the 1940s. The first baptism on the premises occurred on September 12, 1907, which was performed by Father Leopold for Leo Arnold. And the first wedding was performed five years later, on April 27, 1912, when Father Leopold married Ethnobah Norcross and Albert G. Sandoval. Construction was begun on the Annunciation Mission Church in 1910, along with a stone post office and interpreter's house. The mission church was the second oldest Catholic church on the Navajo reservation, and was dedicated on March 25, 1912. Floor plan of the friary Weber took charge of ordering the materials for the building. While many materials were delivered to the site by horse and wagon from Gallup, New Mexico, the stone for the cellar and foundation were quarried locally. The cellar was partial, existing only below the kitchen and dining area. The cost of construction was approximately $1500. This rectangular adobe building first served a dual purpose as a chapel and Friars‚Äô residence. In 1910 or 1911, it became solely a Friars‚Äô Residence, which it continues to be today. The east side of the friary contained a large room consisting of the dining room and kitchen, along with a potbellied stove and chimney, as well as a smaller room which served as a parlor. The north side of the friary contained three bedrooms, as well as a room which contained the stairs to the attic. The south end of the building contained a single large room which was the chapel, which had a second potbellied stove and chimney. The chapel in the friary was only temporary, until a separate permanent structure could be built. With the construction of the Chinle post office in 1911, Leopold was selected as the Postmaster, taking over from Charley Day, who had served as postmaster at his father's trading post. A porch was added to the friary in 1912, which was added to over the years, finally be completed in 1940. In 1912 the cemetery was opened, with their first burial on July 7, when Mary Ayui, an infant, was interred. In 1914, the Reverend Joseph Wernke paid to have a bell cast for the mission. Known as the \\"St. Joseph Bell\\", it was cast at the Buckeye Bell Foundry in Cincinnati, Ohio. It took some time to arrive at the mission, but was installed by 1920 in the north corner of the chapel. Leopold became ill in February 1925, causing him to only visit the mission sporadically over the next several years. Finally, in 1928 he was ordered to remain at lower altitudes, preventing him from ever returning to Chinle, which sits at an altitude of approximately 4,500 feet. On April 10, 1930 Leopold died in Roswell, New Mexico. It was in 1925 when the final of the three structures deemed historically important was constructed. It has been known by various names, such as the \\"Tool Shop\\", \\"Carpenter's Shop\\", \\"Ice House\\" and \\"Morgue\\". This was due to the various uses it has served over the years, including as a workshop or tool shop/storage area, twice as a morgue in the 1940s and 1950s, and as a classroom space for religious education one year. In 1934 Concrete reinforcements were added to the foundation, as well as the center beam being braced, in order to stop some settling of the building which was occurring. Also in 1934, in May, interior plumbing was added and an interior bathroom was added. Two outbuildings were also upgraded or constructed in 1934. An old rabbit house was converted into a coal shed by pouring a concrete floor and reinforcing the walls, and an open garage was constructed behind the friary. In May 1935, an addition was added, acting as a dining room for the friary. Later in 1935, on November 11, the mission cemetery reached capacity. The Friars began to bury their dead in a cemetery which was near the nearby Visitors Center at Canyon de Chelly National Monument. The burials continued at the new site until the Chinle Community Cemetery was opened on March 30, 1946. Modern period A new cinder block church, situated northeast of the Friary, was built between August 1, 1959 and March 27, 1960. It was dedicated on March 27 in honor of Our Lady of F√°tima, at which point the name was officially changed from the Annunciation Mission to Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church. On the completion of the church, the St. Joseph Bell was moved and was set into a tower in the church and equipped with a stationary swinging bell-rocker system. Major changes were done to the interior of the Annunciation Mission in 1964, by the friar in charge, Ivo Zirkelbach. Altars were removed, as were the partitions which created the sacristy and sanctuary boundaries. Zirkelbach also tore down the open garage which sat behind the Friary. From 1967‚Äì69, renovations were undertaken: the original adobe brick chimney, which was crumbling, was removed; the front doorway was widened; and, in 1968, a dormer was added on the north side of the structure. Additional remodeling occurred from 1976‚Äì78 when additional bedrooms were created by enclosing the screened porch on the north side of the building, as well as remodeling of the existing bedrooms and bathroom. The rooms upstairs were also remodeled at this time, as well as the switching of the locations of the dining room and kitchen, which were also updated. A statue of St. Francis, was installed in a small alcove next to the front door in 1980, brought in from the church in Lukachukai. Also in 1980, a mudroom by the rear entrance was also added. A fireplace was added to the south wall of the Friary's living room on December 1, 1981, with a triple walled chimney pipe. In the late 1980s, it was decided to replace the cinderblock church constructed in 1960. The old church was torn down and a new Hogan-shaped church was constructed in 1989, with the first mass being celebrated at the Christmas Eve midnight mass on December 24, 1989. When the Annunciation Mission cemetery was refurbished in 1999, it was ringed by a new fence, and the cross from the old cinder block church was used as the central cross. Other structures Within the historic district, but not meeting the governmental criteria as historical buildings, are several other structures. These are Post Office/Interpreter's House, which while originally constructed during the historical period, in 1911, has since been modified with front and rear additions, hiding the original design of the house. If the additions are ever removed, the building might be able to be returned to its historic state, at which time it might be included as a historic building within the district. which obstruct a visual appreciation of the original house. Two other major buildings, but constructed after the historical period were the Our Lady of Fatima Church and the Bell Tower. Other buildings include a Hogan which was brought in from Manuelito, New Mexico, as well as a church hall which lie southwest of the Friary. Southeast of the church hall is a thrift shop which has been established by remodeling an old chicken coop. The administration offices of the church are housed in a mobile modular building, as well as several other modular buildings south of the thrift shop.

The vibrant paintings reflect her development as an Abstract Expressionist, influenced by Arthur Wesley Dow. Background While working at West Texas State Normal College between 1916 and 1918, O'Keeffe lived in Canyon, Texas and often visited Palo Duro Canyon, which became a source of inspiration for her paintings that helped her develop as an abstract artist. She made 51 watercolors while living in Canyon. Carolyn Kastner, curator of \\"Georgia O'Keeffe‚Äôs Far Wide Texas\\", states that \\"she was at the peak of her commitment to abstraction\\" at that time. Georgia O'Keeffe and friends at the Palo Duro Club, at the head of Palo Duro Canyon, perhaps between 1912 and 1913, when she first went to Texas, or between 1916 and 1918. Now a state park, it is the second largest canyon in the United States and is called the \\"Grand Canyon of Texas\\". The canyon is deep, up to wide, and long. Within the canyon are rock formations, giant boulders, and hoodoos. There are also multicolored layers of white gypsum, bright red claystone, and lavender, gray, yellow ochre mudstone. She had said that this time in Texas was highly creative, one where she felt the freedom to explore her feelings and different forms. O'Keeffe traveled to Palo Duro Canyon, from Canyon, with friends, on farmer's hay wagons, or by walking the distance. Overview Inspired by the principles of Arthur Wesley Dow and the Texas landscape, O'Keeffe made paintings using vibrant red, blue and yellow colors. About 1916, she used brilliant red and yellow colors in Special #21: Palo Duro Canyon, which belongs to the New Mexico Museum of Art. It was stolen in December 2003 and has not been recovered.

After a brief career in the Belgian Army, Costermans enlisted for service in the military of the Congo Free State, the Force Publique, in 1890 and later served in the colony's administration. During several periods of service in the colony, Costermans rose through the ranks. Between 1904 and his death in 1905, he held the position of Vice Governor-General of the Congo. Career A native of Brussels, Costermans attended the Royal Military Academy and was commissioned a sub-lieutenant of artillery in the Belgian Army on 13 December 1880. He joined the armed forces of the Congo, the Force Publique, as a lieutenant on 3 October 1890, and embarked for the Congo the same day at Vlissingen. He arrived in Boma on 2 November... After a short stint at Zobe, Costermans was appointed district commissioner of Stanley Pool (L√©opoldville), where he arrived on 26 May 1891. On 26 September, King Leopold II promoted him district commissioner 2nd class. He undertook major construction projects for the burgeoning colonial town. On 24 February 1892, having fallen ill, he handed over his command and left L√©opoldville for Boma, where he arrived on 10 March. He embarked for Europe on 16 April and arrived a month later on 16 May. On 6 December 1892, just over six months after having arrived in Europe, Costermans left again for Africa. He was re-appointed district commissioner of Stanley Pool. His was a nervous personality. His habit of pacing his veranda at night led the locals to nickname him gondoko (leopard). In April 1894 he fell ill again and was ordered to return to Europe. He left on 20 May and arrived on 24 June. Costermans' second convalescence in Europe lasted a little over a year. He was back in the Congo on 6 September 1895, again as district commissioner of Stanley Pool. On 1 June 1897 he was promoted to the rank of district commissioner general. He explored the territory of the Banfumu people along the Kasai river, which had been relatively neglected owing to the tribe's reported cannibalism. When his term had ended he returned to Belgium on 25 August 1898. On 1 March 1899, Costermans departed for L√©opoldville for the third time, this time as inspector-general of the Congo Free State. On 16 March 1901, he returned to Europe. Later that year he was given a special commission to explore lake Kivu. He departed from Antwerp for Naples, leaving Naples for Africa on 7 January 1902. This time he steamed down the eastern coast, arriving at Chinde in Portuguese East Africa. He took the Zambezi into the interior before heading towards the Ruzizi river and lake Kivu. Costermans returned to Europe in September 1903, but re-embarked for the Congo on 5 January 1904 with the title of Vice Governor-General to take over the reins from F√©lix Fuchs. His government coincided with the release of the Casement Report, a damning account of atrocities carried out in the Congo Free State. On 9 March 1905, in Banana, Costermans evaded his own security detail and shot himself dead. This is generally thought to have been in response to renewed enquiries into Congo atrocities.Alain de Gueldre et al., Kroniek van Belgi√´ (Antwerp and Zaventem, 1987), p. 768. His body was repatriated to Belgium. Costermans was an honorary captain commanding the artillery of the Fortress of Antwerp, a knight of the Order of Leopold, an officer of the Royal Order of the Lion and a knight of the Order of the African Star and of the French L√©gion d'honneur. He also wore the Service Star with four bars and the Military Cross 2nd class. In 1927, the village of Bukavu on the shore of lake Kivu was renamed Costermansville (Costermansstad in Dutch).

Through the years, as the country itself established a social safety net and more benefits, the society took on a cultural role, preserving Gaelic traditions such as c√®ilidhs.

He was nicknamed Axlar-Bj√∂rn, which translates as \\"Shoulder-Bear\\" in Icelandic. Early life Axlar-Bj√∂rn was the youngest of three children born to an Icelandic farmer couple. He lived at √ñxl west of B√∫√∞ir in Sn√¶fellsnes. Murders Abandoned farms in Sn√¶fellsnes. When he was 15-years old, Axlar- Bj√∂rn began to help in the farm of a rich neighbor named Ormur in exchange for room and board. Ormur died some years later from natural causes and left his estates to his son, Gu√∞mundur. Gu√∞mundur had become friends with Axlar-Bj√∂rn during his employment, and gifted him a farm called √ñxl in the Stadarsveit region of Sn√¶fellsnes. Axlar-Bj√∂rn took residence there with his wife, √û√≥rd√≠s √ìlafsd√≥ttir. Many legends have been written about Bj√∂rn and his malice, however these were recorded 250-300 years after the time of the execution. His story is interwoven with legends and full of folkloric motifs. The accounts differ on the motives, modus, number of victims, and events that led to the arrest of Axlar-Bj√∂rn. Two numbers of victims, nine and eighteen, are the most common claims. The victims were travellers and farmhands that came to √ñxl looking for work; some versions say that he hacked them with the axe and others that he drowned them. Local suspicions about Axlar-Bj√∂rn grew as people disappeared in the area while his horses and other possessions increased, but he was safe because of the protection given to him by Gu√∞mundur. Arrest and execution A contemporary depiction of a breaking wheel Axlar-Bj√∂rn was arrested and confessed to nine murders, but authorities found more bodies when they searched his farm. Asked about them, Axlar-Bj√∂rn claimed that he had found the remains buried in his land and decided to rebury them in another place without notifying authorities or bringing them to a cemetery. The authorities did not believe this explanation. A √æing sentenced Axlar-Bj√∂rn to die by hanging followed by breaking on the wheel. After his death, his body was dismembered and each piece put on a stake. √û√≥rd√≠s, who was pregnant at the time, was forced to watch the execution. Family aftermath √û√≥rd√≠s was accused of assisting her husband in the murders and even of committing some of the murders herself. She was also sentenced to death, but the execution was not carried out. The son she was carrying, Sveinn \\"Skotti\\" Bj√∂rnsson, grew up to be a vagrant and a criminal, and was hanged for rape in 1648. After Sveinn's own son, G√≠sli \\"Hrokur\\" Sveinsson, also became a criminal and was executed. Modern references √ölfar √ûorm√≥√∞sson wrote about him in a historical novel, √ûrj√°r s√≥lir svartar (Reykjav√≠k: H√∂fundur. 1988). Magn√∫s √û√≥r J√≥nsson included him in his book Bj√∂rn og Sveinn: e√∞a Makleg m√°lagj√∂ld (Reykjav√≠k: M√°l og menning. 1994). And in 2012, the Icelandic theatre group Vesturport set up the play Axlar-Bj√∂rn which is based on the legends about Bj√∂rn and his wife.

The Garrick Theatre opened on 22 December 1890. Tivoli Theatre In February 1893 Harry Rickards, the vaudeville showman, took over the lease of the Garrick Theatre renaming it the Tivoli Theatre. He made some changes to the building, raising the orchestra pit and installing another sliding roof and opened on 18 February 1893. The building was destroyed by fire in 1899. It was rebuilt after the fire with a new building behind the remaining facade of the former theatre and reopened on 12 April 1900. The new building was larger and could seat 1,200 people. A collection of the Tivoli Theatre programs from 1893 to 1912 is held in the collections of the State Library of New South Wales.

Located west of Bowling Green, the area protects a mixture of wetlands and upland forests at the confluence of the Mattaponi and South rivers. History Prior to state ownership, the land that was to become Mattaponi WMA was used for timber production and rock quarrying. After being identified as an opportunity to conserve diverse wildlife habitat in an area undergoing suburbanization, the WMA was acquired by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) in 2010. The total purchase price of $7.6 million was shared between VDGIF and several partners, including The Nature Conservancy, The Trust for Public Land, and Ducks Unlimited. A significant portion of funding ‚Äì $1.4 million ‚Äì was provided by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of a program to protect lands in the vicinity of Fort A.P. Hill. Mattaponi WMA was officially opened to the public on March 30, 2011. Description Mattaponi WMA covers in Virginia's upper coastal plain, west of Bowling Green in Caroline County. It borders of the upper Mattaponi River and of the South River; the confluence of the two streams is located at the southern end of the WMA. Its boundaries contain both upland forests, various types of wetlands, and open water habitats, including two rare oxbow lakes found within bottomlands where the Mattaponi once flowed. Management at Mattaponi WMA focuses on enhancing wildlife habitat, using techniques such as selective timber harvest, prescribed burns, and controlling water levels within wetlands and ponds. Approximately is used by Fort A.P. Hill as a wetland mitigation bank. Wildlife found on the property include a number of game animals, such as deer, bear, turkey, and squirrels; waterfowl are also abundant within the area's wetlands. Other game bird species, such as bobwhite quail and woodcock, are also found at the property and benefit from management that periodically clears portions of the landscape of mature vegetation. Fish found within the river include bluegill, redbreast sunfish, and largemouth bass; ponds on the property contain crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, chain pickerel, and a limited number of bowfin. A survey conducted by the Virginia Herpetological Society indicated a healthy diversity of amphibians, turtles, lizards, and snakes, including the carpenter frog, a species more typically found in extreme southeastern Virginia, with only occasional occurrences in Caroline County. Public use and access Mattaponi WMA is open to the public for hunting, trapping, fishing, hiking, and primitive camping. Access for persons 17 years of age or older requires a valid hunting or fishing permit, or a WMA access permit.

On 9 February 1794, Merlin took a staff position with the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees and fought in the War of the Pyrenees against the Kingdom of Spain. During the conflict he was wounded in the left leg by a bursting howitzer shell. He was assigned to the 4th Hussar Regiment as adjutant general chef de brigade on 13 June 1795. He served with the regiment in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. During the Rhine Campaign of 1795 on 1 October, the 4th Hussars were part of Paul Grenier's division. Merlin was wounded in the right arm by a saber stroke at Steinbach on 15 October 1795 in a minor French victory during the retreat. Uniform of 4th Hussars During the Rhine Campaign of 1796, the 4th Hussars were in Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre's division of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse. On 31 May the campaign started when the divisions of Lefebvre and Claude-Sylvestre Colaud advanced from D√ºsseldorf. The cavalry screen included Merlin who the source incorrectly identified as a sous-lieutenant. In fact, Merlin was appointed commander of the 4th Hussars on 25 June. The army's last action of the campaign was the Battle of Limburg on 16 September 1796. In 1797, the army's hussars were formed into a division under Michel Ney. The Hussar Division distinguished itself at the Battle of Neuwied on 18 April 1797. In the War of the Second Coalition, the 4th Hussars fought with Lefebvre's division of Jourdan's Army of the Rhine in the Battle of Ostrach on 21 March 1799 and the First Battle of Stockach four days later. The regiment participated in the Second Battle of Zurich on 25‚Äì26 September 1799 in √âdouard Mortier's 8th Division of Andr√© Mass√©na's Army of the Danube. At the start of the 1800 campaign the 4th Hussars were assigned to Antoine Guillaume Delmas' division of Jean Victor Marie Moreau's Army of the Rhine. Delmas' division fought at the Second Battle of Stockach on 3 May 1800. At the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800, the regiment was part of Emmanuel de Grouchy's division. Together with the 108th Line Infantry Regiment, the 4th Hussars opposed the Austrian advance guard as it tried to emerge from the forest. After initial Austrian success, Grouchy's troops pushed their enemies back to the edge of the forest. The 4th Hussars tried twice to overrun an Austrian battery and were successful on their third charge. Merlin sent a hussar squadron against some nearby infantry and sent them fleeing. From 1801‚Äì1803 he served in the garrison at Cambrai. He participated in the successful French 1803 invasion of the Electorate of Hanover which ended in the Convention of Artlenburg. Merlin became a member of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and an officer of the L√©gion on 14 June 1804. General officer Merlin was promoted general of brigade on 1 February 1805. In Mass√©na's Army of Italy, he led a cavalry brigade consisting of the 14th and 25th Chasseurs √† Cheval. Merlin's 6th Brigade was part of Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne's Cavalry Division at the 1806 Siege of Gaeta. He became an equerry to Joseph Bonaparte, the new sovereign of the Kingdom of Naples. On 1 June 1807 he took command of the division of Salerno and Avellino and transferred to lead the division of Abruzzo on 9 September. Merlin was part of the kingdom's government in Naples in May 1808 when Joseph assumed the crown of Spain. Merlin went with Joseph and became a general of division and captain general in Joseph's Kingdom of Spain. At the Battle of Talavera on 27‚Äì28 July 1809, Merlin led 1,188 men of the IV Corps cavalry brigade. The units were the 10th and 26th Chasseurs √† Cheval, Polish Lancer and Westphalian Chevau-l√©ger Regiments. During the battle, the British commander Sir Arthur Wellesley ordered William Anson's cavalry brigade to charge the French. About in front of the French defenders, the 1st Hussars of the King's German Legion and the 23rd Light Dragoons unwittingly charged into a hidden stream bed which toppled many horses and tumbled many riders to the ground. Hastily reforming, the Germans and the left wing of the 23rd LD charged the French infantry drawn up in squares, were repulsed and withdrew. Drake's and Allen's squadrons on the right wing of the 23rd LD rode past the squares and charged Merlin's cavalry brigade. The 10th and 26th Chasseurs in the front line drew aside and allowed the British cavalry to gallop past. The two British squadrons struck the Westphalians in the second line, then were attacked from behind by the 10th and 26th Chasseurs. Only Lord George Russell and a few other British horsemen escaped the trap. In the battle the 23rd Light Dragoons lost 207 killed, wounded and captured out of 450 horsemen. Merlin led cavalry at the Battle of Almonacid on 11 August 1809. The IV Corps cavalry on that occasion included the 3rd Dutch Hussars and the Polish Lancers of the Legion of the Vistula. King Joseph appointed Merlin to command his Royal Guard on 16 August, but he also led the light cavalry in the rout of the Spanish at the Battle of Oca√±a on 18‚Äì19 November 1809 according to historian Charles Mulli√©. This is contradicted by Charles Oman who asserted that Antoine-Marie Paris d'Illins led the IV Corps cavalry at Oca√±a. Paris was killed in a cavalry melee on 18 November and was succeeded by Andr√© Thomas Perreymond. Battle of Reims, 13 March 1814 After the French were driven out of Spain, Merlin received promotion to general of division in the French army on 5 January 1814. After being placed in charge of the central cavalry depot on 21 January and in command of some National Guard units on 31 January, he assumed command of a cavalry division on 11 February. At about this time, Emperor Napoleon reorganized his cavalry, forming the I Cavalry Corps from the divisions of Merlin and √âtienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle with Bordesoulle in command of the corps. Merlin's 1st Light Cavalry Division first appeared in the order of battle during the Battle of Champaubert on 9 February. At the Battle of Vauchamps on 14 February, the 1st Brigade under Fran√ßois Isidore Wathiez consisted of the 6th, 7th and 8th Hussars and the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 8th Chevau-l√©ger Lancers. The 2nd Brigade under Claude Raymond Guyon was made up of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 9th, 16th and 25th Chasseurs √† Cheval. On 20 February, Wathiez's brigade counted 1,063 sabers while Guyon's brigade had 956. The regiments were small; the largest numbered 177 and the smallest 84 horsemen. Merlin's division was involved in the fighting subsequent to the Battle of Gu√©-√†-Tresmes. On 2 March 1814 Friedrich von Kleist sent out a reconnaissance force of three cavalry regiments, five infantry battalions and two horse artillery batteries. Merlin charged the Prussians but was pushed back on his infantry supports. The Prussians were stopped and retreated in the late afternoon. During the Battle of Laon on 9 March, the corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont and Bordesoulle were routed by a 7:30 pm Prussian surprise attack. The French lost 3,500 men and 45 guns in the so-called \\"Hurrah of Athies\\". At the Battle of Reims on 13 March, Merlin's division advanced on the extreme right flank with the task of stopping the Prussians from falling back toward the bridge at Sillery. The cavalrymen overran a number of Prussian battalions, compelling the soldiers to surrender. On 14 March, Merlin's troopers were beaten in a skirmish with Friedrich von Katzeler's Prussian cavalry at Courcy, losing about 100 casualties. By 17 March, Merlin's division had shrunk to 1,150 sabers when it was assigned to Marmont's corps. When the force led by Marshals Marmont and Mortier moved east, Merlin formed its advance guard. On 23 March 1814 at Berg√®res, his troopers drove off an Allied foraging party, capturing 100 men and liberating 16 wagon loads of plunder. At the Battle of F√®re-Champenoise on 25 March, Marmont and Mortier with 18,100 infantry, 4,350 cavalry and 84 guns found themselves facing 26,400 Allied cavalry and 128 guns. Merlin's division was involved in the fighting which ended in a serious French defeat. For the Battle of Paris on 30 March Merlin's division was reduced to 850 horsemen in the brigades of Pierre Fran√ßois Huber and Antoine Henri Latour-Foissac. Marmont and Mortier led 19,961 foot soldiers and 5,565 horsemen against 119,000 Allied infantry and 26,500 cavalry. Bordesoulle's corps and Louis Pierre Aim√© Chastel's cavalry division were posted on the extreme right flank. After stiff fighting, Marmont and Mortier agreed to an armistice that would allow them to evacuate Paris. Later career After Napoleon abdicated, King Louis XVIII named Merlin inspector general of cavalry in the 5th Military Division and awarded him the Order of Saint-Louis on 19 July 1814. During the Hundred Days, Napoleon appointed Merlin to lead the 8th Cavalry Division in the V Corps. He led his troopers in successful skirmishes against the Allies on 24 and 28 June 1815. Upon the Second Bourbon Restoration Merlin was placed in inactive status. On 25 July 1816 he was made cavalry inspector for the 6th and 18th Military Divisions and on 27 April 1817 this changed to cavalry inspector the 18th and 21st Military Divisions. He was appointed to the General Staff on 30 December 1818. He became cavalry inspector for the 2nd Military Division on 21 April 1820. He became available for other assignments on 1 January 1821. He was placed on retirement on 1 January 1825. After the July Revolution, Merlin was first appointed cavalry inspector of the 38th arrondissement on 8 August 1830 and commander of Corsica on 9 September 1830. He became an infantry inspector on 18 March 1831 before being available for other assignments on 30 December that year. He was made cavalry inspector for the 3rd Military Division on 5 July 1832 and became a member of the Infantry and Cavalry Committee on 20 September that year. King Louis Philippe named Merlin a Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur on 18 April 1834. He was appointed cavalry inspector of the 1st Military Division on 14 June 1834. He was placed in inactive status on 27 May 1836 and died in Paris on 9 May 1839. MERLIN is inscribed on the south side of the Arc de Triomphe.

Plot Alan Banks is newly promoted to Detective Superintendent. There are two investigations in the book, one is investigated by DI Annie Cabbot although Banks is the SIO on paper. He has three female assistants. At an important meeting called by the chief constable (and attended by the new Police and Crime Commissioner) Banks is told that he is to be in charge of a historical sexual abuse investigation, along with an old (now) friend Richard (Dirty Dick) Burgess from the NCA (the National Crime Agency; the British FBI. It is similar to the Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris cases, and part of Operation Yewtree. He is to investigate Danny Caxton who was a crooner in the late fifties then a popular (and sexy) television host and celebrity entertainer in the sixties to the eighties and early nineties. Caxton is accused of the rape of Linda Palmer, then fourteen, in the summer of 1967 at Blackpool. One of seven similar complaints against Caxton, here there was a rape witness (and reluctant participant). But the witness, an assistant to Caxton, turns out to have been murdered two months later in suspicious circumstances and left dead in a place used by gays. The case files of the death have disappeared, and the Chief Constable at the time who was a friend of Caxton was dismissed in a drug-related corruption scandal some years later. During an interview with Caxton with his lawyer present Caxton has a stroke, which Banks is the first to notice and calls for paramedics. Later Banks says there will be repercussions and demands for a pound of flesh, but says demotion wouldn't bother me too much. (Promotion to) Chief Constable I'm not so sure about. Caxton was eighty-five, and was not following his doctor's advice as it would interfere with his sex life. He has two more strokes, one on the way to hospital and a third there, so if he survives he will be bedridden and incapacitated. Banks says the CPS will declare him unfit to stand. DI Annie Cabbot is investigating the death of a teenage girl; her battered naked body was found on a country road, and she turns out to be fifteen. The team discovers she was dropped off after intercourse and then beaten to death by someone from a second vehicle. Eventually a friend of her brother confesses to picking her up and beating her to death; he did not like her consorting with Pakis (Pakistanis) who have been grooming and paying her. They will be charged with rape, sex with a child and sexual assault. There is DNA evidence, and she is under-age. Banks says Something's sure to stick, so her case ends in finality. It is similar to the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal.

Her research revealed children were exposed to dangerous levels of lead in Flint, Michigan. She is now the director of an initiative to mitigate the impact of the crisis. She is commonly referred to as \\"Dr. Mona\\". She is the author of the 2018 book What the Eyes Don't See, which The New York Times named as one of the 100 most notable books of the year. Biography Born Mona Hanna in Sheffield, England, her parents are Iraqi scientists and dissidents who fled during Saddam Hussein's regime. She grew up in Royal Oak, Michigan and graduated from Royal Oak's Kimball High School. In 2017, she penned a New York Times opinion about her immigrant story and the impact of President Donald Trump's immigration restrictions titled Corroding the American Dream.\\"Corroding the American Dream.\\" Mona Hanna received her Bachelor of Science from University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability, her Master of Public Health degree in Health Management and Policy from the University of Michigan School of Public Health, and her medical degree from Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. She completed her residency and chief residency at Wayne State University/Children's Hospital of Michigan. She is an associate professor at the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. Her husband, Elliott Attisha, is a pediatrician in Detroit, Michigan. They have two daughters. Flint water crisis Role in exposing lead levels On 24 September 2015, in a press conference at Flint's Hurley Medical Center, Dr. Hanna-Attisha revealed that Flint children's blood lead levels doubled after the water was switched from the Detroit River to the Flint River in April 2014. Dr. Hanna-Attisha conducted her research after talking to a high-school friend, Elin Warn Betanzo, a former Environmental Protection Agency Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water employee and water engineer. Betanzo told Hanna-Attisha that Marc Edwards, a water engineer and professor from Virginia Tech and his team of Flint Water Study researchers, found high levels of lead in Flint residents' homes. Even though Hanna-Attisha was not provided the data she sought from the State of Michigan, she used hospital electronic medical records as data for her study. At a risk to her career, Hanna-Attisha revealed her findings at the 24 September 2015 press conference before her research was scientifically peer reviewed, because of the public health implications. Hanna-Attisha's findings were later published in the American Journal of Public Health. Hanna Attisha's findings were confirmed in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in July 2016, and is recognized as an underestimate of exposure. At Dr. Hanna-Attisha's 24 September 2015 press conference she urged residents, particularly children, to stop drinking the water, to end Flint River as a water source as soon as possible and urged the City of Flint to issue a health advisory. A day after Dr. Hanna-Attisha released her study, Flint issued a health advisory advising residents, particularly children, to minimize exposure to Flint tap water. The water source was switched back to the Detroit River on 16 October 2015. Later, the City of Flint, the State of Michigan and the United States made emergency declarations. Dr. Hanna- Attisha's research was initially ridiculed by the State of Michigan, when a Michigan Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson accused her of being an \\"unfortunate researcher\\" \\"splicing and dicing numbers\\" who was causing \\"near hysteria.\\" About ten days later, after The Detroit Free Press published its own findings consistent with Dr. Hanna-Attisha's findings and after Hanna- Attisha engaged in one-on-one conversations with Michigan's chief medical officer, the State of Michigan backed down and concurred with her findings. Later, at the press conference in which the State of Michigan acknowledged the lead in water crisis, Department of Environmental Quality officials apologized to Hanna-Attisha. In his 19 January 2016 State of the State address, Governor Snyder publicly thanked Hanna-Attisha and Edwards for sounding the alarm about the Flint water crisis. Dr. Hanna-Attisha's work was subsequently heavily criticized in prestigious medical Journals (Clin Toxycol 2019; 57: 790-797. Obstet Gynecol 2019; 134: 628-635. J Pediatr 2018; 197: 15-16.) reporting that the paper on the Flint water accident, although accurate as presented, was plagued by wrong conclusions,being impossible to differentiate the variation in blood lead levels in the time considered from other random variations over time. Moreover, such variation during the accident time was a mere 0,11 ¬µg/dl increse in the mean geometrical blood lead level still within both a low range and a decreasing trend, which sounds differently from the reported \\"doubling\\" of a small number of children with levels over a certain threshold. Advocacy and program involvement Dr. Hanna-Attisha testified twice before Congress about the Flint Water Crisis and penned an op/ed advocating for federal assistance for Flint children exposed as a result of the crisis published in the New York Times. Eventually, in part due to Dr. Hanna- Attisha's advocacy, $100 million in federal dollars was allocated to Flint in addition to approximately $250 million in state dollars to address the crisis. She is the founder the director of the Pediatric Public Health Initiative, a partnership between Hurley Medical Center and Michigan State University, to optimize the outcomes of Flint children. Through community and clinical programs, childhood health policy and advocacy, and robust evaluation, the Pediatric Public Health Initiative works with many partners, including Flint's heroic parents and kids, as a center of excellence, with the primary goal of mitigating the impact of the Flint Water Crisis and serving as a national resource for best practices. Also in response to the crisis, Hanna-Attisha worked to establish, was a founding donor, raises money for and is on the advisory board of the Flint Child Health and Development Fund. In one year, the Flintkids.org Fund raised over $17 million and awarded over $2 million in grants directly supporting Flint kids' health and development. Hanna-Attisha was appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to three public health commissions formed in response to the Flint Water Crisis, the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee,Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee the Michigan Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board,Michigan Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board and the Michigan Public Health Commission.Michigan Public Health Commission \\"What the Eyes Don't See\\" Hanna-Attisha wrote what has been described as a dramatic first-hand account of the Flint Water Crisis with the \\"gripping intrigue of a Grisham thriller.\\" The book was published by Random House imprint One World by editor-in-chief Chris Jackson.

Its name comes from its historical association with the former West Eleventh Street Elevator, a funicular that was similar to the Fenelon Place Elevator to the south. For the most part the historic buildings here are single-family residences with their attendant out- buildings, although the number of out-buildings located here is relatively low. There is one apartment building and 46 duplexes. Some of the single- family houses were converted into multi-family residences, and then some of those were converted back. The various Victorian styles are found along the bluff fronts on the eastern and southern edge of the district, and vernacular structures on the northern and western sections. The Charles T. Hancock House (1890) was individually listed on the National Register. Given the steep bluffs in the district the historic structures are retaining walls and steps that replace the sidewalks.

Her advocacy is focused on criminalizing abortion, particularly in the case of pregnancy from rape. Early life Kiessling was raised in Detroit by a Jewish family and had her bat mitzvah as a teenage girl. She graduated from law school at age 23. In the 1960s, Kiessling's mother was raped at knifepoint and fell pregnant following the assault. She then was advised by her rape counselor that she obtain an illegal abortion in back alley clinics since the elective procedure was illegal by Michigan law at that time, and consulting a legal physician would have been costly. However, she was deterred from obtaining an abortion due to the unsanitary area and practices there. After she gave birth to Kiessling, Kiessling's mother gave her daughter up for adoption. At age 19, Kiessling met with her birth mother, Joann, who had told her that her biological father was a serial rapist as well as \\"Caucasian and of large build\\". Anti-abortion activism Kiessling is critical of pro-life legislation that include a rape exception, such as the Hyde Amendment which bans taxpayer funding on abortion, and the Affordable Care Act which she has described as \\"a joke that holds no weight\\". She has also criticized the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act because it contained a rape exception: \\"She also cited recent legislation, such as Rep. Chris Smith‚Äôs (R-NJ) No Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act, which also included a rape exception.\\" In March 2017, Kiessling spoke for the Irish pro-life group Youth Defence at the Citizens' Assembly, which was debating Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion. Efforts denying convicted rapists parental rights Kiessling supports the termination of rapists' parental rights, both taking cases as a pro-bono attorney and advocating for the passage of laws requiring judges to terminate custody if there is \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" of rape. In 2008, she represented a mother from Michigan who had been raped at the age of 12, and her rapist granted joint custody of the then 8-year-old child. Upon reviewing the case, the judge rescinded his previous ruling granting convicted rapist Christopher Mirasolo joint custody, and furthermore pledged to take action to avoid a repeat of his controversial ruling. In October 2017, she represented another woman who was also assaulted by Mirasolo. In 2019, Alabama passed a law requiring judges to end the parental rights of those convicted of first- degree rape, first-degree sodomy and incest. Kiessling argues conviction-based parental right termination leave some women vulnerable, due to the low percentage of rape reports and furthermore, convictions. At the time, Kiessling stated \\"We need to mandate judges in family-law matters to immediately suspend any legal or physical custody or parenting time if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived in rape.\\" As of 2019, Minnesota is the only state to not have a law ending parental rights for those convicted of rape or incest. Personal life Initially raised in the Jewish faith, Kiessling converted to Christianity at age 23, following an invitation to attend Mass by a friend after suffering domestic abuse from a boyfriend with whom she attended law school. On July 29, 2020, Kiessling announced that her two adopted sons, Caleb and Kyler, died at ages 20 and 18, respectively, from drug overdose.

Though she was co-author of a series of arithmetics books, the publishers decided that her name should be withheld. She became an advocate for the enfranchisement of women. She was said to be the \\"first woman to administer a state normal school\\". She was an officer of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, an active member and director in the New England Women's Educational Club of Boston, and president of the West Newton Woman's Educational Club since its organization in 1880. Though not a prolific writer, she sometimes contributed to the press. She was an occasional lecturer upon literary and philanthropic subjects. Early years and education Electa Nobles Lincoln was born in Watertown, New York, 12 May 1824. She was the youngest daughter of Martin and Susan Freeman Lincoln. On the paternal side, she was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, who settled at Hingham, in 1637, and of his son Mordecai, who was born in Hingham in 1657. These two ancestors of Mrs. Walton were also ancestors of the President, Abraham Lincoln, who was of the same generation that she is‚Äîthe seventh. Mrs. Walton's father, Martin Lincoln, was born in Cohasset in 1795. A teacher by profession, he taught in the public schools of Lancaster, also in the Lancaster Academy, and afterward for some years kept a private school in Boston. Mrs. Walton's mother, whose maiden name was Susan White Freeman, was the daughter of Adam and Margaret (White) Freeman. Adam Freeman, grandfather of Mrs. Walton, emigrated with a party from Frankfurt am Main about 1780, and settled in the locality then known as the \\"German Flats,\\" afterward named Frankfort, New York. His wife, Margaret White Freeman, Mrs. Walton's maternal grandmother, was from Windsor, Vermont. Archibald White, Jr., and William White, who are on record as living in the town in 1786, were her brothers. At the age of two, she removed to Lancaster with her family. She resided afterwards in Roxbury, and later in Boston. Under the tutoring of Dr. Nathaniel Thayer, of Lancaster, and Dr. George Putnam, of Roxbury, she studied the doctrines of Unitarianism. During the ministration of Rev. J. T. Sargent and under the impulse occasioned by the preaching of Rev. Theodore Parker, she devoted herself to religious work. Her first and principal teacher was her father. At the age of seventeen, she entered the State Normal School in Lexington, and was graduated. Career In 1843, having completed the normal course of study and having received her diploma, she became an assistant in the Franklin Grammar School, Boston. After teaching there for a few weeks, she was appointed assistant in the Normal School, her alma mater, where she began to teach on May 7, 1843, five days before she turned 19. She retained her position as assistant at the State Normal School for seven years, one at Lexington and six at West Newton (when the school was removed in 1844), and served under three principals‚Äîthe Rev. Cyrus Peirce, the Rev. Samuel Joseph May, and Eben S. Stearns. In the interregnum between the resignation of Peirce and the accession of Stearns, Lincoln served as principal of the school; and it was the expressed wish of Peirce that she should succeed him as permanent principal. Lincoln was thus the first woman in the United States to act as principal of a State Normal School, but to make her the permanent principal was too great an innovation to be seriously thought of by those in authority in that time. She married George Augustus Walton, of Lawrence, in August, 1850, and for 18 years, they resided in Lawrence. After her marriage, Walton devoted her spare time to benevolent and philanthropic enterprises, and was a leader in church and charitable work. She received instruction in vocal culture from Professor James E. Murdock and William Russell. She was employed by Gen. George Armstrong Custer, conducting a teachers' institute of the graduating class in Hampton. During the American Civil War, turning the sympathies of the Lawrence people toward the Sanitary Commission, she aided in organizing the whole community into a body of co- laborers with the army in the field. She was co-author with her husband of a series of arithmetics books. She believed in the equal rights of woman and that they should be credited for their work. Her beliefs were intensified by the decision of the publishers, that her name should be withheld as co-author of the arithmetics. From being simply a believer in the right of woman suffrage, she became an earnest advocate for the complete enfranchisement of woman. She was always a zealous advocate of temperance and during a residence in Westfield, held the office of president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of that town. After her removal to West Newton, she became actively interested in promoting woman suffrage, believing that through woman suffrage the cause of temperance and other reforms were best advanced. She was an officer of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, an active member and director in the New England Women's Educational Club of Boston, and president of the West Newton Woman's Educational Club since its organization in 1880. Though not a prolific writer, she sometimes contributed to the press. She was an occasional lecturer upon literary and philanthropic subjects. Having received thorough instruction in vocal culture from Professors James E. Murdock and William Russell, she was for years employed as a teacher of reading and vocal training in the teachers' institutes of Massachusetts. She also taught in the State Normal Institutes of Virginia, and for five successive years, by invitation of General Armstrong, conducted a teachers' institute of the graduating class in Hampton. Private life She married George Augustus Walton on August 27, 1850. At that time and for a number of years after, he was principal of the Oliver Grammar School in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Subsequently, as a teacher in teachers' institutes in New England, also in New York and Virginia, he became widely known and influential. For 25 years, from 1871, he was agent of the Massachusetts State Board of Education. Mr. Walton was a graduate of the Bridgewater Normal School. He received the degree of Master of Arts from Williams College. Born in South Reading (now Wakefield), Mass., February 18, 1822, son of James and Elizabeth (Bryant) Walton, he was a lineal descendant of the Rev. William Walton, whose services as minister of the gospel at Marblehead covered a period of 30 years, 1638‚Äì68. The Waltons were the parents of five children, of whom three survived: Harriet Peirce, wife of Judge James R. Dunbar, of the Massachusetts Superior Court; Dr. George Lincoln Walton (Harv. Univ., A.B. 1875, M.D. 1880), neurologist, of Boston: and Alice Walton (Smith Coll., A.B. 1887; Cornell, Ph.D. 1892), who became associate professor of Latin and archaeology at Wellesley College. Walton died on March 15, 1908 in Newton, Massachusetts. Selected works * 1866, A pictorial primary arithmetic : on the plan of object-lessons (with G. A.

For example, a weather front is the interface between two different density masses of air, in combustion where the flame is the interface between burned and unburned material or in population dynamics where the front is the interface between populated and unpopulated places. Fronts can be static or mobile depending on the conditions of the system, and the causes of the motion can be the variation of a free energy, where the most energetically favorable state invades the less favorable one, according to Pomeau or shape induced motion due to non-variation dynamics in the system, according to Alvarez-Socorro, Clerc, Gonz√°lez-Cort√©s and Wilson. From a mathematical point of view, fronts are solutions of spatially extended systems connecting two steady states, and from dynamical systems point of view, a front corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit of the system in the co-mobile frame (or proper frame). The motion of magnetization domains front. Black state (a magnetization direction in the material) invades the white state (opposite magnetization direction). The fronts are the interfaces between black and white areas. Fronts connecting stable - unstable homogeneous states  The most simple example of front solution connecting a homogeneous stable state with a homogeneous unstable state can be shown in the one-dimensional Fisher-Kolmogorov equation: :: N_{t} = D N_{xx} + r N (N_0-N) that describes a simple model for the density N(x,t) of population. This equation has two steady states, N = 0, and N = N_0. This solution corresponds to extinction and saturation of population. Observe that this model is spatially-extended, because it includes a diffusion term given by the second derivative. The state N \\\\equiv N_0 is stable as a simple linear analysis can show and the state N = 0 is unstable. There exist a family of front solutions connecting N=N_0 with N=0, and such solution are propagative.

Roosevelt Oval Office The Hoover desk is a large block front desk, designed by J. Stuart Clingman and built by the Robert W. Irwin Company, used by Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Oval Office as their Oval Office desk. Created in 1930 as a part of a 17-piece office suite by furniture makers from Grand Rapids, Michigan, it was given to the White House by the Grand Rapids Furniture Manufacturers Association. The Hoover desk is one of only six desks to be used by a President in the Oval Office. Design and markings The Hoover Desk in a recreation of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Oval Office at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in 2008. The Hoover desk is a large, and , traditionally designed desk. It was designed by J. Stuart Clingman and was created in the \\"Royal\\" plant of the Robert W. Irwin Company. Taking design cues from both Queen Anne and Colonial New England furniture styles, the desk has a block front design motif and has three drawers in each pedestal as well as a center drawer. The desk is made completely of American lumber, faced with Michigan-grown maple burl wood veneer, and finished in a rich French Walnut tone. The desk has an engraved plate attached to it which states: \\"This desk presented to the President of the United States by the Grand Rapids Furniture Manufacturers Association. History At about 8:00 pm on Christmas Eve, 1929, a fire began in the attic of the West Wing. Due to some quick thinking and a tarpaulin, George Akerson managed to save the Theodore Roosevelt desk, but the executive offices were heavily damaged. By 10:30 the fire was extinguished but not before the roof, attic, floors, and press room of the West Wing were ruined. The building was repaired and on April 14, 1930, President Herbert Hoover moved back into the newly constructed Oval Office. With the opening of the newly repaired and renovated Oval office, Hoover was given a 17-piece office suite, made by furniture makers from Grand Rapids, Michigan, by the Grand Rapids Furniture Manufacturers Association, to furnish the space. The Wilson Desk was the centerpiece of this office suite. According to an article in the Grand Rapids Spectator from the time, in addition to the desk the full set consists of a \\"davenport, a club chair, two large and one smaller wing chairs, two tables, a swivel desk chair, two armchairs, two bookcases, a small table and three smoking stands of two sizes.\\" All pieces have uniform finishes and carry a common design language, but were created by various Grand Rapids furniture manufactures. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office after Hoover, he decided to keep the same furnishings and furniture in the Oval Office as his predecessor. Over the course of his presidency he gathered a collection of objects that he displayed on the desk. After Roosevelt's death, on Harry Truman's first day as President, he cleared off the Hoover desk and shortly thereafter had the desk itself shipped up to what is now the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, New York. The Hoover desk, the chair Roosevelt used with it, and a selection of objects on the desk at the time of his death are currently on display at the library.

Krogan, a Canadian molecular biologist, is a professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and a senior investigator at the J. David Gladstone Institutes. He is also the Director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute, (QBI), which focuses on developing and using quantitative approaches to study basic biological mechanisms, often related to disease areas. He serves as Director of The HARC Center, an NIH-funded collaborative group that focuses on the structural characterization of HIV-human protein complexes. Krogan's research is focused on using quantitative system approaches to help understand complex biological and biomedical problems. He has authored over 250 papers in the field of molecular biology and has given over 300 lectures and seminars around the world.  Early life and education  Krogan obtained his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the University of Regina in 1997. Upon completing his M.Sc. in 1999 at the University of Regina, Krogan started his Ph.D. at the University of Toronto with Jack Greenblatt as his doctoral advisor. During his PhD thesis, he led a project that systematically identified protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through a tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy. This led to the characterization of over 500 complexes, comprising more than 4000 proteins. During this time, he worked on developing an approach, termed E-MAP, for high throughput generation and quantitative analysis of genetic interaction data. Combining the genetic and protein-protein interaction data led to a deeper understanding of the relationship between physical and genetic data as well as insight into a wide variety of biological processes, including chromatin function, transcription, protein trafficking and RNA processing.  Career  In July 2011, Krogan joined the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology (GIVI) and Gladstone Institute of Cardiac Disease (GICD) as an associate investigator. In 2012, he led a comprehensive study using AP-MS to systematically identify protein-protein interactions between HIV and host cells. 497 different HIV-human protein-protein interactions were identified, only 19 of which had been previously reported in the literature. . Krogan was appointed director of the UCSF-QB3 in July 2013. The same year, he was also promoted to senior investigator at the GIVI and GICD. He created the Thermo Fisher Scientific Mass Spectrometry Facility for Disease Target Discovery at the J. David Gladstone Institute and serves as its Director. Krogan, along with Trey Ideker at UCSD, launched the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) at UCSF in 2015. The group, which includes many investigators at UCSF and UCSD, focuses on using systems approaches and network biology to interpret cancer genomic data.

It is a bushy shrub with three-part, clover-like leaves and small clusters of pale to deep pink flowers with four petals and four stamens. Description Zieria cytisoides is a bushy shrub which usually grows to a height of up to with its branches covered with velvety hairs. The leaves are composed of three leaflets with the central one elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide and with a petiole long. The leaflets are flat, sometimes with their edges rolled under. They are dark green and covered with short, soft hairs on the upper surface and grey- green, covered with velvety hairs on the lower surface. Pale to deep pink, rarely white flowers are arranged in clusters of between 3 and 30 in leaf axils with a persistent bract at the base of the cluster. The clusters are about the same length as the leaves, but often longer or shorter. The sepals are triangular, about long and covered with soft hairs. The four petals are long, have a covering of soft hairs and do not overlap each other. There are four stamens. Flowers are present in winter and spring and are followed by velvety follicles containing black to reddish-brown seeds. Taxonomy and naming Downy zieria was first formally described in 1818 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in The Cyclopaedia. The specific epithet (cytisoides) alludes to a similarity between this species and one of the genus Cytisus, but the connection is not clear. (The suffix -oides means \\"likeness\\" in Latin.) Distribution and habitat Zieria cytisoides occurs in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. It is most common and widespread in New South Wales where it grows in forest woodland and heath, often in sandy soil on rocky slopes from coastal areas to the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range. Use in horticulture This zieria is most easily propagated from cuttings and is hardy in well-drained soil in full sun or part shade. In the Australian National Botanic Gardens it grows as a compact shrub with little pruning and is resistant to pests and diseases.

Overview The 360 (referring to the 354 cc engine) had a two-cylinder engine producing 18 horsepower. Originally introduced as a two-door sedan, it was also built in light panel van and pickup truck versions, replacing the unrefined and outdated Cony Guppy and the similar Giant 360. Instead of an air-cooled two cylinder engine from the previous model, which was seen as outdated and unrefined, a new lighter air-cooled four cylinder engine producing 18 hp was placed in the 360; power went up to 20 hp after 1967. The vehicle was a technical oddity in early-1960s Japan. The compact engine, designed to take as little space as possible, was mounted in a RMR layout with a dry sump instead of an oil pan. The vehicle featured rack and pinion steering, a feature that was rare in Japanese cars at the time and mostly found on advanced American and European performance cars; post-1967 models also had a four-speed manual transmission, a rarity in kei cars of the time. Despite technological advantages, the 360's performance was low even for its class. It struggled to achieve a top speed of 80 km per hour. Cabover truck The wide truck was unveiled at the 1964 Tokyo Motor Show as a competitor to established cab over kei truck models such as the Subaru Sambar and Daihatsu Hijet. The name of Wide was due to the large size of the loading platform, which was the largest in its class; a panel van version was introduced in 1966. Some of the cab-over trucks were made in left-hand drive for export markets, mainly North America.The 150 type was planned to be released in October 1969, a prototype very similar to a two-door car of [Honda ¬∑ Life] (first generation) aiming at 3000 units per month and a price of 350,000 yen. Although it was a car, the parent company Nissan Motor originally planned to send manufacturing affiliates to the top management of Aichi machinery, but it was unable to train Aichi as a completed car manufacturer, and this plan did not succeed. (Translated from Japanese Wikipedia citation) Demise For a smaller Japanese manufacturer, Aichi Kokuki was fairly successful and innovative; however, competition in the Japanese auto industry became fierce, particularly in the 360 cc kei segment. The introduction of newcomers, mainly the Honda N360 and T360 in particular, ate into Cony's market share as the vehicles, while advanced, were inferior in capability and performance compared to the Honda and Suzulight models. Nissan, having taken over Prince Motor Company in 1965, was greatly expanding its production and influence in the Japanese auto industry. Aichi Kokuki began its collaboration with Nissan in 1965, designing the Nissan A engine which would debut in the brand new 1966 Nissan Sunny. Aichi Kokuki's financial problems, combined with Nissan increasing their share of the company, caused the production of Cony vehicles to finally come to a halt in 1970; while there were plans to continue Cony vehicles under the Nissan badge, the plant was instead put to use to produce larger and far more profitable Nissan models, such as the Nissan Cherry, while the dealer network was transformed into the Nissan Cherry Store. Nissan did not control Aichi Kouchi completely until 2012, when it became a full-fledged subsidiary of Nissan.

The Kotte's campaign had several phases against Jaffna dated between A.D. 1449‚Äì50 and 1453-4.Humphrey William Codrington, A Short History of Ceylon Ayer Publishing, 1970; The first campaign, led by Prince Sapumal, adopted son of Parakramabahu VI in 1450. In the second campaign, Prince Sapuma defeated Kanakasooriya Cinkaiariyan and ruled the region nearly 17 years as a representative of Kotte.  Background  Jaffna kingdom was in better peak in terms of power and economy during early 15th century. It had influential control over Palk Strait and extended its domination over Vanni, Puttalam, and Chilaw regions. Vanni principalities were paid tribute to the kingdom. Also, it was able to influence southern kingdoms of the island. The rise of Vijayanagara Empire influenced Southern India and extended its sovereignty to Jaffna. Therefore, Jaffna kingdom became powerless, weak, and a tributary state. Meanwhile, Kotte kingdom became powerful during the reign of Parakramabahu VI. He made a request to Prince Sapumal for invading Jaffna kingdom as the king wanted to keep him away from Kotte by considering future crown issues. However, Rajaveliya did not mention such causes.  Campaign  Expeditions against the Jaffna kingdom had two phases that were led by Sapumal. The first campaign was able to defeat tributary Vanni states of Jaffna kingdom, but failed to subdue the Jaffna. The support of Vijayanagara Empire was an additional strength to Jaffna forces. It occurred in 1449‚Äì50. Sapumal gathered forces from Kotte and launched the second attack, including center of Jaffna during 1453-4. Jaffna and Kannada forces put up stubborn resistance. Kannada forces had an outpost on the mainland that served as access command to the Jaffna peninsula. Vanniyar leaders and Indian Muslims also helped Jaffna. However, all of them were defeated and Sapumal conquered Jaffna kingdom. There are different concepts about the last days of Jaffna king Kanakasooriya Cinkaiariyan. Ancient records that described the Jaffna campaign do not say much about his last days, but Rajaveliya says that Sapumal slew him, took his consort and children prisoners, and brought them to Kotte. Also, some historical scholars suggest that he would have been killed in the final battle, but Yalpana Vaipava Malai and Kokila Saudesaya describe that he had fled to Southern India with his family.  Aftermath  Parakramabahu VI appointed Prince Sapumal as representative of Kotte and ruler of Jaffna. Sapumal received cooperation from local people including chieftains and the Jaffna army. The newly formed army consisted of Tamil, Malayalis, Tuluvar, and Singhalese. According to Yalpana Vaipava Malai, Sapumal established Nallur city and built Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil. However, there are controversial concepts that say Nallur and temples were established before the arrival of Sapumal. Also, some scholars say that the campaign end the rule of Aryacakravarti dynasty in Jaffna kingdom as the later kings of Jaffna did not have the title of Aryacakravarti. Sapumal ruled the Jaffna kingdom for 17 years.

It was built in 1913 on the project of architect V.A. Pokrovsky. The cathedral has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional significance.  History  One of the first places of worship for Old Believers community of Rostov-on-Don was a small chapel. In 1813, a wooden Church of the Intercession was built on the site of the chapel. According to the assumption of the Rostov regional ethnographer A.P. Zimin, this church was moved by the settlers from the White Sea. In 1913, a stone church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin was built on the opposite side of the street where the wooden church was situated. The construction of the temple was donated Rostov merchant N.A. Panin. A well-known architect Vladimir Pokrovsky was the author of the project. Opposite the church apse there was located Old Believers hospice (according to other sources, it actually was the clergy house), built in 1910 also on the funds of Panin. In church was established an altar of St. Elijah the Prophet, so the temple also sometimes called \\"Pokrov‚ÄïSt. Elijah Church\\". The proximity of the two Old Believers Pokrovsky temple was explained by the presence of multiple branches of Russian Old Believers. According to the memoirs of the members of congregation, stone Church of the Intercession was originally owned by the Beglopopovtsy of Russian Old-Orthodox Church. And to the community of Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church belonged the old wooden church. In 1923, the wooden church was closed, and its congregation moved into the stone Pokrovsky temple. In 1930 this temple was closed, too, and its building was used to house a radio workshop. In 1946 it was re-opened, but was given to Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church community.  Architecture  Old Believers Pokrovsky Cathedral was built in Russian Revival style. The architect had to solve the problem of construction of the temple in a small area surrounded by urban development. This fact explains its unusual architecture. To extended dining room adjoins the semicircular apse, asymmetrically located one-tier belfry and porch. Belfry, refectory and the apse are crowned by small cupolas with crosses. Semicircular window openings of the refectory are decorated with decorative plaster. The temple is designed to hold about 500 worshipers.

The player must care for their virtual pet toy, Baby Talking Tattletail, while avoiding the pursuit of its recalled predecessor, Mama Tattletail (commonly referred to as \\"Mama\\"). The game was released on Steam on December 28, 2016. Sometime after the game's full release, 2 updates were released, one adding multiple endings and the other adding an expansion campaign that takes place after the main game's campaign. During the expansion there is a mysterious person giving the player notes referencing that they failed to fix their memories.  Gameplay  For the five nights leading up to Christmas, the player must tend to their Baby Talking Tattletail toy by feeding it, grooming it, and allowing it to charge while completing a set of objectives each night. While the Baby Talking Tattletail is not a threat, it is prone to generating a lot of sound when its needs are not met, alerting Mama Tattletail of their location. While completing a set task, the player must avoid Mama by staying quiet when she is near. Failure to do so or going too close will result in Mama attacking the player in a jumpscare. Players acquire a shake flashlight to navigate in the darkness, but Mama Tattletail has the ability to kill their flashlight when they point it directly at her. Baby Talking Tattletail is also afraid of the dark and is quite vocal about it, creating a necessity to recharge the flashlight by shaking it quickly. However, shaking it generates sound, so the player must be careful about when and where to shake. Over the course of the game, a series of \\"Gift Eggs\\", presumably laid by Tattletail, are placed throughout the house. Collecting all of the eggs will result in the player achieving the \\"good ending\\" of the game.  Plot  The game takes place in 1998 over the course of 5 nights, beginning on December 20 and ending on Christmas Day. The player wakes up on Night 1 to open their Christmas present early. The present is the new fad toy, a purple Baby Talking Tattletail (based on a Furby). After playing with the toy briefly (which involves feeding and grooming it), the player puts it back into its box and goes back to bed. On Night 2, the player finds the same Tattletail in the tumble dryer, with no indication of how it got there. The player then charges it, wraps it back up into its box and goes back to bed. On Night 3, the player encounters the contents of an old nursery in the basement. In the corner sits the now-recalled Mama Tattletail, along with a cassette tape which can be played using the toy. The tape contains a snippet from a story in a read-along style - including prompts to \\"turn the page\\" - about how \\"the children thought that Mama would never find them as long as she couldn't see them\\" but Mama would find them nevertheless. The player returns upstairs to find that Tattletail has made a mess. Tattletail asks to be taken to ‚ÄúMama‚Äù. The player returns to the spot to find that Mama has disappeared. Mama Tattletail then starts to hunt down the player when they try to clean up after Tattletail. On Night 4, after a lengthy hide-and-seek session with another Tattletail, the player finds a VHS tape that shows several interchangeable camera feeds from what seems to be a Tattletail commercial (which is actually footage from the trailer). After some time, some of the camera feeds' names turn red, the lighting changes from blue to green and trash bags and obscured parts of inanimate or writhing human bodies appear. On Christmas Eve, Baby Talking Tattletail invites the player to the basement to join a \\"party\\" with a yellow and blue Baby Talking Tattletail, with two more that the player must fetch. After the player gets them, they must pick up their own Tattletail and get some supplies from upstairs. The player then finds out that the Talking Tattletails have made a pentagram out of the Christmas lights with the VHS tape in the middle, and have begun chanting in a seance. After rewinding the VHS tape, Mama appears and steals the candles and the player must find them in vases scattered around the basement while avoiding being attacked by Mama. Once the seance reaches its climax, the tape begins to levitate and the player must destroy it. The seance then ends and the player goes back to bed. Endings On Christmas Day, the ending of the game depends on whether the player has collected all 22 eggs laid out across the game: * Bad Ending: If the player fails to collect all 22 eggs, it takes longer to open the present, and Mama Tattletail‚Äôs chase theme will begin to play. The gift box‚Äôs bow comes off and the lid‚Äôs position is slightly altered. The player then has to attempt to open it again, only to find the gift box is empty. Mama Tattletail then jump scares the player (implying that the ritual failed), ending the game and rolling the credits. This ending was the original canon ending before the release of \\"The Gift\\" Update. * Good Ending: If the player manages to collect all 22 eggs, their present is revealed to be the same Baby Talking Tattletail the player received when opening it 5 days early. Tattletail will then proceed to give the player a series of gifts - its birth tag and a golden flashlight. The player will then need to open the door of their mother's room and wake her up, triggering a white screen. The game ends with the Talking Tattletail saying \\"Thank you\\" for the player (considering the protagonist cannot yet speak), along with the player's mother yawning. This ending is considered canon in the Kaleidoscope DLC. * Joke Ending: If the player falls out of the map with Tattletail in their hands, Tattletail will begin to glitch out and start saying that the player broke \\"it\\" (more commonly known as the game). The game then ends and the credits roll. Although technically this ending was a glitch, it was awarded soon by the Waygetter Company with its own Tattletail dialogue. This ending will result in returning to the main menu with no progress. The Kaleidoscope DLC In the free Kaleidoscope DLC, the player awakens on Christmas Day to find their present, a purple Baby Talking Tattletail. However, it looks slightly different, talks in a boring monotonous voice and then glitches out. At the front door, the player finds a package and an anonymous letter claiming that Tattletail \\"wasn't like this\\" and \\"this isn't how it happened at all\\". The player then gradually remembers one night back and has to play through each night again in reverse order with the events and circumstances of the nights being similar, except Mama is now a friendly and caring character. Each night \\"ends\\" with a letter explaining that something went wrong, and the final letter explains that a place called the Kaleidoscope, where all memories are stored, is what's causing the changes. The player is then offered the choice to either go back to bed or enter the dangerous Kaleidoscope; going to the Kaleidoscope results in the \\"good\\" ending in which the player will retrieve their memories; going to bed results in the \\"bad\\" ending in which Tattletail will stay boring forever. In the Kaleidoscope, the environment looks like a glitched, warped version of the house lit in a bluish tint. The player eventually finds a VHS tape with a letter saying that it must be played to restore the player's memories; it contains a slightly different version of the Tattletail TV advert with 2 glitches. Once the tape is played, night one is repeated, with Tattletail restored to its cheery self; and Mama restored to its aggressive self. As the player is about to wrap Tattletail back up, it tells a joke, but is interrupted by Mama and the player is transported back to the Kaleidoscope. The player must then traverse back to the entrance of the Kaleidoscope without being killed by Mama. After escaping, the player wakes up on Christmas Day again and opens the gift. Once it's open, Tattletail gives the player a present with a final letter that praises the player and tells the player to say Hi to Tattletail for them. Tattletail then tells another joke to the player by telling him \\"me love you!\\", ending the game.  Development  The game was published under the name of the in-universe fictional toy company named Waygetter Electronics. In reality, the team is led by game designer Ben Esposito, and consists of character designer/co-developer Geneva Hodgson along with lead programmer Tom Astle. Cartoonist Ryann Shannon also stars as the voice of Talking Tattletail.  Reception  The game has received criticism for its resemblance to the Five Nights at Freddy's series for featuring similar elements, including its visual aesthetic, five-day time limit, and animatronic-based antagonists. GameSpew's Chris Mc praised its more structured gameplay, as well as its reproduction of nineties childhood fears. The game has also received very positive reviews on Steam.  In popular culture  Tattletail made appearances on three episodes in the Annoying Orange YouTube series for ‚ÄúShocktober 2017.‚Äù Following the Let‚Äôs Play videos of the game on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel, Tattletail first made his debut on the episode, ‚ÄúAsk Orange #35: Shocktober Surprise!‚Äù when a fan made a comment about Pear looking like a Tattletail. The second appearance was made in the episode ‚ÄúAnnoying Orange vs. Tattletail‚Äù when Orange meets Tattletail who both disrupt and annoy an egg during quiet time in the kitchen from the game. Mama Tattletail makes her first appearance in the series as she appears with the same dialogue from the game, and ends up killing Egg as the scene cuts to black ending with Mama Tattletail saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you.‚Äù Tattletail made a brief appearance in the episode ‚ÄúTrick or Treat on Horror Street‚Äù as Orange and the gang go trick-or-treating on ‚ÄúHorror Street,‚Äù Tattletail appeared as Halloween treats each wrapped and placed in a bowl at the house from the game where Mama Tattletail jump scares Orange, Pear, and Little Apple (erroneously called Midget Apple), and captures Pears as she shouts ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me!‚Äù Mama is later joined by Freddy Fazbear, Ink Bendy from Bendy and the Ink Machine, and Mr. Peterson from Hello Neighbor to jump scare Little Apple, who all revealed to be Orange, Pear, Grapefruit, and Marshmallow teaching him to lay off the horror video games he had been playing.

The association was founded on 8 September 1978 in Arnhem as the Veganistenkring (\\"Vegan Circle\\"), the first organisation in the Netherlands of its kind. Shortly thereafter, its name was changed to Vereniging Veganisten Organisatie (\\"Association Vegans Organisation\\"), finally adopting its present name in 1987. The NVV's stated purpose is promoting a way of living, which is completely free from exploitation of animals, and advocating a healthy, wholly vegetable diet, to the benefit of human beings, animals, plant life and the environment. In the period 2012‚Äì2015, the association's membership tripled from almost 650 to 1891. At the start of the year 2017, the NVV had 2100 members.  Activities  The NVV publishes Vegan Magazine, which is also available for non-members, distributed in organic shops and elsewhere. Initially, the magazine was called V. Furthermore, the association holds the VeganChallenge twice a year, a free online programme in which participants try to follow a vegan diet for a month. The campaign 'Melk, je kan zonder!' (\\"Milk, you can do without!\\") was an NVV initiative as well. It also maintains the online platform Vegan Wiki, which provides product information and information about veganism, and awards the Vegan Friendly logo to companies that make above average efforts to take the concerns of vegans into account.. Moreover, the NVV is the main partner for Dutch companies who seek to apply for The Vegan Society's Vegan label for their products. The NVV distributes a newsletter and maintains a website, webshop and a Facebook page, and holds a general assembly every year. VegFest is an annual veganism fair, of which the NVV is one of the sponsors (NVV members pay half the entry fee). VegFest was held for the first time in November 2014 in the Martin Luther Church in Amsterdam, in November 2015 in the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht and in December 2016 as well.

Completed in 1986, the floor-to-ceiling glass facade building once stood alone on the western side of Brickell, which at the time was home to mostly office towers and older low- rise residential buildings. After two residential high-rise building booms, the first in the 2000s, concurrent with the 2000s real estate bubble, and the second in the 2010s, the building was virtually surrounded by taller buildings. Solitair Brickell required demolishing a parking ramp to the base of the building to the northeast, Brickell Heights was built directly adjacent to the east, and Nine at Mary Brickell Village was built directly to the south of the building. To the west, even West Brickell saw significant mid-rise development in the 2010s, such as the West Brickell View low income senior housing two blocks to the west. It is adjacent to the Brickell Metrorail and Metromover station. The building is also known as the Chase Building, naming rights for anchor tenant Chase Bank, which has a branch on the ground floor. It was once one of the tallest buildings in Miami, but by 2017 wouldn't even be in the top 100. The building was sold in 2013 for US$70 million.

The show covers top stories and current affairs in Pakistan. It airs every Monday to Friday at prime time from 10:00pm to 11:00pm PST, with repeat telecasts at 01:00am the following day. The show has been hosted by Aamir Liaquat since its establishment, until his resignation from the channel in November 2017. It was thereafter hosted by a character known as Mr. Qaum, who wears a V mask and directly addresses the audience. In April 2018, Liaquat re-joined the channel and continued his transmissions of the show. In 2019, Aamir Liaquat again left the channel and joined the Geo network. Liaquat has called out and prominently criticized several Pakistani liberal and leftist personalities on his show for their political and ideological views. One such focus of attention was Tarek Fatah, one of the staunchest critics of Pakistan. The two were later involved in a Twitter feud.. He resigned from BOL News during his live show Aisay Nahi Chalay Ga. Controversies On 26 January 2017, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) ordered a suspension of Liaquat's show over \\"hate speech\\". The media watchdog's notification stated that Liaquat had aired during his show, from 2 January to 24 January, allegations comprising derogatory remarks, incitement to violence, casting of aspersions, and accusations of anti-state or anti-religious activities against various individuals. The suspension came after Liaquat had lashed out at some civil society activists on his show for blaming the country's intelligence agencies over the disappearance of five online bloggers, who were accused of hosting blasphemous posts or content critical of the military on their pages. However, the Sindh High Court granted a stay order against PEMRA's decision and allowed Liaquat to continue his broadcasts until a verdict was issued on the matter. The Supreme Court then directed Bol to cease airing the show or face contempt of court charges, and Bol agreed to follow the court's order. Later, the Islamabad High Court overturned PEMRA's ban, allowing the show to continue its transmission on 28 February. Amnesty International criticised the Pakistani government over its purported inaction, terming the show's content a \\"smear campaign\\" against human rights and civil society activists. During the suspension, the show was renamed to \\"Qaum Kay Saath Aisay Nahi Chalay Ga\\". It featured a dummy cartoon disguised in a Fawkes mask who talked to the audience in a robotic voice-over. The show was reverted to its original name and format when Aamir Liaquat was reinstated as host. However, following Liaquat's resignation from the channel in November 2017, the character was reinstated under the name \\"Mr. Qaum\\". By April 2018, Aamir Liaquat re-joined the show as its host after he returned to Bol News.

Scientific contributions  Superplasticity  The first comprehensive treatment of the subject ‚ÄòSuperplasticity‚Äô was authored by Padmanabhan and G.J. Davies, which was published in 1980 by Springer Verlag. In 2012, it was identified as one of about 40 books out of a few thousand books published by Springer-Verlag during 1843 ‚Äì 2005 (163 Years) and published in both print and e-book form. Two other books on the same subject, ‚ÄòSuperplastic Flow: Phenomenology and Mechanics‚Äô and ‚ÄòSuperplasticity: Common Basis for a Near-Ubiquitous Phenomenon‚Äô were also published in 2001 and 2018. Additionally, Padmanabhan has contributed 6 book chapters and more than 280 research publications, with a majority on Superplasticity.  Mechanical processing  A procedure for the superplastic forming of hemispherical domes of Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) was developed by Padmanabhan for the Integrated Missiles Technology Program of the Defense R&D; Laboratory, Government of India. He developed a multi-stage closed die forging technology for the production of undercarriage base plate fitting component for the air frame of high- performance (supersonic) Aircraft for the Indian Aeronautical Development Agency(Aeronautical Development Agency).  Materials development  Padmanabhan developed for the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), an alloy equivalent to AFNOR 7020 alloy (a French alloy) for use as construction material for water tankages. The technology was transferred to an ordnance factory for productionization. The development of an austenitic steel having only 1% nickel for the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) was successfully completed and today nearly 800,000 tonnes of this grade of steel is made by Indian industries.  Materials plasticity under different loading conditions  His work for the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was mainly concerned with the physical and mechanical metallurgy aspects (deformation, fracture, stress corrosion cracking and low cycle fatigue) of AISI 304, 304 LN, 316 and 316 LN austenitic stainless steels and an improved grade D9, all construction materials for the Fast Breeder Reactor program. He was a consultant to the R & D Centre for Iron and Steel, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), when they produced for the first time in the country both Extra Deep Drawing (EDD) and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) grades of steel. He was a consultant to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (now known as Tata Motors) when they introduced the micro-alloyed ferrite - pearlite steel (first generation), 49MnVS3, for the first time in India for the forging of crankshafts.  Basic research and nanostructured materials  Padmanabhan proposed a new concept ‚Äòmesoscopic grain boundary sliding‚Äô for explaining the origins of the phenomenon of Superplasticity (K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf 1996). K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf (1996): A Model for Grain Boundary Sliding and its Relevance to Optimal Structural Superplasticity: 1. Theory. In Mater. Sci. Technol., 12, pp. 391‚Äì399., (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) K. A. Padmanabhan and H.

Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559‚Äì571.. His model for grain boundary sliding and its application to superplastic flow in micro- crystalline metallic materials and ceramics questioned the dominant idea of the time in high-temperature deformation modelling that Grain Boundary Sliding is an inherently fast process, which at no stage could be controlling the rate of high-temperature deformation (K. A. Padmanabhan 2009) K. A. Padmanabhan (2009): Grain Boundary Sliding Controlled Flow and its Relevance to Superplasticity in Metals, Alloys, Ceramics and Intermetallics and Strain-Rate Dependent Flow in Nanostructured Materials.

Raviathul Basariya (2019): A theory of steady state structural superplasticity in different classes of materials. A materials- agnostic analysis. In Materials Science & Engineering A (744), pp. 704‚Äì715.. His model for inverse Hall-Petch effect in nano-crystalline and quasi- crystalline materials extends the ideas contained in the above model to explain why when the grain size in a nano-crystalline material goes below a value ~ 10-15 nm, there is grain size softening, rather than the usual increase in hardness with decreasing grain size. At the international conference on \\"Severe plastic deformation\\" held in Russia in 2011 this paper of 1997 was named the most significant publication in this area (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559‚Äì571. , (K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P. Dinda, H.

Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28‚Äì38. . His model with H. Gleiter extends the above ideas to cover superplastic deformation in metals and ceramics of micro-crystalline, sub-micron and nano-crystalline grain sizes. Using Herring's equation a physical justification is given for mesoscopic boundary sliding/plane interface formation using the minimization of the total free energy as the key criterion. This paper was described by Nature Materials as a \\"break-through from India\\" (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28‚Äì38. .

One of the first agricultural researchers in pre-state Israel, she studied methods for industrial processing of fruits and vegetables, canning, and food infestation. Her research was published in numerous peer-reviewed journals. She was director of the Department of Food Technology at the Agricultural Research Station (Volcani Center) in Rehovot from the early 1950s to 1969. Early life and education Zdenka (Devorah) Kohn was born in Prague to Otto and Vilma Kohn. Active in the Zionist youth movement, she immigrated to Palestine in 1924. In 1926 she and her husband, Moshe Rudolf Samish, also a Czech native, went to California to complete their degrees at UC Davis and UC Berkeley. She received her B.S. in 1931 at UC Davis and her M.A. in household science in 1933 at UC Berkeley; her masters thesis was on \\"The Effect of Excess Viosterol and of Parathyroid Extract upon the Tissues of Rats\\". Career In 1934 the couple returned to Palestine and she began working as a chemist at a fruit canning factory in Rehovot. In 1937 she joined the experimental research station in that city, and in 1946 was named director of the laboratory for canned fruits and vegetables. In 1949 she became an instructor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Faculty of Agriculture in Rehovot on the subject of food technology. After 1951 she became director of food technology at the Agricultural Research Station in Rehovot. Research In 1946 Samish received a grant from the Mandatory government to develop methods for producing juices and concentrates from citrus fruits. In 1947 she received a U.S. patent for the manufacture of dried citrus fruit paste (fruit leather). Other research projects included a joint U.S.-Israeli study of microorganisms found in fruit and vegetable pulp; techniques for squeezing olives and producing olive oil; tomato paste production; industrial processing of potatoes and peaches; and freezing and dehydrating vegetables. Her research on \\"bloaters\\" ‚Äì cucumbers that float to the surface instead of staying in the brine during the pickling process ‚Äì was reported in the U.S. publications Science News and Organic Gardening and Farming. Samish served as a consultant on planning committees for food production and helped draw up standards for food products in institutions in Israel and abroad. She also introduced the subject of canning to agricultural schools in Israel. Although she retired in 1969, she continued her research at the Volcani Center for several more years. She was appointed as an official representative of the Ministry of Agriculture's Fruit Council in 1979. Awards and honors In 1992 she was honored as a Worthy Agricultural Researcher () for being one of the first agricultural researchers in pre-state Israel. In 1996 she was honored as a Worthy Citizen of the City of Rehovot. Personal life She and her husband, Moshe Rudolf Samish, PhD (1904‚Äì1975), had two sons. He worked in the experimental research station in Rehovot in the area of plantations, as director of the Division of Pomology and Viticulture at the Agricultural Research Station (Volcani Center), and as a professor in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Faculty of Agriculture in Rehovot. Zdenka Samish died on March 8, 2008, less than a week shy of her 104th birthday, and was buried beside her husband in the Rehovot Old Cemetery.

The last noble family, which originated from the kindred, became extinct in 1849. Origins According to the fourteenth-century chronicle composition, the Hah√≥t kindred descended from the Counts of Orlam√ºnde, arriving to Hungary in the 1160s upon the invitation of Stephen III to help to defeat the rebelled Cs√°k kindred. The first member of the clan was Hahold (Hah√≥t), who suppressed the rebellion with his soldiers. The chronicle says Stephen, who invited the Hah√≥ts, was a son of B√©la II, which description fits to Stephen III's uncle, Anti-king Stephen IV. However both historians J√°nos Kar√°csonyi and Elem√©r M√°lyusz argued, the Hah√≥ts took part in the defeat of the rebellious Stephen IV in 1163, who took assistance from some clans, includings Cs√°ks, in addition to the Byzantine Empire. Historian Endre T√≥th considers the Hah√≥ts' settlement and defeating the Cs√°ks as two separate events, and the latter one only marked the Hah√≥ts' first prominent presence in national politics. Simon of K√©za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum referred to the Hah√≥t kindred as \\"Buzad autem generatio de Mesn originem trahit, nobiles de districtu Wircburg\\". Kar√°csonyi identified Wircburg as Marburg in March of Styria (today Maribor, Slovenia), while Mesn was identical with the nearby Messendorf, he claimed. M√°lyusz identified the two geographical names with Wartburg and Meissen in Thuringia (Margravate of Meissen), noting that none of them were part of the estates of the House of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, which ruled Meissen from 1046 to 1067. Endre T√≥th tried to reconstruct the origin of the kindred based on the spread of the name Hahold in German-speaking areas. Near Freising, the name was relatively frequently used since the 8th century, in addition, it appeared altogether with the name Arnold in the 13th century, which was also used for four generations in the Hah√≥t kindred. Seats and possessions Following Stephen III's victory, Hahold received land donations and settled down in Zala County near the Austrian border. By the 13th century, his kindred possessed the most extensive estate in the county, along the rivers Kerka and Ledava, and in Prekmurje (today in Slovenia). In the early period, the family seat was Hah√≥t, which was named after the kindred, between rivers Kanizsa and P√∂l√∂ske. In 1192, Hahold II bought lands in Als√≥lendva (today Lendava, Slovenia) and in the surrounding areas (Ven√©ce). His brother Buz√°d I was mentioned as a onetime owner of √öjudvar, also in Zala County, by a royal charter of B√©la III of Hungary, when he donated the estate to the Feh√©rv√°r monastery. Archaeologist L√°szl√≥ V√°ndor argued Hahold I was granted his coherent and extensive possession from a crown land after the cessation of the \\"gyep≈±\\" border system. Accordingly, the Hah√≥ts' first lands were part of the so-called \\"gyep≈±elve\\", a mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited area beyond the Austrian border, comparable to the modern buffer zones. V√°ndor considered √öjudvar (Nova Curia), where stone buildings, churches, monasteries were excavated, was the centre of this territory until the donation. ƒåakovec in Croatia) By the 1230s, Buz√°d I's son Arnold I founded the kindred's monastery at Hah√≥t, the namesake seat of his family, dedicated to Margaret of Antioch. Archaeologists argued the Hah√≥ts erected their monastery on a basis of a royal convent founded by Ladislaus I of Hungary. However, in fact, the Hah√≥t monastery was only a common burial place among the Hah√≥t clan, as its branches moved away from each other by then. In 1248, Michael I of the Hahold branch founded a Franciscan friary in Szemenye (today in Muraszemenye), also dedicated to Mary the Virgin. Later the B√°nfi de Als√≥lendva family, descendants of the Hah√≥t kindred through his brother Hahold III, became patron of the monastery. One of the members of the more powerful Buz√°d branch, Atyusz (or Cs√°k I) erected a Premonstratensian monastery at Rajk around 1270. Possibly it was Arnold II of the Arnold branch who built the castles of P√∂l√∂ske and Sztrig√≥ (today ≈†trigova, Croatia) in Zala County in the 1240s, after B√©la IV of Hungary abandoned the ancient royal prerogative to build and own castles in response to the Mongol invasion. After the 1270s the gradually marginalized Arnold branch, resided on the western part of the Hah√≥t basin, lost the ownership of P√∂l√∂ske and Sztrig√≥ against Ottokar II of Bohemia then the increasing powerful K≈ëszegi family. Nicholas III also owned Purbach () in Sopron County, but after his rebellion in 1270, Stephen V of Hungary confiscated the castle and donated to his loyal soldier Panyit Miskolc. Until confiscation, Nick was also a property of Panyit Hah√≥t. In Somogy County, the branch possessed Sukor√≥, M√≥richely, Oszi√°gy, Surd and K√°konya. For a time, James also owned K√°lm√°ncsa and Dobsza, formerly queenly estates. Als√≥lendva Castle (today Lendava in Slovenia) By 1251, sons of Blessed Buz√°d (Buz√°d branch) built their own timber fortifications ‚Äì Buz√°dtornya, Cs√°ktornya, Teresty√©ntornya and Lankr√©dtornya (lit. Buz√°d's Tower, Cs√°k's Tower, Tristan's Tower and Lancelot's Tower, respectively). Among them only Cs√°ktornya (today ƒåakovec, Croatia) survived the following centuries. Ottokar's army captured all castles in the early 1270s, causing the Buz√°d branch's move into Center Zala. The eldest son Buz√°d III also inherited Buz√°dsziget and Szabar from his father who entered the Dominican Order. His son Atyusz resided in Szabar and thus became ancestor of the Szabari family. Cs√°k I's branch settled down in Cs√°ny after Ottokar's invasion ‚Äì their descendants, the Cs√°nyi family originated from there. After a praefectio in filium by his father Nicholas V in 1365, Klara, a descendant of Buz√°d IV (son of Cs√°k I) granted the village of Buz√°dsziget, while its fort was already demolished by then. Following that Klara mortgaged the estate to her husband John Koltai and his brother George. Tristan's branch became extinct after a generation. Herbord, son of Lancelot, owned Falkos and S√∂jt√∂r, his descendants were frequently named after both villages. The Lancelot branch also owned Szombathely, Podturen, Belica among others once a long time ago. After his victorious unification war, Charles I of Hungary donated the liberated and formerly Hah√≥t-owned estates to the emerging Lackfi family. Descendants of the Buz√°d branch (the Szabaris, Cs√°nyis and S√∂jt√∂ris through the lineage of Buz√°d III, Cs√°k I and Lancelot, respectively) unsuccessfully attempted to regain their former possessions on the occasion of a lawsuit lasted from 1351 until 1376. Hahold IV of the Hahold branch called himself \\"Lord of Als√≥lendva\\" (today Lendava, Slovenia) in 1272, proving that he owned and possibly built the castle himself by then. The K≈ëszegis captured their castle around 1314, but Nicholas VII regained that in 1323. The Hahold branch owned villages and estates mostly the territory of today Slovenia. Nicholas VII received numerous land donations surrounding Als√≥lendva Castle, which became the domain of the B√°nfi de Als√≥lendva family. Notable members Hahold I :Ancestor and founder of the clan, a mercenary knight from Thuringia (possibly related to the Counts of Orlam√ºnde), who was invited by King Stephen III against his uncle, Stephen IV, who contested his realm in 1163. Hahold's army defeated the Cs√°k forces, who fought for the rebellious anti-king. After the internal war, he received land donations (e.g. Hah√≥t, P√∂l√∂ske) and settled down in Zala County. According to 18th-century archivist J√°nos Schenk, Hahold was granted the village of Lenti (Nempti) in 1172. Buz√°d I (died 1192) :Son of Hahold I. Being ancestor of the Arnold and Buz√°d branches, he died by 1192. Hahold II (fl. 1192) :Son of Hahold I.

Artificial regeneration, carried out through seeding or planting, typically involves transferring forest reproductive material to a particular site from other locations while natural regeneration relies on genetic material that is already available on the site. Technical opportunities and challenges to ensure quality and quantity of forest reproductive material can be found in the activities of identification, selection, procurement, propagation, conservation, improvement and sustained production of reproductive material. The use of low quality or poorly adapted forest reproductive material can have very negative impact on the vitality and resilience of a forest. In Europe, much of the material used for artificial regeneration is produced and transferred within a single country. However, forest reproductive material, usually in the form of seeds or cuttings, is increasingly traded across national borders, especially within the European Union. Forest reproductive material and climate changes As a result of climate changes, leading to increasing temperatures, some parts of the current distribution ranges of forest trees are expected to become unsuitable while new areas may become suitable for many species in higher latitudes or altitudes. This will most likely increase the future demand for imported forest reproductive material as forest managers and owners try to identify tree species and provenances that will be able to grow in their land under new climatic conditions. Especially, forest reproductive material with high plasticity will be increasingly useful for this purpose. References External links *Use of forest reproductive material.

V. Petersen (1914‚Äì1987) was an Afrikaans-language South African poet and author, educator and founding principal of the High School Spes Bona in Athlone, Cape Town. He was the first person of colour whose poetry and prose were published in South Africa. Life and Work Sydney Vernon Petersen was born on 22 June 1914 in Riversdale, a town in the south of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. He was the second child in a family of five children, of which all five later became teachers. His father was a saddler and harness maker, his mother a homemaker. Motivated mainly by their mother all of the children obtained, at least, their degree in Education. Petersen visited the local Berlin Mission School until 1926, completing his schooling in Cape Town at the Trafalgar High School. He excelled in athletics and sports throughout his student days. During his final year in high school a pastor, Reverend Kohl of the Lutheran Mission Church, he felt, had a particularly good influence on his personal development.Article by Erika Terblanche SV Petersen (1914‚Äì1987) 2008-12-15, https://archive.today/20130424005528/http://www.argief.litnet.co.za/cgi- bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&cause;_id=1270&news;_id=57677&cat;_id=284#selection-339.1-339.16 Retrieved 26 May 2018 At this time there were very limited opportunities for children of colour to obtain a proper schooling (in 1929 only around 600 children were enrolled in high school within the Union of South Africa) and it was a great achievement, despite these limitations, for him to obtain such results,Hein Willemse in an article in Tydskrif vir Letterkunde‚Äô‚Äô, January 2010 (Vol 47 no.2) http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid;=S0041-476X2010000200003 made possible through his strong personal drive and the support of his parents and people like Reverend Kohl. As a young child, he made daily deliveries of bread and as a teenager did manual labour for a living and contribute to its training costs. On completing school, he studied at the Battswood Training College, Wynberg, where he qualified as a teacher in 1933. His first teaching post was in Ladismith in the Cape Province. Two years later he was back in Cape Town teaching at the Berlin Mission School in Searle Street District Six. He began attending evening classes at the University of Cape Town for his bachelor's degree with majors in Afrikaans, English and Mathematics, befriending the Afrikaans poet I.D. du Plessis. On graduating in 1940 he obtained the University Medal for Afrikaans. Later he obtained a BEd degree from the same university. As a teacher, he served from 1939 as an assistant in the secondary school Battswood, while lecturing in the Training College Battswood and from 1945 as head of the same institution's primary school. In January 1947, he founded the Athlone High School where he remained principal until his retirement in 1974. After his retirement, he accepted a temporary post in the Department of Education at the Hewat Education College in Crawford and in 1981 he lectured at the Teacher Training College in Bellville, where he was employed until 1983. His wife, Mavis, was also a teacher and the couple had a son, Sydney, named after his father. In 1959 Petersen was appointed a member of the US ‚Äì SA leadership program and travelled with his family to America, where he lectured at several university colleges in New York and Chicago. His hosts noticed he was writing his reports by hand, so the bought him a typewriter, with which he wrote for the rest of his life. He travelled to Ghana, Israel, Greece and Turkey. In April 1960, he spent a year abroad as a guest of the Dutch-South African Society. From 1969 on he was also invited by the governments of Germany and the Netherlands to visit educational centres in these countries. In 1982 he was appointed to the advisory board of the SABC He died of kidney failure in Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town on 30 October 1987. The Writer Already in primary school he started to write prose in addition to poetry. After 1940, short stories and sketches appeared in ‚Äò‚ÄôNaweek‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äô‚ÄôSuid-Afrika‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äô‚ÄôDie Huisgenoot‚Äô‚Äô and Tydskrif vir Letterkunde. His short stories Repos ailleurs and Kaapstad are included in the volume Gese√´nd is julle (Blessed Are You), edited by S. J. Malan and W.H. Vos. The short story Verbode vrugte (Forbidden Fruit), was published in 1943 in Die Naweek and included by Daniel Hugo in his collection Tydskrif 2. Its theme of racially mixed marriage, dealt with in rather more jovial than confrontational fashion, was daring for the time. From the same period dates the novel As die Son Ondergaan (When the Sun Goes Down), a story about the demise of a young brown man (Frans) in the city. The gifted young man, unable to realise his ambition to become a teacher, left his home in the countryside for city, hoping to get a paying job. He is swallowed up in the urban industrial machine and makes friends with the wrong crowd of people. His morality undermined by drinking and sex, he marries a flighty young woman, Karolien. Deserted by his so-called friends and his wife, he is given over to drink. Then his parents come for him. By returning to his old, familiar environment he can at last, overcome his spiritual crisis. For the first time in African literature, the race issue is here addressed from the point of view of people of colour, the emotional impact emphasised. This problem, however, remains largely in the background, the destruction and preservation of the protagonist representing not a symbolic example of the coloured people's struggle, but rather a more universally human development. The novel shows a far more nuanced characterization than the stereotyping of so many previous writers. In 1946 As die Son Ondergaan was awarded the prize in a nationwide contest of prose writing offered by the magazine Kern a part of the Unie-Volkspers. Along with PJ Philander he authored school textbooks for geography and history. However, it is his poems that make the greatest contribution to Afrikaans literature. In his work, the brown people, with their varied feelings of resistance and resignation, receive for the first time, their own voice in African literature. His writing style initially draws more on the older poets and their national type of verse, rather than the Dertigers or Viertigers (Afrikaans poets of the thirties and forties) with their more personal issues. Many verses in his early collections are impressive in their simplicity and dramatic impact through the use of dialogue. In tone wry and bitter and filled with deep emotion, presented however, in a naturally sober and direct manner. Yet the technique in these poems still largely stems from the generation before the thirties. Die Enkeling (The individual) makes its impact more through the authenticity of feeling about the suffering of coloured people, than the quality of the poems, which technically, are not yet truly poetry. It is especially the poignant poem Bede (Prayer) that revolts against \\"the accursed penalty of a dark skin\\" and concludes with the speaker praying for the fortitude to accept his fate, should this indeed be God's will. Opstand (Revolt) describes far more how difficult it is to acquiesce and be silent. In Roepende stemme (Calling voices) a chorus cries out, questioning how long the oppression will continue, each commentator responding by placing the calls within a greater reality. Die arbeider (The labourer) is a largely successful portrayal of a human character. A poem like Die vreemde (The stranger) is typifies the protest and resentment caused by the inferior position coloured people hold within society, while the theme of Drinklied (Drinking song) speaks of trying to escape reality through alcohol. In a second edition, he omits a number of his more youthful verses ‚Äì Worsteling, Vergewe... Vergeet? , Elegie and Die winterwind ‚Äì but makes no further changes. Die stil kind (The quiet child)Grov√©, A.P. Standpunte Jaargang 4, no.2, 1949 evinces considerable artistic progress, with the tone of the poems less harsh. As its title states, the dreaming child is portrayed as a lonely individual, while verses describe with deep emotion the ravaged victims of poverty. Riversdal shows nine women who wash white people's clothes by the river, with word and rhythm used to great effect. ‚Äò‚ÄôVoorteken‚Äô‚Äô (Pre-ordained) outlines the loneliness of the coloured people, knowing that their life is doomed to heavy labour and unfulfilment. ‚Äò‚ÄôMotorrit (Road trip) expresses the sense of release when the narrator in his car leaves the city behind him, free in the speed of the car and the presence of nature, while Rondebosch likewise depicts the freedom of nature. Die loper (The runner) portrays the struggle of the intellectual coloured man, and Slotsom (Conclusion) concludes that, in death, no difference between the races exists. After a long hiatus, Petersen began publishing again after 1960 with Die kinders van Kain (The Children of Cain), Suiderkruis (Southern Cross), Nag is verby (Night is over) and Laat kom dan die wind (Late the Wind Then Comes). The finest verses in these collections wittily portray city types, while those of resistance against racial discrimination resound far more powerfully.Antonissen, Rob \\"Standpunte\\", Nuwe reeks 32, Desember 1960 The title Die kinders van KainAntonissen, Rob Kern en tooi Nasou Beperk Eerste uitgawe Eerste druk Elsiesrivier 1963 immediately points to those excluded from the rest of society. The collection reflects the progress of his first two books and in depicting the provocation, the melancholy and loneliness of the brown people and can be seen as an important milestone in African poetry. The statement of most of the poems is sober and less desperate, while a larger number a number contain a transcendent purity. Beautiful poems include Kinders van Kain (where the fate of those kicked out is contrasted with the promise of the New Day); Die drumpel (The threshold), in which the harsh manner in which coloured people are treated is challenged by an accusation that, as a racial group, they originated from the immoral behaviour of white pioneers; Kinderland (Childhood), with its melancholy about the utterly lost dreams of childhood; and Die veles (The many) follows the path of common people through life in rather a witty manner. Bergies (Mountain dwellers) is also noteworthy, with its witty imagery of this marginalised sector of society, while Windermere touches the social needs of the people. Kaapse naweek describes the superficial lifestyle of revellers. Die toring Babel (The Tower of Babel) makes of discrimination not simply a local but a universal issue, while Kamee (Cameo) portrays the cheerfulness of the brown woman in the midst of her suffering. Suiderkruis,Antonissen, Rob Standpunte Nuwe reeks 66, Augustus 1966 in two sections, contains poems about of the memories of a youth in the rural areas. on the one hand and events within the contemporary urban environment on the other. Each section ends with a suite of five poems, Ballade ‚Äì a series about the \\"platteland\\", the countryside, and one on the \\"Confession of the city dweller\\" showing the contrasts in the feeling of freedom. Memories of country life find expression in poignant poetic memoirs such as Tuiskoms (Homecoming) and Sekelgat, where former joys are played off against the sadness of remembrance. Well portrayed are also the marginalised of the city, Koerante-verkopertjie (News vendor) and Die doofstomme (The deaf-mute). Alleenstryd (\\"Single combat\\" or \\"the lonely struggle\\")Cloete, T.T. Tydskrif vir Letterkunde, Nuwe reeks 18 no. 2, Mei 1980 is a label he himself finds appropriate for poetry up to that point.Cloete, T.T. \\"Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe\\" Jaargang 20 no. 2, Junie 1980 It fits the loneliness and the life struggles to which his poems give voice, characterised in the progression from rural nature verses to the more realistically-oriented poems of city life.

Tydskrif vir Letterkunde Nuwe reeks 19 no. 2, Mei 1981 deals with how the question of skin colour can dominate one's judgements on the value and dignity of the human being,Cilliers-Preller, Rika Die Transvaler 12 Januarie 1981 and the search for one's own identity in trying to find the sense of security that was present in the parental home. .Cloete, T.T. Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe Jaargang 21 no. 2, Junie 1981 The collection includes poems of resistance, landscape poetry, poems of remembrance and travel, the latter inspired by journeys both at home and abroad.Nienaber, C.J.M. Beeld 17 November 1980 The title reflects a optimistic outlook, a move away from a situation of frustration to one of greater hope and equality, which is also reflected in the content of the poems. The title poem develops a prophetic vision of human freedom. Noteworthy poems are Stadsmens (City dweller), depicting the hand-to- mouth existence of this group; Kaapse Vlak (Cape Flats) about the violent death of a young boy; and Landelik (Rural), beautiful images from this carefree and simple world. There are also several memory verses, the best of them, Drie dromertjies (Three little drummers), Die witborskraai (The pied crow) and Sekelmaan (The sickle moon). His last collectionBrink, Andr√© P. \\"Rapport\\" 23 Maart 1986 Laat kom dan die wind, received generally negative criticism. It includes poems of travel, childhood memories, longings for a bygone way of life and images of city personages. In 1962 he published in the Netherlands a collection of English verses or aphorisms, Meditations on the brink: dedicated with reverence to the life-work of Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven, based largely on the anthroposophical theories of Rudolf Steiner. It is his only such publication in English, speaks of his meeting with Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven and describes insights he gained through him. This he re-published under his own name in South Africa in 1980. In 1967, Dr. W.H. Vos compiled a volume, Keurverse (Selected poems) from the poetry of Petersen and PJ Philander. His poems are included in several anthologies, including Groot verseboek, Die Afrikaanse po√´sie in ‚Äôn duisend en enkele gedigte, Digterstemme, Afrikaanse verse, Uit ons digkuns, Uit ons letterkunde, Digters en digkuns, Die junior digbundel, Woordpaljas, My Afrikaanse verseboek, Die goue vreugde, Voorspraak en Junior verseboek, also providing a poem for the collection Verse vir Opperman. He also published poems in magazines such as Standpunte en Tydskrif vir Letterkunde.  Tributes In 1950 the SABC dedicated an episode of Ons skrywers en digters aan die woord (Our writers and poets of the word) to his work. The South African Academy for Science and Art in 1959 awarded him a medal of honour for his contribution to Afrikaans culture and he received the Crown Medal for his educational work. In 1977, he was proposed for membership of the South African Academy for Science and Art, but the Academy took so long to come to a decision that seven members resigned in protest. When the Academy finally approached him to become a member, he turned this down due to ill health. In 1982 the State President awarded him the Decoration for Meritorious Service and in 1986 he was elected a member of the Society of Dutch Literature in Leiden in the Netherlands. Shortly after his death, he was declared honorary citizen of his native village Riversdale, together with Alba Bouwer and Dalene Matthee. A radio play about him was compiled by Chris Swanepoel under the title Kind van die dal (Child of the valley) and broadcast on the South African Broadcasting Corporation's Afrikaans Service in 1989. The composer Hendrik Hofmeyr set to music two of his poems in 1997, Kinderland and Die veles from the volume Die kinders van Kain and in 2005 further songs set to music by Hofmeyr were sung at the \\"Woordfees \\"(Festival of the Word) in Stellenbosch.

He was persecuted as a half-Jew (Mischling) in the National Socialism period, and had to emigrate as young man.  Life  Vordtriede cames from a rich family. Born in Bielefeld, he moved because of the First World War and the early divorce of his parents, 1922 to Todtmoos in the Black Forest and in 1923 to Freiburg im Breisgau. As from 1926, Werner grew up with his sister Fr√§nze and their mother K√§the Vordtriede. K√§the Vortriede was to become famous as a journalist in post-war Germany, and Fr√§nze Vortriede well known as a writer and professor. He was already interested at an early age, in German literature and corresponded frequently with literary greats like Kurt Tucholsky or Arthur Schnitzler.  Emigration and career  After the Nazis came to power, he emigrated to Switzerland in 1933 and to the United States later. He began his studies in Zurich and worked part-time as a house teacher. Meanwhile, he wrote articles and book reviews for the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, using several pseudonyms because of prohibition of work. He earned his PhD and taught French and German Literature at various universities, including Princeton University and University of Wisconsin-Madison. During a journey to Europe, Vordtriede was surprised by the outbreak of the Second World War and interned as an Enemy alien in occupied France. By interventions, he became free months later and was allowed to go back to America. He met his mother in New York City late in 1941, who also emigrated to the USA.

Early life Born in 1804, Edward Chapman was one of nine children in a family of six sons and three daughters of Thomas Chapman (1771‚Äì1833), a Richmond solicitor and his wife, Sophia (n√©e Barrett, c.1776-1852). While his brothers followed careers in the Law, medicine, surveying, and engineering, Edward Chapman had ‚Äúa taste for books, and a meditative, studious mind, and with books he chose to make his life‚Äù.Arthur Waugh, A Hundred Years of Publishing: Being the Story of Chapman & Hall, Ltd., Chapman & Hall, Ltd, London (1930) p. 4 With William Hall (1800-1847) he founded a bookselling and publishing business at 186 Strand, London in 1830, having bought out a small journal called Chat Of The Week. Chapman is thought to have had the literary skills to be able to spot a saleable book while Hall had the business acumen to sell it. John Sutherland, The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction, Routledge (2013) - Google Books According to Robert L. Patten by 1835 they were publishing illustrated fiction and magazines issued weekly or monthly. Arthur Waugh, later the Chairman of Chapman & Hall, described Chapman as \\"a quiet and retiring man.... full of information, and had such a broad, just mind that it was a great privilege to hear his judgment upon any subject.\\"Edward Chapman on Spartacus Educational Charles Dickens Chapman & Hall published Charles Dickens for much of his career In 1835 Chapman and Hall published Squib Annual of Poetry, Politics, and Personalities by the illustrator Robert Seymour. In 1836 Seymour proposed to William Hall that Chapman & Hall should publish a series of sporting illustrations by Seymour with short written sketches linking them together in some way. Further he developed the idea of a 'Nimrod Club' of sporting people having adventures as the framework for the sketches and illustrations. Chapman agreed that the work should be issued in monthly parts, with descriptive text by Charles Dickens. However, Dickens, then only 22, was not the first choice as writer. Charles Whitehead, the senior editor in the publishing house, did not have time to complete the work so recommended Dickens on the basis of his recently published and successful Sketches by Boz, also in a monthly periodical format. Eventually, this became The Pickwick Papers, and concerned the adventures of Samuel Pickwick and his friends. In May 1837 The Pickwick Papers sold over 20,000 copies and Hall sent Dickens a cheque for ¬£500 as a bonus above the agreed payment. By the end of its monthly publications Pickwick was selling over 40,000 copies a month and Dickens received a further ¬£2,000 bonus with Chapman & Hall making about ¬£14,000 from the publication. Marriage Chapman died at Elm Lodge in Hitchin in 1880 When visiting his uncle Michael Chapman in Cork Street in Hitchin in Hertfordshire Chapman noticed Mary Whiting (c.1814-1875), the daughter of his uncle's neighbour in her garden. He fell in love with her, but coming from a strict Quaker family she was forbidden to communicate with him. Chapman therefore drilled a hole through a wall into the neighbours' spare bedroom through which he passed notes and talked to her. Returning his feelings and refusing to submit to her parents' authority Mary Whiting left her home and went to her brother Thomas Whiting's house in Leeds, where she and Chapman were married on 22 September 1841.Delphi Dickensiana Volume I, Delphi Classics (2012) Google BooksWest Yorkshire, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1813-1935 for Mary Whiting - Ancestry.com In 1842 they moved into a house on the Old Brompton Road where they had three children: Margaret ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù Sophia (afterwards Simpson, later Gaye, 1842‚Äì1933), Florence (afterwards Roeder, b. 1845), and Reginald Forster (b. 1849). Also in 1841 he hired his 18-year-old cousin Frederic Chapman (1823‚Äì95) as a clerk. Edward Chapman's relationship with Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning began in 1848 when, like Thomas Carlyle and Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Robert Browning's works were brought to Chapman & Hall by his friend John Forster.Robert Browning letter to Frederick Locker, 20 February 1874, ms at Armstrong Browning Library, Baylor University, Waco, Texas Later career Chapman's grave in Hitchin Cemetery Chapman's daughter Meta recalled in her eighty-eighth year that she ‚Äòused to wonder what he did at the office as when ever Mama took me to 193 Piccadilly, Papa was standing with his back to the fire‚Äô.Waugh, p. 4 On the death of Edward Hall in 1847 Chapman's cousin Frederic Chapman began his progress through the ranks of the company and eventually becoming a partner in 1858 and sole proprietor on Edward Chapman's retirement from Chapman & Hall in 1866. He spent the next decade travelling throughout Europe before his poor health forced him to return to his home at Royal Tunbridge Wells before moving to Elm Lodge in Hitchin in Hertfordshire, where he and his wife had family.

The work was dedicated to Mme Fernand Allard. This cycle was premiered in concert on 2 May 1926, salle des Agriculteurs8 in the 9th arrondissement of Paris,Correspondance 1910-1963, p. 269 by Pierre Bernac, as a 26-year-old baritone virtually unknown, and Francis Poulenc, 27 years old, as the pianist. It was the memory of this first collaboration that would bring together Poulenc and Bernac several years later for many international tours, from 1934 to 1959.  Composition of the cycle  The titles of the eight pieces, of which the tempi alternate quick and slow movements, are as follow: # La Ma√Ætresse volage ‚Äì Rondement # Chanson √† boire ‚Äì Adagio # Madrigal ‚Äì Tr√®s d√©cid√© # Invocation aux Parques ‚Äì Grave # Couplets bachiques ‚Äì Tr√®s anim√© # L'Offrande ‚Äì Mod√©r√© # La Belle Jeunesse ‚Äì Tr√®s anim√© # S√©r√©nade ‚Äì Mod√©r√©  Analysis  Just out of the surrealist experience of Les Six, Poulenc dared to bring the bawdy songs into the concert halls. On the one hand, the text of Les Chansons gaillardes comes from anonymous texts of the seventeenth century, written in a tone of celebration and alcohol: \\"texts rather scabrous\\",Correspondance 1910-1963, p. 266 according to Francis Poulenc himself. On the other hand, in the Journal de mes m√©lodies, Poulenc explains about them: \\"I hold this collection dear where I tried to demonstrate that obscenity can accommodate music. I hate ribaldry\\". Most texts imply a particular play on words, a lightness in the form of code. For example, in the Chanson √† boire, the words celebrate \\"the kings of Egypt and Syria\\" because they \\"wanted their body to be embalmed, to last longer, dead\\", and conclude, Buvons donc selon notre envie ! [...] Embaumons-nous ! (Let's therefore drink according to our desire!

The game features dungeon crawl side-scrolling gameplay, with tap-to- action controls, and a \\"buddy system\\" to ease daily grinding. A fatigue system is implemented, which means that players can not rush levels. Boss raids are also available, as well as a dungeon progression system, which means that more dungeons or PVE areas would be made available the higher level goes.  Gameplay   Classes  Dragonica Mobile SEA features 6 different starting characters, each with their own unique attributes and playstyles, from magic cheesing Warlocks and Wizards, sneaky Thieves and Assassins, to plain dash- and-brawl Knights and Gladiators.  Tasks  Dragonica Mobile SEA features instances that allow players to gain access to items, experience, and currency as well as serve to advance the overall storyline in the game. These instances are known as \\"missions\\" and must be completed sequentially in order to unlock the final scenario that advances the plot. Each step in the mission becomes significantly more difficult than the previous and oftentimes requires a group to complete. Missions are often composed of four main mission modes (increasing in difficulty) and a fifth scenario (unlocked when the previous modes have been completed). Each step in the mission also features a grading system that attempts to rank players based on how a player has performed during that step. The grading system allows the player to obtain higher quality and quantity loot based on that individual's performance and group contribution. Players will often be sent into these missions to complete important quests, such as those needed to change class. Although many of these missions can be done by oneself, the benefits of tackling these missions with others far outweigh that of taking them on alone.
