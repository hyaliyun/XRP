The poem exists in several revision, the oldest probably written in 7th or 8th century Korea, during the late Goguryeo or the North‚ÄìSouth States Period. It is attributed to either Danyuanzi (‰∏πÂÖÉÂ≠ê, Îã®ÏõêÏûê, Danweonja, Sui dynasty) or to Wang Ximing (ÁéãÂ∏åÊòé, ÏôïÌù¨Î™Ö, Wang Heuimyeong, Tang dynasty).

In late Joseon era Korea (18th century) a revised version of the poem was composed, motivated by new knowledge on Chinese asterisms imported during the Qing dynasty (which was itself based on the knowledge of the southern sky acquired from European contact in the Ming period). But there remained disagreement between the song and the star-charts used by the Royal Observatory (ËßÄË±°Áõ£, Í¥ÄÏÉÅÍ∞ê, Gwansanggam). This caused confusion, especially in the national examinations for selecting new astronomers. To resolve this situation, the Royal Observatory commissioned a Song of the Sky Pacers, Adapted to New Methods (Êñ∞Ê≥ïÊ≠•Â§©Ê≠å, Ïã†Î≤ïÎ≥¥Ï≤úÍ∞Ä, Shinbeop Bocheon'ga; also known as the New Song of the Sky Pacers) based upon star-charts and song of the Sequel of the I-Hsiang-K'ao-ch'eng (Ê¨ΩÂÆöÂÑÄË±°ËÄÉÊàêÁ∫åÁ∑®, an astronomical work written in 1744 by German Jesuit Ignaz K√∂gler).

The highway runs from VT 11 in Londonderry east to U.S. Route 5 (US 5) in the incorporated village of Bellows Falls in the town of Rockingham. VT 121 follows the Saxtons River in northern Windham County. The highway has a pair of gravel sections in the towns of Windham and Grafton. Route description VT 121 begins at an intersection with VT 11 in the hamlet of North Windham in the town of Londonderry. The highway heads south and follows the Middle Branch Williams River into its headwaters in the town of Windham. VT 121 curves east and enters the valley of the Saxtons River at the hamlet of Lawrence Four Corners. There, at its intersection with Hitchcock Hill Road and Windham Hill Road, the highway continues as a gravel road, which crosses the river four times before it enters the town of Grafton as Houghtonville Road. VT 121 becomes paved again west of the Houghtonville Historic District in the namesake village. East of Houghtonville, the highway becomes gravel again, curves south with the river, and crosses it three times, and passes to the east of the Middletown Rural Historic District and the constituent Park Farm. West of Hinkley Brook, VT 121 becomes paved again, and the highway veers onto Main Street in the Grafton Village Historic District. The well-preserved village includes the Butterfield House, the Milldean and Alexander-Davis House, the Grafton Congregational Church and Chapel, the Grafton Post Office, and Grafton District Schoolhouse No. 2. VT 121 meets the north end of Kidder Hill Road, which leads to the Kidder Covered Bridge, crosses the Saxtons River, and intersects VT 35 (Chester Road). VT 121 and VT 35 run concurrently east from the village center along the Saxtons River. The highways pass through the Mechanicsville Historic District and cross the river three times together. Near the eastern town line, the highway diverge; VT 35 heads south into Athens and VT 121 crosses the river again and enters the town of Rockingham in the hamlet of Cambridgeport along Saxtons River Road. VT 121 passes through the Saxtons River Village Historic District, where the highway crosses the river again. The highway continues southeast past the Hall Covered Bridge into the town of Westminster, where the route passes under Interstate 91, crosses the river for the last time, and serves the hamlet of North Westminster.

They consist of from 3 to 9 letters and digits, with their composition determined by a station's service category. By international agreement, all call signs starting with the letters K, N and W, as well as AAA-ALZ, are reserved exclusively for use in the United States. AM, FM, TV and shortwave broadcasting stations can request their own call letters, as long as they are unique. The FCC policy covering broadcasting stations limits them to call signs that start with a \\"K\\" or a \\"W\\", with \\"K\\" call signs generally reserved for stations west of the Mississippi River, and \\"W\\" limited to stations east of the river. Amateur stations can receive call signs starting with all of the letters \\"A\\", \\"K\\", \\"N\\" and \\"W\\". Historically prefixes beginning with \\"A\\" have been exclusively assigned to U.S. Army stations and prefixes beginning with \\"N\\" to U.S. Navy stations. Broadcasting stations WOR, New York City) Other stations downplay their call letters, in favor of an easily remembered slogan. This is also the standard practice in most other countries.(KGMZ-FM, San Francisco) Although most transmitters regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are issued call signs for their official identification, the general public is most familiar with the ones used by radio and TV broadcasting stations. However, there is a wide variety in how much emphasis stations give to their call signs; for some it is the primary way they establish public identity, while others largely ignore their call signs, considering a moniker or slogan to be more easily remembered by listeners (and those filling in diaries for the Nielsen Audio ratings measurement). In the United States, the only time broadcasting stations are required to mention their call signs is during station identification announcements, made at a \\"natural break in programming\\" as close to the beginning of each hour as possible. (Code of Federal Regulations: Station identification.) Stations are also required to identify their community of license. Television stations have the option of displaying a small graphic or text (\\"digital on-screen graphic\\" or \\"bug\\") at the bottom of the screen listing their call sign, community of license, and other identifying information. Sometimes station identification is displayed non-intrusively in small type during short promotions, either for an upcoming show or their next local newscast (even incorporating these identifications at the start of newscasts), that air just before the top of each hour. FM stations with HD Radio digital subchannels must individually identify each program stream, but do not need to do so in any particular form; most licensees use the form \\"WXXX HD2\\", but this is not part of their call sign. A few AM stations have had the same call letters for almost 100 years: KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has been in continuous use since 1920, while WBZ in Boston, KYW in Philadelphia, and KWG in Stockton, California, all date back to 1921. At the other extreme, reflecting multiple changes in ownership and format, are stations which have changed call letters numerous times, for example KXFN in Saint Louis, Missouri, has switched ten times since 1925.The sequence of call letters has been: KFVE, KWK, KGLD, KASP, WKBQ, KRAM, WKBQ, KKWK, KZJZ, KSLG, and KXFN. Call signs meanings While the earliest radio call signs were randomly or sequentially assigned and intended merely to distinguish transmitters, they soon became an important part of a station's identity, and since the mid-1920s government regulators have allowed station owners to choose their own. Thousands of radio and TV stations have been established, with a wide variety of reasons for choosing particular call signs.\\"Radio/TV Station Call Letter Origins\\" by Bob Nelson (oldradio.com) Some common categories include: * Slogans: It is sometimes difficult to determine which came first: a station's call sign, or a slogan attached to it. However, some well-documented examples of call letters being chosen to reflect an existing slogan include: WGN and WGN-TV in Chicago, standing for \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\", used by their original owner, the Chicago Tribune; WIS in Columbia, South Carolina, the \\"Wonderful Iodine State\\"; and WPTF, Raleigh, North Carolina, which references the motto of previous owner the Durham Life Insurance Company, \\"We Protect the Family\\". * Owners: The major owned-and- operated stations of the Big Three television networks ‚Äî ABC, CBS and NBC ‚Äî have traditionally had call signs reflecting the network abbreviations. Stations operated by schools and universities commonly incorporate their school's initials, including WWVU (West Virginia University, Morgantown), and KUOM (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis). * Locations: Three stations have call signs that fully spell out their community of license: WACO-FM (Waco, Texas), WARE (Ware, Massachusetts) and WISE-FM (Wise, Virginia). Other stations reference their community of license or designated market area (DMA) with an abbreviation or initialism, such as WRAL-TV ( _Ral_ eigh, North Carolina), or WCSC-TV ( _C_ harleston, _S_ outh _C_ arolina). * Numbers: Numerous television stations have chosen call letters that reference their channel number, either spelled out or using Roman numerals: WXII (channel 12, Winston‚ÄìSalem, North Carolina), KXII (also channel 12, Sherman, Texas), WIIC (now WPXI) (channel 11, Pittsburgh), WPVI (channel 6, Philadelphia), WIVB (channel 4, Buffalo, New York), WTWO (channel 2, Terre Haute, Indiana). Some, like WGRZ (channel 2, Buffalo) and WDIO-DT (channel 10, Duluth), use letters which have similarities to numerals; in those examples, the \\"Z\\" in WGRZ resembles a \\"2\\", while the \\"IO\\" in WDIO resembles a \\"10\\". Examples on the AM band have historically included KIXI in Seattle, which previously broadcast at 910 kHz (\\"IX-I\\"); and KIIS in Los Angeles, which originated on 1150 kHz (as the letters IIS resemble 115, its frequency in myriahertz). Geographical separation of K and W call signs Map of the historic division between K and W broadcasting station call letter assignments. The blue section in the west has normally received K calls, while the eastern red section has normally received W. The yellow section in the middle received W calls from 1912 until January 1923, when a boundary shift to the Mississippi River transferred it to K territory. Following a practice inaugurated in 1912 when the federal government first licensed radio stations, beginning in 1921 broadcasting stations have generally been assigned call signs beginning with \\"K\\" when their community of license is located in the west, and with \\"W\\" in the east. (The FCC proposed ending this policy in 1987, in order to allow unrestricted assignments of K and W stations throughout the country. However, it was decided to retain the rule due to industry objections.)\\"In the Matter of Amendment of Part 73 Relating to Call Sign Assignments for Broadcast Stations\\", MM Docket No. 87-11, Adopted: October 20, 1987 (FCC.gov) The original boundary line ran northward from the Texas-New Mexico border. In early 1923 the boundary was moved to its present location of the Mississippi River, in order to better balance the populations in the two regions.\\"'K' Calls Are Western\\", The Wireless Age, April 1923, page 25. The geographical separation of \\"K\\" and \\"W\\" prefixes applies only to radio and television broadcasting stations, and is not followed for weather radio, highway advisory radio, or time signal stations; nor does it apply to auxiliary licenses held by broadcast stations, such as studio-transmitter links and inter-city relay stations. For stations located in U.S. possessions, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are considered to be east of the Mississippi River, and all their stations have been given standard \\"W\\" call signs. The Pacific Ocean territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa are considered to be in western \\"K\\" territory, although assignments here have been less consistent. Currently all but one of these stations have \\"K\\" calls; the exception is WVUV-FM in Fagaitua, American Samoa, which received its call while it was paired with a since-deleted AM station, WVUV. The 1923 boundary shift meant that a number of existing stations with \\"W\\" call letters were located in a section of country that was now being issued \\"K\\" call letters, but these earlier stations were allowed to keep their now non-standard call signs. Examples of these stations include WBAP (Fort Worth, Texas), and WDAF- FM and WDAF-TV (Kansas City, Missouri), which inherited their calls from the original WDAF (now KCSP). Although a long established convention, the K-W division has not always been rigidly followed, and over the years a few exceptions have accumulated. One prominent example is KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which was licensed in 1920 during a short period when new land stations were issued call signs from a block of letters that previously had been reserved for ship stations.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 1, 1920, page 2. The FCC has also been lenient in the case of relocations that result in a station moving to the other side of the boundary, especially when close to the Mississippi River.\\"K/W Call Letters in the United States\\" by Thomas H. White (earlyradiohistory.us) The most extreme example occurred in 2013, when television station KJWP was allowed to keep its call letters even after moving from Jackson, Wyoming to Wilmington, Delaware; the station changed its call letters to WDPN-TV in 2018. Three-letter call signs Starting in 1921, most broadcasting stations were assigned three- letter call signs. However, within a few years there would be hundreds of stations, and there were not enough three-letter calls to go around, so beginning in April and May 1922 most new broadcasting stations were instead issued four-letter calls. Over the next few years a small number of additional three-letter calls were authorized, with the final grant made in 1930 to WIS in Columbia, South Carolina. In the past, base three-letter calls could only be shared by stations located in the same community and under common ownership. A prominent dispute involving this issue occurred in the 1980s, when it required several petitions before a station in Granite City, Illinois, was permitted change its call letters to KWK-FM (now WARH), matching its sister station, KWK (now KXFN) in St. Louis. In addition, beginning in the mid-1980s stations which were previously co-owned but later separated no longer are required to have one of the stations give up the three-letter call, which is why WWL and WWL-TV in New Orleans can still share the assignment. Under current FCC regulations in force since 1998, the limits on reassigning three-letter call signs have been relaxed. The restriction requiring a common community of license was removed, and an owner of a station with a three- letter base call sign can now request the same three-letter call (with an \\"-FM\\", \\"-TV\\", or \\"-LP\\" suffix as necessary) for any station under common ownership. CBS Radio most prominently took advantage of this rule: resurrecting WJZ and adding WJZ-FM in Baltimore, as well as WBZ-FM in Boston. In most cases the FCC will not reissue a three-letter call sign after all the stations that had been using it switch to four-letter calls, but there have been a few exceptions where a station has been permitted to reclaim an \\"abandoned\\" three-letter call. This happened most recently in 2000, when KKHJ in Los Angeles was allowed to change back to KHJ, fourteen years after it had last used the three-letter call. The justification that the FCC accepted was that the first two letters of \\"KKHJ\\" are pronounced \\"caca\\" in Spanish, which was considered offensive.\\"Mystique of the Three-Letter Callsigns\\" by Thomas H. White (earlyradiohistory.us) Suffixes As the number of broadcasting stations has increased, the FCC has adopted a number of suffixes for use by FM and TV stations to allow multiple stations to share the same \\"base\\" three- or four-letter call sign. (AM and shortwave stations have never had \\"-AM\\" or \\"-SW\\" or any other suffixes.) For example, in addition to an AM station with the call letters WLOV, there are also WLOV-FM, WLOV-TV and a low-power FM station, WLOV-LP. And in addition to shortwave station KSDA, there is also a KSDA-FM. Suffixes are optional for full power FM and TV stations, unless another station shares the same three- or four-letter base call sign, requiring a differentiation between the two stations. Reviewed below are the various broadcasting station suffixes: * FM: The FM radio band was established on January 1, 1941, and from the beginning educational stations received standard unique four-letter call signs. Commercial stations within the original FM band were assigned transmitting frequencies that spanned from 43.1 MHz to 49.9 MHz, and the FCC initially issued these stations standardized call signs that included the last two digits of their frequency plus a common closing letter or letters that indicated their community. This resulted in call signs that were hard for the public to differentiate, for example, as of February 1942 there were nine commercial New York City stations operating on frequencies ranging from 43.1 to 47.5, which were assigned call signs between W31NY and W75NY.\\"U.S. FM Stations as of Feb. 17, 1942\\", FM Magazine, February 1942. In order to eliminate this confusion, the FCC announced that, effective November 1, 1943, the 45 existing commercial FM stations would change to standard call letters. At the same time, the \\"-FM\\" suffix was introduced, which meant that FM stations could use the same base call letters as an existing AM station if they added \\"-FM\\" to their call. One restriction was that the paired stations had to have common ownership and be located in the same community.\\"Standard Broadcast Station Call Letters for All Outlets Starting Nov. 1, FCC Rule\\", The Billboard, September 4, 1943, page 7. * TV and DT: Commercial television was introduced in the United States in July 1941, and initially TV stations were assigned standard unique four-letter call signs. In 1946 the \\"-TV\\" suffix was introduced, which, like \\"-FM\\", included the restriction that paired stations had to have the same owners and be located in the same community. The \\"-DT\\" suffix was introduced as part of the later conversion of TV stations from analog to digital transmissions. During a transition period, digital TV stations were identified using -DT suffixed calls, with the base call staying the same as the one assigned to their analog sister station, e.g., WRC-DT was paired with WRC-TV, etc. With the termination of the analog stations in June 2009, most digital TV stations inherited the calls formally used by their analog counterparts. However, the FCC provided that these stations could optionally keep their -DT suffix, and a relative few elected to do so.\\"FCC Public Notice: Digital Transition Call Sign Procedures\\", June 3, 2009 (FCC.gov) Few stations have adopted the \\"-DT\\" suffix. In the June 19, 2014 public data export of the FCC's Common Database System, 91 US- licensed full-power television stations have the \\"-DT\\" suffix, while 1,749 stations use \\"-TV\\" or no suffix at all. * LP: Beginning in 1995, the FCC allowed Low Power TV stations to be issued four-letter calls with an \\"‚ÄìLP\\" suffix. In 2001 Low Power FM stations were also allowed to request -LP suffixed call letters. * CA, LD, CD and D: In 2000 a new Low Power analog TV classification of Class A television stations was added, and these stations are eligible to receive standard call letters with a \\"-CA\\" suffix. After the introduction of digital TV, an \\"-LD\\" suffix was made available for standard Low Power digital TV stations, with digital Class A TV stations eligible for a \\"-CD\\" suffix. Low power digital TV stations, including translators, that still have alphanumeric call signs based on their channel number receive a \\"‚ÄìD\\" suffix, as in W08EG-D. (Code of Federal Regulations: Digital call signs.) The FCC makes no differentiation between translating and originating LPTV stations, thus either type of station may have an alphanumeric or a regular \\"-LP\\" or \\"-LD\\" call sign. * FM Boosters: \\"Boosters\\" extend a station's coverage by transmitting on the same channel as an originating station. FM boosters receive call signs which repeat the entire call sign of the primary station, plus a sequential numeric suffix, like \\"FM1\\". Only LPFM boosters have multiple suffixes. The longest possible call sign in the United States (nine characters) went into use for the first time July 22, 2017, when KWSV-LP signed on booster KWSV-LP-FM1. FM and TV translator stations Translators are low-powered transmitters that rebroadcast an originating station's programming on a different channel or frequency. The naming convention for FM translators includes their three-digit FM channel number (from 200 to 300), followed by two sequentially assigned letters ‚Äì for example, K237FR. The translator may identify itself hourly by voice or Morse code. The primary station may instead choose to identify all its translators together; if it does so, the identification must occur once between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., once between 12:55 p.m. and 1:05 p.m., and once between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. local time. The policy for TV translators consists of a leading geographical letter K or W, followed by the two-digit channel number on which they operate (02-83), and closing with two sequentially assigned letters; for example, W04AX. In 2009, the FCC began allowing digital television stations to apply for \\"digital replacement\\" translator stations, which are not given a separate call sign, instead taking on the one of the primary station. This is only in the case of areas that would lose coverage due to the digital television transition. , channels 7, 9, and 13 in the western United States are up to K07Zx, K09Zx, and K13Zx, respectively. In the digital era, these call signs continue in use with an optional -D suffix to indicate digital operation. The FCC has since extended K-prefixed translator call signs on channels 7 and 13 to three-letter suffixes; what is now KMNF-LD operated briefly under the six- character call sign K13AAR-D in 2018, and was later granted a channel 7 construction permit with call sign K07AAH-D before changing to its current sign. Non-broadcast stations Amateur stations Map showing the numeral codes for amateur radio call signs in the United States. The region in which the operator was licensed determines the numeral. United States amateur radio call signs consist of one or two letters, followed by a single digit, and closing with one to three more letters. The number in the call sign indicates in which of the ten U.S. radio districts the license was issued. (It is no longer necessary for U.S. amateur radio operators to change their call signs after moving into a new district.) Most amateurs going to an exotic location will add a \\"/location\\" suffix to show their current operating site, for example, a station visiting American Samoa might sign \\"(regular call sign)/KH8\\". American amateurs are permitted to operate in Canada under their own call signs with a location indicator. Outlying areas have special calls. For example, those issued in Hawaii can (like other American call signs) start with \\"A\\", \\"K\\", \\"N\\", or \\"W\\", but then will have \\"H6\\" or \\"H7\\" before the one to three additional letters. Other Pacific possessions use other \\"H\\" numbers. For example, a station on Guam could be \\"KH0‚Äì\\". Stations in Alaska have \\"L\\" as their second prefix letter, and stations in the Caribbean region (such as the Virgin Islands) use \\"P\\" for their second letter. Generally the shorter the call (up to a 1x2 or 2x1 format) the higher the grade of license, but amateurs who upgrade are not required to change their call signs. In any case some of the available blocks have been used up. The 1x1 call signs, such as K6O, are for short-term special event stations. Amateur stations are required to identify themselves by their call sign once every ten minutes during a communication and at the end of the communication. (Code of Federal Regulations: Authorized transmissions) Other services * Experimental stations have alphanumeric call signs, with \\"X\\" as the first letter following a regional digit. (All television and most FM stations that were operational before World War II were licensed as experimental stations.) Notable experimental stations included Major Armstrong's FM station W2XMN in Alpine, New Jersey; Powel Crosley Jr.'s 500kW superpower AM W8XO, operating at night carrying WLW's programming; and Don Lee's pioneering television station, W6XAO in Los Angeles. Synchronous AM station \\"booster\\" transmitters receive experimental call signs which incorporate the primary stations' call letters in their call signs, for example, WA2XPA was paired with WAPA, and WI2XAC was paired with WIAC. * Time signal and standard-frequency stations have the reserved call signs WWV, WWVB through WWVI, WWVL, and WWVS. This grouping is derived from shortwave station WWV of Fort Collins, Colorado, which was the U.S. government's first such station. WWVB and WWVH are also currently in use, while WWVL was active from 1962 through 1972. Standard broadcasters may use these call signs with a suffix; what is now WVBX operated as WWVB-FM from 2008 through 2009. * NOAA Weather Radio stations operating between 162.4 and 162.55 MHz have call signs consisting of a \\"K\\" or \\"W\\" followed by letters, and two digits. The \\"K\\" and \\"W\\" prefixes are used on both sides of the Mississippi River (for example, KHB36 in Washington, D.C. and WXK25 in El Paso, Texas). * Highway advisory radio stations operating on the AM band have call signs consisting of \\"K\\" and \\"W\\" followed by two or three letters and three digits. As with weather radio, \\"K\\" and \\"W\\" calls are assigned on both sides of the Mississippi River. * Leisure craft boats with VHF radios do not have to be assigned call signs, in which case the name of the vessel is used instead. Ships wishing to have a radio license anyway are under FCC class SA: \\"Ship recreational or voluntarily equipped.\\" Those calls follow the land mobile format of the initial letter K or W followed by one or two letters, followed by three or four numbers (such as KX0983 or WXX0029). * Military call sign systems: (Code of Federal Regulations: Call signs) ** AAA‚ÄìAEZ and ALA‚ÄìALZ are reserved for Department of the Army stations. ** AFA‚ÄìAKZ are assigned to the Department of the Air Force. ** NAA‚ÄìNZZ is jointly assigned to the Department of the Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard Call signs in the western United States can be confused with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airport codes, because they are four-character codes beginning with \\"K\\". Examples include KSFO (San Francisco International Airport and radio station KSFO), KLAX (Los Angeles International Airport and KLAX-FM), and KDFW (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and KDFW (TV)). Historical overview Early history The use of call letters predates the invention of radio, and were introduced as part of landline telegraph communication. Telegraph operators generally used Morse code, and it was standard practice to assign identifying letters to individual offices located along a line. Early radio stations (originally called \\"wireless telegraphy\\") commonly employed former telegraph operators, who continued the practice. While there was no need for telegraph stations to coordinate their assignments, the great distance that radio signals traveled required international standardization. As early as 1906, the Service Regulations adopted by the Berlin International Wireless Telegraph Convention specified that \\"calls shall be distinguishable from one another and each must be formed of a group of three letters\\".\\"Regulation IV\\", Service Regulations, Berlin International Wireless Telegraph Convention, 1906. Despite this pronouncement, the United States would be slow to adopt this standard, largely because radio stations were unregulated at this time. Individual stations selected their own call signs, commonly only one or two letters, with little concern about duplication. The first U.S. organization to conform to the international standard was the U.S. Navy, which in 1909 switched from two- letter calls scattered throughout the alphabet to three-letter calls, all starting with the letter \\"N\\".List of Wireless Telegraph Stations of the World (corrected to September 1, 1909), Department of the Navy: Bureau of Equipment. The lack of coordination and duplication of call signs used by merchant ships was eventually determined to be a threat to maritime navigation. A November 1911 report by Commissioner of Navigation Eugene Tyler Chamberlain\\"Call Letters\\", Annual Report of the Commissioner of Navigation to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1911, submitted November 18, 1911 from Commissioner Eugene Tyler Chamberlain to Secretary Charles Nagel, page 52-53. noted the lack of standards in the latest compilation of ship call letters,of American Merchant Vessels and Yachts Equipped with Wireless Apparatus, Arranged in the Order of Their Call Letters\\", Forty-third Annual List of the Merchant Vessels of the United States (June 30, 1911), pages 102-103. and decided to take measures to rectify the situation, invoking his authority given \\"by the act of July 5, 1884\\" to assign \\"signal letters to American merchant vessels\\". (Previously this had applied to four-letter signal flag identifiers). The new merchant ship radio call letters went into effect on June 30, 1912. Ships were divided into two geographical groups, with three- letter calls starting with \\"K\\" assigned to ships on the \\"Atlantic and Gulf Coasts\\", and calls starting with \\"W\\" assigned to the \\"Pacific Coast\\" vessels.\\"List of American Merchant Vessels and Yachts Equipped with Wireless Apparatus, Arranged in the Order of Their Call Letters\\", Forty-fourth Annual List of the Merchant Vessels of the United States (June 30, 1912), pages 102-103. No reason was given for splitting the ships into two groups, and this differed from the practice followed for the assignment of the earlier flag signal letters, which had been sequentially issued with no differentiation between the two regions. Nor was any explanation given why the letters \\"K\\" and \\"W\\" were chosen. Radio Act of 1912 The United States did not license radio stations until the adoption of the Radio Act of 1912.\\"An Act to Regulate Radio Communication\\" (approved August 13, 1912), Radio Communication Laws of the United States (edition July 27, 1914), pages 6-14. This new statute placed the licensing authority, including issuing call letters to both ship and land stations, under the control of the Bureau of Navigation in the Department of Commerce. At this time the United States also started to participate with international regulations, and one of the first acts was to be formally assigned call letter blocks. The initial assignment allocated all call signs starting with \\"N\\" and \\"W\\", plus the range KDA-KZZ, for use by the United States.Radio Call Letters, Department of Commerce, May 9, 1913 (FCC.gov) (Initially KAA-KCZ were assigned to Germany, but in 1929 this call letter block was transferred to the United States. AAA-ALZ were added after World War II.) The policy that had been adopted for ship stations assignments was \\"W call letters in the west, and K call letters in the east\\". For land stations, the reverse was now implemented, with western land stations getting K calls, and eastern stations receiving W calls. This policy is still followed for broadcasting stations assignments. \\"K\\", \\"N\\", and \\"W\\" call letters were considered to be international assignments. Initially there were some classes of radio stations which did not qualify for these calls because they were considered to be only of domestic interest. This included the standard amateur radio stations, plus the three classes of \\"Special Land\\" stations: Experimental, Technical and Training School, and Special Amateur. The United States was divided into nine \\"Radio Inspection\\" districts,\\"United States Amateur Radio Districts\\", The Consolidated Radio Call Book, 1922, page 276. and amateur and Special Land stations were issued call signs that started with the district number in which they were located, followed by two letters. The first letter for standard amateur stations came from the range A-W. For Experimental stations, the first letter was \\"X\\", a practice that is still followed. \\"Y\\" was reserved for Technical and Training School stations, and \\"Z\\" for Special Amateurs. More letters were added as the number of stations grew. Effective October 1, 1928, the amateur and Special Land stations were \\"internationalized\\", with stations adding an initial \\"W\\" (for continental) or \\"K\\" (for territorial) ahead of their call signs' district number.\\"Amateur and Special (Experimental and Technical Training School) Station Calls to be Changed\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 30, 1928, page 22. In later years a greater variety of amateur call signs would be added. Early radio broadcasting stations The original radio stations were primarily used for private point-to-point communication. The early 1920s saw the introduction of radio broadcasting, and by the end of 1922 there were over 500 broadcasting stations operating in the United States. Most of the first broadcasting stations received randomly assigned three-letter call signs. However, in early 1922, due to the prospect of all the available three-letter call signs being used up, the government switched to four-letter calls that were sequentially assigned. Initially two different patterns were employed. In the east, beginning in April 1922 calls were issued in alphabetical order with \\"A\\" fixed as the third letter, i.e. WAAB, WAAC, WAAD... WBAB, WBAC... etc. Surviving stations from this era include WBAP (Fort Worth, Texas), WHAS (Louisville, Kentucky) and WTAM (Cleveland). In April 1923 the pattern switched to calls centered on \\"B\\", including WBBM (Chicago), WCBM (Baltimore) and WMBD (Peoria, Illinois). In the west, after a small number of KD‚Äîfour-letter calls were issued, the government switched to KF--, KG‚Äîand KI‚Äîcalls issued in alphabetical order, including KFQD (Anchorage, Alaska), KGFX (Kalispell, Montana) and KIUL (Garden City, Kansas). Beginning in the mid-1920s it became the norm for station owners to request call letters of their own choosing. However, in cases where no preference has been stated, the government will make its own assignment. 1983 deregulation In late 1983, the FCC adopted a number of changes that greatly reduced its role in call letter assignments and disputes, including:\\"In re Matter of: Revision of Section 73.3550 of the Commission's Rules with respect to the Assignment of New and Modified Call Letters to AM, FM and TV Broadcast Stations\\", MM Docket No. 83-373, Adopted: December 1, 1983. * Ended the ban on issuing call letters that are \\"not in good taste\\". The FCC noted that any objections could be handled by a complaint through the federal courts. * Eliminated the requirement that a station seeking to change its call letters had to notify local stations of the pending request. In addition, the FCC would no longer set aside a thirty-day period to receive objections and rule if the new calls met FCC standards, because call letter changes were now being authorized as soon as they were received. * Eliminated the requirement that stations with four-letter calls operating on different services had to be located in \\"the same or adjoining communities\\" in order to have the same base call. (The single-community restriction remains in force for three-letter calls). In 1987, the requirement was further relaxed, now allowing common four-letter base call signs to be issued to stations with different owners, although permission had to first be obtained from the current call letter holder. * Adopted a \\"first requester\\" policy for reassignment of relinquished call letters. The previous rule stated that after a call was relinquished, the reassignment would go to the senior broadcaster requesting during the next fifteen days. * Eliminated the rule that relinquished call letters could not be reassigned to the same community for 180 days. * Eliminated the requirement that \\"suitable clearance\\" had to be obtained in order to receive call letters that were the initials of a current or former president, or a government agency.

Located on the south bank of the Bagaduce River opposite Castine, the principal feature of the site is a large shell midden, yielding evidence of a long period of human habitation. When excavated by pioneering Maine archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead in the 1920s, he described one of the ceramic finds at this site among the most finely decorated he had found anywhere on the New England coast. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Discovery and early excavation The site was first described in detail by Warren K. Moorehead, who engaged in a multi-season survey of archaeological sites in Maine in the 1910s and 1920s. He identified the Von Mach Site as one of the larger shell midden sites on the lower reaches of the Bagaduce River, which empties into Penobscot Bay on the central Maine coast. The midden was located on the property of art historian Edmund von Mach, who granted Moorehead permission to excavate the site. Local residents reported to Moorehead that there had been previous work at the site, and he was able to locate trenches nearby consistent with these reports, but no written reports. The shell midden is about long, and varies in width and depth. Moorehead excavated trenches totalling about long and wide, with the deepest central portion of the midden between and deep. Most of the shells were of quahogs of a variety still found in the area, although now smaller in size. He identified ten distinct layers within the midden, typically alternating between vegetative organic matter and layers (sometimes quite deep) of shells. Cultural remains were predominantly found at the lower layers, including layers of ash, blackened shells, ceramic fragments, and tools. Most of the tools found were bone (awls, gouges, fishhooks), but he also found evidence of stone tool manufacture, including stone flakes consistent with tool-making activity.

A member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions, he was one of the scholars sent by Louis XV to the eastern Mediterranean to collect inscriptions and manuscripts. He is now best remembered for having presented as genuine some forged inscriptions. Life His father was √âtienne Fourmont of Herblay in the Paris region, a surgeon and official; √âtienne Fourmont (1683‚Äì1745) was his brother. He became a Catholic priest, and an orientalist pupil of his brother in Paris Fourmont became a private tutor, and was given the Chair of Syriac at the Coll√®ge royal in 1720. He was admitted as an associate of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1724. In 1728 Fourmont was sent by Louis XV to Constantinople and Greece, leaving in 1729 with Fran√ßois Sevin. They were under instructions from Jean-Paul Bignon, the king's librarian, to search out surviving Byzantine manuscripts, and the journey was supported by the Comte de Maurepas, for the greater glory of French scholarship. Fourmont traveled in Greece and the Aegean Sea for over a year, but had little luck in finding early manuscripts of ancient authors sitting in monastic libraries. He would report to Maurepas in February 1730: Therefore, Fourmont made collecting ancient Greek inscriptions his primary focus. Fourmont would report to Count Maurepas that he copied 1,500 ancient inscriptions (300 in Sparta). His technique was brutally direct. Workmen were hired to dismantle any structure that might contain ancient stones with letters on them. Fourmont reported paying 1,200 man-days of labour to dismantle monuments in search of ancient marbles. In a letter to Bignon dated 20 April 1730, Fourmont wrote: In the same letter he wrote: Fourmont was called back to France before he could visit ancient Olympia as planned. Back in France, Fourmont published only a short report. He was elected a member of the Royal Society on 4 November 1742. Legacy Later travelers to Greece were horrified at Fourmont's descriptions of the ancient monuments he destroyed. Fourmont is alleged to have written in one of his letters that he had destroyed certain inscriptions after transcribing them. The British traveler Edward Dodwell reported that when he visited Sparta (in 1806) he was shown marbles that Fourmont had mutilated so as to make their inscriptions illegible.. That some of Fourmont's most important inscriptions from Amyclae could not be relocated helped fuel scholarly suspicions that he had either forged or seriously misrepresented the inscriptions he reported. In 1791 Richard Payne Knight published An Analytical Essay on the Greek Alphabet, in which he argued that Fourmont had forged some inscriptions in his collection. A controversy began. Fourmont's collection of inscriptions was transcribed in 1815 by Immanuel Bekker. The collection of 26 texts from Amyclae, about which doubts had been raised, were identified as forgeries by August B√∂ckh. Where inscriptions could be relocated, Fourmont's transcriptions of the Greek text frequently proved inaccurate: \\"Corrupt, like most of the Fourmontiana\\", in B√∂ckh's verdict. All Fourmont's published work was thus invalidated; but there remained a substantially larger collection of unpublished material. Dodwell's verdict is harsh but probably accurate: \\"Great ambition, and a little learning, with an unfeeling indifference for the monuments of antiquity, incited him to destroy some of the most venerable and interesting records of ancient history.\\" Notes 1690 births 1746 deaths French Roman Catholic priests French classical scholars Fellows of the Royal Society ","title":"Michel Fourmont"},{"id":"46498111","text":"Cox Creek is a stream in Lauderdale County, in the U.S. state of Alabama, that flows through the northern portions of the city of Florence.

History  Suothern Sun Cape Sun hotel, Cape Town The group was established in 1969, when hotelier Sol Kerzner founded the chain of Southern Sun Hotels in partnership with South African Breweries. Prior to 1994, the group's operations were limited to hotels as gambling in South Africa was heavily restricted. When the new democratic government came to power, gambling was legalised, which enabled the group to add 14 gaming destinations to its portfolio. Through a process of bid applications, the group acquired five casino licences: Emnotweni (Nelspruit), The Ridge, Hemingways, Montecasino and Suncoast.

In a survey of listeners and readers of Radio Beat and magazine Rock & Pop, he was selected as a member of the Czech supergroup together with Michal Pavl√≠ƒçek, Kamil St≈ôihavka, Vladimir Kulh√°nek, Roman Dragoun and Jan Hrub√Ω.  Biography  Milo≈° Meier comes from musical family; his stepmother is a singer, his brother is also a drummer and his father leads a brass orchestra, in which Meier performed until he was 16. The first musical instrument that he started to play was the piano. During his orchestra years he also played with local rock and metal bands Invasion of Privacy and Eclipse of a Shadow. At the age of fifteen he left to Prague to study at the Prague Conservatory. Around this time he became interested in diverse musical styles including jazz, fusion, and funk. He played with a large number of different bands, including death metal artist Tortharry, with whom he recorded an album, Bon Jovi and Judas Priest tribute bands, and Aneta Langerov√°'s band. Intensive drumming led to problems with his tendons and muscles in his hands, and he had to stop playing the drums for six months. After his recovery, at the age of 19 he successfully auditioned for BSP, a Czech supergroup consisting of Ota Balage, Kamil St≈ôihavka, and Michal Pavl√≠ƒçek, with whom he has been playing ever since. In 2009 he recorded the album Neser (Do not fuck) with Czech metal band Dymytry, who he later joined. He also plays in the bands Noid, Story, and Eleison, as well as various other musical projects.

History A post office was established at Bailey Springs in 1854, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1901. The community was named for Jonathan Bailey, who started a resort on several mineral springs. The spring waters here have been classified as chalybeate, iron water, and alkaline-saline springs. A large number of people came from Memphis and surrounding areas for the purported healing qualities of the springs. At one point, the water at Bailey Springs was bottled and shipped around the United States. The springs were opened as a resort and hotel until 1910. A school for women, Bailey Springs University, was founded in 1893 on the resort grounds. It remained open until 1900. During the American Civil War, troops from the 7th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel Richard Rowett camped at Bailey Springs. Notable person Henry W.

The Bedaria constitute a large portion of Sudanese Arabs, and traditionally only speak Arabic. Sudanese Arabs are the Arabic- speaking majority population of Sudan. They are predominantly Muslim and most of them speak the Sudanese Arabic dialect.Encyclopedia of Tribes and families in Sudan: the author: Sidig Paddy History The Bedaria trace their lineage to Abbas, uncle of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They were at one time subject to the Funj kings, but their position was in a measure independent. At the Egyptian invasion in 1820 they were the most powerful of Arab tribes in the Nile valley. They submitted at first, but in 1822 rebelled and massacred the Egyptian garrison at Shendi with the Mek Nimir, a Jaali leader burning Ismail, Muhammad Ali Pasha's son and his cortege at a banquet. The revolt was mercilessly suppressed, and the Ja'alin were thence forward looked on with suspicion. They were almost the first of the northern tribes to join the mahdi in 1884, and it was their position to the north of Khartoum which made communication with General Gordon so difficult. The Ja'alin are now a semi- nomad agricultural people. In common with much of the rest of the Arab world, the gradual process of Arabization in Sudan led to the predominance of the Arabic language and aspects of Arab culture, The population of Sudan includes various tribes who are ethnically Arab, such as the Shaigya, Ja'alin, Shukria, Guhayna, etc. (according to Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, the Bedouins of the eastern desert of Sudan such as the Ja'alin are almost indistinguishable from the Bedouins of eastern Arabia. Sudanese Arabic It was noted in the late 19th century that the Arabic spoken in Sudan still largely maintained grammatical and dialectical features similar to that introduced from the Arabian Peninsula in the 12th century, and as a result Sudanese Arabic is a form of pure or \\"archaic Arabic.\\" This, among other features, serves to distinguish the Arabic spoken in Sudan from that of its neighbor, Egypt. Lifestyle Some Bedaria still farm and raise livestock along the banks of The Nile river and in Western Sudan, but today they more commonly consist of the bulk of the Sudanese urban population, forming a large part of the merchant class. Although many have moved to cities, such as the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, they still maintain their tribal identity and solidarity. Famous for maintaining ties with their homeland, they keep in contact with their original home and return for frequent visits, especially for marriages, funerals and Muslim festivals.

The bridge carries Wire Bridge Road across the Carrabassett River a short way north of the village center. Built in the mid-19th century, it is one of four 19th-century suspension bridges in the state. It is one lane wide, and has a weight limit of 3 tons. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history The bridge is in a rural setting, crossing the river just upstream of the mouth of Lemon Stream. The bridge is long and wide, sufficient to carry a single lane of traffic. The bridge towers are , and are set on abutments of large rough- quarried granite. The towers are covered in wooden shingles, and are constructed of beams. The main steel cables are about in diameter, and connected to the bridge decking by 204 steel girders. The cable ends are anchored by concrete and granite blocks with an estimated weight of 30 tons. The decking surface is wooden planks. The construction history of the bridge is a matter of minor local controversy. One traditional account places its construction at 1840-42, under the auspices of Colonel F. B. Morse, who lived nearby and had been an engineer in the army. According to this account, Morse ordered the cables from Sheffield, England, and had them hauled overland from Hallowell by a large team of oxen. Local criticism of the work led the bridge to dubbed \\"Morse's Fool Bridge\\". The official town history of the bridge is more prosaic, stating that it was built in 1864-66 by David Eider and Captain Charles Clark. The bridge was last rehabilitated in 2009-10; its towers and cable are original.

Principle of operation of belay glasses. Light from above is reflected into the observer's eye. Belaying involves a person standing on a stable platform below a rock climber controlling the tension and friction of the climber's rope. Since this activity requires craning one's neck to look up at the climber, a common malady named \\"belayer's neck\\" can occur. The prismatic lenses of the belay glasses are arranged so as to bend light from above through total internal reflection into the observer's eye, allowing the belayer to observe the climber while maintaining a comfortable head/neck position. The design based on the eyeglasses frame provides for a split field of vision: * the central field through the lenses, providing a vertical view to the climber; * the peripheral field around the sides of the lenses, allowing the belayer to remain aware of their surroundings.

He was one of the scientists who participated in the Project 523 of the Chinese Government under Chairman Mao Zedong. The project resulted in the discovery of artemisinins, a class of antimalarial drugs, from the medicinal plant Artemisia annua. Zhou specifically worked on artemether, one of the derivatives of artemisinin. In 1985 he combined artemether with another drug lumefantrine into a single tablet, which he successfully used for the treatment of severe malaria. With the support of Novartis, the drug was produced in 1991 under the brand name Coartem, and it became the first artemisinin-based combination therapy. For this invention he and his team were awarded the European Inventor Award of 2009 in the category \\"Non-European countries\\".  Biography  Zhou was a son of Chinese peasants. At age 16 he was enlisted in the Eighth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army of China. Having a medical background he served in the healthcare of the army. He was a nurse in the beginning, then the head of a nursing squad, assistant physician and eventually doctor-in-charge during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945) and throughout the Chinese Civil War. After the civil war he studied medicine at the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai. He graduated in 1960, and then joined the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences as a researcher.  Development of Coartem  Zhou was among more than 500 Chinese scientists assigned to investigate for a new antimalarial medication during the Cultural Revolution. Established by Mao Zedong-led government in 1967, the collaborative research was called Project 523. In 1972 Tu Youyou and her team discovered artemisinin (originally known as qinghaosu). A more stable compound artemether was synthesised from artemisinin. In 1981 the National Chinese Steering Committee for Development of Qinghaosu (artemisinin) and its Derivatives authorised Zhou to work on artemether. Zhou showed that artemether combined with another antimalarial lumefantrine was the most potent of all antimalarial drugs. He worked alone for four years, and was joined by Ning Dianxi and his team in 1985. They found that in clinical trials the combined tablet (artemether/lumefantrine) had very high cure rate of severe malaria, more than 95%, including in areas where multi-drug resistance is experienced. They applied for patent in 1991, but granted only in 2002. In 1992 they got it registered as a new drug. Novartis then noticed the new drug and made a deal for mass production. In 1999 Novartis obtained the international licensing rights and gave the brand name Coartem. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2009.

Life He was born in White Horse Close on the Canongate on Edinburgh‚Äôs Royal Mile on 6 May 1793 to Jean and John Dick (1769-1844), a farrier who had moved south from Aberdeen with his wife, Jean. He was educated by the Reverend J Robinson at Paul‚Äôs Work, a small complex of buildings where Waverley Train Station now stands. His higher education was at Mr Keeson‚Äôs School in Shakespeare Square, at the east end of Princes Street. In 1815 the family moved to a courtyard off a back lane in the New Town, Edinburgh, 15 Clyde Street. The following year he began extra-mural classes, studying anatomy under Dr John Barclay. He remained friends with Barclay until his death. Due to his background he decided to combine his love of horses with the study of anatomy, and at Barclay‚Äôs suggestion, travelled to London late in 1817, to specifically study as a veterinary surgeon under Edward Coleman in Camden Town. The study here was brief and he received his Diploma in January 1818 after three months.https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/2199/Loc%20Vet%20Educ%20?sequence=1 He returned to Edinburgh to establish his own veterinary college, based at his father‚Äôs courtyard, and with the support of his sister, Mary Dick, and a patron, John Corse Scott of Sinton. After a slow start, with only 4 students in 1819, greater progress began to be made. The course consisted of two lectures per week for 23 weeks. Covering anatomy and diseases of a range of large animals, chiefly farm stock and dogs. He also encouraged his students to attend extra-mural anatomy lectures at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. The college expanded to absorb other buildings on Clyde Street over the next 20 years. The process was executed in liaison with the Highland Society, who at the end of the course issued a certificate, following an oral examination, to say the student was competent to practice \\"the veterinary art\\". After much fame and success Queen Victoria appointed him as Veterinary to the Queen in 1838 and the Clyde Street premises displayed a royal coat-of- arms from that date.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/901b/f29d782161ad6829f572b520bdc8fedee9b8.pdf By his death in 1866 he had trained 818 students who had gone on to practice around the globe. He died on 4 April 1866 and was buried in New Calton Burial Ground overlooking his original birthplace and family home just to the south. The grave lies just to the north-east of the central crossing of the main paths, facing west. His will stipulated that his fortune on death must be held in trust and used to continue to run the college. Following his death the college was briefly run by Colonel James Hallen, but Hallen was obliged to travel to India to tackle an outbreak of cattle plague. In May 1867 William Williams took over as principal.The New Veterinary College, Edinburgh, 1873 to 1904, CM Warwick and AA MacDonald Legacy In 1906 the College was officially named the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College by Act of Parliament.

Reduced to ruins by the fighting of World War II, the ruins of the establishment remain on the grounds of Naval Base Guam on the west side of the island. In 1901, the Commercial Pacific Cable Company offered to lay a cable between the Continental United States and Guam at no cost to the federal government. In 1903 the company began construction of a series of buildings near what was the small village of Sumay. Designed to be proof against typhoons, earthquakes, and other perils, the complex included the main cable station building, several buildings of living quarters, and a self-contained water supply system. The cable connecting Guam to Hawaii was completed in June 1903, marking the complete encirclement of the globe by communications cables. This station became a major communications hub, eventually also housing cables to China and the island of Yap, and becoming an early-warning center for typhoons. Operation of the cable was interrupted by the Japanese capture of Guam in 1941. It resumed with the liberation of Guam in 1944, but continued only until 1951, when the cable between Guam and Hawaii was broken. Since then the remains of the cable station have been succumbing to the elements. Its remains were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

Life  Theophylact was the son of Damian Dalassenos, the first attested member of the distinguished Dalassenos aristocratic clan. He first appears in 998, when he accompanied his father, then holding the post of doux of Antioch, in battle against the Fatimids. In the resulting Battle of Apamea Damian was killed and Theophylact, along with his brother Constantine, were taken prisoner. They were then sold on to the Fatimid general Jaysh al-Samsama for 6,000 gold dinars, spending the next ten years in captivity in the Fatimid capital of Cairo. Following his release he continued his military career, but his life is obscure until 1021/22, by which time, according to Yahya of Antioch, he held the rank of protospatharios and droungarios (most likely the post of droungarios tes viglas). In August 1022, Emperor Basil II (reigned 976‚Äì1025) appointed him strategos (military governor) of the Anatolic Theme and gave him money to raise troops, with the task of suppressing the rebellion of Nikephoros Xiphias and Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos. In the end, the two rebels fell out and Xiphias had Phokas assassinated; as the rebellion collapsed, Dalassenos took Xiphias prisoner and brought him for trial to Constantinople. From his surviving seals of office, it is known that he further held the rank of the posts of katepano of Iberia (likely before 1021), and katepano of Vaspurakan (after 1027). His last post, likely in 1032‚Äì34, was that of doux of Antioch, with the ranks of anthypatos patrikios and vestes, also attested by a seal. Emperor Michael IV the Paphlagonian (r. 1034‚Äì41) however suspected the Dalassenoi of conspiring to usurp the throne; Theophylact's career therefore probably ended in 1034, and the entire family was banished in August 1039. Another seal records that he held the supreme court rank of magistros as well, but it is unclear whether this was already before 1034 or whether he was awarded it after Michael IV's death. Theophylact was most likely the father of Adrianos, the maternal grandfather of Anna Dalassene, the mother of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, founder of the Komnenian dynasty.

History The first Udet aircraft to be built was the single-seater Udet U 1 designed by Hans Henry Herrmann in the winter of 1921/22 with a 22 kW two-cylinder Haacke HFM-2 engine. Although the fuselage was designed with two seats, only one seat was installed due to the low-powered engine. The first flight took place in May 1922. The refined U 2, which was ready for series production in the winter of 1922, had been designed with two seats. It had a wingspan of 8.9 m, was about 6 m long and was driven by the same Haacke engine as the U 1.Flight, 16 August 1923 - The Udet monoplane. At least four machines of this type were built. On January 1, 1923 Herrmann then officially became chief designer at Udet in Ramersdorf. The U 4 retained the design features of the U 2 but was now equipped with a 40 kW Siemens-Halske Sh 4 radial engine. The U 6 and U 10 were further refined designs. Developed in the summer of 1923 the U 6 had the same dimensions as the U 4, but was equipped with a 62 kW Siemens-Halske Sh 5 engine, a roll bar over the front seat and an aerodynamically rounded fin . With the following U 10, some competition successes were achieved. This type was again equipped with the Sh 4 engine, but had the wingspan increased to 10.5 m. A U 10a was also tested with light metal floats. A total of 10 aircraft of this type were sold. The high-wing U 5 proved to have poor performance, but the larger and stronger U 8 was used in some copies in the regular service. The U 8b variant was the first aircraft in Germany to be equipped with slats. The ultralight U 7 Kolibri (hummingbird) used a half-litre capacity Douglas engine, had a 10 m wingspan and weighed only 250 kg. The type was known for its success on the Wasserkuppe in 1924. Nevertheless, only two U 7s were built. However, the best-known Udet type was the U 12 \\"Flamingo\\", which first flew on 7 April 1925 and was built not only in Germany, but also in Austria, Hungary and the Baltic States. The largest aircraft type was the four-engine U 11 \\"Kondor\\" with a fuselage in metal construction, the wings, however, were made of wood. The company entered new technological territory with the U 11 as only Junkers, Dornier and Rohrbach were building metal aircraft in Germany at the time.. The failure of the \\"Kondor\\" was one of the reasons that the company ran into financial difficulties. A last type was designed for the maritime competition in 1926, the U 13 floatplane.Flight, 29 July 1926 - The German Seaplane Competition. The design suffered problems from the start and turned out to be completely unfit. Ernst Udet left in 1925, he was followed at the end of February 1926 by Erich Scheuermann, whereupon Hans Herrmann temporarily took over the company. On 24 August 1926, the company was finally liquidated and the remaining assets were taken over by the government. The remains of Udet Flugzeugbau GmbH were merged with Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) which later became Messerschmitt. A new factory was built in Augsburg which continued to build the U 12 in several versions as the BFW U 12 .

When he returns from his trip away, Fletch's wife, Natalie (Claire Cage) starts to worry that Fletch is having an affair and he denies her worries. Tess then ends the affair with Fletch after finding out that Natalie is beginning to worry but they stay friends. Fletch later comes clean to Natalie that he has had an affair but he does not reveal who with. Tess becomes worried when Fletch is involved in an accident and feels guilty when Natalie confides in Tess about Fletch's affair. She feels a further guilt when Natalie wants Tess' help when delivering their baby boy. Tess is injured in a train crash and nearly dies, but Fletch saves her. Natalie then realises that Fletch had an affair with Tess, not an agency nurse and ends her marriage with him. Fletch leaves Holby ED after an emotional farewell with Tess. Tess is involved in a serious road traffic accident travelling with Connie Beauchamp, Martin Ashford, Ethan Hardy and Lily Chao (Amanda Mealing, Patrick Robinson, George Rainsford and Crystal Yu), which ends in turmoil when the minibus explodes whilst paramedic Jeff is still inside. Her attitude towards her colleagues changes following the death of Jeff and her break-up with Fletch, especially with Zoe and young nurses, Robyn Miller and Lofty Chiltern (Amanda Henderson and Lee Mead). Tess steps down as Clinical Nurse Manager, to help set up a new health centre as a secondment. She returns two weeks later as a Band 7 Ward Sister, with Rita Freeman (Chloe Howman) having taken over her previous position. Following her return, Tess has several quieter months, assisting Charlie with the recovery of his heroin-addict son Louis (Gregory Forsyth- Foreman). After seeing the torment that Charlie goes through with Louis, Tess leaves a voicemail for her son Sam, asking him whether he is happy and telling him she is always there for him. He then returns to Holby, surprising Tess with a visit, alongside his newborn son Charlie. Sam asks Tess to move to Leeds with him and be a grandmother to his son. Tess struggles to make decision as her life is in Holby and the ED, but with Charlie's assistance, she makes the choice of moving to Leeds to be with Sam and his son. Charlie is said to be helping her move to Leeds and settle in. The following week, Tess appears through a video message to Zoe, wishing her luck for her hen party and wedding as well as noting she is enjoying life as a grandmother. Rita also takes over responsibility for leading Zoe's hen party after Tess' departure. Development The BBC described her as \\"a traditionalist [...] dedicated [and] well-balanced\\". They expand: \\"She may be viewed as a kill-joy and inflexible but her immaculate, business-like front masks a wicked, dry, sense of humour. She's a control freak, not to be messed with\\". In 2012, Inside Soap described Charlie and Tess as 'the mum and dad of Casualty'. Current producer Nikki Wilson talked about the importance of Charlie and Tess saying, \\"I think it's really crucial that we keep them around. Charlie has been in the show for 25 years, and he's such an iconic character. It's fantastic he's still here. His relationship with Tess is quite important - as you say, they're like the parents of the whole department - so long may it continue.\\" In 2014, series producer Erika Hossington spoke to Digital Spy about the upcoming series and plans for the thirtieth anniversary, and also mentioned that in the first half of series 29, Tess will be driven by the team discovering her relationship with Fletch. \\"She's got to deal with that discovery and for a while, Tess becomes very starchy and very focused on work.

During its five decade existence, Cemp became one of the largest privately owned companies in Canada. At its peak it controlled assets worth tens of billions in dollars of assets in major distilling, commercial real estate development, oil and gas, and entertainment companies across North America. History and corporate structure In 1951 the Bronfman family established two holding companies to hold the assets of the children of brothers Samuel and Allan, beginning with Seco Ltd. which held the stock in Distillers-Seagram Co. Ltd.: Cemp for the four children of Samuel, and Edper Investments for the two children of Allen. Each company was an amalgam of the children's names. Cemp's ownership was by a variety of trusts established to minimize exposure to taxes. When established, ownership was assigned 33% to Charles, 28% to Edgar, 18% to Minda, and 21% to Phyllis. Over time this changed depending on varying amounts of money withdrawn by each of the four. Cemp in turn was assigned 70% of Seco Ltd. and Edper 30%. Seco Ltd. held the siblings' shares in the family distilling empire, Distillers- Seagram Co. Ltd. Within a decade of its inception, Edper sold its share of Seco Ltd. to Cemp for CAD $16.6 million (approximately US$15 million), leaving the Montreal-based branch of the family the sole owner. In Canada the company focused primarily in commercial real estate and the liquor business. Starting in the early 1960s most of the Cemp's acquisitions and diversification were in the United States through its New York-based Seagram subsidiary, Seagram Co. Ltd. For much of its history, Cemp was run by Leo Kolber, who served as president. Following the death of Samuel Bronfman in 1971, control of Cemp and its subsidiaries was shared between brothers Charles (in Montreal) and Edgar (in New York). In 1987 Charles Bronfman announced that Cemp was to be dissolved and the assets distributed to its individual family-member owners. At the time its major asset was a 40% stake in Cadillac Fairview Corp. Charles Bronfman said he would transfer his Cemp assets, as well as his own personal 16.5% stake in Seagram, into his own company, Claridge Investments.

Cadillac Fairview In 1958 Cemp established property developer Fairview Corporation. Its premiere development was the Mies van der Rohe-designed Toronto-Dominion Centre, an office tower complex that expanded to include multiple towers totaling over 4 million square feet. In 1974 Fairview merged with the Cadillac Development Corporation, which was founded in 1953 in Guelph, Ontario. Cemp owned 40% of the new Toronto-based Cadillac Fairview Corporation (CF). Together with partners Toronto-Dominion Bank and department store T. Eaton Company, it developed Vancouver's Pacific Centre and the Toronto Eaton Centre, each local landmarks.

He was also a specialist on Cam and Minangkabau languages.  Biography   1954‚Äì1975  Issued from a family farmer, he was the oldest of four children. He studied at the Petit and Grand S√©minaries of Laval before joining Missions Etrang√®res de Paris on 20 September 1954. Ordained on 29 June 1957 at Laval, soon after he was sent to Viet Nam for his first mission of Nha Trang. He studied Vietnamese at Banam (about 60 km southeast Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia).G√©rard Moussay and Brigitte Appavou, \\"R√©pertoire des membres de la Soci√©t√© des Missions Etrang√®res 1659-2004\\", Paris, Les Indes Savantes, 2004, 603 p. In 1954, when Viet Nam was divided into the North and the South of the 17th parallel, some hundreds of thousands of northern refugees (mostly devout Catholics) were settled by small groups in different southern provinces especially where the field was not yet exploited because most of them came from the countryside in the North. So between 1958 and 1968, G√©rard Moussay was in charge of these Catholics in two provinces of Ninh Thu√¢n and Binh Tuy. Particularly he founded two parishes of Hi√™p Nghia and Hi√™p An. Close to his parishioners and being good at language, he spoke impeccable Vietnamese. It was not rare hearing from him a popular expression as \\" √¥ng Ke \\" (M. Ke an imaginary terrible man picking up children who don‚Äôt behave themselves, so when they cry or don‚Äôt want to sleep their mother reminds them of M. Ke) or a proverb as \\"an trai nho ke tr√¥ng c√¢y\\" (literally: eating a fruit to remember who plants the tree). In 1968, on the consent of his fellow-members about the newly redefined activities of Missions Etrang√®res de Paris and encouraged by his bishop he settled in Phan Rang (Ninh Thu√¢n Province) among Cam people Chams. In early 1970‚Äôs, they were around 40 000 including Cam inhabitants in the neighbourhood (Phan Ri).G√©rard Moussay, \\"Coup d‚Äô≈ìil sur les Cam d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© des Etudes Indochinoises, Saigon, n¬∞2, 1971, pp.363-372 Two thirds of this population \\"follow a religion which was no doubt Brahmanism in the past but it is now only a distant souvenir of the religion coming from India\\". The last third are the so-called Banis who are descendants of Cam families who have opted for Islam since 14th or 15th century. These two communities have their villages, theirs clergies, their own rites. They don‚Äôt get married between them but keeping their relationship (same Cam calendar and some formal occasions). A small part of this ethnic group establishes in southwestern Viet Nam not far from the border of Cambodia. In this country however were living the majority of Cam people. That was what pointed out G√©rard Moussay when he had arrived into Phan Rang. He set up there the Cam Cultural Centre to study Cam language and to form a team of researchers with the cooperation of old Cam scholars. They collected ancient texts, translated them and published them. A Cam- Vietnamese-French dictionary was issued in 1971.  1976‚Äì1993  July 1976, G√©rard Moussay reached Padang diocese on the western coast of Sumatra Indonesia. Before leaving Paris, he did follow an intensive course of Indonesian organized at the head office of Missions Etrangeres de Paris.Pierre Labrousse, \\"G√©rard Moussay (1932-2012)\\", Archipel, Paris, n¬∞ 84, 2012, pp.3-6 Afterwards, he was instructed in Minangkabau language. The close link between these languages with that of Cam people made his task easier. Between August 1978 and May 1979, he undertook a course of Arabic and islamology at Rome. Devoting to his duty of assistant-priest (1978-1981) then priest (1981-1993) at Bukittinggi, meanwhile he drew up the grammar of Minangkabau language in which he had a doctorate at School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)) in 1982. To prepare a Minangkabau-Indonesian-French dictionary, G√©rard Moussay and his Minang contributors were examining in systematic manner all newspapers and magazines occurred between 1965 and 1990. Throughout this work he wished to introducing \\"a Minangkabau language such as one spokes it and such as one writes it today \\".G√©rard Moussay, \\"Dictionnaire Minangkabau-Indon√©sien-Fran√ßais\\", 2 tomes, Paris, L‚ÄôHarmattan, 19951328 p. Furthermore, by means of references might be found out all of literature of proverbs, sentences, popular stories‚Ä¶. This dictionary will be published only in 1995 in Paris.  1993‚Äì2012  Early 1993, G√©rard Moussay was appointed to carry out the Archives of Missions Etrang√®res de Paris of which he was in charge until his death early 2012. Throughout these years, with the help of some assistants he made an inventory of numerous documents such as dictionaries, travel books, correspondence between missionaries‚Ä¶ throughout continents and centuries. He remade the internal organization in view to receiving researchers and students putting at their disposal, along with his own experience, the documentary treasures dating back to many centuries. Under his direction were published many books (directories of follow-members of Missions Etrang√®res, their bibliographies ... ). He took an active part during the exhibition celebrating the 350th anniversary of Missions Etrang√®res‚Äôs foundation in 2008.

The stadium was named after R.F.E. Cooke, a local banker, and had been the site of local baseball games. Baseball In 1922, the stadium was refurbished and the Philadelphia Phillies held their spring training there from 1922 until 1924. According to news reports at the time, the refurbishment called for the field to be \\"cleared, leveled, clayed and sodded, a grandstand and a board fence built, all in less than three months.\\" Reports also state that the city even had to cut down trees southwest of center field and fill in a big hollow in another corner. On March 14, 1923, Rogers Hornsby and the St. Louis Cardinals played an exhibition game against the Phillies at Cooke Field. That same March, sharpshooter Annie Oakley, who had a residence in Leesburg, performed a shooting exhibition for the practicing Phillies' players. Phillies' manager Art Fletcher stated in 1924 that \\"As long as I am manager of the team, I shall do all I can to come back to Leesburg for spring training.\\" However, in the Phillies did not return to the city in 1925. After the Phillies left for McKechnie Field, located in Bradenton, Cooke Field fell into disrepair. Many local players referred to the stadium as \\"Sand Spur Field\\", due to the high amount of sand spurs present in grass. The Leesburg Spiders, part of the Negro baseball leagues used the field from 1925 to 1930. Football When Leesburg High School started their football program in 1926, the team used the field for football practices and games. However the local Chamber of Commerce, along with several civic club members and people from the community promoted a drive to build the school a stadium. In 1951 Leesburg High School's football began play at Memorial Field was dedicated to war veterans and victims of World War II. Demolition In 1936, the city built the Ballpark at Venetian Gardens, which became Leesburg's premier ballpark. The new ballpark had concrete stands, while Cooke Field still had wooden bleachers. In the early 1950s the stadium was demolished. The site of Cooke Field is currently occupied by the Cutrale Citrus plant.

Every year, the camp is hosted by a different institution (typically schools for the blind or universities) in a European country. Concept The idea behind the camp is very simple. It focuses on enhancing the participants' technical and social skills, both of which are of great importance to enable the students being integrated into mainstream education. The usage of IT and AT is highly encouraged and taught in workshops driven by participants' choice. Also, the participants are supported in the process of choosing their future study and get information how to organise it. Besides that, the participants get to build up and strengthen an international network, which serves as a platform for exchange and advice. Programme The day typically starts with breakfast at 7.30 am. Workshops are held in the morning (9.00 am - 12.00 pm) and afternoon (2.00 pm - 5.00 pm). During the workshops, there are small coffee breaks. In the evening, there are different leisure time activities, as well as the opportunity to go to the city. The participants are basically responsible for themselves, although there are always staff members and volunteers ready to help. There's always an excursion day, on which all the participants can discover a special place near the host. The workshops deal with every aspect of the participants' lives. While there workshops dealing with general life skills, social issues and culture, there are others dealing with specific software (e.g. JAWS). Leisure time activities may differ on the host and its environment. They can again range from crafting to sightseeing. History The efforts to support blind and partially sighted students at the universities of Linz and Karlsruhe led to considerations on how to support the transition from school to university. These considerations encouraged founders Klaus Miesenberger and Joachim Klaus to make up a concept to get in touch with possible students at an early stage. To get some experiences, there was a national computer camp in Austria in 1993. Camps and locations Since 1993, the camp took place in various European countries and brought together about 1700 participants and 1300 staff members. * 1st Integrating Computer Camp 1993, Graz, Austria * 1st International Computer Camp 1994, Graz & Linz, Austria * 2nd International Computer Camp 1995, Graz & Linz, Austria * 3rd International Computer Camp 1996, Graz & Linz, Austria * 4th International Computer Camp 1997, Zeist, Netherlands * 5th International Computer Camp 1998, Villeurbanne and Clermont-Ferrand, France * 6th International Computer Camp 1999, Stockholm, Sweden * 7th International Computer Camp 2000, Stuttgart, Germany * 8th International Computer Camp 2001, Skofja Loka, Slovenia * 9th International Computer Camp 2002, Loughborough, United Kingdom * 10th International Computer Camp 2003, Zollikofen, Switzerland * 11th International Computer Camp 2004, Budapest, Hungary * 12th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2005, Brno, Czech Republic * 13th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2006, K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, Germany * 14th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2007, Espoo, Finland * 15th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2009, Vienna, Austria * 16th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2010, Nea Erithrea, Athens, Greece * 17th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2011, Florence and Ferrara, Italy * 18th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2012, Cluj-Napoca, Romania * 19th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2013, Telƒç, Czech Republic * 20th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2014, Riga, Latvia * 21st International Camp on Communication and Computers 2015, Zeist, the Netherlands http://www.icc-camp.info/index.php?id=history * 22nd International Camp on Communication and Computers 2016, Dresden, Germany * 23rd International Camp on Communication and Computers 2017, Leuven, Belgium * 24th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2018, Zadar, Croatia * 25th International Camp on Communication and Computers 2019, Hereford, United Kingdom * The International Camp 2020 did not happen due to Covid-19, it was going to be in Avero, Portugal In 2021, the ICC takes place in ?, ?.

Biography  Black ovals Simeti started working as an autodidact when he arrived in Rome from Sicily in the 1950s. Rome at the time was one of the most dynamic artistic and cultural spots in Europe. His first art works consisted of collages of fabric, paper and cardboard, in a serial repetition. In the mid-sixties he moved to Milan where a new artistic scene was emerging: he joined there the members of the Zero group, such as Enrico Castellani, Agostino Bonalumi, amongst others. In 1965, Simeti was part of the young generation of Italian artists reunited in the Zero Avantgarde show organized at the Lucio Fontana‚Äôs atelier in Milan alongside Heinz Mack and Otto Piene and many other art pioneers from Europe, South America and Japan. This was a turning point in Simeti's career, who then started holding solo shows, with a particular audience in Germany and Switzerland, and later in Brazil where he lived from some time.  Shaped canvas  The repetition of a module, which is the essence of Simeti's work, draws upon the lesson of Alberto Burri and Lucio Fontana. The monochrome and the modification of the flat surface of the canvas are his distinctive signature. Driven, as the other contemporary members of the Zero group, by a will of zeroing tradition, Simeti uses the ellipse as the main geometrical form around which his visual research is built. He managed to maintain a deep coherence and his production stands out for the use of canvases which surfaces are shaped, altering their classic tension. Acknowledgements In 2014, he was appointed as Artist of the year and so he won a Prize (Premio delle Arti Premio della Cultura) assigned to him by Circolo della Stampa of Milan.

He was active as a rider from around 1837 to around 1863, and as a trainer from the mid-1850s to about 1872, two years before his death. He interspersed his professional racing life with periods concentrating on his farming interests on the Norfolk‚ÄìCambridgeshire borders. His full name was Christopher Green but throughout his professional life he was referred to as Chris or Cris Green.  Early life  His exact date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 16 July 1820 as Christopher Green to William and Mary Green at Upwell, close to Wisbech and the Isle of Ely in the Fenlands of the Norfolk/Cambridgeshire borders. There is nothing in later records to disagree with 1820 being his year of birth. His 1874 obituary writer, styling himself as 'The Sportsman', tells of him learning to ride at a very early age 'whipped in to his father' who hunted a pack of harriers across the 'enormous Fen drains'. He soon earned a name for the daring manner in which he rode.  Early career ‚Äì rider  Chris Green soon obtained his first 'place' on leaving home with Lord Berners but, according to his obituary writer, when he thought it was he that was entitled to the mount (and not George Edwards, the nominated jockey) of Phosphorus, the eventual but unfancied winner of the 1837 Derby, he threw up his engagement. He then moved on to William Rowland Sandiford 'who kept a small stud of flat racers and steeplechasers' at Colkirk House, Colkirk, Norfolk. Bailey's Magazine of Sports & Pastimes illustrates Green's work ethic with three rides in two days for William Rowland Sandiford at the Norfolk and Norwich Steeple Chases on 10 & 11 September 1839 on the 4yr-old bay colt Oliver Twist. A small biography when he hit the public consciousness ten years later mentions that 'in 1839-40 was successful with Thought, Corringham and Longwaist' and there are several race reports of 1840 that mention his wins on these horses. Indeed, one account of a Chase at Diss waxes quite lyrical over Green's handling of the race-winning heavyweight chestnut Thought - 'Mr Green was rider for Mr Sandiford, and Mr Turner of Carlton, was seen mounted on Modesty. It would be hard to find two better Steeple Chase Riders than them ... Green on Thought had a tremendous fall, by his horse swerving against a gate post; although much stunned he was up \\"as quick as Thought,\\" and away went horse and rider at an increased speed ... The riding of Green was much admired, he is not only a good but a most fortunate rider, and has almost invariably ridden the winner, wherever he has appeared this season'. As well as these mostly local races, Thought, ridden by Green, started to take to a wider stage. At the Waltham Abbey Steeple Chase on 9 April 1840 he came second to Jerry, the 1840 Grand National winner, ridden by Jem Mason in a duel that was a credit to both riders, even if the race itself was mismanaged. After this promising start to his career, though, the potted biography of 1850 goes on to say that Christopher Green's farming interests took precedence over his racing and he gave up professional horsemanship. He only 'took to the pigskin again' in 1849. His return in 1849 was marked by a second and a first place at the same meeting on 2 April on Mr Abel's grey mares, Present and Novice, at Stallinghall, just outside Norwich (although Chris Green's name as rider does not appear in contemporary reports). Early 1850 was not so successful - riding Mr Briggs' bay gelding, Hope, he failed to finish both at Louth (on account of a severe fall) on 1 February and Lincoln on 21 February. On both occasions, a rider named Canavan was also unsuccessfully piloting a small bay gelding named Abd-el-Kader. Another obituary of Green was written by this rider, now identified as the Irish rider Charlie Canavan in which fuller details of the Lincoln Steeple Chase and its consequences are given. Abd-el-Kader 'leaped on the wrong side of one of the flags soon after starting and was pulled up' and Hope 'might, nevertheless, have won had he not possessed the most wayward of tempers' and failed at the penultimate fence, as another writer said 'on account of the course being imperfectly flagged'. Chris Green had ridden well enough, though, to confirm to his Irish owner and trainer, Joseph Osborne that he was the rider for Abd-el-Kader in the Grand National in a few days time. He did indeed win, leading from the front, by about a length, in a record time of 9min 57.5sec 'taken by three watches', and Green had ridden the gelding masterfully: 'The judgment with which he steered Abd-el-Kader for this great event betokened an ‚Ä≥artiste‚Ä≥ of no little merit, for he rode throughout with indomitable resolution, steadying the little horse when necessary, and keeping him going in that part of the line where his superior jumping soon made the heavy weights tell.'  Intermediate career ‚Äì rider and trainer  Such a victory propelled him into a different league of steeplechases, horses and trainers. Christopher Green was granted a passport in 1850 which may well mean he was riding abroad. He rode, and won, often for 'Mr Carew' and Ben Land snr. and he is now mainly mentioned by the sporting press only when something out of the ordinary happened. For a while, though, Green had been wanting to set up a training establishment on his own account and so moved back to Littleport in the Isle of Ely (his father's birthplace) where 'he soon got the management of several steeple chase horses' but found 'it was easier to find stabling than a country to train over'. He soon made the acquaintance of Henry Jones of Aps (or Apes) Hall, Littleport which became a long-standing relationship of friendship rather than one of pure business. In the 1850s, Green and Jones, as co-owners, bought Tomyrus (foaled 1851) who had a successful flat and hurdles career. Prince Charlie, Camel, Hester, Avenger, Gownsman 'and other good horses' were all descended from Tomyrus and gave Jones fame and success. Henry Jones also gave him the liberty to train his own stud over his grounds, and one of these was Half Caste (a horse owned by the team of John Gerard Leigh and Samuel Brisco Sheward). Other horses mentioned as being under his management were Old Dog Tray, Lady Hathaway, Abd-el-Kader (by Scutari, and so not the 1850 and 1851 National winner, although Green did ride him unsuccessfully in the 1858 Grand National), The Screw, Fox and Yeoman. Half Caste learnt 'his fine quick style of jumping' at Apes Hall and was prepared for the 1859 Grand National here and finally at Newmarket - Green relocated from Littleport to the premises (off Station Road) lately occupied by W. Smith in Newmarket. A month before the Aintree race, he was still taking in horses for training. The 1859 Grand National was one of the closest in Aintree history. Half Caste, ridden by Green, started second favourite at 100:15 (nearly 7:1), and won 'a most exciting race' from the French horse Jean du Quesne by only a neck and Huntsman was only a length behind them. Green then went on to win twice at the Warwick Spring Meeting which led 'Touchstone', The Era columnist, to say that he 'was extremely fortunate in the steeple chases, having ridden the winners of the two in which the professionals were entitled to ride on Thursday, and as he has undoubtedly placed himself at the head of cross-country riders, having won on three out of the last four different horses he has mounted, only one of which was the favourite'. By 1860, his stud was very well respected with the Sporting Life highlighting Abd-el-Kader, Lord Oswald, Sepoy, Dutch Drops, Physician, King William and, especially, Miss Harkaway as representing 'the stable which is usually as formidable, in cross- country events, as John Day's in the Derby'. For the 1860 Grand National Green rode Sepoy for Captain White (1790‚Äì1866), but even though they were backed to 20:1 (largely on account of his celebrity), they were not mentioned in the race commentaries. Later in that year Abd-el-Kader had to be destroyed at the Upton-on-Severn Steeple Chases on 1 November ‚Äì Green was severely shaken after the stricken horse rolled over him. Chris Green had not severed his links with Henry Jones and nor had he severed his links with top-rank flat racing. He trained Eastern Princess (foaled 1858, a daughter of Tomyrus by Surplice) for Jones and rode her himself in The Oaks of June 1861 at Epsom, although not to any success. Green also entered her in the Berkshire Stakes at Abingdon in July 1861 where she was favourite (at 5 to 4 on). The race was a disaster as Eastern Princess 'overpowered her jockey' (H Bradley) and rushed to the front. Green actually 'ran up to his jockey on the far side... and gave him orders to \\"sit still and hold hard\\" but soon after it was clear her bolt was shot'. Eastern Princess had been favourite on the basis of her performance at Newmarket on 2 and 3 July where she had won the opening Handicap Plate of 50 Sovereigns easily (by three lengths) and the Town Plate of 50 Sovereigns by the same margin (and at a canter) the day after. The race report confirmed that Eastern Princess was trained by Green amongst his jumpers in Newmarket. Later that year saw him training and riding Cockatoo (another Leigh/Sheward horse although run under the nom de course of Mr S Gooderham) in the 1861 Grand National (third favourite at 6:1), but it fell on the second circuit and led to Green being struck and again he was left 'much shaken'. He also trained Yaller Gal for the 1863 Grand National which was seen as being 'not the worst outsider in the world\\" and could cause a betting upset but in the event, ridden by Mr Dixon, she came third. In 1863 Green started jumping his own horse, Reporter ‚Äì a bay colt foaled 1859 in America by Lexington, dam by Glencoe. He actually rode Reporter for victory himself, on the horse's jumping debut, at the Great National Steeple Chase at Lincoln in October 1863 in a close and exciting duel with Socks, 'the victory being mainly attributable to the steady way in which he was ridden by Chris Green'. This seems to be the last winner that Green actually rode himself. Reporter almost immediately then won the Worcestershire Grand Annual Steeple Chase by ten lengths and Green was immediately offered 800 pounds ‚Äì or guineas (¬£840) ‚Äì after the race by rider- trainer John Nightingall of Epsom. Reporter had a solid record at first and he was put up for auction in October 1864 but did not sell. An injury to his foot around mid-1865 blighted his career.  Later career ‚Äì trainer  By the mid-1860s, Chris Green was forging closer links with Lord Poulett, another major racehorse owner. It was reported in late 1865 that Poulett was building a private racecourse and training ground on Soberton Downs in Hampshire (more familiarly known in the Poulett context as Droxford) and had engaged Green as personal trainer. As it was, Green stayed in Newmarket at that stage (Ben Land sen. went to Droxford) but got immediate charge of all the Poulett horses including Cortolvin (who he then trained to be second in the 1866 Grand National). Green's mid-1860s Newmarket premises were in Station Road, very near where it joins the High Street. They were obviously very extensive as they included a vast half-mile wide straw-bed circle which, in hard frosts, other trainers (Blanton, Godding and J Wood are mentioned) he allowed to use. But Green's Newmarket premises were put up for sale at the White Hart Inn on the 13 February 1868 by auctioneer Ebenezer Feist and presumably he, as a quarterly tenant, was obliged to move to other premises in Newmarket at that point. Further details of the property are given though ‚Äì a dwelling house with enclosed court yard, stalls and loose boxes for sixteen horses, hay, corn and straw chambers, carriage houses and an ample supply of spring water, within a short distance of the railway station. Two months later, Green was sending four horses up to the 1868 Grand National (Thalassius, Archimedes, Brick and Daisy) but only Daisy and Thalassius actually ran and neither was placed. The winner was The Lamb, trained by Ben Land snr. for Lord Poulett. 1869 started badly when his horse Reporter cut his foot badly on a stone ‚Äì the wound turned septic and Reporter died a week later of 'lockjaw' (tetanus). Only one of his horses started the 1869 Grand National, Guy of Warwick, and he disgraced himself by refusing at the second fence and exiting the course. The rest of the year was very quiet as well and Green was realising that 'however fit the [Newmarket] Heath might be to train horses for the flat, there is no rough-and-ready country sufficiently near the metropolis of the Turf to keep steeple chasers au fait to their business'. Christopher Green retired back to his farming interests. Ben Land snr., private trainer to Lord Poulett at Droxford, had decided to retire in 1870, and Chris Green was persuaded to take his place in Hampshire in September 1870 where he took charge of such horses as Benazet, Cortolvin and The Lamb. He was given the task of preparing The Lamb, a little iron grey Irish horse, for a second Grand National win and during the winter 'Lord Poulett and his party were exceedingly sanguine of success, and his Lordship caused a private circular to be distributed among his friends telling them to back The Lamb to win'. For the race itself, The Lamb, unseen in public for exactly two years, was paraded by Ben Land jun. and 'was greeted with a buzz of admiration, aroused by his beautiful appearance and condition... No horse in the world could have looked better than The Lamb did'. This testament to Green's work continued in the race as The Lamb kept ahead of the pursuing horses to finally win by a couple of lengths in 'a desperately exciting finish'. It is not known exactly when he gave up his appointment at Droxford, but it has been stated that he 'retired from public life' to reside 'at Wisbech' either at the end of 1871 or upon the death of his father (21 April 1872).  Judgement by his peers  His 1874 obituary writers summarise his record thus... 'As a jockey Chris Green was one of the best and boldest horsemen of any time' and 'As a cross-country jockey he had few equals, for to the most indomitable pluck he added rare judgment, never being taken aback in a difficulty; he had a firm and at the same time elegant seat, and the finest hands. It mattered not what kind of horse he was put on, for he was equally at home on the puller as on the slug.' Praise for him as a trainer was slightly more muted, but, after the 1871 Grand National victory with The Lamb, a correspondent did comment on him in the following terms: 'Chris Green has not had charge of Lord Poulett's horses more than a twelvemonth, and it is something in the trainer's favour that he was able to win a Grand National on the first time of asking'.  Personal life  Christopher Green married Rebecca Bettinson at All Saints, Walsoken, Norfolk, on 19 September 1854. He was aged 34 and she was ten years younger than he She was the second child of Thomas Bettinson, a Walsoken farmer of 190 acres, and his wife Hannah. Green's father, William, farmed 250 acres at Outwell, six miles from Walsoken. Christopher and Rebecca Green had six known children (two of whom died in infancy): # William Warth Green - born Q2 1856 Ely area, Cambridgeshire, baptised Littleport, Cambridgeshire on 8 July 1856 # Tom Bettinson Green - born Q3 1857 Ely area, Cambridgeshire, baptised Littleport, Cambridgeshire on 24 July 1857, died Q1 1858 Ely area, Cambridgeshire # Christopher Green - born Q3 1858 Ely area, Cambridgeshire, baptised Littleport, Cambridgeshire 1858, died Q2 1859 Newmarket area, Cambridgeshire # Rebecca Green - born Q1 1860 Newmarket area, Cambridgeshire, baptised Woodditton, Cambridgeshire on 1 June 1860 # Christopher Green - born Q4 1861 Newmarket area, Cambridgeshire, baptised St Mary, Newmarket, Cambridgeshire on 6 November 1861 # Mary Hannah Green - born Q4 1862 Newmarket area, Cambridgeshire At the same time as his horse, Reporter, was dying in early 1869, it was also reported that his wife and family were 'very ill' but no further details were given. So after an unsuccessful Grand National, Green retired to Walsoken to his farming interests. Soon, though, he was coaxed back to training with Lord Poulett in Hampshire in 1870, taking his family with him. He won the 1871 Grand National but was soon back with his family at Walsoken - sources disagree whether this was in late 1871 or April 1872 when his father died. The life of a gentleman farmer was brought to an abrupt end by the death of his wife, Rebecca, in late 1873, aged just 43. According to the Churchwarden of All Saints, Peter Wadlow, she was buried in the parish graveyard on 22 December 1873. Green did not long survive her and he died two months later on 26 February 1874. The Walsoken parish burial register does not seem to list his burial, but his obituary states that he was laid to rest alongside his wife. The graveyard was closed and largely cleared of monuments in 1971 and so his grave cannot now be pinpointed. Green did leave a valid will, but his executors had either died or were unwilling to act. The probate calendar shows that his brother, James William Green of Upwell, Norfolk, acted as administrator and was also now ward to the four young orphans. He left an estate valued at under ¬£200.  Depictions  An evocative description exists in words from 1867: ‚Ä≥Look at the dapper little fellow, how neatly he sits on the back of the old American horse, Reporter. Notice the jerry-hat, the open but determined, never-say-die, countenance, the polished boots, the burnished spurs, the tight-fitting breeches, the long waistcoat, creaseless coat, and general ‚Ä≤get-up‚Ä≤ of that wiry-looking, ten-stone, five-feet-five specimen of humanity, and tell me if he is a ‚Ä≤character‚Ä≤ when once seen that will never be forgotten.‚Ä≥ Charlie Canavan differs on one point - he states his weight 'when at man's age' did not exceed 9 stone (126 lb or 57 kg). In 1850 ‚Ä≤a correct likeness‚Ä≤ of Chris Green with Abd-el-Kader was commissioned by Joseph Osborne and painted by Henry Thomas Davis. An engraving of this (to match one already made of Raby) was advertised and prints were to be sold for one guinea (21 shillings or ¬£1.05) each through Mr John Moore, publisher and bookmaker. Half Caste, the 1859 Grand National winner, was painted by Henry Barraud later that year. No publicly available image of this painting has been found but a contemporary image of Half Caste with Green up is held by one of Christopher Green's descendants and this may be based on this. The original was sold by Sotheby's, London on 18 July 1979. The very next Sotheby's lot comprised another Henry Barraud painting, entitled \\"Rebecca Green with her son William on a pony\\". No publicly available image of this painting of Green's wife Rebecca, and his eldest son William Warth Green, has been found either.

Built in the later 1890s, the factory differs from other industrial buildings of its day because of its ornate facade. It was home to medical supplier Betz & Co. (1895‚Äì1905), the Swedish American Telephone Company (1905‚Äì1923), and the Denoyer-Geppert Co. (1923‚Äì1985). History The Ravenswood Land Company purchased along the Chicago & North Western tracks in Edgewater in 1868. At the time, the railroad had stops to the north at Rosehill Cemetery and to the south at Ravenswood Manor. In 1875, the railroad opened a stop at Summerdale, west of this site. Plans were in place to develop a residential community there by 1890. The neighborhood became known as Andersenville by its early Norwegian settlers‚Äîlater Swedish settlers changed the name to Andersonville, and the Summerdale name fell into disuse. The Swedish American Telephone Company Building was the first major industrial building in the Andersonville district of Edgewater. A sizable employer, the factory building spurred residential growth in the surrounding area. It was the first building of what would become an industrial corridor along the CNW tracks. The factory building housed three significant companies in succession. Frank Betz was a former real estate developer who lost his fortune in the Panic of 1893, but quickly recovered as a manufacturer of bath cabinets. In 1899, he decided to expand his operations to include other supplies for hospitals and physicians. This required a larger manufacturing space, so he built a three-story building here; it was attached to two existing buildings in 1901, creating the large complex that stands today. By 1904, Betz & Co. had outgrown the Andersonville factory and moved to Hammond, Indiana. When the patent on telephones expired in 1894, the Swedish American Telephone Company was one of the many small operations founded to supply the industry. Swedish American sold most of their products to the Chicago Telephone Co., a monopoly in the area. In 1902, the company was sold to Stromberg-Carlson, which itself was sold to Eastern Industrialist the next year. By 1905, Swedish American required a larger building to manufacture its products and moved into the recently vacated Betz & Co. building. The next tenant was the Denoyer-Geppert Company, who moved into the building in 1923. They were best known for their educational pull-down maps for classrooms. They also manufactured models of human features for medical schools and developed educational film strips. The company was purchased by Rand McNally in 1984. Shortly after they moved out, the building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

The NKKK was an economic development company established by the Empire of Japan to develop the territories of the South Seas Mandate, which it oversaw between the First and Second World Wars. In the Northern Marianas, the company aggressively developed arable areas for sugar cane farming, importing workers from Japan, Okinawa, and Korea. Each of the three major islands (Tinian, Saipan, and Rota) had major support facility. On Tinian, this area, now roughly where the island's largest community, San Jose is located on the south coast, consisted of an extensive development, most of which was destroyed during the Battle of Tinian in the Second World War. Of this large complex, only four buildings or structures remain, all of which have been listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places, as rare surviving examples of pre-war Japanese architecture on the islands. Administration building The remains of the NKKK Administration Building are on the west side of San Jose, consisting of an unpainted concrete frame whose wooden elements, including the roof, are long gone. The frame measures wide, long, and is about tall. The main entrance, to the east, is identifiable by a canopy with unique fascia detailing not found on other surviving NKKK buildings in the region. When listed on the National Register in 1981, the structure was being used for storage, and its concrete was deteriorating. Laboratory building This building is a two-story unpainted concrete structure, measuring about with a wood-framed metal roof. Its window openings have Japanese-style concrete canopies sheltering them. It was one of the few two-story NKKK buildings, and is the only of the company's known laboratory building to survive. When listed on the National Register in 1981, it was being used as a private residence. Ice storage building The ice storage building, the only surviving building of its type in the islands, is located just north of the House of Taga. It is a single-story unpainted concrete structure, and tall. It has a single entrance at the northwest corner, and another opening on the west side. The interior is divided into two spaces by a concrete wall, the larger space serving as the main storage area. The roof is flat tar pitch covered with concrete tiles. Two of the exterior walls have wainscoting that is a cement mortar mixed with small aggregate. The building suffered some war damage to the west wall and the interior dividing wall. Unknown utility building One of the NKKK's surviving buildings has an unknown purpose. It is a single-story unpainted concrete structure, and tall. The only openings are a door and window on the north facade. Both were originally sheltered by concrete canopies, but that over the window was destroyed in the war. The original roof was also destroyed; it was apparently a gently-sloping shed roof. The building's form is distinctive among surviving NKKK buildings in the Marianas. It was listed on the National Register as a \\"Japanese Structure\\".

Noel (16 April 1905 - June 1977), of Montclair, New Jersey, murdered cab driver Raymond Pearce and six-year-old Mary Daly in an apparent copycat kidnapping in early September 1925. He was condemned to death but the sentence was upended on appeal by reason of insanity. Noel was committed to an institution and died in Trenton, New Jersey in 1977. Early life Noel was born in Manhattan, New York on 16 April 1905 and moved five years later to Montclair, New Jersey, where he was living with his mother and stepfather at the time of the murder case. He exhibited signs of a mental disorder while in college and spent time in Overbrook Hospital for the Insane in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. Evidence and criminal charges Raymond Pearce Raymond Pearce, an African-American cab driver, was last seen near the Montclair railroad station on the afternoon of 3 September 1925. His body was discovered by a passerby along the roadway near the Peckham river in Cedar Grove two days later. Pearce had been shot in the back of the head with a .32 caliber steel- jacketed bullet. His cab was found in the woods in Cedar Grove later that day. Noel's vehicle happened to have been spotted in Cedar Grove near a stone quarry on 4 September and reported to the police by the wife of the local chief of police. Noel was apprehended and taken to police headquarters. In a search of Noel's home, police discovered a variety of the weed Beggar's lice, which could be commonly found in the woods where Pearce's cab was abandoned. Also found was a box of .32 caliber ammunition and a receipt for a Spanish automatic pistol purchased from a sporting goods store in New York and shipped to an address in Little Falls, New Jersey. The Little Falls postmaster identified Noel as having received a package of a size and shape appropriate for the delivery of the pistol only days after the purchase date on the receipt. The pistol was found in Pearce's recovered vehicle. Blood stains were found in the vehicle and on clothes found in Noel's home. John Sandin John Sandin, a chauffeur, followed Noel's vehicle on 4 September after a commotion in front of the Montclair where he was polishing his vehicle. Witnesses pointed Sandin towards Noel's vehicle and a chase ensued. When Sandin pulled up next to the vehicle, Noel shot him in the head and seriously wounded him. Sandin reported that Noel had a young girl in the vehicle. Mary Daly Noel kidnapped Mary Daly, a six-year-old girl, from in front of her Montclair home on 4 September, with the intent to collect a $4,000 ransom. Inexplicably, Noel shot her in the head and killed her and left her body in a back roads area of Little Falls. Noel led the police to the body and provided a written statement. Noel claimed to have been inspired to commit the kidnapping by the 1924 trial of Leopold and Loeb, who were famously defended by Clarence Darrow. Legal process Noel was charged with two counts of murder in the first degree. A strong insanity defense was waged. He was tried in the Essex oyer and terminer and found guilty with no recommendation from the jury to commute the sentence to life imprisonment. He was sentenced to death in the electric chair. William A. Wachenfeld, his lawyer, obtained a writ of error from Chancellor Walker, which stayed the execution, pending an appeal hearing. The appeal court, the Court of Errors and Appeals, found Noel insane. Noel was committed to the Greystone Park Psychiatric Center in Morris County, New Jersey. Trial Aftermath Public opinion blamed Noel's father and the director of the mental institution for having him released, thereby allowing Noel to commit his crimes. There was also strong public sentiment against insanity pleas.

History  In 1946, Clay Holland sold the hotel to George Hotels, Inc. under the control of Lawrence George of Mount Pleasant, Texas. Mr. George ran the hotel for three years, and in 1949 sold it to Frank Hofues. In 1957, Mr. Hofues died. The trustees of the Mr. Hofues' estate sold the hotel in 1957 to James C. Henderson, who in turn, has financial difficulties, and in 1959, the facilities were deeded to I.C. Roark, who continued to operate the hotel for about 10 years. Then in 1969, the hotel was closed down. and all the equipment and furnishings were sold. The building remained empty for several years. Then in 1972, Gene Henddryx arranged to purchase the hotel from Mr. Roark's estate, with the stipulation that all the furnishing be removed from the building. Therefore an auction was held and Hendryx took control of the building and completed a renovation, changing it from a hotel to an office building. In 1985, the McFarland family, Robert, Myra Jo, and their daughter Carla, purchased the Holland Hotel, with Carla McFarland as the general manager, and slowly turned it back to a hotel as tenants' leases expired. They opened an upscale restaurant called McFarland's that is still talked about. This was followed by a number of quality restaurants until the McFarlands sold the property in the first decade of the 21st century. The McFarland family, especially Carla, is the longest- standing owner to date of over 20 years. In the early 21st century, Carla McFarland hired Texas muralist, Style Read, along with other local artisans, to restore the Holland's lobby to the grandeur of the Trost and Trost original design. A surprising palette of color was discovered and the hotel took on a festive atmosphere. Much of that work was covered up by new owners. In September 2011, The Holland Hotel was acquired by Greenwich Hospitality Group, which restored the building to its former glory with 24 guest rooms and a full-service restaurant, The Century Bar and Grill.

Downstream, one arm is channeled towards the √âtang Saum√¢tre, another joined the Canal Boucanbrou and the Trou Ca√Øman. Geography Rivi√®re Blanche has its source around the Pic la Selle, which rises to 2,680 meters above sea level, overlooking the mountains of peak. This river forms several arms when it arrives in the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac. In the past, the Rivi√®re Blanche flowed into lakes whose arms are channeled either to the northeast of the √âtang Saum√¢tre, or to the northwest of the Trou Ca√Øman. The former name for this was called the Rivi√®re du Boucan Brou, however today, these arms are channeled under the name Boucanbrou or the Canal Boucambrou. During the rainy season, the Rivi√®re Blanche becomes impetuous and overflows its banks, especially because the Canal Boucanbrou is not curetted and clear of the mud that reduces the flow of water. It floods partly in the Plaine of the Cul-de- Sac in the east of the agglomeration of Port-au-Prince. Canalization of the river In 1954, Hurricane Hazel moved large sedimentary land in the valley of the Rivi√®re Blanche, forming a sediment dam spanning 192 km¬≤ and diverting the course of the Rivi√®re Blanche from its natural bed. Its waters found an outlet downstream in the flowing direction of the √âtang Saum√¢tre. In January 2014, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Association of Agricultural Producers was signed, to correct the alignment of the Rivi√®re Blanche to re-groove its original channel over a length of 5.5 km long, and by harnessing to strengthen this part of the river course weak.

Nagasawa died in 1934, but the round barn he constructed at Fountaingrove was a landmark in Sonoma County. Early life Nagasawa was born in Kagoshima, Japan, on February 2nd, 1852, a member of the Satsuma clan and the son of a samurai. At age 12 or 13, he was one of 15 Satsuma students smuggled out of Japan and sent to the United Kingdom to learn Western customs, technology and systems. At this time, he was granted a new name by his lord in order to protect his family from any possible legal repercussions as most foreign travel was forbidden at the time. Nagasawa, being too young for university, was sent to Aberdeen, Scotland, to live with the family of Thomas Blake Glover and attend school. In Scotland, he met English nobleman Laurence Oliphant, who was a disciple of Thomas Lake Harris and had been asked to find potential recruits for his New York State commune. Oliphant took Nagasawa, along with five other Satsuma students, to New York to join Harris' community there. Nagasawa studied at Cornell University for one year in 1870. While the other students who had left Japan with Nagasawa returned home shortly afterwards, he stayed with Harris and eventually followed him out to California when Harris left Brocton, New York. Fountaingrove destroyed by wildfire in 2017. Nagasawa arrived in California in 1875 at age 23. The community Harris established in Santa Rosa was named Fountaingrove, and the ranch encompassed 1,000 acres. Harris brought winemaker Dr. John Hyde to the property to plant grapes and instruct the disciples in viticulture. Nagasawa became winemaker after Hyde left, and made wine for the Brotherhood of the New Life's store in New York City as well as for the British Isles. Nagasawa introduced California wines to the international world, including Europe and Japan. The wine won several medals and was widely marketed. Harris attributed the wine's success to the spiritual qualities of the Fountain Grove community. Harris left Fountain Grove in 1891, though, after journalist Alzire Chevaillier wrote several articles for the San Francisco Chronicle saying that the commune leader was a charlatan. Harris died in 1906 without ever returning to Fountain Grove, and Nagasawa took over the estate. When Harris eventually died in 1906, he became the leader of The Brotherhood of the New Life and lead the cult until his death. By 1916, however, he was the only cult member still resident at Fountaingrove, and although other members visited from time to time, missionary activity had effectively ceased during the later years of Harris' life. Nagasawa became the top wine producer in California. In Japan, he earned the \\"Wine King of California\\" nickname, and has been described as \\"the Robert Mondavi of his time.\\" In 1915, he helped run the Japanese Exhibit at the Panama-Pacific Exhibition in San Francisco. He was often referred to as \\"Prince Nagasawa\\" or \\"Baron Nagasawa\\" because of his samurai heritage, and hosted extravagant parties at Fountaingrove throughout Prohibition, at which the wine flowed freely. Death and legacy Nagasawa lived into the early 20th century, enduring growing anti-Japanese sentiment in America. Despite efforts to pass the Fountaingrove property on to his relatives, including his American-born grand-nephew and grand-niece, the land was sold in an estate sale. The property became a cattle ranch, and today is largely a residential development, although several hundred acres are still planted. Nagasawa's round barn was a landmark in Santa Rosa, and a 33-acre park was named in his honor in 2007.

It is classified in the family Mycoplasmataceae, order Mycoplasma, class Mollicutes, phylum Firmicutes and domain Bacteria. Many organisms of the genus Mycoplasma are known pathogens in humans and animal species. Mycoplasma alligatoris is known to elicit a fatal disease with inflammatory characteristics that can cause rapid death of alligators and caimans.  Discovery  Mycoplasma alligatoris was first isolated in a study led by D. R. Brown of six captive alligators showing signs of pneumonia, polyserositis (inflammation of serous membranes), and multifocal arthritis. The isolates were obtained from various organs, blood, synovial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid and subject to various experimental tests for identification purposes. Primary isolates were cultured in ATCC medium 98 agar containing 105 U penicillin G 1‚àí1, 10 5 U polymyin B 1 ‚àí1, 65 mg cefoperazone 1 ‚àí1 and 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 atmosphere or in ambient air. Isolates were then grown at seven different temperatures in an anaerobic environment, reaching optimum growth at 30 to 34 ¬∞C. Cultures were diluted in broth medium then passed through membrane filters of various pore diameters, yielding similar results for all nine isolates. Diluted isolates were then tested for reversion, a method of genetic stabilization unique to some bacteria, in both broth and agar medium. No reversion was observed. Isolates were grown in broth medium with large (20%) and minute (0.2%) amounts of fetal bovine serum as a sterol source. Growth was inhibited in the latter, indicating dependence on an outside sterol source for growth. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced, yielding a unique sequence, suggesting the discovery of a previously unidentified organism. The Brown study in 2001 further investigated the pathogenicity of the newly discovered M. alligatoris by inoculation of four healthy alligators with the bacteria and one control alligator inoculated with sterile broth. Three of the experimental alligators died within three weeks of inoculation. The surviving alligator tested free of M. alligatoris after 14 weeks, further supporting the researchers suspicions of the new isolate as the cause of the investigated symptoms.  Preliminary characterization  Mycoplasma alligatoris is a non- motile chemoorganoheterotroph found in American alligators. It has an optimum growth temperature range of 30-34 ¬∞C. The DNA sequence for M. alligatoris type strain A21JP2T was obtained through random shotgun sequencing, revealing a genome size of 1040‚Äì1060 kb, with 89% being coding sequences. The M. alligatoris genome has a 26% G+C content. DNA analysis identified genes of the N-acetylneuraminate scavenging and catabolism pathway. Biochemical tests including metabolism of glucose, mannose, lactose, sucrose, arginine, aesculin, urea and phosphatase activity performed on M. alligatoris isolates showed that the organism ferments glucose, mannose, lactose, and sucrose and displays phosphatase activity. DNA sequencing analysis revealed genes encoding a complement of glycosidases, which include hyaluronidases, two sialidases, three Œ≤-galactosidases, Œ±-amylase (glycogenase), and two glycosyltransferases. M. alligatoris differs from other species of the Mycoplasma genus by the aforementioned complement of sialidases, which are enzymes of the hydrolase class.  Pathogenicity  Comparisons of the M. alligatoris genome and that of its nearest known relative, Mycoplasma crocodyli, were analyzed in hopes of understanding the unusually aggressive nature of the M. alligatoris species. Mycoplasma crocodyli is much less virulent than M. alligatoris, lacking the genes for adhesins, variable surface antigens, and sialidases found in M. alligatoris. Sialidase, in combination with hyaluronidase, is thought to act as a virulence factor responsible for the pathogenicity of the organism, working together as potential promoters of the expression of CD95 (FasR). CD95 is a protein involved in mediated cell death of eukaryotic cells. In a study done in 2005, researchers used immunofluorescence imaging to observe the outcome of M. alligatoris in vitro on apoptosis by cardiac fibroblasts of alligators. Results of the study showed that M. alligatoris produces an infection that changes the morphology in cardiac fibroblasts, increasing CD95 expression leading to cell death.  Ecological impact  Experimental inoculation of American alligators (Alligator mississippienis), Siamese crocodiles (Crocdylus siamensis), and broad-nosed caimans (Caiman latirostris) with M. alligatoris yielded growth of the bacteria in all species tested. However, the infected Siamese crocodiles showed no symptoms of disease as seen in alligators and caimans. The commensal relationship observed between M. alligatoris and C. siamensis suggests the crocodilian as a potential natural reservoir for M. alligatoris. The transmission of M. alligatoris is unknown, but due to its presence in captive alligators, researchers warn against returning captive alligators to their natural habitats, fearing these animals may function as a vector for infecting wild populations. As major predators of their ecosystem, alligators help to control the populations they prey on. The various ecological roles of the alligator also include providing shelter for various animals with their abandoned gator holes. The submerged cavities remain full of water throughout the dry season and provide critical nourishment for an abundance of wildlife such as fish, turtles, birds and insects.

The enlarged second iteration of the Oregon Hospital for the Insane, built in 1862 after the hospital became official contractor for the state of Oregon. Oregon Hospital for the Insane was a facility constructed in the city of Portland, Oregon, USA by medical doctors J. C. Hawthorne and A. M. Loryea. Launched in 1859 as Oregon Hospital, the facility later came to specialize in the treatment of mental illness and served as the de facto insane asylum for the state of Oregon under contract with the Oregon Legislature beginning in 1861. Legislation passed in 1880 led to the launch of the state-owned Oregon State Insane Asylum (today's Oregon State Hospital) in Salem in 1883.

From the time of launch the hospital was dedicated to the treatment of non-contagious disease. The hospital seems to have quickly gained support of the Oregon legislature as a semi-official facility for the maintenance and treatment of the mentally ill, with the press reporting in September 1861 that Hawthorne and Loryea were coordinating the contribution of \\"books for the use of the insane,\\" with materials received to be held in trust as property belonging to the state of Oregon.The Weekly Oregonian, vol. 11, no. 42 (Sept. 7, 1861), pg. 3. From approximately that date Hawthorne and Loryea's Oregon Hospital became known as Oregon Hospital for the Insane.\\"Oregon Hospital for the Insane, Portland 1861-1883,\\" Oregon State Hospital Museum blog, www.oshmuseum.wordpress.com/ Aug. 31, 2010. The 1862 Oregon Legislature instructed Governor A. C. Gibbs to select a location in Salem for a permanent state hospital for the insane.\\"Marion's History: Plymouth of the Pacific Coast,\\" Weekly Oregon Statesman, Jan. 1, 1892, pg. 23. This instruction was set aside, however, with contracting with the Oregon Hospital for the Insane in Portland seen as the more economical option for the state. A contractual relationship was established in which the state of Oregon paid a set per capita fee for the housing of \\"indigent insane and idiotic persons\\" committed to the facility by the courts. Buoyed by state financial support, Oregon Hospital for the Insane was moved to a new permanent home in 1862, a building located on \\"Asylum Avenue\\" (today's Hawthorne Boulevard) on Portland's East Side, near SE 12th Avenue. In 1872 co-founder of the hospital A.M. Loryea, nearly two decades Hawthorne's junior, sold his half of the enterprise to his partner and entered into the patent medicine business under the business name \\"Oregon Medical Laboratory\\", marketing a nostrum prepared from \\"Unk weed\\" said to ameliorate arthritis.\\"The Unk Weed Remedy, or, Oregon Rheumatic Cure,\\" advertisement in The New Northwest [Portland], Feb. 16 1872, pg. 3. Thereafter the facility was owned by Hawthorne alone and its fortunes were intractably bound up with his. Description Physician J.C. Hawthorne was one of the co-founders of Oregon Hospital in 1859. A physician visiting the Oregon Hospital for the Insane in 1868 noted that the hospital was divided into wards, each with a toilet and bathroom supplied with hot and cold water.J.S. Giltner, Report of the Visiting Physician of the Oregon Hospital for the Insane for 1867-8. Salem, OR: W.A. McPherson, State Printer, 1868. Quoted in Oregon State Hospital Museum, \\"Oregon Hospital for the Insane, Portland 1861-1883,\\" Oregon State Hospital Museum blog, www.oshmuseum.wordpress.com/ Aug. 31, 2010. Patients ate in a common dining room, supplied by a single kitchen and the medical staff was supported by a well-stocked dispensary. Each bedroom in the great building contained one or two beds, supplied with linen and blankets.J.S. Giltner, Report of the Inspecting Physician to the Insane Asylum; Oregon: To the Legislative Assembly Thereof: Sixth Regular Session, September 1870. Salem, OR: W.A. McPherson, State Printer, 1870; pg. 4. Residents were served a variety of fresh and salted meats, fruit, vegetables, and bread, along with coffee and tea. Water was provided from a nearby spring, stored in a high water tower capable of supplying any part of the building. In 1866 several acres surrounding the hospital had been enclosed with a high board fence, allowing increased opportunities for exercise and recreation for the facility's patients. Women were put to work sewing and knitting and were responsible for the greater part of the clothing used at the hospital. Those men able to work were assigned tasks on the hospital's own farm and gardens. Corporal punishment was forbidden at the facility in favor of what were considered in the day to be \\"kind but firm treatment,\\" including the use of strait jackets and confinement to quarters.Giltner, Report of the Inspecting Physician to the Insane Asylum...September 1870, pg. 6. J.C. Hawthorne was particularly singled out for his efficiency in the hospital's operation, including his \\"uniform kindness to the large number whose maladies will never admit of cure, but whose management has been entrusted to his care.\\"Giltner, Report of the Inspecting Physician to the Insane Asylum...September 1870, pp. 6-7. Criticism emerges Following 1862 legislation contracting with the state of Oregon, Hawthrone and Loryea briefly marketed their expanded operation as the \\"Oregon State Insane and Idiotic Asylum.\\" Although privately owned and operated, the Oregon Hospital for the Insane was almost exclusively funded through its state contract, with one official report showing that 162 out of 167 total patients present at that time were there through agency of the state.\\"Insane Asylum,\\" Sept. 28, 1874, pg. 3. Report for the biennium Sept. 1, 1872 to Sept. 1, 1874. Of the nearly 300 people who had been housed in the hospital from September 1872 to 1874, men accounted for just under 70% of the population, women about 30%. According to terms of 1874 legislation contracting with Hawthorne, the state of Oregon was to pay $6 per week for each individual consigned to the hospital.\\"Oregon Legislature: Eight Biennial Session: Thursday, Oct. 8,\\" Weekly Oregon Statesman [Salem], vol. 24, no. 48 (Oct. 17, 1874), pg. 1. The $6 per week rate was regarded by some as grossly excessive, with the Salem Statesman opining that such a fee represented an \\"outrageous extortion,\\" and that Hawthorne was effectively being granted a \\"life franchise of the Insane Asylum\\" by his legislative supporters.\\"The Hawthorne Job,\\" Weekly Oregon Statesman [Salem], vol. 24, no. 48 (Oct. 17, 1874), pg. 1. With a view to pushing the legislature to found a state-owned hospital for the mentally ill in Salem, hometown of the newspaper, the editorialist berated Dr. Hawthorne as \\"wholly unknown outside of Oregon\\" and prominent within the state's boundaries \\"chiefly through the enormity of his bills and the power and continuity of his suction as an official vampire.\\" Behind the purple prose and local self-interest of the Statesman editorialist, there appears to have been merit to the basic complaint that Oregon's cost of treatment of the mentally ill was relatively costly, with the Oregon Hospital for the Insane's annual per capita cost topping a list of 49 facilities in one 1878 report ‚Äî some 40% higher than the average for these institutions.Annual Reports of Officers, Boards, and Institutions of the Commonwealth of Virginia for the Year Ending September 30, 1879. Richmond, VA: R.F. Walker, 1879; pg. 13. There was merit as well in the related charge that Oregon Hospital for the Insane's contract with the state was enabled by Hawthorne maintaining friends in high places, with the wife of 1870s Governor LaFayette Grover later testifying in an unrelated trial that her husband had used his influence as governor to forestall building of a state-owned asylum on behalf of his personal friend Hawthorne.\\"Former Governor Grover is Denied Claim on Tract,\\" Oregon Daily Journal [Portland], vol. 9, no. 240 (Dec. 10, 1910), pg. 1. The legislature enacts change The attack on costliness and cronyism was taken up in the halls of the state capitol, with the Marion County (Salem) delegation leading the charge. Defenders of the status quo managed to defeat a series of proposals for construction of a new state-owned mental hospital until a shifting of the tide at the legislature's September 1880 session, spurred by the Marion County delegation's decision to focus action on passage of their \\"pet measure.\\"T.T. Geer, Fifty Years in Oregon: Experiences, Observations, and Commentaries upon Men, Measures, and Customs in Pioneer Days and Later Times. New York: Neale Publishing Co., 1912; pg. 317. The junior member of the six member Marion County delegation and future Governor of Oregon T. T. Geer later recalled the financial imperative for change in the system of Oregon's treatment of the mentally ill, with Dr. Hawthorne and his previous partner said to have amassed fortunes through contracts which had been \\"let at exorbitant figures.\\" \\"All efforts to break up this system had been unsuccessful,\\" Geer claimed, thus costing the people of Oregon thousands of dollars each year over expected costs under state ownership and management. A bill was drafted and introduced by Tilmon Ford, head of the Marion County delegation. A heated legislative battle ensued, remembered by Geer as \\"one of the most bitterly contested struggles in the history of the Oregon Legislatures,\\" complete with organized caucuses and heated back room negotiations.Geer, Fifty Years in Oregon, pg. 318. Speaker of the House Z. F. Moody of Wasco County was credited by Geer for having played an instrumental role in ensuring passage of the bill. Unsuccessful opposition to the bill for the new Oregon State Hospital was headed by A. J. Lawrence, an attorney from Baker County.Geer, Fifty Years in Oregon, pg. 323. The state-owned Oregon State Insane Asylum in Salem built as a result of the 1880 legislature's enabling legislation was opened in 1883. With its opening, the state's financial relationship with the Oregon Hospital for the Insane in Portland came to an end. Termination and legacy J.C. Hawthorne died in February 1881 leaving ownership of the hospital in the hands of his wife. Dr. Simeon Josephi took over the operation of the hospital from the time of Hawthorne's death until the completion of the Oregon State Insane Asylum in Salem. Control of the patients at the Portland hospital were transferred to state officials in October 1883, with the 268 male and 102 female patients then housed at the facility transported by rail aboard a special O&C; train from Portland to Salem on October 23, 1883.R.J. Hendricks, \\"Bits for Breakfast,\\" Oregon Statesman [Salem], vol. 84, no. 4 (March 31, 1934), pg. 4. Hawthorne's hospital is remembered as one of the most progressive American mental health facilities of its era.Lone Fir Cemetery Foundation official web site, www.lonefir.org/ The hospital was marked by empathetic medical treatment and concern for the health and well being of patients by allowing them to work in the fresh air, raising vegetables and livestock, thereby helping them to maintain a sense of purpose. The bodies of destitute patients of Oregon Hospital for the Insane were interred at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland, the final costs of which were borne by J.C. Hawthorne out of pocket.

She was also the mother of Zhong Hui, a Wei general who played a significant role in the conquest of Wei's rival state, Shu, in 263. Her given name was not recorded in history; \\"Changpu\\" was actually her courtesy name. According to her biography written by Zhong Hui, she was a strict mother to Zhong Hui and played a significant role in his early education. She was also known for her virtuous conduct and wisdom. Background The only extant source on Zhang Changpu's life is a biography of her written by her son, Zhong Hui. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi incorporated parts of her biography as annotations into the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), which was written by Chen Shou in the third century. Zhang Changpu was from Zishi County (Ëå≤Ê∞èÁ∏£), Taiyuan Commandery (Â§™ÂéüÈÉ°), which is around present-day Fenyang, Shanxi. Her ancestors served as officials under the government of the Han dynasty and had an income of about 2,000 dan (Áü≥) of grain. She lost her parents at a young age and was married to Zhong Yao as one of his concubines. She earned praise from the Zhong household for her observance of the proprieties in her behaviour and excellent moral conduct.(ÊúÉÁÇ∫ÂÖ∂ÊØçÂÇ≥Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§´‰∫∫ÂºµÊ∞èÔºåÂ≠óÊòåËí≤ÔºåÂ§™ÂéüËå≤Ê∞è‰∫∫ÔºåÂ§™ÂÇÖÂÆöÈôµÊàê‰æØ‰πãÂëΩÂ©¶‰πü„ÄÇ‰∏ñÈï∑Âêè‰∫åÂçÉÁü≥„ÄÇÂ§´‰∫∫Â∞ëÂñ™Áà∂ÊØçÔºåÂÖÖÊàê‰æØÂÆ∂ÔºåËÑ©Ë∫´Ê≠£Ë°åÔºåÈùûÁ¶Æ‰∏çÂãïÔºåÁÇ∫‰∏ä‰∏ãÊâÄÁ®±Ëø∞„ÄÇ) Annotation about Zhong Hui's mother in Sanguozhi vol. 28. Conflict with Lady Sun Zhong Yao had another concubine, Lady Sun (Â≠´Ê∞è), who was very jealous of her husband's other spouses and constantly sought to harm them or make them fall out of her husband's favour. When Zhang Changpu was pregnant with Zhong Hui, Lady Sun attempted to harm her and her unborn child by poisoning her food. However, Zhang Changpu was alert and she vomited out the food when she sensed that there was something wrong with it. Nevertheless, the effects of the poison still caused her to become unconscious for a few days. When she recovered, a servant advised her to tell Zhong Yao about the incident,(Ë≤¥Â¶æÂ≠´Ê∞èÔºåÊîùÂ´°Â∞àÂÆ∂ÔºåÂøÉÂÆ≥ÂÖ∂Ë≥¢ÔºåÊï∏ËÆíÊØÄÊó†ÊâÄ‰∏çËá≥„ÄÇÂ≠´Ê∞èËæ®ÂçöÊúâÊô∫Â∑ßÔºåË®ÄË∂≥‰ª•È£æÈùûÊàêÈÅéÔºåÁÑ∂Á´ü‰∏çËÉΩÂÇ∑‰πü„ÄÇÂèäÂßôÂ®†ÔºåÊÑàÊõ¥Â´âÂ¶¨Ôºå‰πÉÁΩÆËó•È£ü‰∏≠ÔºåÂ§´‰∫∫‰∏≠È£üÔºåË¶∫ËÄåÂêê‰πãÔºåÁûëÁú©ËÄÖÊï∏Êó•„ÄÇÊàñÊõ∞Ôºö„Äé‰Ωï‰∏çÂêëÂÖ¨Ë®Ä‰πãÔºü„Äè) Annotation about Zhong Hui's mother in Sanguozhi vol. 28. but she replied: She then claimed that she was ill and remained indoors.(ÈÅÇÁ®±Áñæ‰∏çË¶ã„ÄÇ) Annotation about Zhong Hui's mother in Sanguozhi vol. 28. As Zhang Changpu predicted, Lady Sun told Zhong Yao: \\"I wanted her (Zhang Changpu) to have a male child, so I gave her a drug that would increase her chances of becoming pregnant with a male child, yet she accused me of poisoning her!\\" Zhong Yao said: \\"It doesn't make sense for you to secretly put into someone's food a drug that would increase a woman's chances of becoming pregnant with a male child\\" He then summoned the servants, questioned them, and found out the truth. He then asked Zhang Changpu why she did not let him know about Lady Sun's deed, and her reply was the same as her earlier response to the servant. Zhong Yao was greatly surprised and very impressed with Zhang Changpu's virtuous behaviour. Zhang Changpu gave birth to Zhong Hui in 225 and became even more favoured by her husband. Zhong Yao also divorced Lady Sun and made another of his concubines, Lady Jia (Ë≥àÊ∞è), his formal spouse.(Â≠´Ê∞èÊûúË¨ÇÊàê‰æØÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÂ¶æÊ¨≤ÂÖ∂ÂæóÁî∑ÔºåÊïÖÈ£≤‰ª•ÂæóÁî∑‰πãËó•ÔºåÂèçË¨ÇÊØí‰πãÔºÅ„ÄèÊàê‰æØÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÂæóÁî∑Ëó•‰Ω≥‰∫ãÔºåÈóáÊñºÈ£ü‰∏≠Ëàá‰∫∫ÔºåÈùû‰∫∫ÊÉÖ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄèÈÅÇË®ä‰æçËÄÖÂÖ∑ÊúçÔºåÂ≠´Ê∞èÁî±ÊòØÂæóÁΩ™Âá∫„ÄÇÊàê‰æØÂïèÂ§´‰∫∫‰ΩïËÉΩ‰∏çË®ÄÔºåÂ§´‰∫∫Ë®ÄÂÖ∂ÊïÖÔºåÊàê‰æØÂ§ßÈ©öÔºåÁõä‰ª•Ê≠§Ë≥¢‰πã„ÄÇÈªÉÂàùÂÖ≠Âπ¥ÔºåÁîüÊúÉÔºåÊÅ©ÂØµÊÑàÈöÜ„ÄÇÊàê‰æØÊó£Âá∫Â≠´Ê∞èÔºåÊõ¥Á¥çÊ≠£Â´°Ë≥àÊ∞è„ÄÇ„Äç) Annotation about Zhong Hui's mother in Sanguozhi vol. 28.

The Wei Shi Chunqiu mentioned that there was a rumour that Zhong Yao divorced Lady Sun because he favoured Zhang Changpu. Empress Dowager Bian heard the rumour and wanted to know if it was true, so the Wei emperor, Cao Pi, summoned Zhong Yao to ask him. Zhong Yao turned furious and tried to commit suicide by consuming poison but failed, so he consumed spices until his teeth started chattering. Cao Pi then stopped asking him about it.(È≠èÊ∞èÊò•ÁßãÊõ∞ÔºöÊúÉÊØçË¶ãÂØµÊñºÁπáÔºåÁπáÁÇ∫‰πãÂá∫ÂÖ∂Â§´‰∫∫„ÄÇÂçûÂ§™Âêé‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ë®ÄÔºåÊñáÂ∏ùË©îÁπáÂæ©‰πã„ÄÇÁπáÊÅöÊÜ§ÔºåÂ∞áÂºïÈ¥ÜÔºåÂºóÁç≤ÔºåÈ§êÊ§íËá¥Âô§ÔºåÂ∏ù‰πÉÊ≠¢„ÄÇ) Wei Shi Chunqiu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 28. Educating Zhong Hui Zhang Changpu was known for being a strict mother to Zhong Hui. She made him read extensively since he was a child and ensured that he was already well versed in the Confucian classics and other books by the time he grew up. When he was four, she made him read the Classic of Filial Piety. When he was seven, she made him read the Analects. When he was eight, she made him read the Classic of Poetry. When he was ten, she made him read the Book of Documents. When he was 11, she made him read the Yijing. When he was 12, she made him read the Spring and Autumn Annals, Zuo Zhuan and Guoyu. When he was 13, she made him read the Book of Rites and Rites of Zhou. When he was 14, she made him read the Yiji (ÊòìË®ò) written by his father. When he was 15, she sent him to the Imperial Academy (Â§™Â≠∏) to learn from a wider range of sources. She once told Zhong Hui: \\"When you read too much, you become tired of reading. When you become tired of reading, you become lazy. I was worried that you would become lazy, so I decided to make you read in a progressive manner. Now you are able to learn independently.\\" Zhang Changpu herself was also known for being well read, and she was particularly interested in the Yijing and Daodejing. She liked to quote Confucius's teachings and use them to educate her son and make him memorise them until he became so familiar with them.(ÂÖ∂ÊØçÂÇ≥Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§´‰∫∫ÊÄßÁüúÂö¥ÔºåÊòéÊñºÊïôË®ìÔºåÊúÉÈõñÁ´•Á®öÔºåÂã§Ë¶ãË¶èË™®„ÄÇÂπ¥ÂõõÊ≠≤ÊéàÂ≠ùÁ∂ìÔºå‰∏ÉÊ≠≤Ë™¶Ë´ñË™ûÔºåÂÖ´Ê≠≤Ë™¶Ë©©ÔºåÂçÅÊ≠≤Ë™¶Â∞öÊõ∏ÔºåÂçÅ‰∏ÄË™¶ÊòìÔºåÂçÅ‰∫åË™¶Êò•ÁßãÂ∑¶Ê∞èÂÇ≥„ÄÅÂúãË™ûÔºåÂçÅ‰∏âË™¶Âë®Á¶Æ„ÄÅÁ¶ÆË®òÔºåÂçÅÂõõË™¶Êàê‰æØÊòìË®òÔºåÂçÅ‰∫î‰ΩøÂÖ•Â§™Â≠∏ÂïèÂõõÊñπÂ•áÊñáÁï∞Ë®ì„ÄÇË¨ÇÊúÉÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÂ≠∏Áå•ÂâáÂÄ¶ÔºåÂÄ¶ÂâáÊÑèÊÄ†ÔºõÂêæÊáºÊ±ù‰πãÊÑèÊÄ†ÔºåÊïÖ‰ª•Êº∏Ë®ìÊ±ùÔºå‰ªäÂèØ‰ª•Áç®Â≠∏Áü£„ÄÇ„ÄèÈõÖÂ•ΩÊõ∏Á±çÔºåÊ∂âÊ≠∑Ë°ÜÊõ∏ÔºåÁâπÂ•ΩÊòì„ÄÅËÄÅÂ≠êÔºåÊØèËÆÄÊòìÂ≠îÂ≠êË™™È≥¥È∂¥Âú®Èô∞„ÄÅÂãûË¨ôÂêõÂ≠ê„ÄÅËóâÁî®ÁôΩËåÖ„ÄÅ‰∏çÂá∫Êà∂Â∫≠‰πãÁæ©ÔºåÊØè‰ΩøÊúÉÂèçË¶ÜËÆÄ‰πãÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÊòì‰∏âÁôæÈ§òÁàªÔºå‰ª≤Â∞ºÁâπË™™Ê≠§ËÄÖÔºå‰ª•Ë¨ôÊÅ≠ÊÖéÂØÜÔºåÊ®ûÊ©ü‰πãÁôºÔºåË°åÂ∑±Ëá≥Ë¶ÅÔºåÊ¶ÆË∫´ÊâÄÁî±ÊïÖ‰πüÔºåÈ†ÜÊñØË°ìÂ∑≤ÂæÄÔºåË∂≥ÁÇ∫ÂêõÂ≠êÁü£„ÄÇ„Äè) Annotation about Zhong Hui's mother in Sanguozhi vol. 28. Reaction towards the Incident at Gaoping Tombs In 247, when Zhong Hui was appointed as a Gentleman of Writing (Â∞öÊõ∏ÈÉé), Zhang Changpu held her son's hand and cautioned him against self-indulgence. Around the time, the regent Cao Shuang, who dominated the scene in the Wei imperial court, spent his time indulging in alcohol and lavish banquets. When Zhong Hui's elder half-brother, Zhong Yu (ÈçæÊØì), returned from one of Cao Shuang's banquets, he told Zhong Hui and Zhang Changpu about what he saw. Zhang Changpu remarked that Cao Shuang would bring about his own downfall eventually because of his extravagant lifestyle.(Ê≠£ÂßãÂÖ´Âπ¥ÔºåÊúÉÁÇ∫Â∞öÊõ∏ÈÉéÔºåÂ§´‰∫∫Âü∑ÊúÉÊâãËÄåË™®‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÊ±ùÂº±ÂÜ†Ë¶ãÂèôÔºå‰∫∫ÊÉÖ‰∏çËÉΩ‰∏çËá™Ë∂≥ÔºåÂâáÊêçÂú®ÂÖ∂‰∏≠Áü£ÔºåÂãâÊÄùÂÖ∂ÊàíÔºÅ„ÄèÊòØÊôÇÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÊõπÁàΩÂ∞àÊúùÊîøÔºåÊó•Á∏±ÈÖíÊ≤àÈÜâÔºåÊúÉÂÖÑ‰æç‰∏≠ÊØìÂÆ¥ÈÇÑÔºåË®ÄÂÖ∂‰∫ã„ÄÇÂ§´‰∫∫Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÊ®ÇÂâáÊ®ÇÁü£ÔºåÁÑ∂Èõ£‰πÜ‰πü„ÄÇÂ±Ö‰∏ä‰∏çÈ©ïÔºåÂà∂ÁØÄË¨πÂ∫¶ÔºåÁÑ∂Âæå‰πÉÁÑ°Âç±Ê∫¢‰πãÊÇ£„ÄÇ‰ªäÂ•¢ÂÉ≠Ëã•Ê≠§ÔºåÈùûÈï∑ÂÆàÂØåË≤¥‰πãÈÅì„ÄÇ„Äè) Annotation about Zhong Hui's mother in Sanguozhi vol. 28. In 249, Zhong Hui accompanied the Wei emperor Cao Fang on a visit to the Gaoping Tombs (È´òÂπ≥Èôµ), where the previous emperors were buried. Around this time, Cao Shuang's co- regent, Sima Yi, used the opportunity to launch a coup to seize power from Cao Shuang. Zhang Changpu remained calm and composed after receiving news about the coup, while others started panicking. The officials Liu Fang (ÂäâÊîæ), Wei Guan, Xiahou He and others were puzzled about Zhang Changpu's reaction, so they asked her: \\"Lady, your son is in danger. Why aren't you worried?\\" Zhang Changpu replied: \\"The General-in-Chief (Cao Shuang) has been leading an extravagant life, and I have long suspected that he won't have peace. The Grand Tutor (Sima Yi) will overcome the General-in-Chief with his righteous actions that don't endanger the Empire. My son is with the Emperor, so what is there to worry about? I also heard that this coup doesn't involve heavily armed troops, so I guess it won't last long.\\" The situation turned out to be as she expected. Sima Yi successfully seized power from Cao Shuang and eliminated him later, while Zhong Hui was not harmed in the coup.(ÂòâÂπ≥ÂÖÉÂπ¥ÔºåËªäÈßïÊúùÈ´òÂπ≥ÈôµÔºåÊúÉÁÇ∫‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈÉéÔºåÂæûË°å„ÄÇÁõ∏ÂúãÂÆ£Êñá‰æØÂßãËàâÂÖµÔºåË°Ü‰∫∫ÊÅêÊáºÔºåËÄåÂ§´‰∫∫Ëá™Ëã•„ÄÇ‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§ÂäâÊîæ„ÄÅ‰æçÈÉéË°ûÁìò„ÄÅÂ§è‰æØÂíåÁ≠âÂÆ∂ÁöÜÊÄ™ÂïèÔºö„ÄéÂ§´‰∫∫‰∏ÄÂ≠êÂú®Âç±Èõ£‰πã‰∏≠Ôºå‰ΩïËÉΩÁÑ°ÊÜÇÔºü„ÄèËçÖÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄéÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂ•¢ÂÉ≠ÁÑ°Â∫¶ÔºåÂêæÂ∏∏ÁñëÂÖ∂‰∏çÂÆâ„ÄÇÂ§™ÂÇÖÁæ©‰∏çÂç±ÂúãÔºåÂøÖÁÇ∫Â§ßÂ∞áËªçËàâËÄ≥„ÄÇÂêæÂÖíÂú®Â∏ùÂÅ¥‰ΩïÊÜÇÔºüËÅû‰∏îÂá∫ÂÖµÁÑ°‰ªñÈáçÂô®ÔºåÂÖ∂Âã¢ÂøÖ‰∏ç‰πÜÊà∞„ÄÇ„ÄèÊûúÂ¶ÇÂÖ∂Ë®ÄÔºå‰∏ÄÊôÇÁ®±Êòé„ÄÇ) Annotation about Zhong Hui's mother in Sanguozhi vol. 28.

While Harris was being subdued, Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Charles \\"Bob\\" Bates, 73, allegedly confused his personal weapon, a Smith & Wesson .357 revolver, for a Model X26 Taser.http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/14/us/taser-gun-confusion/ Bates shot Harris in the back when he was on the ground. According to the Tulsa County Sheriff's office, he immediately said afterwards, \\"Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.\\" Bates was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison. Aftermath It was later determined that Harris did not have a gun when he was tackled and shot. A sunglasses-camera video shows his arms flailing as he runs. Bates was later charged with second-degree manslaughter. Harris family attorney Donald Smolen said the sunglasses video shows Deputy Bates with a yellow Taser strapped to his chest and a .357 revolver in his right hand as he stands over Harris. \\"There is absolutely no way, if Mr. Bates had been trained at all, which I believe will be reflected ultimately through the lack of records to substantiate his training, that an officer who was trained would [ever] get these two weapons confused,\\" Smolen said. In the video, Harris can be heard saying, \\"I'm losing my breath,\\" to which 38-year- old Deputy Joseph Byars replies, \\"Fuck your breath.\\" 24-year-old Deputy Michael Huckeby is also shown in the video kneeling on Harris' head as the dying Harris is told, \\"You shouldn't have ran,\\" and \\"Shut the fuck up.\\" A third deputy restraining Harris was not identified. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, hired as an \\"expert witness\\" for the sheriff's department, said at an April 10 news conference that the deputy who fired the fatal shot \\"was a true victim of slips and capture\\", and that it was typical for law enforcement officers to experience diminished hearing, tunnel vision, or go into \\"auto pilot\\", where a person's behavior \\"slips\\" off the path of his intention because it is \\"captured\\" by a stronger response and sent in a different direction. \\"Bates didn't commit a crime,\\" Clark said, and no policy violations occurred. Smolen told the Tulsa World that Clark's ruling was \\"premature and ill-advised\\", challenging a report that Harris was \\"uncooperative and combative\\" as firefighters attempted to administer aid. Smolen said Harris could hardly be combative since he was struggling with labored breathing and his hands were cuffed. \\"It's most likely the word 'combative' is being used because that's what they're being told by the Sheriff's Office,\\" Smolen told the Tulsa World. \\"The other alternative is their use of the word combative is more a description of Mr. Harris struggling to get air and kind of writhing in pain from the gunshot wound.\\" Bates' qualification scandal The Tulsa Police Department immediately sought to clarify their relationships with both Bates and Clark. \\"Robert Bates has no current affiliation with the Tulsa Police Department and has not had any in 50 years,\\" TPD said in a press release. \\"Additionally, Mr. Jim Clark, a consultant for the Tulsa County Sheriff, does not represent the Tulsa Police Department nor has the Tulsa Police Department conducted an assessment of this incident.\\" Later that week, The Tulsa World reported supervisors at the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were ordered to falsify Deputy Bates' training records. Sheriff's spokesman Shannon Clark later said the documents wouldn't matter because Bates, a major donor to Sheriff Glanz's re-election, was granted special exceptions. The sheriff's deputy that certified Bates has moved on to work for the Secret Service, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said during an interview with a radio station, while the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office denied providing Bates with the training he claimed. Chief Glanz resigned as a result of the scandal around Bates' lack of qualification. In 2016 he pled guilty for failing to release information that showed the department knew Bates to be unqualified. He was sentenced to one year in jail, and the sentence was suspended.Drinking while on parole?

(2004) Load theory of selective attention and cognitive control. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133, pp. 339-54. Lavie originally proposed the Load Theory in the mid-nineties to resolve the \\"Locus of Attentional Selection\\" debate. Load Theory offered a new approach concerning the nature of information processing that reconciles the apparently contradicting views in this debate regarding the issue of capacity limits versus automaticity of processing. In Load Theory - perceptual information processing has limited capacity but processing proceeds automatically on all information within its capacity. The theory made an important contribution to the understanding of the impact of attention on information processing, visual perception and awareness. It explains how people use their working memory during task performance and the ways in which people can exert cognitive control over their perception, attention and behaviour.Carmel, D., Fairnie, J., & Lavie, N. (2012). Weight and see: loading working memory improves incidental identification of irrelevant faces. Frontiers in Psychology, 3, p. 286.

It occupies the current boundaries of the modern Prefecture of Argolis, except for the former municipality of Ermionida. The see's original name was the Bishopric of Argos, and according to Paulinus the Deacon, it was founded by Saint Andrew. The early bishops of Argos were suffragan to the Metropolis of Corinth. It was separated from Corinth renamed the Metropolis of Argos and Nafplio in 1189, confirming an earlier de facto merger with Nauplion. In 1833, it was renamed the Metropolis of Argolis. Its cathedra was originally Argos, but it moved around the Argolid several times due to political factors. Its incumbent is Metropolitan Nektarios Antonopoulos (b. 1952). The previous metropolitan, from 1985 until his death, was Metropolitan Iakovos (\\"James\\") II (1932-2013), who died 26 March 2013. (In Greek, the late metropolitan, like other deceased Orthodox faithful, he is referred to as makaristos -- \\"of blessed memory.\\") The current metropolitan was chosen on 18 October 2013. Saint Nicholas Church in Nafplio History and ecclesiastical administration According to the article \\"Argos and Orthodoxy Through the Passage of the Ages\\", written by the Archimandrite Kallinikos D. Korobokis, the diocesan homilist (published in the periodical \\"Eyes on Argolis\\", Volume 10, May‚ÄìJune 2002), the history of the metropolitan see is recorded as follows: Paulinus (354-431 AD) relates that the Apostle Andrew first proclaimed the Gospel at Argos, and thus he is traditionally held to be the founder of the Church there. It is also likely that the Apostle Paul came to Argos, some time around 50-60 AD; he remained in Corinth for a considerable number of months and, it is also thought, all around the neighboring provinces of Corinth. Argos acclaimed a bishop fairly early on, separate from that of the bishopric of Nauplia (Nafplio), with both under the jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Corinth. The first known Bishop of Argos is Perigenes. At the end of the 9th century, the Bishop of Argos was Saint Peter the Wonderworker, who became the town's patron saint. The sees of Argos and Nauplion were unified in 1166. According to other sources, the unification of Argos and Nauplion had already occurred a few years after 879. Throughout the minutes of the Council of 879 in Constantinople, written by the members, the Bishop of Argos is recorded as Theotimos, and that of Nauplion as Andreas, which establishes a terminus post quem, but not a precise date for the unification. In 1189 the unified diocese of Argos and Nauplion was extracted from the Metropolis of Corinth and converted into a metropolitan see sui juris, with one John serving as its first metropolitan. According to the Argolic Calendar of 1910, which was produced by the Bishops of Argos and Nauplion, the Eparchy (Bishopric) of Argos was led under the Metropolis of Corinth: According to the anonymous hand-written chronicle published in ŒîŒµŒªœÑŒØœâ ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅ. ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒøŒª. ŒïœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒØŒ±œÇ Œ§.ŒíŒÑ œÉŒµŒª. 32, ed. Io. Sakellionos (Bulletins of the Historical and Ethnological Society of Greece 303, p. 32), there are 23 recorded Bishops of Argos and Nauplion. Their names are as follows: *Peter the Wonderworker *Constantine *Christopher *Peter *John *Nicholas *Sisinius *Andrew *Theodore *Sisinius *Peter *Basil *Theophylact *Sisinius *Gregory *Nicholas, the kitor (donator) of Agios Andreas (Saint Andrew's Church) *John, the kitor (donator) of the new church *Gregory *Constantine *Theodore Leon *Nicitas John, who led the diocese down to its new title of Nauplion and Argos. In 1212, the local Orthodox hierarchy was replaced by Latin hierarchs during the period of Frankish rule in which the two towns formed part of the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia. This state of affairs lasted until 1540, with the withdrawal of the Venetians after the Third Ottoman-Venetian War. Afterwards, the diocese returned to the control of Greek Orthodox hierarchs, but in 1686, the seat of the bishop moved from Argos to Nafplio. Shortly after the Venetians returned, and with them, a Roman Catholic hierarchy, and the Orthodox administration re- located to the village of Merbaka, returning to Argos in 1770 in the wake of attacks by Albanian irregulars. At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, the seat moved again to Nafplio. The bishop, Grigorios Kalamaras was killed in the Siege of Tripolitsa, and is consequently termed an ethnomartyr a national martyr, Greek: ·ºêŒ∏ŒΩŒøŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ. This designation is a popular one, and has no canonical status making the bishop a saint, as death in battle does not necessarily qualify one for martyrdom. After the creation of the Greek state but before the creation of the new autocephalous Church of Greece in 1850, the diocese underwent a brief period of successive reorganizations as the Patriarchate of Constantinople adjusted to having large numbers of faithful outside the Ottoman millet system. It was briefly merged with the Metropolis of Corinth (1841), with the addition of the Bishopric of Hydra in 1842, before its present jurisdiction was created between 1850-52. Currently, the Bishop of Epidavros (Epidaurus) is suffragan to the Metropolitan Bishop of Argolis, and serves as the auxiliary bishop for the metropolis; he is sui juris the bishop of the See of Epidavros, and is subordinate to the Metropolitan only in his capacity as auxiliary in the See of Argolis and the metropolitan synod, over which the metropolitan presides. The General Hierarocratic Commissioner -- akin to a western vicar general or archdeacon -- is Archpriest Vasileios (Basil) Soulandros. The Roman Catholic name for the diocese was . It is currently listed as suppressed, but in the past was used as the name of a titular see. Prior to 1882, the term used by the Catholic Church to describe this and other Orthodox dioceses formerly governed by Latin clergy was (\\"in the parts of the infidels\\"), but the term was changed by the papacy of Pope Leo XIII, reportedly in response to complaints by King George I of Greece over its offensive nature. List of bishops and metropolitans  According to the French theologian and scholar Michel Le Quien, these are the earliest bishops of Argos, as recorded in Greek and Latin sources: #Perigenes #Genethlius #Onesimus #Thales #John #Theotimus #Peter the Wonderworker #Leo #John #?

History  Founding gate lodge located adjacent to one of two entrances to the grounds of the hospital. This building was completed in 1898, possibly after the hospital got an extension three years prior, and is now in use as an office The hospital is a freestanding 41 bay, 3 storeyed psychiatric hospital built on twenty-five acres of land purchased in 1848 for ¬£829 which eventually opened as the Mullingar District Lunatic Asylum on 23 August 1855. It was extended 1895. The hospital is a well- detailed Victorian institutional complex, in the Gothic style with extensive Tudor Gothic detailing. The structure was built to designs by John Skipton Mulvany, possibly the most celebrated architect operating in Ireland at the time. It cost some ¬£35,430 (equivalent to ‚Ç¨44,986 in today's money) to build and was built to accommodate 300 patients. The first patients were transferred from the Richmond Surgical Hospital in Dublin, and all of them were female. In the grounds of the hospital, there are various buildings including a chapel which was constructed 1886, a nurses' home which was built 1940 and an infirmary which was also built 1940. Incarceration, and past treatment of patients Julie Caffrey Leonard, a housekeeper from nearby Trim, County Meath, was admitted into the hospital after she threw hot tea on her husband during an argument as she suspected him of adultery. She spent 22 years in the institution and protested as she knew she did not belong in such a place, neither did most of those who were confined in its walls. She died in the hospital on 10 February 1919, aged 54 due to myocardial degeneration. Hanna Greally was born in Athlone in 1925, and she was admitted to the hospital in 1943 at the age of 19 by the advice of her mother after Greally had just returned home from London where she had witnessed the horrors of the London Blitz while training to be a nurse. Bird's Nest Soup, a book written by Hanna and published in 1971, captured the haunting detail of other's lives stripped of human rights of \\"the unloved, social outcasts, the incurably embittered and the dispirited\\". Greally died at her home in County Roscommon in 1987, aged 62. > \\"The patients inside, expectant, waited for the letters and the visits, > until finally, one day, they would find themselves rejects, outcasts, and no > explanation given. Sometimes a crushed spirit breaks, from mental agony and > anguish, when she understands at last she is captive in a free society.\\" > ‚ÄîBird's Nest Soup, 1971 In 1958, a time which was referred to as the \\"pinnacle of confinement\\", was reached in Ireland when 21,000 patients were being confined behind mental hospital walls across Ireland, 0.7% of the general population. Mortality rates were high, with more than 11,000 deaths every decade between the 1920‚Äì1960 period. 1,304 bodies are reportedly buried in the grounds of the hospital, the last one being in 1970. As of 2011, they are unmarked, with numbered crosses being stored in an outbuilding. Inspector of Mental Health Services report After the introduction of deinstitutionalisation in the late 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline. In 2007, the Inspector of Mental Health Services report created a horrific picture of the appalling conditions which some residents have to endure in ageing psychiatric hospitals around the country. The Inspector called for two hospitals to be closed, urging that St Loman's be closed immediately. The Inspector made the following comments on St. Loman's conditions. Church on the grounds of St. Lomans > \\"Apart from the admission units, the conditions in areas of St Loman's > Hospital remained very poor with damp, peeling paint, tiles lifting on > floors, poor sanitary facilities, curtains falling down and drab and > institutional-style furnishings and decor. A significantly large number of > these areas were dirty, including sluice rooms and bathrooms and toilets. In > short, the conditions that people with enduring mental illness have to live > in permanently in St Loman's Hospital were deplorable... every effort must > be made to close the hospital immediately.\\" ‚ÄîInspector of Mental Health > Services Report, 2007 In response to the report, the HSE kept the hospital open, admitting that the facilities there are \\"not what is required in the 21st century\\" and noting that there had been \\"an upgrade of one of the blocks at St Loman's at a cost of ‚Ç¨1.8 million, and secondly, the development of a 12 bed residential hostel for elderly clients with an enduring mental illness at a cost of ‚Ç¨1.85 million\\" in 2008. There has also been a long history of the admission of children and adolescents to adult units in the grounds of St. Loman's Hospital Mullingar. This practice was not limited to St. Loman's Hospital but has long been the norm within the public mental health services of Ireland when accommodation for those minors cannot be met in appropriate child & adolescent units. The inspector for Mental Health Services has described this practice as \\"inexcusable and counter-therapeutic\\", while the founder of the Pieta House suicide prevention charity and senator Joan Freeman has described Ireland as being \\"in breach of all international regulations\\" in regards to this practice. Dr Muthulingam Kasiraj In 2016, a Medical Council inquiry had found a junior doctor, Dr Muthulingam Kasiraj, also known as Dr Sripathy, who had worked as a senior house officer at St Loman's Psychiatric hospital for a period of approximately six months between July 2013 and January 2014, guilty of poor professional performance on several counts. Allegations made against the doctor included that he did not have basic knowledge of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), did not know the difference between some generic and branded drugs, did not know how to dial 999, was incapable of interpreting simple blood tests, did not understand the effects of some drugs on the liver, and that he wrote up wrong doses for drugs (supposedly no patients were harmed). Mr Kasiraj was also accused of being responsible for incomplete note taking. In Mr Kasiraj's defence, he claimed that anankastic personality disorder, which he was diagnosed with after the time period in question, had \\"affected\\" his performance during the period in question. Mr Kasiraj had worked in the child and adolescent psychiatric services in Mullingar for the approximate six months prior to securing his position at St Loman's Psychiatric Hospital.

It was built in 1862 in the former home of the poet and collector Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim (1719-1803).Der Freundschaftstempel im Gleimhaus zu Halberstadt. Portr√§ts des 18. Jahrhunderts.

Halberstadt 1986 (Die Sammlungen des Gleimhauses; Teil 1) The half-timbered house lies behind the choir of the gothic cathedral to Halberstadt. The collections of the Gleimhaus go back to Gleim's estate.  Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim  Gleim was a popular poet in his time. His poetry collection Versuch in Scherzhaften Liedern, from 1744 or 1745 is one of the most important early documents of German anacreontics. His \\"Romanzen\\" (1756) worked on the ballad seal of the Sturm und Drang generation. His Prussian war songs, written in 1757, were a milestone in the effort to bring the popular into German poetry. His fable seals can still be found in textbooks. Nevertheless, from a modern perspective, Gleim appears more as a transitional figure in German literary history, having been overtaken by recent literary developments since the 1770s. He continues to have paramount importance as a patron, collector and exponent of the friendship cult of his time. Gleim came to Halberstadt in 1747 to become \\"Domsekret√§r\\", d. H. Administrator of the cathedral pin, to become. Supported by a social-ethically oriented friendship ideals, Gleim created a network of literary communication and, in addition to the representatives of the Literary Society, made Halberstadt a literary center in Germany.  The Collection  Gleim's collections are characterized by a unique connection between images, books and letters, and are in the service of his intense group of friendship; the collections became the property of the \\"Gleim Family Foundation\\" and were earmarked for public use. Gleim created a large portrait collection of writers and important contemporaries of the 18th century. While he at first only had his close friends painted, the circle of people painted expanded over the decades. At his death, the number of portraits was about 150; Today, the Gleimhaus preserves around 130 portrait paintings of 18th and early 19th century personalities, including portraits of Ewald von Kleist, Karl Wilhelm Ramler, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Klopstock, Anna Louisa Karsch, Sophie von La Roche, Johann Jakob Bodmer, Salomon Gessner, Wilhelm Heinse, and Jean Paul. Many of the most important portraitists of the second half of the 18th century are represented by one or more works, such as Anton Graff, Jens Juel, Georg Oswald May, Benjamin Calau, Gottfried Hempel, several members of the Tischbein family, Johann Friedrich Eich, Friedrich Georg Weitsch, Johann Heinrich Ramberg, and Georg Friedrich Adolph Sch√∂ner. Gleim's socialization led to an immense letter archive. Correspondents included the writers Lessing, Klopstock, Wieland, Ewald von Kleist and Herder, the poet Anna Louisa Karsch, the painter Bernhard Rode, the theologian Spalding and the esthetician Sulzer and the count's house Stolberg- Wernigerode. The manuscript collection of the Gleimhaus contains a total of around 10,000 letters from more than 500 correspondence from Gleim (originals, designs and contemporary transcripts, including more than 2,000 copies by Gleim, otherwise correspondence or letters from correspondence of the Gleim friends with third parties). There are also over 1,000 manuscripts (poetic bequests by Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim, Jakob Immanuel Pyra, Ewald von Kleist, Johann Benjamin Michaelis, partial estate of Anna Louisa Karsch, occasional manuscripts by Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Johann Peter Uz, Lessing, Ramler, Heinse, Johann Heinrich Voss and others). Moreover, Gleim's personal documents and his family are occasionally found, including some wallpaper left over from Gleim's summerhouse with handwritten notes by his friends. The convivial, scholarly, friendly and literary correspondence in North and Central Germany during the second half of the 18th century, concentrating on the connection between image, book and letter, is exemplified in the museum. Gleim's largely preserved book collection is considered one of the largest private bourgeois libraries of the 18th century; it comprises about 12,000 volumes, including over 50 incunabula, about 800 titles of the 16th century, about 1,200 of the 17th century. The largest part dates from the 18th and early 19th centuries, including numerous dedication copies. The library has its focus in European literature of the second half of the 18th century and also contains larger collections on literary and art history, economic, social, cultural and political history and natural sciences. These collections are the largest closed poetic estate of the 18th century at the historical site in the original collection conception and can be considered as the first literary archive of German works. The portrait collection and the letter archive are accessible via the homepage of the Gleimhaus.  History  After Gleim's death, his grandnephew and estate administrator Friedrich Wilhelm K√∂rte (1776-1846) kept his collections in his home, as well as in the cathedral square in Halberstadt. He later published them. After his death, the holdings in the Domgymnasium were stored until the Gleim Family Foundation in 1861 bought the former home Gleim and made the collections in 1862 under the name \\"Gleimhaus\\" publicly accessible. The holdings were expanded by the Family Foundation and the Gleimhaus. Thus, in the second half of the 19th century, a part of the graphic, book and manuscript collection of the Halberstadt Oberdompredigers Christian Friedrich Bernhard Augustin (1771-1856) was incorporated into the stock of the Gleimhaus. It has also built its own collection of prints and drawings, which today contain around 12,000 sheets and cover the period from the end of the 15th century to the present, with a focus on 18th and 19th century portrait graphics. In 1898, the family foundation sold the house and the collections to the city of Halberstadt, which operated the Gleimhaus until the end of 1994. For its part - within the available financial resources - it provided for the collection the creation of a scientific library. At the beginning of the 20th century, the monument to Anna Louisa Karsch by J. C. Stubinitzky, which had been erected in the landscape park \\"Spiegelsberge\\" near Halberstadt in 1784 as the first poet monument in Germany in the form of a portrait statue, was transferred to the Gleimhaus. During the Second World War about one-sixth of the historical book inventory as well as a few manuscripts and pictures were destroyed. The building of the Gleimhaus was also damaged by an attack on Halberstadt on 8 April 1945. The museum was reopened in August 1946. In the autumn of 1949, the exhibition \\"From this world rose Goethe\\" was presented at the K√§the-Kollwitz- Gymnasium Halberstadt. During the 20th century several estates of 19th and 20th century artists from the region of Halberstadt arrived the Gleimhaus. Selected works from this collection will be presented in a \\"Gallery of Artists of the Region\\". In 1994, a museum extension for the Gleimhaus with magazine rooms, a reading room, an event and meeting room as well as a paper restoration workshop was completed. Educational offers and a varied program of events for adults and children aim to bring life to the former Gleim residence, as it did in the 18th century. Since 1999, scientific conferences have been held in the Gleimhaus in cooperation with specialist colleagues from universities and museums. This includes workshops for junior researchers and student seminars.  Museum Presentation  The heart of the museum's presentation of the Gleimhaus is the so-called \\"Temple of Friendship\\". These are the rooms on the upper floor whose walls are densely covered with Gleim's portrait paintings and in which festivals and readings took place in the circle of friends during his lifetime. On display are also books and manuscripts from the collections of the Gleimhaus and Gleim's original writing chair. In a special room, children can experience the 18th century with all their senses.  Awards  In 2004, the honorary pin of the city of Halberstadt \\"Silver Roland\\" to the F√∂rderkreis Gleimhaus e. V. awarded. In 2005, the Gleimhaus (together with the Museum of Prehistory, Halle) received the Museum Prize of the Ostdeutsche Sparkassenstiftung in Saxony-Anhalt. The Gleimhaus was included in the Blue Book of the Federal Government as a \\"Cultural Memorial Site with Special National Importance\\".

A Commodore 64 port followed. Coleman also wrote another game published by Synapse in 1983, The Pharaoh's Curse. The Atari version was later part of a \\"Double Play\\" promotion, where some Synapse games had a second, complete game on the other side of the diskette. The Double Play re-release of Rainbow Walker includes the game Countdown by Ken Rose. Gameplay Coloring the rainbow at night. The player controls a small creature named Cedrick who hops on a flat rainbow curving into the screen, giving a pseudo 3D quality to the game. The rainbow consists of 8 arcs, each of which contains 16 squares. Hopping along an arc scrolls the rainbow and eventually wraps around to the starting square. Each level omits some parts of this grid to make it more challenging. At the start of each round the squares are gray, and moving onto them adds color. The goal is to color the entire rainbow. Hopping off the rainbow costs one life. Holding the button while moving jumps over a square. Other creatures attempt to change the squares back to gray or to knock Cedrick off the rainbow. A shooting star moves along an arc then drops Cedrick off, possibly in a location without a square. A demon bird carries Cedrick into the clouds and undoes all of the coloring done in the level. Fragile squares break if Cedrick stands on them for too long. One offensive opportunity is that if Cedrick steps on a freeze square, then it stops creatures moving for a few seconds during which time they can be stomped on and eliminated. There are twenty levels in all, with bonus rounds between them, and then the game ends. After reaching level five, it is possible to start a new game at that level, though only in the current play session.

It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the coasts of the Maltese Islands. It is the only surviving tour-reduit in Malta. Today, Vend√¥me Tower houses the headquarters of Marsaxlokk F.C. The tour-reduit is also known by several other names, including Vend√¥me Redoubt (), Qrajten Redoubt or Craite Redoubt () and Fisheries Redoubt. History Vend√¥me Tower was built between 1715 and 1716 as part of the Order of Saint John's first building program of coastal fortifications. It was one of four tour-reduits built in Malta, with the other three being Fresnoy Redoubt, Spinola Redoubt and Marsalforn Tower. However, the others were all demolished, leaving Vend√¥me Tower as the only one of its kind. The tower was named after Philippe de Vend√¥me, the Grand Prior of France. He was the military advisor who advocated for the building of many batteries and redoubts in Malta. In fact, a number of other batteries and redoubts are also known by the name Vend√¥me Battery or Vend√¥me Redoubt. The structure is essentially a tower-like blockhouse with a square plan. It has sloping walls topped by a parapet, and the walls are pierced with musketry loopholes. The structure was originally surrounded by a ditch, with a drawbridge leading to the main entrance. However, the ditch no longer exists. The interior of the tower consists of two rooms and a staircase leading to the roof. A chapel was also located in the tower. The tower was intended to prevent enemy ships from landing at Marsaxlokk Bay. It was part of a chain of fortifications defending the bay, which also included the large Saint Lucian Tower, two smaller De Redin towers, seven coastal batteries, four redoubts and three entrenchments. Present day Vend√¥me Tower is now the headquarters of Marsaxlokk F.C. Today, Vend√¥me Tower is used as the headquarters of Marsaxlokk F.C., and it is not open to the public. The southern and western walls are in need of restoration.

Her early work is associated with the Boston Expressionist school; later she became known for her still-life paintings in which light is refracted through glass and water, and for her portraits. She is also known for her collaboration with the poets Anne Sexton and Maxine Kumin, and for her archived correspondence with various artists and writers. Life and career Barbara Swan was born in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1922. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1943 with a B.A. in art history, then studied painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts until 1948. In her last year at the museum school she was Karl Zerbe's teaching assistant. She spent two years living and working in France on a fellowship from the Museum of Fine Arts, at a time when two-year traveling fellowships were rarely awarded to women.Roscio (2013), p. 8. There she met her husband, Alan Fink, whom she married in 1952. Fink later founded the Alpha Gallery on Newbury Street in Boston. Swan achieved local fame as an artist in the 1950s. Her paintings from this period are loosely associated with the Boston Expressionist school, although her themes tended to be gentler than those of Jack Levine and others working in that style. In a 1957 review of her show at the Boris Mirski Gallery, critic Edgar Driscoll marveled at her ability to render tranquil domestic scenes, featuring sleeping children or nursing infants, in a creative way: \\"It is a tender, touching showing...Yet the artist, through strong color and off-beat compositions, carefully avoids over-sentimentalizing or slipping into the banal.\\" One of her best known paintings from this period, \\"Baby\\", shows her infant son Aaron held up by a man's hand, presumably her husband's. At various times in the 1940s through the 1960s, Swan taught art classes at Boston University, Wellesley College, and the museum school. Collaboration with Anne Sexton and Maxine Kumin In 1961 Swan was one of the first women to receive a grant from the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. Through the grant program she met other creative women, including the poets Anne Sexton and Maxine Kumin. Swan provided pen and ink illustrations for several of Sexton's books, including Transformations, The Death Notebooks, and Live or Die, the last of which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. She also illustrated Kumin's Pulitzer-winning Up Country. Swan's essay on Sexton, \\"A Reminiscence\\", is included in Anne Sexton: Telling the Tale, a collection of essays published in 1988. In the essay Swan recalls, among other things, how her lithograph, The Musicians, inspired Sexton's poem, \\"To Lose the Earth\\", and her drawing, Man Carrying a Man, inspired Sexton's \\"Jesus Walking\\". Critic Vernon Young, reviewing Transformations in 1972, wrote, \\"The drawings of Barbara Swan incisively complement the poems. Their designs are what they should be: importunate and macabre; Gothic and placental.\\" At least one critic found Swan's illustrations distastefully female. John N. Morris, reviewing Up Country in 1974, called them \\"prettifications\\" and complained that \\"they draw too much attention to the slightly ladylike quality of a few of these poems, the air they have of essays in the female georgic.\\" Portraiture Swan drew and painted portraits of Sexton, concert pianist Luise Vosgerchian, writer Tillie Olsen, historian James F. O'Gorman, composer Arthur Berger, and artists Sigmund Abeles, Gregory Gillespie, Harold Tovish, and Esther Geller, among others. According to her husband, she always started her portraits with the eyes. Later years Swan continued painting and exhibiting into her seventies. In 1995 her work was included in Boston's Honored Artists: Still Working, a tribute to senior artists at the Danforth Art Museum. A reviewer called her still lifes \\"intense\\". In many of her later paintings, images are distorted as light is refracted through glass and water. She died on June 2, 2003, at the Kindred Hospital in Brighton, Massachusetts. She was survived by her husband, her daughter Joanna, and her son Aaron. Her son, Aaron Fink, is also a painter whose work has been exhibited widely. Her husband Alan later died on March 21, 2017. Swan's work is included in the permanent collections of museums and galleries throughout the U.S. Her archived correspondence includes letters from, and photographs of, many notable artists and writers, including Bernard Chaet, Ellsworth Kelly, Maxine Kumin, Tillie Olsen, Anne Sexton, Andrew Stevovich, and Elbert Weinberg.

He graduated from National Central University, and then worked as a researcher in the University of Tokyo in Japan. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, he returned to China and worked in Jinagsu College of Education, Sichuan College of Education, Sun Yat-sen University and Dade College of Hong Kong. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Zhu was responsible for the school textbooks in Ministry of Education, and then worked as associate editor in People's Education Press. In 1951, he was invited to work in Beijing Normal University. He was the chairman of Education Department, director of Institute of Child psychology, and editor of Journal of Psychological Development and Education. Zhu was one of the first doctoral tutors, and cultivated China's first doctor in psychology, Lin Chongde. Early Life and study Zhu Zhixian was born in Ganyu County in Jiangsu Province in 1908. His mother died when he was 9 years old, and big brother died when he was 12. Then, when he was 26, his father was killed by brigands. Zhu was responsible for supporting the life expenses of his step mother and three younger brothers and his own study. After finishing high school study, he entered into No. 8 Normal University in Haizhou. When he graduated in 1928, he got the teaching work in the affiliated primary school due to his excellent performance. Two years later, Zhu started his undergraduate study in National Central University in Nanjing and got the bachelor's degrees in education. During his study and teaching work, he published more than 20 articles on teaching, and several books, such as Teaching Method of Primary School History, Study on the Curriculum of Primary School, and Research Methods in Education. In his fourth grade, his book, Study on the Curriculum of Primary School, was one of the reference books recommended by his teacher. Representative work: Child Psychology Zhu Zhixian wrote Child Psychology in 1962 which was the textbook of college students in psychology and education. The revised edition was published in 1979. This book illustrated the stage of child psychological development under the guidance of dialectical materialism. Zhu discussed the following issues in this book: * External cause of psychological development: There was a debate for long that children's psychological development was congenital or determined by environment. Zhu analyzed and criticized Granville Stanley Hall‚Äôs theory of heredity determination, John Broadus Watson‚Äôs theory of education determinism and Robert Sessions Woodworth‚Äôs theory of Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R). He proposed that heredity is a prerequisite of children‚Äôs psychological development, while environment and education is decisive condition. *Internal cause of psychological development: Zhu thought that motivation of children‚Äôs psychological development was the contradiction between requirement for children from society and education and children‚Äôs mental state. This internal contradiction boosted children‚Äôs psychological development. *Education and Development: Zhu insisted that education is necessary for children‚Äôs psychological development. The external and internal causes cannot boost children‚Äôs psychological development without education, but education plays role through external and internal causes. Therefore, children‚Äôs psychological development is determined by education condition which is suitable for children‚Äôs psychological development. Later life In 1979, when he was 71 years old, the revised edition of Child Psychology was published by People‚Äôs press. In 1980, Zhu edited Speech of Education of Children Psychology which was published by Beijing Normal University Press. In 1982, His book Encyclopedia of Children's Family Education was awarded the second prize of national outstanding science and technology books. He edited the book, Teaching Reference Materials of Child psychology, was published by Beijing Normal University Press. In 1983, he was in charge of the national key scientific research project ‚ÄúPsychological development and education of Chinese adolescent‚Äù. More than 200 psychological researchers participated in this project. In 1984, he and his student Lin Chongde edited the book, Developmental Psychology of Thinking, which was published in 1986. In 1985, he built the Institute of Child Psychology and the Journal of Psychological Development and Education. He was the director of Institute of Child psychology. In 1986, he led the compilation of Dictionary of Psychology which was published by Beijing Normal University Press and awarded first prize of Chinese book. In 1988, he and Lin Chongde edited the book History of Child Psychology, which was published Beijing Normal University Press. Zhu Zhixian died on March 5, 1991. Selected publications Zhu Zhixian published more than 200 articles or books in his life.

Skiing started off in the state as a recreational activity enjoyed by only a few, but since the 1930s, it has increasingly developed into a substantial industry, which creates thousands of jobs and brings in millions of dollars in revenue. The ski industry adds much to Utah‚Äôs economy, in particular its tourist industry, which includes several year-round outdoor activities, such as hiking, trekking, mountain climbing, and mountain biking. Utah‚Äôs seven major ski resorts, Alta, Brighton, Deer Valley, Park City, Snowbird, Solitude, and Sundance, are located in the Wasatch Range; however there are several others scattered throughout the state such as Beaver Mountain, Brian Head, Cherry Peak Resort, Eagle Point Ski Resort, Powder Mountain, Snowbasin and Wolf Mountain.  History   Pre-war (1900 to 1930s)  In the early nineteenth century, skiing simply started off as a way for people to move from one point to another, especially, in snowy winter months with limited mobility. The first persons who used skis were trappers, miners and mountain dwellers.Salt Lake Tribune, Jan. 15. 1992 In mining towns such as Alta, which on average received five-hundred inches on snow per year, skis were an essential means of transportation.Engen, Alan K. For the Love of Skiing: A Visual History. Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 1998. Print. As skiing developed, it became a popular recreational activity. All through the Wasatch Range, ski clubs and trails were created, which attracted skiers, hikers, and climbers. The Wasatch Mountain Club, founded by Charles T. Stoney in 1912, was the most successful of the first clubs. Skiing expeditions throughout the Wasatch mountains near Park City, Brighton, and Alta were organized and the first touring groups were established. During the late 1910s and 1920s, the Wasatch Mountain Club started to expand their touring groups which extended as far as Ogden. During the 1920s, the ski touring industry continued to expand. Short trips lasting from two to four days were popular in the Brighton area. Early on, because of the sport's extreme nature, public opinion of skiing portrayed it as a dangerous, largely because skis and cold-weather apparel were hand-made and primitive. Later, once equipment and apparel improved, the public opinion of skiing improved as well. By the 1930s, the sport evolved and professional ski jump meets were organized. Becker Hill started hosting professional meets which attracted thousands of spectators. The attention of these events sparked the expansion of other ski areas, such as Rasmussen's Ranch in Parley's Canyon and Ecker Hill. In 1937, the National ski jumping championship was held at Ecker Hill, after the Utah Ski Club and the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce raised thirty-five hundred dollars for the event. Between eight and nine thousand spectators attended the Championship. The New Deal provided public work relief programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps Highways which constructed highways to ski resorts, such as Alta and Brighton. Also at this time, the first uphill tows were created. These new highways and improved technologies expanded the ski industry further, and more jobs were created, which mitigated the effects of the Great Depression. In 1938, the first ski lift was constructed by businessman Joe Quinney and his partners with the hopes that it would transform the ski industry in Utah.Joseph, Arave. \\"Utah History.\\" Utah Ski Resorts. Travel Center, 1 Jan. 2000. Web. During the first year the lift was plagued with problems and only operated sporadically, but later modifications greatly improved the lifts which allowed beginners and experienced skiers to go up and down the mountains with ease. Other resorts such as Brighton, Snow Basin, and Cache Valley soon followed and added their own ski lifts. The efficiency of the lifts propelled the advancement of other new skiing inventions, like poles, adjustable bindings, sealskin climbers, ski wax, water-resistant clothing, and goggles. In the 1940s, skiing in Utah expanded drastically. In 1914, only a few people skied and no modern-day resorts existed, but in 1940, it was recorded that over 190,000 had visited ski resorts in Utah. The era of lift-served skiing came to Park City with local skiing enthusiasts Otto Carpenter and Bob Burns building a ski lift and a warming hut at Snow Park Resort in 1946. The resort operated on weekends and holidays until it closed in 1969. The site of the Snow Park Resort is now Deer Valley Resort.Rick Pieros. Park City Past and Present 72 (2011) In 1941, when the United States entered World War II, the demand for skiing and other recreational activities decreased.The Ramber, Dec. 1942 Many, but not all, ski resorts were converted into training camps for paratroopers and specific rescue groups of the U.S. military.Kelner, Alexis. Skiing in Utah: A History. Salt Lake City, Utah (1201 1st Ave., Salt Lake City 84103): A. Kelner, 1980. Print. The resorts that were reserved for recreation were commonly used for alpine skiing. Alpine skiing increased in popularity and more competitions were created. For example, Alta started the famous Snow Cup tournament in 1940 and Snowbasin hosted the US National downhill slalom and combined ski championships in 1947. The 1948 US Winter Olympic team included a large contingent of Utah skiers.\\"Skiing in Utah.\\" Life in the Valley Magazine. Life in the Valley Magazine. Web. 22 Apr. 2015. . During the latter part of the war, winter recreation surged in popularity once again and ski resorts were often operating at full capacity. Alta and Brighton alone received 44,000 skiers during the 1944‚Äì45 winter season. After World War II, state officials promoted Utah's slopes more than ever, producing the film \\"Ski Aces\\" which was shown to millions throughout the United States.Rugh, Susan. \\"Branding Utah: Industrial Tourism in the Postwar American West.\\" The Western Historical Quarterly 37.4 (2006): 445-72.

Engen and Gregory C. Thompson, First Tracks: A Century of Skiing in Utah (Salt Lake City, 2001), 122. State government conducted research at this time which concluded that winter sports recreation brought in two and a half times more revenue than summer recreation leading to even more money spent on advertising.1 Rulon S. Howells, Commissioner, to Gerald L. Leaver, 13 December 1948, box 19, Series 1138.

James Cannon, known as Jim Cannon, first came up with the \\"Ski Utah!\\" brand, which caught on with skiing fans and boosted Utah's tourism industry. Shortly after, he coined the slogan \\"The Greatest Snow on Earth\\" ‚Äî the phrase that was eventually printed on Utah license plates in 1985. The Travel Council exhibited these ski slogans on many billboards all over the state and created advertisements which were displayed at extreme sport conferences in Los Angeles, Oakland, Chicago, and New Jersey.Utah Tourist and Publicity Council, Report, July I, ?960 to June 30, 1962 (Salt Lake City,1962), pp. 4-5, 9, box 1, Series 2993.

By 1972, tourism was ranked as the second largest industry in Utah and generated nearly $209 million per year for the state.Lee Jorgensen, \\"Governor's Conference on Tourism, Travel Utah, Inc.,\\" box 3, Series 2501, USARS. = Utahn Inc. = To get more Utahns interested in the development of the tourist industry, Utahn Inc. was created, which consisted of the chamber of commerce, various hotels, transportation and touring companies, amusement parks, ski resorts, and park agencies. This organization was successful in promoting economic activity in the state and was largely responsible for developing Park City's Ski industry. In 1962, it helped the United Park City Mines company stay afloat and helped build the Treasure Mountain Ski resort, which was eventually renamed as the Park City Mountain Resort.Kristen Smart Rogers said, '\\"We Didn't Think He Was Gonna Build It': Skiing Hits a Mining Town.\\" Utah Historical Quarterly 69 (Fall 2001): 310-25.

Moreover, the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation also distributed over $120 million in sports related programs and operations at Utah Olympic Oval in Kearns and Utah Olympic Park near Park City.

Future developments  In 2013, Vail Resorts signed a 50-year lease agreement to operate Canyons Resort, the largest ski resort in Utah. In 2014, Vail purchased Canyons Resort's neighbor, Park City Mountain Resort from Powdr Corporation. Since the acquisition, the Colorado-based resort has connected Park City to The Canyons ‚Äî a plan which has been estimated to cost $50 million for an interconnect gondola and other upgradesBECKY LOMAX 9th December 2014  On the Snow Vail Resorts Combines Park City & Canyons  and created the largest ski resort in the United States, with over 7,300 acres for skiing and snowboarding. In 2014, Ski Utah formed a project called One Wasatch. This projects plans to team up with seven Wasatch Range ski resorts just east of Salt Lake City: Alta, Brighton, Canyons, Deer Valley, Park City, Snowbird, and Solitude. Their objective is to create the largest network of ski resorts in North America with 100 lifts, 750 runs and 18,000 acres to explore. The cost of the project is estimated at $30 million for new lifts and improved infrastructure.Brad Tuttle Forget the Alps: 100-Lift, 18,000-Acre Mega Ski Resort Planned in Utah TIME March 21, 2014 However, One Wasatch is opposed by a group called \\"Save Our Canyons\\" who seek to protect the Wasatch Front from further developments that could be detrimental to the environment, especially considering that both the Cottonwood Canyons are watersheds for the Salt Lake Valley. One Wasatch is also opposed by the local backcountry skiing community as the Wasatch is one of the most popular locations in the United States and One Wasatch would allow access to terrain that skiers would normally need to be able to ski tour in order to ski down.  Climate change  Climate change is a global problem which directly affects the core of the ski industry. Resorts have adjusted to the climate changes over the years by implementing new technologies, like, snow-making machines, that enable resorts to stay open longer.Impacts of climate change on ski industry; Environmental Science & Policy M. Gilaberte- B√∫rdaloa, F. L√≥pez-Mart√≠nb, M.R. Pino-Ot√≠na, J.I. L√≥pez-Morenoc, Comparing records since 1999, the NRDC reported that Utah had 14 percent fewer skiers in low snow fall winters compared to heavy snowfall winters; that it cost the state $87 million in revenue and 1,000 jobs were lost; and that future projections estimate that the ski industry will lose 27,000 jobs and $1 billion in revenue due to decreasing snow.Mike Gorrell sltibe December 17, 2012 Global warming hits Utah‚Äôs ski industry hard  Summer resorts  Occasionally, some resorts are able to stay open into the summer if there is enough snow to continue operating, most frequently Snowbird because of its microclimate for snow retention. With decreasing snow levels, most resorts have limited operations through the summer and have invested in summer activities, which include miniature golfing, alpine slides/coasters, climbing walls for kids, zip-lines, and several hiking and biking trails.  Employment  The Winter sports industry has proven to be an asset to Utah's economy, attracting nonresidents and bringing in new out-of-state dollars to the economy every year. In the latest RRC Associates survey on Skiing in Utah, they estimated that skiers and snowboarders spent about $1.29 billion in the 2012/13 season‚Äîa 10% increase from the previous year. Of the $1.29 billion spent, $1.1 billion was spent by nonresident skiers and snowboarders. Based on data calculated by BEBR, the ski industry provided 18,419 direct, indirect and induced full- and part-time winter sports-related jobs during the month of February 2013.Bureau of Economics and business Research 2014  Volume 73, Number 4 Many of the top winter sports events come to Utah because of the variety of world-class venues that were constructed during the 2002 Olympics. As a result, thousands of additional tourists travel here, which again creates hundreds of seasonal jobs for Utah's economy. Laura Shaw of the Utah Sports Commission, a non-profit organization created by the state to attract sporting events, estimated that winter sporting events brought in $27.3 million for the state in 2013.Billy Hesterman - Daily Herald Winter sports industry crucial to Utah economy December 15, 2013 Events are held all over Utah including Park City, Salt Lake City, and Kerns.

Patterned after prior Operation Raindance, it depended upon extensive air strikes blasting communist units and clearing them from the path of the Royalist offensive. Powered by 150 daylight and 50 night sorties daily, with 50 to 80 day strikes directed by Raven Forward Air Controllers, Kou Kiet ran from 6 August to 30 September 1969. It was successful beyond expectations. After the Royal Lao Government troops achieved their objectives, General Vang Pao insisted on pushing forward while they had the initiative. As a result, the Royalists regained control of the entire Plain of Jars while also capturing a huge stock of munitions from the communists. Their triumph came at a cost. However successful the Royalists were, by battle's end their battle- worn forces had exhausted their pool of potential recruits, while the Vietnamese could easily replace their personnel losses. Overview After World War II, France fought the First Indochina War to retain French Indochina. As part of its loss of that war at Dien Ben Phu, it freed the Kingdom of Laos. Laotian neutrality was established in the 1954 Geneva Agreements. When France withdrew most of its military in conformity with the treaty, the United States filled the vacuum with purportedly civilian paramilitary instructors.Castle, pp. 7‚Äì12, 15‚Äì18. A North Vietnamese-backed communist insurrection began as early as 1949. Invading during the opium harvest season of 1953, it settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.Dommen, pp. 30-34. As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency established a secret guerrilla army in the Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought to hold on to their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos.Warner, pp. 44‚Äì47 After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng. As a riposte, Hmong General Vang Pao plotted another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists. However, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) beat him to it with Campaign Thoan Thang. After the Vietnamese campaign ran its course, Vang Pao launched yet another inconclusive offensive that failed to clear the foe from the Plain of Jars, Operation Off Balance.Warner, p. 264.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 210‚Äì211.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 298, 300. By 28 June 1969, the PAVN had 60 tanks deployed. Additionally, there were seven new Vietnamese infantry battalions poised on the Plain, while the Royalist remained unreinforced. The PAVN now had a total of 26 battalions in the Plain of Jars area, seemingly poised for a further wet season offensive.Ahern, p. 320.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 307‚Äì309. Kou Kiet Preliminaries The monsoon rains that had crippled the air support for Operation Off Balance, and Operation Pigfat before that, now began to clear to favor Vang Pao and his forces. With about triple the usual rainfall for the month of July, communist ground logistics began to bog down, often quite literally. Conversely, Vang Pao's troops were being amply supplied via air bridge; brand new M16 rifles were being secretively provided for his troops. Also, U.S. Air Force tactical air strikes with area denial munitions forced the PAVN supply efforts off the main road. However, to the opposing Royalist forces, the PAVN still remained a threatening force in being to the ancestral Hmong territory south of the Plain of Jars. In late July 1969, as Off Balance was still being fought, Vang Pao plotted a diversionary attack against the PAVN's main supply road, Route 7. Suspicious of leaky security among the Royal Lao Army command, Vang Pao demanded CIA-supported guerrillas for his next offensive. His insistence was problematic, as he lacked the needed manpower in his own CIA guerrilla army. In an unprecedented move, guerrillas were transferred in from other Military Regions.Ahern, p. 323. The Hmong general called the new offensive operation Kou Kiet (Redeemed Honor). His CIA contacts dubbed it Operation About Face when they approved it.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 214‚Äì217. No matter the name, it was patterned on the previous Operation Raindance, planned as a three-week attack with the major firepower being tactical air. Newly arrived Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley messaged his superiors in the U.S. State Department that the military situation on the Plain of Jars was so crucial that if fighter-bombers would not suffice for Kou Kiet, Arc Light strikes by B-52s should be considered as a followup.Anthony, Sexton, p. 309. It was planned as a two phase operation. The first phase was a helilift of two battalions to a ridgeline overlooking Nong Pet, which oversaw Route 70. From there, both the Royalist battalion of regulars and the Hmong Special Guerrilla Unit would attack and block Route 7. The second phase would involve three battalions of Royal Lao Army and five battalions of irregulars. They were to be helicoptered in to take up positions on two mountains that overlooked the southern Plain of Jars. This latter movement seemed beyond Royalist capabilities; both his CIA advisors and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma cautioned him about it. However, the Hmong general pressed forward with his plans, even persuading both Military Region 3 and Military Region 4 to loan him a guerrilla battalion each. Kou Kiet was due to launch on 3 August. Although the PAVN outnumbered the Hmong and had superior fighting power, it was believed that air power during favorable weather conditions would tip the balance to the Royalists.Ahern, p. 327. Planning 150 tactical air strikes during daylight, and 50 strikes per night, the U.S. Air Force could count on Raven FACs to spot for and direct 50 to 80 sorties per day close air support for the Royalist guerrillas.Anthony, Sexton, p. 310. Phase one After a hold because of bad weather, the offensive kicked off during a heavy rain on 6 August 1969.Ahern, p. 326. With the new troops available from other Military Regions, the operational planning had shifted to a pincer movement for phase one. Blue Battalion from Military Region 3 was coptered into Bouamlong, north of Route 7, to be joined by local Auto Defense Choc militia. They were to march south toward the Nong Pet road junction. The other pincer was landed by short takeoff and landing aircraft at San Tiau, southeast of Route 7. This makeshift force was made up of Military Region 4's battalion-sized 2nd Special Guerrilla Unit, Military Region 2's Bataillon Volontaires 27 (Volunteer Battalion 27), plus some ADC guerrillas. Despite the weather hold, the attack began in heavy rain. As a result, the northern contingent was bogged down for about a week before helicopters could move them to Nong Pet. At about the same date, on 19 August, the southern pincer took the ridge overseeing Nong Pet that was their objective. Four days later, the northern task force had moved within eight kilometers of Nong Pet. The People's Army of Vietnam had offered no organized resistance to the Royalist incursion. Road watch teams, plus implanted spy sensors, both reported that no trucks bearing supplies for the communists had made it down Route 7 onto the Plain of Jars since the attacks began. Encouraged by his success, and by the lack of opposition, Vang Pao launched Phase two of his plan. Phase two Building on success, on 20 August Vang Pao expanded his offensive. He continued to plan on a two-pronged operation. As before, there was a northern column. Two battalions of Royalist regular volunteers‚ÄîBataillon Volontaires 21 and Bataillon Volontaires 24‚Äîwere stiffened with the 101 Bataillon Parachutistes (101st Paratroop Battalion). This probe moved northeastward from Ban Na; their immediate objective was Moung Phanh. The second column, moving in from the south, consisted of two regimental-size units of guerrillas, Groupe Mobile 22 and Groupe Mobile 23. Most of the Kou Kiet troops were armed with M16s. GM 22 and GM 23 marched northward without opposition through the marshy southern edge of the Plain of Jars for five days, GM 22 leading, GM 23 trailing. Then GM 22 split in two; part of the unit swerved eastward on its own axis of advance. The two prongs of GM 22 would reunite at the Lat Houang junction of Routes 4 and 5 by the end of August. There they found a feast of abandoned livestock. On 31 August, the U.S. Air Force began five days of spraying defoliant on communist-held rice paddies on the plain. The ongoing success of the campaign was credited to air power. Besides the heavy daily contribution of 140 sorties per day of the U.S. Air Force, fewer than 30 Royal Lao Air Force AT-28s flew over 90 sorties per day of close air support. By 1 September, there had been no real opposition from the foe. Of the 18 communist battalions that had been occupying the Plain of Jars, only two weren't Pathet Lao. A Vietnamese prisoner of war revealed that the communists planned no new offensive until arrival of the dry season. On 4 September, a captured PAVN officer described his 400-man unit and six tanks as being trapped when they attempted withdrawal back along Route 7 to North Vietnam. Most unusually for the highly disciplined PAVN, the unit broke, scattered, and fled. At about this time, Vang Pao realized he could extend his offensive still further. Phase two, part two By 5 September, the Hmong irregulars moved north onto the Plain of Jars, overrunning huge hoards of military materiel, including a fleet of PT-76 tanks. Continuing onwards, still uncontested, on 9 September GM 22 captured Khang Khay. Even as they were doing so, GM 23 swung into action. Two of its battalions captured Phou Khe and Phonsavan on 12 September; the third relieved GM 22 at Khang Khay. GM 22 advanced one kilometer northwest to occupy a cavern containing a Pathet Lao radio station, and other materiel. Vang Pao brought more fresh troops to his campaign, a mixture of Royalist regulars and Hmong irregulars. On 18 September, Bataillon Volontaires 21 and a force of the hill tribe guerrillas captured Phou San and nearby foothills. Here, for the first time, the RLG troops met resistance. After the communists managed to block the Royalist advance for two days. the latter were reinforced by a regiment, Groupe Mobile 21. GM 21 was tasked with seizing the high ground at Phou Keng in a night assault. They took it on 24 September, granting them surveillance of the northern end of the Plain of Jars. With the Plain of Jars largely under RLG control, a scratch force of seven Auto Defense Choc militia companies closed in on the PAVN troops stranded in Muang Soui. On the last day of September, two ADC companies occupied Muang Soui as the battered, starving Vietnamese faded into the jungle. Despite extensive bombing by the U.S. Air Force, most equipment there was undamaged, and untouched by the PAVN. At this point, it became apparent that communist resistance was forming. There were still three intact PAVN regiments in the vicinity; military intelligence reports heralded the arrival of the PAVN 312th Division from Vietnam. A PAVN counterattack on an SGU fixed position at Phou Nok Kok showed that the Vietnamese were willing to take heavy casualties to attrite the dwindling guerrilla forces.Ahern, p. 329. Results of the operation During this operation, Vang Pao and his Hmong army became dependent on close air support to the point they were considered to be the first guerrillas in history to project air superiority. That dependence began to erode their fighting abilities.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 249 - 250. By the time Kou Kiet ended on 30 September 1969, tactical air was credited with hitting 308 communist vehicles. The PAVN had fled, abandoning the Pathet Lao and their weak allies in the Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes. The Pathet Lao dispersed into the countryside, while the Neutralists refused combat and hastily retreated eastward to the border with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. One of the caches captured by the advancing Hmong contained 100 tons of munitions; another held 22 trucks. Falling into the conquerors' hands by the end of October were 25 tanks, 113 vehicles with over 800,000 liters of fuel, more than 6,400 weapons, almost six million rounds of ammunition, and five days rations for the entire PAVN force.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 203, 205. In terms of materiel captured, Kou Kiet was the greatest haul yet in the Second Indochina War.Conboy, Morrison, p. 248. The loss jarred the PAVN into changing their previous tactics of stockpiling supplies close to their front line troops before an offensive.Ahern, p. 336. Now, with the width of the plain separating the communists from the main guerrilla bases, the latter were no longer besieged. In addition to the tremendous stores of military materiel captured by the RLG, 20,000 inhabitants of the Plain were removed, depriving the communists of porters to move their supplies. The Plain of Jars was now clearly under RLG control for the first time in almost a year. However, the Hmong guerrilla attack suffered from success; the irregulars had outrun the planned limits of the campaign and pushed into an area designated for area denial ordnance. As a result, U.S. Air Force pilots could not drop mines to seal off the Vietnamese incursions due to the presence of friendly troops.Conboy, Morrison, p. 250. Aftermath Even as Kou Kiet was grinding to its finish, General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p issued orders on 13 September for an upcoming PAVN dry season attack in Military Region 2, dubbed Campaign 139. A preliminary battalion-sized retaliatory probe on 29 November pushed Bataillon Volontaires 21 and its Hmong auxiliaries off their mountaintop strongpoint. The Hmong, who were transitioning from classic guerrillas to light infantry, suffered irreplaceable increased casualties as a result. General Vang Pao's forces had dwindled to about 5,000Ahern, p, 331. to 5,500 effectives. The Pathet Lao outnumbered them, with about 6,000 under arms. PAVN, on the other hand, could muster 16,000 troops.Anthony, Sexton, p. 323. Moreover, while the Vietnamese replenished their losses, the Hmong were hard pressed to find recruits to replace their casualties. Refugee relief worker Pop Buell left an account of recruiting Hmong replacements: > ...we rounded up three hundred fresh recruits. Thirty percent were fourteen > years old or less, and ten of them were only ten years old. Another thirty > percent were fifteen or sixteen. The remaining forty percent were forty-five > or over. Where were the ones in between? I'll tell you‚Äîthey're all > dead.Tapp, p. 82. The Pathet Lao communists held rural territory largely barren of population for replacements; their forces had dwindled to battalions of about 150 men. By comparison, the Vietnamese could hypothetically replace 10,000 casualties per year for the next 14 years in the northern Laotian fighting, while Laotian forces could expect few or no replacements. A planned three-week offensive had stretched into three and a half months. The Royalist irregular troops were exhausted by their successful drive. The mismatch in troops made them obviously unable to hold the ground they had captured. The American Embassy backers of the operation recommended that the guerrillas plan a step by step withdrawal back across the Plain of Jars, retreating through a series of four static lines. Key to the original defensive line was Phou Nok Kok. The PAVN attacked Phou Nok Kok's 600 man garrison throughout December, suffering an estimated 400 killed in action and 1,000 wounded, mostly inflicted by close air support. As bad flying weather curtailed air support for the Royalists during January 1971, the communists continued their attacks. On 12 January 1971, after a six-week defense that cost the PAVN about 600 killed, and despite the initial use of RLAF AC-47 gunships for support, the Hmong guerrillas withdrew from the stronghold. They had suffered 12 killed. With the loss of Phou Nok Kok, which barred the eastern entry to the Plain, the Royalists were forced to withdraw.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 323 - 325. Nevertheless, Kou Kiet was dubbed \\"the first major victory in the history of the Royal Lao Government\\".Anthony, Sexton, p. 331. Notes References * Ahern, Thomas L.

During that confrontation, Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone Town Marshal Virgil Earp, Assistant Town Marshal Morgan Earp, and temporary deputy marshals Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday shot and killed Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury. Billy's brother Ike, who had repeatedly threatened to kill the Earps for some time, had been present at the gunfight but was unarmed and fled. As permitted by territory law, he filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday on October 30. In an unusual preliminary hearing, Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer heard testimony from a large number of witnesses during the next 30 days. Friends of the Cowboys, most notably Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, testified that the Cowboys had thrown up their hands or opened their coats and been shot in cold blood. Initially persuasive, his testimony motivated Spicer to jail Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday who had been free on bond. (Virgil and Morgan were recuperating from their wounds.) Friends of the lawman and several key neutral witnesses then testified that the Cowboys had drawn their guns and that Virgil Earp had called out, \\"Hold, I don't want that!\\" or words to that effect. In a lengthy ruling, Spicer concluded there was no basis for a trial. Although he criticized Virgil Earp's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, he concluded that no laws were broken by the lawmen. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil. He described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a \\"proposition both monstrous and startling!\\" The Earps were freed from jail, but the blood feud between the lawmen and their friends and the Cowboys and their allies escalated. On December 14, Justice Spicer received a threatening letter from \\"a miner\\" who threatened to kill him and told him to leave Tombstone. On the same day, someone tried to kill Tombstone Mayor John Clum, who was a member of the Citizens Safety Committee and publisher of The Tombstone Epitaph that had consistently supported the Earps. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and hit by a shotgun round that crippled his left arm. The Earps thought they knew who the perpetrators were, but witnesses provided alibis for them. On March 18, Morgan was killed while playing billiards. An assassin shot him through the window of a door that opened up into an alley. A bullet intended for Wyatt struck close above his head. Once again, the Earps believed they knew the men responsible, but the testimony of a key witness was inadmissible and the Cowboys were not charged. Wyatt assumed Virgil's duties as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County. He concluded that he could not rely on the courts for justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. He believed that the only way to deal with the Earp's enemies was to kill them. He assembled a federal posse that intercepted Frank Stilwell laying in wait near the train station in Tucson and killed him. They then scoured the countryside looking for the others they believed responsible. During early April, 1882, Wyatt and his posse tracked down and killed Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz, Curly Bill Brocius, and Johnny Barnes, three of the men they believed were responsible for their brothers' ambush and murder. The ride for vengeance came to be called the Earp Vendetta Ride. Five of the Earp party were wanted on a warrant for killing Frank Stilwell, and they left Arizona Territory and never returned.  Background   Media response  The two newspapers in Tombstone usually opposed each other in their reporting, but both newspapers' stories after the gunfight initially supported the lawmen's version of events. The Daily Nugget was a Democratic newspaper loyal to Sheriff Behan and the rural Cowboys, but their pro-Cowboy publisher Harry Woods was out of town. Richard Rule, an experienced reporter, knew Behan personally and very likely interviewed him after the gun fight. He wrote the story for Nugget published on the day after the shootout, and it backed up the Earps' version of events. Rule wrote in the style of the day by telling a story without attributing sources or naming witnesses. Rule reported that the battle began when Frank made a motion for his pistol, and that Wyatt responded by drawing and firing his pistol. He wrote that Doc Holliday fired a short- barreled shotgun. Rule's account backed up the actions taken by the Earp brothers and Holliday. Rule's article varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony. Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan and the Cowboys' view of events. The October 28, 1881, issue of The Tombstone Epitaph, which was loyal to the Republican business establishment, was more restrained in its language: Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nuggets later view entirely and supported the lawmen. Since The Tombstone Epitaph was the local Associated Press client, its story was the version of events that most readers across the United States read first.  Public reaction  The initial public reaction was largely favorable to the Earps, but began to change when rumors began to circulate that Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury were unarmed, and that Billy Clanton and Tom McLaury even threw up their hands before the shooting. Within a few days, Phineas \\"Phin\\" Clanton arrived in town, and some began to claim that the Earps and Holliday had committed murder, instead of enforcing the law. Clara Spalding Brown, the wife of mining engineer Theodore Brown, was a correspondent for the San Diego Union and other California newspapers. She wrote that Tombstone residents were divided about the justification for the killings. Referring to the initial testimony offered by Ike Clanton, she wrote, \\"Opinion is pretty divided as to the justification of the killing. You may meet one man who will support the Earps, and declare that no other course was possible to save their own lives, and the next man is just as likely to assert that there was no occasion whatever for bloodshed, and that this will be 'a warm place' for the Earps hereafter. At the inquest yesterday, the damaging fact was ascertained that only two of the cowboys were armed, it thus being a most unequal fight.\\" Even the Governor of the Arizona Territory, John C. Fr√©mont, reported after the gunfight, \\"Many of the very best law-abiding and peace-loving citizens [of Tombstone] have no confidence in the willingness of the civil officers to pursue and bring to justice that element of out-lawry so largely disturbing the sense of security ... [The opinion] is quite prevalent that the civil officers are quite largely in league with the leaders of this disturbing and dangerous element.\\"  Conflicting record of events  It is not known who started shooting first. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. All witnesses agreed that general firing almost immediately commenced. Most witnesses reported the first two shots were so close together that they could barely be distinguished. Some witnesses testified that Morgan and Doc fired across one another at Billy and Frank, respectively. Wyatt said that he and Billy Clanton had fired first, and Virgil confirmed that one of the first shots was fired by Billy Clanton. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Witnesses could not agree on whether Tom McLaury was armed. The existing record of the events surrounding the gunfight and the testimony given at the preliminary hearing are provided by three primary sources. The first two are the newspapers, The Tombstone Epitaph and The Nugget. Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony at the coroner's inquest and the Spicer hearings, but only the reporter from the Nugget knew shorthand. The third source was the court recorder, who took down the testimony in longhand. Testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two reporters varied greatly. Generally the Nugget coverage was more complete, but occasionally the Epitaph offered information not found elsewhere. Author Stuart N. Lake, who wrote the extremely popular biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal, relied on the surviving portion of the court record, which he described as a \\"sheaf of original handwritten documents rescued from oblivion.\\" Part-time newspaper reporter Howell 'Pat' Hayhurst, sponsored by the Federal Writers' Project, part of the Works Progress Administration, transcribed all of the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s. However, it's known that Hayhurst arbitrarily edited and removed text that he decided was not relevant. The documents were subsequently lost and are still unaccounted for. Hayhurst seemed to have an antipathy toward Wyatt Earp. Author Alan Barra believes Hayhurst was a friend of Albert Behan, Johnny Behan's son. After he completed his transcription, he kept the original document in his home, where it was destroyed in a house fire. Lake later said Hayhurst 'mutilated' the transcription. Alford E. Turner published The OK Corral Inquest based on the Hayhurst transcription, minus his edits, in 1981, and added his own footnotes. He hired a typist to copy the Hayhurst transcription, which introduced additional errors and omissions. A copy of the Hayhurst transcription is in the Goldwater collection at Arizona State University.  Coroner's report  Coroner Henry M. Matthews convened the Coroner's Inquest. For unknown reasons, he chose individuals mostly sympathetic to the Cowboys: Ike Clanton, William Claiborne, C.H. Light, John Behan, R.F. Coleman, William Cuddy, Peter Fallehy, and Mrs. Martha King. Matthews examined the dead Cowboys and reported his findings to the inquest members. The Tombstone Epitaph reported and commented on the coroner's jury's findings: Matthews testified at the inquest that Tom McLaury had been killed by a single shotgun blast, contradicting Behan's testimony that he had been shot with a pistol, which according to the defense, \\"... to make any sense, the court would have to believe that Holliday marched down Fremont Street carrying a shotgun; put it aside in order to pull out his pistol; fired the first shot, presumably at Billy Clanton; and then picked up the shotgun in order to kill Tom McLaury‚Äîall in the space of a few seconds.\\" Under questioning, Matthews said he did not see Ike Clanton appeal to Wyatt to not shoot him.  Earps and Holliday arrested Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer Four days after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, as permitted by territorial law, Ike Clanton applied by affidavit for an arrest warrant against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Because Morgan and Virgil were incapacitated by their wounds, they were recovering at home, and were not required to post bail. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer. Spicer initially denied bail because it was a capital case, but \\"upon a showing of facts by affidavit,\\" decided to exercise judicial discretion, and granted Wyatt and Holliday $10,000 bail, about $ today. Their bail was paid by contributions from James Earp, Tom Fitch (their attorney), Robert J. Winders (a mining partner), E. B. Gage (part-owner and superintendent of the Grand Central Mining Company), Fred J. Dodge (Wells Fargo undercover agent), and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts. Wyatt contributed $7,000 to Holliday's bail amount. Gage was also a prominent Republican and a member of the Citizens Safety Committee. Fitch was one of the most experienced criminal defense lawyers in the region. Justice Spicer was a Republican and had mutual friends in common with the Earps. He had been a lawyer, prospector, land speculator, and journalist. The defense appeared to bet its case on winning a preliminary hearing in front of Spicer, rather than in front of a jury that might be composed of Cowboy loyalists. The city council suspended Virgil Earp as town marshal pending the outcome of the hearing. James Flynn was named to replace him.  Preliminary hearing convened  After Ike Clanton filed murder charges, Justice Spicer convened the preliminary hearing in the Mining Exchange Building on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial. In an unusual proceeding, Spicer took written and oral testimony from a number of witnesses over more than a month.  Prosecution team and witnesses  The preliminary hearing was prosecuted by Republican District Attorney Lyttleton Price, assisted by John M. Murphy, James Robinson, and Ben Goodrich. During initial motions, they tried to invalidate Justice Spicer's ability to render a decision. They argued that as justice of the peace he was merely an administrative officer and had no power to pass judgement on the evidence submitted. They submitted that his only duty was to note the evidence submitted along with the objections taken. Spicer denied the motion, stating that he was acting as the court and had the power to pass on the admissibility of all evidence put before the court. Price and his team were joined on November 4 by William McLaury, Frank and Tom's older brother, and an able attorney from Ft. Worth, Texas. The outlaw Cowboys were anxious for a ruling finding the lawmen guilty of murder. A travel writer from New York reported that the Earps had sufficient influence in town that they would go free, but that Cowboys were \\"flocking into town, and on one quiet Sunday afternoon in particular things wore an ominous look. It was said that should justice fail to be done, the vengeful, resolute men conferring darkly at the edges of the sidewalk would attempt to take the matter into their own hands.\\"  Will McLaury threats Will McLaury appeared to be genuinely convinced that Ike Clanton was telling the truth, that the Earps and Holliday and taken part in a scheme to rob stages, and that the Earps and Holliday had killed his brothers hiding behind their badges in the execution of the Cowboys. He arrived with every intention of seeing the Earp's and Holliday pay for killing his brothers by \\"one means or another.\\" After Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday were jailed during the fifth day of the hearing, Will McLaury wrote about the hearing and the events in a letter to his sister. He implied in his letters that if he wasn't successful obtaining justice through the courts that he might call on armed friends to kill the lawmen. In another letter, Will McLaury stated it was his duty to see that the lawmen were punished. Later in November he wrote his sister again, who had criticized him as a single father for leaving his family in Texas for such a long period.  Martha J. King  Martha J. King was in Bauer's butcher shop, next door to the O.K. Corral's rear entrance, when she saw the Earp party walk by four abreast, headed towards Fly's Boarding House and Photography Studio. She saw Holliday, nearest to the building, carrying \\"a gun, not a pistol\\" under his overcoat on the left side. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992)  C.H. Light  C. H. \\"Ham\\" Light, a business partner of Pete Spence and a friend to the Cowboys, heard the first two shots from his room at the Aztec House across the corner from the fight, and went to the window in time to see all but the first two shots fired. According to Light, at that time Tom McLaury was already moving onto Fremont Street, away from the empty lot, although other eyewitness accounts placed Tom's movement later.  Sheriff Johnny Behan  As Cochise County Sheriff, Johnny Behan was the most significant witness for the prosecution. The first story published in the Nuggett the day after the shooting, which was usually very friendly to the Cowboys, stated that Behan \\"was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it.\\" But Behan's testimony contradicted what was reported in the Nuggett. On the third day of the hearing, Behan began two days on the stand. Behan said he tried to persuade the Cowboys to give up their weapons and attempted to stop the Earps from confronting them. Behan testified that from the time the Earps passed him by to confront the Cowboys, he had watched them closely. Behan gave strong testimony that the Cowboys had not resisted but either threw up their hands or turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that the Earp group started shooting first. \\"I suppose that there was as many as 8 or 10 shots before I saw arms in the hands of any of the McLaury or Clanton party.\\" But Behan offered confusing testimony about which member of the lawmen first pulled the trigger. He testified he \\"saw a shotgun before the fight commenced. Doc Holliday had it. He had it under his coat.\\" He said he did not see the shotgun used. He also said that, \\"My impression at the time was that Holliday had the nickel-plated pistol\\", that \\"The nickel-plated pistol was the first to fire,\\" and that \\"The nickel-plated pistol was fired by the second man from the right.\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) He told the court that he heard Billy Clanton say, \\"Don't shoot me. I don't want to fight.\\" He also testified that Tom McLaury threw open his coat to show that he was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Behan denied hearing either the Clantons or McLaurys make any threats against the Earps or Holliday beforehand. He also denied telling the Earps, \\"I have got them disarmed.\\" But Behan had motive to lie. Ever since he reneged on his promise to put Wyatt in as his deputy once he won the election, the two had been at odds. And there was also the possibility that Behan knew of the attraction if not a relationship between Josie and Wyatt. Under cross-examination by Earp's attorney, he admitted seeing Holliday carrying the messenger shotgun towards the confrontation. All the witnesses testified that they saw Holliday carrying a shotgun. Behan's testimony for the prosecution initially turned public opinion against the Earps. He portrayed a far different gunfight than had been first reported in both of the Tombstone papers. But he was also challenged by the defense attorney about a conversation he reportedly had with Virgil Earp the evening of the gunfight during which he supported their version of events. Fitch asked Behan if while visiting the Earps that night if he had said, \\"I heard you say, \`Boys, throw up your hands; I have come to disarm you,' when one of the McLowry boys said, \`We will, and drew his gun, and shooting then commenced. I am your friend, and you did perfectly right,' or language of the same substance or import?\\" Behan equivocated and did directly answer the question.  Thomas Allen  Thomas Allen said he thought Holliday fired first and that it was a pistol shot. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992)  Ike Clanton  Ike Clanton Ike Clanton took the stand on November 9. He repeated in his testimony the story of abuse that he had suffered at the hands of the Earps and Holliday the night before the gunfight. He denied threatening the Earps. He testified that the Clantons and Frank McLaury raised their hands after Virgil's command, and Tom thrust open his vest to show he was unarmed. Clanton said Wyatt shoved his revolver in his belly, telling him, \\"You son-of-a-bitch, you can have a fight!\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Clanton backed up Behan's testimony that Holliday and Morgan Earp had fired the first two shots and that the next several shots also came from the Earp party. Under cross-examination, Clanton said that Doc Holliday, Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Morgan Earp had all confided in him that they had actually been involved in the stage robbery. He further claimed that Holliday had told him that Holliday had \\"piped off\\" money from the stage before it left (although no money was missing, and the stage had not been successfully robbed). Clanton also said Holliday had confessed to him about killing the stage driver. Clanton testified that Wyatt Earp had threatened to kill him and his confederates because Earp feared they would reveal his part in the robbery. Murder was a capital offense, and given their acrimonious relationship, it was unlikely Holliday would confide in Clanton. These and other inconsistencies in Clanton's testimony lacked credibility. By the time he finished his testimony, the entire prosecution case had become suspect. Will McLaury believed Clanton's testimony. He wrote his sister the next day, telling her, \\"I send you papers containing the evidence. I shall try to have these men hanged.\\" He also wrote his partner in his legal practice, Captain Greene, and told him, \\"As to the perpetration of the crime, I can only say it was as cold-blooded and foul a murder as has been recorded.\\" Clanton stated that Wyatt's motive for murdering the Cowboys was based on a stagecoach robbery on March 15, 1881. He claimed that the Earps and Holliday had robbed the stage, and killed the Cowboys to cover up the crime. He told the court that Earp wanted to conceal his family's involvement in the Benson stage robbery and had sworn him to secrecy, and that Morgan Earp had confided in him that he and Wyatt had \\"piped off $1,400 to Doc Holliday and Bill Leonard\\", who were supposed to be on the stage the night when Bud Philpot was killed. Clanton told the court, \\"I was not going to have anything to do with helping to capture‚Äî\\" and then he corrected himself \\"‚Äîkill Bill Leonard, Crane, and Harry Head\\". Clanton denied having any knowledge of the Wells Fargo telegram confirming the reward money. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992)  Billy Claiborne  Billy Claiborne, who had run from the fight, supported Ike Clanton's testimony as well. Claiborne also backed up the version of events testified to by Behan that placed a nickel- plated pistol in Holliday's hands, and that Holliday opened the fight with a shot from his nickel-plated pistol. Claiborne said, \\"They came within ten feet of where we were standing. When they got to the corner of Fly's building, they had their six-shooters in their hands, and Marshal Earp said, 'You sons-of- bitches, you've been looking for a fight, and you can have it!' And then said, 'Throw up your hands.'\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992)  Wes Fuller  Cowboy Wesley Fuller, who had initially been at the back of the empty lot near the rear of Fly's studio, corroborated Clanton's version of events. He testified that he heard the Earps say, \\"Throw up your hands!\\" He said Billy Clanton threw up his hands, saying, \\"Don't shoot me! I don't want to fight!\\" and the shooting began immediately. The prosecution asked Fuller if on November 5 he had told Wyatt that he intended to \\"cinch Holliday.\\" He responded, \\"I don't say positively I might have used words, 'I mean to cinch Holliday.'\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Over several days, the prosecution's witnesses testified that Tom McLaury was unarmed, that Billy Clanton had his hands in the air, and that neither of the McLaurys were troublemakers. They portrayed Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury as being unjustly bullied and beaten by the vengeful Earps on the day of the gunfight. On the strength of the prosecution case, Spicer revoked bail for Doc and Wyatt Earp and had them arrested on November 7, and they spent the next 16 days in jail.  Defense team and witnesses  The Earps hired Tom Fitch as their defense counsel. He was an experienced trial lawyer, a terrific speaker, and was nicknamed the \\"silver-tongued orator of the Pacific.\\" Tom Fitch, the Earp's defense counsel, was an experienced trial lawyer. The Earps' lawyer Tom Fitch had gained a reputation as the \\"silver-tongued orator of the Pacific.\\" He was one of the best-known legal and political figures on the American frontier in the 1880s. Fitch carried impressive credentials: he was a former state legislator from California, had been Nevada's Representative to the United States House of Representatives, was former general counsel for Brigham Young and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Utah Territory, and a close friend of Arizona's governor John C. Fr√©mont. Fitch was assisted by his law partner and future mayor of San Diego, Will Hunsaker. The Earps raised defense funds from E.B. Gage and others.  Defense testimony  The defense won a key motion when they persuaded Justice Spicer to allow testimony about the history of threats made against the Earps. While Morgan, who had been shot in the back, remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify, Spicer moved the proceedings to the Cosmopolitan Hotel so Virgil Earp, who had been hit in the calf, could testify from his bed.  Holliday's role  The defense wanted to cast doubt on Behan, Claiborne and Allen's testimony that Doc Holliday or a \\"man\\" had fired his nickel-plated pistol first. The defense pointed out that the prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing. Author Allen Barra pointed out that this sequence is unbelievable. Holliday was fighting for his life and switching weapons twice in the first few seconds doesn't make sense. Doc Holliday was defended by United States Court Commissioner Thomas J. Drum. Given Doc Holliday's reputation as a hothead, the defense decided to not call him to the stand. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun before the gunfight. Modern writers including Paula Mitchell Marks and Alford Turner have advanced the theory that Holliday somehow managed to hold and accurately fire two weapons ambidextrously, but none of the witnesses including Behan reported observing this. Firing even a short messenger shotgun is a two-handed effort. Three witnesses‚ÄîH.F Sills, Addie Bourland, and Judge J. H. Lucas‚Äîeventually gave key evidence that swayed Justice Spicer to hold that there was not enough evidence to indict the Earps and Doc Holliday for murder.  Wyatt Earp  Fitch had Wyatt Earp prepare a written statement, as permitted by Section 133 of Arizona law, which would not allow the prosecution to cross-examine him. On November 16, when Wyatt was called to the stand and began to read his statement, the prosecution vociferously objected. Although the statute wasn't specific about whether it was legal for a defendant to read his statement, Spicer allowed his testimony to proceed. Wyatt testified about the stagecoach robbery described by Ike Clanton as his motive for murdering the Cowboys. He stated that he offered Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury the $3,600 Wells Fargo reward money in return for information about the identities of the three robbers. He testified that he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. According to testimony given by Wyatt and Virgil, both McLaury and Clanton agreed to provide information to assist in capturing Leonard, Head, and Crain, but they never had a chance to fulfill the agreement. All three suspects were killed when attempting other robberies. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Wyatt detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys. Reading from his written statement, he said that \\"The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury.\\" He said that he knew Frank was a better shot, so he aimed for Frank first. He said he drew his gun only after Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury went for their pistols and that he and the other lawmen fired in self-defense. After the defense had established doubts about the prosecution's case, Justice Spicer released Holliday and Wyatt from jail to rejoin their families in time for Thanksgiving. Mining executives E.B. Gage and James Vizina paid the lawmen's $20,000 bail.  Winfield Williams  When questioned by Fitch during his earlier testimony, Behan denied that he had told Virgil he'd seen a McLaury brother draw first, or said to Virgil, \\"I am your friend,\\" and that Virgil had done the right thing.\\" Fitch called Deputy District Attorney Winfield Scott Williams, who had been appointed by District Attorney Price. Williams was present when Behan visited Virgil the evening after the gunfight. He affirmed Virgil's memory of the visit and contradicted Behan's testimony about the conversation. In that conversation, according to Williams, Behan told Virgil that one of the McLaury brothers drew his gun first, and \\"I am your friend, and you did perfectly right.\\"  H.F Sills  One of the most notable witnesses was H. F. Sills, an AT&SF; RR engineer. He had been temporarily furloughed from his job and found a room in a lodging house in Tombstone only the day before he witnessed the shootout. He stayed there for nine or ten days, recovering from an undefined illness. He was then admitted to a hospital where he remained for more than two weeks before he appeared at the hearing on November 22. Sills didn't know any of the parties involved and had no knowledge of any of the events prior to the day of the gunfight. He could only report what he saw and heard since his arrival. Testifying about the gunfight itself, he said he saw \\"the marshal go up and speak to this other party. I ... saw them pull out their revolvers immediately. The marshal had a cane in his right hand at the time. He throwed up his hand and spoke. I did not hear the words though. By that time Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp had fired their guns off.\\" Grilled by the prosecution, he corroborated virtually all of the defense's testimony. Because his view of events was so neutral, some Cowboys thought he was a plant or part of a conspiracy intended to discredit the Cowboys. Little information can be found today on Sills before he came to Tombstone and he vanished afterward, except for a brief mention in one newspaper three months later: \\"Engineer Sill, who formerly drove a locomotive on the Las Vegas division, is in California.\\" Some modern researchers have tried to discredit Sills' testimony, questioning the perfect timing of his arrival in Tombstone and his exact corroboration of the Earps' view of events. They believe Sills may have had an earlier connection to the Earps and was tutored in his testimony. But Sills included in his testimony two key details about his employment history that have been confirmed. He said that he \\"went to Omaha, Nebraska ... I was an apprentice in the machine shop, locomotive fireman on the road, and locomotive engineer. During the time I served my apprenticeship Mr. Congden was general mechanic, and Mr. McConnell was foreman.\\" Both of these names have been found in Omaha city directories of that time period, apparently confirming the truthfulness of his identify and some portions of his testimony.  Addie Bourland  The second key witness was Addie Bourland, a dressmaker whose residence was across Fremont Street from Fly's Boarding House. She testified that she saw both sides facing each other, that none of the Cowboys had held their hands up, that the firing was general, and that she had not seen Billy Clanton fall immediately as the Cowboys had testified. After her initial testimony, Spicer decided to personally interview Addie Bourland. She had presented confusing testimony and he recalled her to the stand to answer his questions, much to the dismay and objections of the prosecution. In her second visit to Spicer's courtroom, she said a man stepped forward and poked a large, bronze pistol into an unnamed Cowboy's belly, then took a couple of steps backward. She didn't see anyone raise their hands. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992)  Judge J. H. Lucas  The third witness was Judge J.H. Lucas of the Cochise County Probate Court, whose office was in the Mining Exchange Building about from the shootout. Lucas' corroborated Addie Bourland's testimony that Billy Clanton was standing throughout the fight, which contradicted prosecution witnesses who maintained he went down immediately after being shot at close range in the belly. Spicer noted that no powder burns were found on Clanton's clothing, which contradicted the plaintiff's claims that he had been shot at close range. Only when Clanton went down at the end did the general firing cease.  Ruling  These witnesses' testimony, especially that of H.F. Sills, discredited much of the testimony given by Sheriff Johnny Behan, Ike Clanton and the other Cowboy witnesses. In his ruling, Spicer specifically mentioned Sills' testimony: Sills' lack of knowledge of the parties enhanced his credibility with Justice Spicer and may have been the deciding factor in his ruling. After extensive testimony, Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that there was not enough evidence to indict the lawmen. He noted that the doctor who examined the dead Cowboys established that the wounds they received could not have occurred if their hands and arms had been in the positions that prosecution witnesses described. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil. In his ruling, he noted that Ike Clanton had the night before, while unarmed, publicly declared that the Earp brothers and Holliday had insulted him, and that when he was armed he intended to shoot them or fight them on sight. On the morning of the shooting he was armed with revolver and Winchester rifle. Spicer noted that: He also wrote in his decision that Ike Clanton had claimed the Earps were out to murder him, yet even though he was unarmed, the Earps had allowed him to escape unharmed during the fight. He wrote, \\"the great fact, most prominent in the matter, to wit, that Isaac Clanton was not injured at all, and could have been killed first and easiest.\\" From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) He described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a \\"proposition both monstrous and startling!\\" He noted that the prosecution claimed that the Cowboys' purpose was to leave town, yet Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne did not have their weapons with them. Spicer did not condone all of the Earps' actions and criticized Virgil Earp's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, but he concluded that no laws were broken. Spicer invited the grand jury to confirm his findings. Two weeks later, they agreed with Spicer's ruling and also refused to indict the lawmen. Even though the Earps and Holliday were free, their reputations had been tarnished. Supporters of the Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as murderers.  Aftermath  The newspapers followed the hearings closely. When Spicer announced his decision, the Arizona Weekly Citizen on March 26, 1882, wrote: \\"These facts are sorely entitled to sufficient consideration to prevent the homicide thus legally declared to be justifiable from being classed with deeds of secret murder.\\" On about December 14, Justice Spicer received a threatening letter from \\"A Miner,\\" which said in part, \\"But it is only a matter of time you will get it sooner or later\\" and told him that he should leave Tombstone. He responded with a defiant letter published by The Tombstone Epitaph, stating he would not bow to threats from the rabble of the city. He wrote that some of the citizenry \\"would like to be thugs if they had courage; would be proud to be called cowboys, if people gave them that distinction; but as they can be neither, they do the best they can to show how vile they are ...\\", concluding that \\"I will be here just where they can find me if they want me\\". Wells Fargo Agent Marshall Williams, Mayor John Clum, attorney Tom Fitch, Oriental Saloon owner Lou Rickabaugh, and the Earps were also threatened.  Ike refiles charges  In December, Ike Clanton went before Justice of the Peace J.B. Smith in Contention City and again filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday. A large posse escorted the Earps to Contention, fearing that the cowboys would try to ambush the Earps on the unprotected road. The charges were dismissed by Judge J. H. Lucas because of Smith's judicial ineptness. The prosecution immediately filed a new warrant for murder charges, issued by Justice Smith, but Judge Lucas equally quickly dismissed it, writing that new evidence would have to be submitted before a second hearing could be called. Because the November hearing before Spicer was not a trial, Clanton had the right to continue pushing for prosecution, but the prosecution would have to come up with new evidence of murder before the case could be considered.  Mayor Clum attacked  On December 14, two weeks after Justice of the Peace Spicer handed down his decision, someone tried to kill John Clum. He was publisher of The Tombstone Epitaph whose newspaper had consistently supported the Earps, a member of the Citizens Safety Committee, and Mayor of Tombstone. While on a stage en route to Benson, it was fired upon by unknown assailants. The stage didn't carry any mail, cash, or silver, so robbery was an unlikely motive for the attack. Stagecoach driver Jimmie Harrington was able to outrun the attackers, but had to stop to remove a lead horse that had been shot through and was bleeding to death. Clum, certain the attackers were trying to kill him, didn't reboard the stage but walked several miles until he found a horse he could borrow. He got to Benson the next day.  Additional witness found  The Kansas City Star ran a story that was reprinted by The Tombstone Epitaph on December 30, 1881 about a witness who had never been called during the preliminary hearing. According to the Star, a Mrs. J. C. Colyer had been visiting the home of her sister and brother-in-law at Boston Mill on the San Pedro River southwest of Tombstone. On the day of the shoot out, she drove into Tombstone with her sister and stopped at the post office. While she waited in the buggy, she was an eyewitness to the confrontation. According to Colyer, the Cowboys opened fire the moment the marshal called upon them to throw up their hands. She also said that one of the Cowboys was firing from under the neck of his horse which some interpreted to be Tom McLaury, who according to the Cowboys was unarmed. She said, \\"... the Cowboys opened fire on them, and you never saw such shooting. One of the Cowboys, after he had been shot three times, raised himself on his elbow and shot one of the officers and fell back dead. Another used his horse as a barricade and shot under his neck.\\"  Anonymous threats On December 30, 1881, the Weekly Arizona Miner newspaper published the following article:Death Threats in Tombstone January 2, 2017.  Virgil Earp ambushed  At about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, just over two months after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Virgil Earp was ambushed as he was returning from Schieffelin Hall back to the Cosmopolitan Hotel, where the Earps had moved for mutual support and protection. Three assailants on the second story of an unfinished building across Allen street from the hotel fired three loads of double-barreled buckshot from about . Virgil was struck in the back and left arm by about 20 buckshot pellets, shattering his humerus. Dr. George E. Goodfellow removed of shattered bone and was able to save Virgil's arm, but he carried it in a sling the rest of his life. The next day Wyatt, believing that Virgil was dying, telegraphed Crawley Dake, U.S. Marshal for the Arizona Territory. He requested appointment as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County and asked for authority to form a posse: In late January, unable to obtain funds from his superiors, Dake went to San Francisco where he persuaded the Wells, Fargo & Co. to loan him $3000, assuring them that the Department of Justice would honor the loan. He apparently neglected to inform his superiors of his arrangement and was later investigated for financial improprieties. Some reports say he borrowed only $500. On January 20, 1882, Dake deposited $2,985 into an account in Wyatt's name at Hudson & Company in Tombstone, and authorized Wyatt to employ a posse to track down the Cowboys. On January 25, Wyatt obtained warrants from Judge Stilwell for the arrest of Ike and Phin Clanton, and another Cowboy named Pony Diehl, for the attempted murder of Virgil. Wyatt and Morgan Earp, along with Doc Holliday, assembled a posse which turned Charleston inside out looking for the Cowboys without success. Wyatt returned to Tombstone to find the men had already surrendered, though they thought it was for lesser charges. Clanton was later accused, along with his brother Phin Clanton and friend Pony Diehl, of attempting to kill Virgil Earp. Wyatt apparently used only a portion of the Wells Fargo funds, with a single withdrawal of $536.65 on record. A week later, Wyatt tried to defuse the situation by offering Ike Clanton a truce, but Clanton would have no part in it. On February 2, Virgil and Wyatt resigned from their positions as Deputy U.S. Marshals in a letter published in The Daily Epitaph, though Dake refused Wyatt's resignation. Though Ike's hat was found at the scene where the ambushers waited, a number of associates stood up for him, saying that he had been in Contention that night, and the case against Ike, Phin and Pony Diehl was dismissed for lack of evidence. On February 9, Ike Clanton filed murder charges yet again against the Earps, once again in Contention City. Behan escorted Wyatt and Morgan there, guarded by a phalanx of 12 heavily armed friends en route. Judge Smith refused to indict the Earps unless the Clantons could supply new evidence. The Earps were pressed for cash. Virgil had been suspended from his job as town Marshal which paid him $150 a month. For increased security, the brothers and their wives had been living in town at the Cosmopolitan Hotel since the October 26 gunfight. The Wells Fargo funds only covered the costs of his posse. On February 13, Wyatt and Mattie took out a three-month note on their home, lots three and four of Block M near Fremont and First Streets, and James G. Howard loaned them $365.00 in gold coin (or about $ in today's dollars). Wyatt was unable to pay the mortgage and Howard later foreclosed, claiming the property.  Morgan Earp assassinated  This is the location of the 1880s Tucson Depot. It was in this location where Frank Stilwell, suspected in the murder of Morgan Earp on March 18, 1882, was killed by Wyatt Earp in the company of Doc Holliday. The location is now part of the Amtrak Station which is located at 400 N. Toole Ave. in Tucson, Az.. On Saturday evening, March 18, 1882, Morgan, Doc Holliday, and Dan Tipton attended Stolen Kisses, a musical by William Horace Lingard and Company, at Schieffelin Hall. Wyatt, having received threats that same day, warned against going. Benjamin Goodrich cautioned them, \\"You fellows will catch it tonight if you don't look out,\\" but the men went anyway. Afterwards, Doc went to his room and Morgan and Tipton headed for Hatch's Saloon and Billiard Parlor, which had become their unofficial headquarters after the Oriental Hotel was sold. Morgan came upon Virgil's wife Allie while she was out shopping for her convalescing husband, and he escorted her back to the Cosmopolitan Hotel. He returned to the Campbell & Hatch Billiard Parlor and played a late round of billiards with owner Bob Hatch. Wyatt, Tipton, and Sherman McMaster watched them play at a pool table near the back door. At 10:50 pm, Morgan Earp was waiting for Hatch to line up a shot when two bullets were fired through a glass-windowed, locked door which opened onto a dark alley between Allen and Fremont Streets. The first bullet struck Morgan in the right side. It shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of mining foreman George A. B. Berry. A second bullet lodged near the ceiling over Wyatt's head. Morgan fell to the floor and Wyatt, McMaster, and Tipton moved him away from the outside door to the floor near the door of the card room. Hatch dashed outside looking for the shooters. Dr. William Miller arrived first, followed by Drs. Matthews and George Goodfellow. They all examined Morgan. Even Goodfellow, recognized in the United States as the nation's leading expert at treating abdominal gunshot wounds, concluded that Morgan's wounds were fatal. They then moved Morgan to a lounge in an adjoining room where he died less than an hour after he was shot. The next day, Sunday, March 19 (Wyatt's 34th birthday), he and brother James Earp and a group of friends took Morgan's body to the railroad station in Contention. After loading his remains onto the train, James and five close friends accompanied it to Colton, California. Morgan's wife was already in Colton, where she had traveled for safety before Morgan was killed. James and his guard arrived in Colton with Morgan's body on March 21. During the coroner's inquest into Morgan's murder, Pete Spence's wife Marietta Duarte testified that her husband, Frank Stilwell, Frederick Bode, Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz, and an unnamed half-breed Indian had turned up at her home an hour after Morgan was killed and talked about shooting him. She said that Spence threatened violence if she told what she knew. The five men were named as suspects in Morgan Earp's murder and the coroner's jury issued warrants for their arrest. Spence turned himself in so that he would be protected in Behan's jail, but his attorney successfully blocked his wife's testimony. Lacking evidence, the prosecution withdrew its charges. Holliday said in 1882 that he thought Behan was behind the murder of Morgan Earp.  Frank Stilwell killed  On Monday, March 20, Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp, James Earp, Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson, and Sherman McMaster guarded Virgil and Allie on the way to Tucson. James was to accompany Virgil, Allie, and Morgan's body to the family home in Colton, California. Morgan's wife and parents waited to bury him. Wyatt received information that Frank Stilwell, Ike Clanton, Hank Swilling, and another cowboy were waiting for them in Tucson. Upon their arrival in Tucson, the Earp party spotted Stilwell and other Cowboys. James, Virgil, and Allie boarded the train to Tucson armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. Virgil said later that he had Allie wear his pistol belt where he could easily have access to the weapon if he should need it. As the train pulled away from the Tucson station at about 7:15 p.m., six or seven shots were heard. Witnesses said they saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone. Wyatt later told his biographers that he saw Frank Stilwell, and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton, armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar. When Wyatt and his men approached, the two men ran. Stilwell stumbled, allowing Wyatt to catch him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as he attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Stilwell's body was found the next day alongside the tracks riddled with buckshot and four other bullet wounds. His own pistol had not been fired. Tucson Justice of the Peace Charles Meyer issued arrest warrants for Wyatt and Warren Earp, Holliday, McMaster, and Johnson for the murder of Frank Stilwell.  Earps seek vengeance  Wyatt Earp felt he could not rely on the courts for justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. He concluded that only way to deal with Virgil's attackers and Morgan's murderers was to heed Spicer's advice and kill them. During the next week Wyatt and his posse tracked down and killed Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz, Curly Bill Brocius, and Johnny Barnes, three of the men they believed were responsible for their brothers' ambush and murder. The ride for vengeance came to be called the Earp vendetta ride. Wyatt and Doc left the Arizona Territory for Colorado in April, 1882 and parted company after a minor disagreement. Although they may have remained in contact, they never saw each other again. Two years later, Will McLaury wrote a letter to his father in Iowa, cryptically stating: \\"And none of the results have been satisfactory. The only result is the death of Morgan and crippling of Virgil Earp and death of McMaster.\\"  Participants' deaths  Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury are buried in Boot Hill Cemetery, Tombstone, Arizona. The McLaury brothers were buried side by side in the same grave, and Billy Clanton was buried next to them, in a different grave. Morgan Earp was killed by a shot in the back while playing billiards less than five months after the O.K. Corral fight. He was 30 years old. His brother James took Morgan's body to Colton, California, where Morgan's wife and parents buried him in the old city cemetery of Colton, near Mount Slover. When that cemetery was moved in 1892, Morgan's body was reburied in the Hermosa Cemetery in Colton. Billy Claiborne was killed in an altercation outside the Oriental Saloon in Tombstone on November 14, 1882, by Franklin Leslie. Leslie shot Claiborne in self-defense after Leslie refused Claiborne's drunken demands that he call him the new \\"Billy the Kid.\\" Claiborne was 22 years old when he died. He was buried in Tombstone's Boothill Cemetery. Ike Clanton was caught stealing cattle June 1, 1887, and shot dead by lawman Jonas V. Brighton while resisting arrest. He was about 40 years old. His body was reportedly left where it fell for several days until nearby Mormon ranchers buried him in an unmarked grave in a Mormon cemetery southeast of Eagar, Arizona on what is today called \\"The 26 Bar Ranch\\". Doc Holliday died of tuberculosis in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, November 8, 1887, at age 36, but Wyatt Earp did not learn of Holliday's death until several months later. Holliday was buried in the Linwood Cemetery overlooking Glenwood Springs. Virgil Earp was ambushed on the streets of Tombstone on the evening of December 28, 1881, by hidden assailants shooting from the second story of an unfinished building. The wound left him without use of his left arm. Virgil left Tombstone for California after Morgan was killed. He served as the \\"Town Marshal,\\" hired by the Southern Pacific Railroad, in Colton, California. He died of pneumonia in Goldfield, Nevada at the age of 62 in 1905, still on the job as a peace officer. At the request of his long-lost daughter, Nellie Jane Bohn, Virgil's remains were buried in the River View Cemetery in Portland, Oregon. Johnny Behan was not re-nominated by his own party for the sheriff race in 1882 and never again worked as a lawman. He spent the rest of his life at various government jobs and died in Tucson of natural causes at age 67, in 1912. Behan was buried in Tucson's Holy Hope Cemetery. Wyatt Earp traveled across the western frontier from one boom town to another in the company of Josephine Marcus, working mostly as a gambler and miner, until they settled in Southern California. He was the last living participant of the gunfight when he died on January 13, 1929 at the age of 80 in Los Angeles of chronic cystitis. Josephine Earp, Wyatt's common-law wife, was of Jewish heritage. She had Earp's body cremated and secretly buried in the Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. The location of his remains remained unknown to even Earp's closest living relative, George Earp, until about 1957 when the Tombstone Restoration Commission sought to have Wyatt's remains moved to Tombstone. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.  Hearing transcripts  In April 2010, original transcripts of witness statements made during the preliminary hearing were rediscovered in an abandoned closet in county offices in Bisbee, Arizona, and the county said they would be preserved and digitized. Photocopies of these documents have been available to researchers since 1960, and new digitized records of the originals have been made available for online access. While the transcripts do not offer any significant deviations from generally accepted historical accounts of the gunfight itself, they were taken directly from eyewitnesses shortly afterwards and as such, they provide an interesting and unique perspective of the event.

His biggest hit, \\"I've Been Hurt\\" reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart in 1973. Biography Born in Kent, he began his career in the early 1960s singing with Ray McVay's band. Two of his singles with McVay were \\"Daddy Cool\\", released in 1961, and \\"I‚Äôve Been Hurt\\" a cover of the hit by Bill Deal And The Rondels, which was released in 1966. He also recorded \\"Turn To Me\\" and \\"Sing Me No Sad Songs\\". The latter, a composition by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, was released in 1969 and almost immediately withdrawn. He became front-man for the band Guy Darrell and the Midniters in 1964. Most of his early songs were covers of US originals, such as \\"Sorry\\" by The Impalas, \\"Stupidity\\" by Solomon Burke, and \\"Somewhere They Can't Find Me\\" by Paul Simon. None of them reached the charts, although some received radio play, especially on pirate radio stations. In 1966, he released \\"I've Been Hurt\\" on the CBS label, a 1965 song by Ray Whitley which had already been covered with some success in the US by The Tams. Despite the involvement of Des Champ, this release also failed to reach the UK chart, although it was a top ten hit in South Africa. During the remainder of the 1960s, Darrell continued to record for various UK record labels. He was able to record, through his connections with Roger Easterby and Des Champ, a version of Elton John's song \\"Skyline Pigeon\\" almost a year before the composer's own version was released. In 1967, Darrell married Lyn Webster. In 1969, he formed the band Guy Darrell Syndicate with musicians with whom he had been working at BBC radio. The band included: Darrell on vocals; Martin Jenner, guitar and Dave Green, bass/flute (both ex- Summer Set); Derek Elson, keyboards, and Graham Jarvis on drums. Among the band‚Äôs songs were \\"Birds Of A Feather\\", for which composer credit was given to Joe South, and \\"Keep The Rain From My Door\\". After one single release \\"How Are You?\\" on Page One Records in October 1969, the Guy Darrell Syndicate morphed into Deep Feeling. At this point, Darrell abandoned the Guy Darrell stage name temporarily and reverted to his given name John Swail; press releases for Deep Feeling made no mention of his previous career as Guy Darrell. While they continued to release 45 RPM cover versions of US songs such as Bobby Freeman's \\"Do You Want To Dance\\" and a further version of \\"Skyline Pigeon\\", the group (including Swail) also began to compose in their own right. Their range of cover versions began to expand from the musical mainstream toward progressive rock. In 1971, they released their only album, also titled Deep Feeling, once more produced by Easterby and Champ, released by DJM Records. The album moved yet further toward progressive rock, and though little noted at the time, Deep Feeling has received subsequent critical reassessment and notice, and has been re-released several times up to the present day. Also in 1971, the group composition \\"Sweat, Dust And Red Wine\\" was covered by Chicory Tip on their album Son Of My Father. Throughout the early 1970s, Deep Feeling regularly performed live, playing a mixture of their own material and covers from progressive bands such as Yes and Led Zeppelin in east London and throughout the UK. (Deep Feeling are not to be confused with the short-lived band of the same name, of which Jim Capaldi and Luther Grosvenor were members).) Meantime, the song \\"I've Been Hurt\\" had once more been a US hit in 1969 for Bill Deal and the Rhondels, and this version became popular in northern soul clubs such as the Twisted Wheel. Roger Easterby and Des Champ were setting up their own record label, Santa Ponsa Records, and having noted the popularity of the song, made one of the new label's first issues a re-release of Darrell's 1965 recording of it, backed with the original B-side \\"Blessed\\" written by Paul Simon. The re-release made its way into the UK Singles Chart, earning Darrell a spot on Top of the Pops (broadcast 20 September 1973) backed by the other members of Deep Feeling. This despite the fact that none of them had played on the recording in question. The song reached a chart high of No. 12 for the week ending 29 September 1973. Following this belated success, Darrell resumed the use of his stage name for recordings, and made several more records with Easterby and Champ for Santa Ponsa; Deep Feeling also released one final single on the same label. For these releases he relinquished progressive rock and reverted to his previous style of covering more mainstream songs. However, no further chart success was forthcoming, and Darrell's final record release came in 1975. Guy Darrell died of cancer in Spain on 3 May 2013.

Murphy House is a historic house at 923 North 13th Street in Fort Smith, Arkansas. It is a rectangular 2-1/2 story brick structure, with basically symmetrical massing by asymmetric details. The main roofline is hipped toward the front facade, with a pair of similarly-sized projections on either side of a central raised hip-roof porch at the third level. The left projection has larger single windows at the first and second levels, and a small window recessed within a jerkin-headed gable pediment. The right projection has two narrower windows on the first and second levels and a small hipped element projecting from the top of that section's hip roof. A single- story porch extends across the width, supported by paired columns, with an entablature decorated by garlands. The house, built about 1895, is one of Fort Smith's most sophisticated expressions of Classical Revival architecture. It was built by a local manufacturer of saddles and harnesses.

The title was intended solely for tag teams in tag team matches, not individuals, and was the secondary tag team championship in NWA Mid-America, with the Mid- America version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship being the primary championship. The promotion also had a third tag team championship at its peak, a testament to the popularity of tag team wrestling in the territory, as they promoted the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship as well. The championship was established around March 6, 1962, when Yoshinosato and Taro Sakuro were named champions upon arrival by NWA Mid-America instead of holding a tournament to establish the championship. With a number of NWA territories active at the time this version of the United States Tag Team Championship was one of at least six championships that shared the same name under the NWA's supervision. The team of Dennis Condrey and Phil Hickerson, also known as \\"The Bicentennial Kings\\", held the championship the most times, five in total including the last reign when the titles were abandoned in 1976. Because the championship was a professional wrestling championship, it was not won or lost competitively but instead by the decision of the bookers of a wrestling promotion. The championship was awarded after the chosen wrestler \\"won\\" a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport.

History AISL was created in 1967 to meet the needs of Americans residing in Togo. Over the years the student population has changed and has become more international. When the school was first built, it was called the International School of Lome (ISL). (There was a sister school in Benin, a neighbor country. The second school was founded years after ISL and was known as the International School of Benin. The name of the school in Togo was later changed to show its dedication to an American curriculum: American International School of Lome or AISL.) On June 4, 2012, the American International School of Lom√© inaugurated a new building with a ribbon-cutting ceremony for parents, board members, teachers, staff, students, and those involved in the construction. The Togolese Minister of Education was the keynote speaker. U.S. Ambassador Whitehead also gave a speech. This was an important day for AISL after 45 years of continuous existence in Togo.http://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes- les-rubriques/Education/Inauguration-du-campus-de-l-AISL Present day Today, the school continues to provide an American-style education which will enable children to integrate easily, academically and socially, into American schools or international schools with similar requirements. Graduating students are prepared for American colleges and universities. Dr. Clover J. Afokpa is the director of the school. Mary Agnes Graves is the part-time administrator, college counselor and AP coordinator. Curriculum The curriculum is similar to that of U.S. general academic and college preparatory schools. Most graduates attend colleges and universities throughout the world, primarily in the U.S. The school's testing programs include the SAT, PSAT, Plan, Explore, ACT and the MAPS. All classes are taught in English. The elementary program, in which teachers are organized into grade-level teams, features specialists in science, art, computer studies, music, theater and physical education PE. The middle school, which includes sixth through eighth grades, uses interdisciplinary teams and a curriculum based on a block schedule. The high school, which offers many AP courses, is constantly re- evaluating its programs to better serve student needs and interests. Athletics and extracurricular activities AISL offers a wide variety of activities and sports each school day from 2:15 to 5.00 p.m. Some activities and sports change each quarter. Those offered in the past include folk dance, additional French, batik, drama, drawing, needlework, ESL, SAT preparation and ceramics. Sports offered have included swimming, basketball, volleyball, handball, tennis. Participation is encouraged and recommended as an extension of the academic school day. A minimum of one afternoon team sport activity is compulsory for grades 3-12.http://aislome.org/index.php/about-us/after-school- activities References External links * American International School of Lom√© Lome International schools in Togo Schools in Lom√© ","title":"American International School of Lom√©"},{"id":"46501011","text":"Takae Ohnishi is a Japanese harpsichordist who has performed extensively in the United States and Japan as a soloist, chamber musician and basso continuo player. She has appeared with numerous orchestras and at various venues in the United States and Japan, being a featured performer with the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra, Ishihara Hall 10th Anniversary Concert series and the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. She is also a music teacher and since 2007 has been an adjunct with the University of California, San Diego. Life and education Ohnishi is a graduate of the Toho Gakuen School of Music. She went on to earn a masters in Music from the New England Conservatory of Music and a doctorate in Musical Arts from Stony Brook University, learning from teachers such as Arthur Haas, Peter Sykes, John Gibbons and Chiyoko Arita. She currently resides in San Diego and is married to Chinese- American classical music composer Lei Liang. The couple has one son. Career Ohnishi has been the principal harpsichordist at the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra and in 2004, was the featured soloist at the Ishihara Hall 10th Anniversary Concert series. Her 2006 recital tour in Japan was broadcast nationally on NHK TV program Classic Ku-ra-bu. More recently she was featured in the Art of Music Concert Series at the San Diego Museum of Art, and represented Japan as a soloist at the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. Other solo performances include those with the Berlin Philharmonic Scharoun Ensemble, the Gardner Chamber Orchestra (directed by Paula Robinson) the MIT Chapel, Swedenborg Chapel, the Boston Early Music Festival, Summer Institute for Contemporary Piano Performance and at the New England Conservatory of Music. She has been a basso continuo player with Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra, Atlantic Symphony Orchestra and the Gardner Chamber Orchestra and the Boston University Baroque Orchestra. She has also performed with the Harvard Group for New Music and the Callithumpian Consort. In addition to performing, Ohnishi is teacher and lecturer, having worked in Yantai, China, Toho Gakuen School of Music in Tokyo, as well as the Early Music Festival in Fukuoka, Japan. She was a participant in a lecture series entitled Historical Performance Practice, recorded and published by the Muramatsu Gakki Company in Tokyo. Since 2007, the musician has been an adjunct teaching harpsichord and Baroque chamber music at the University of California, San Diego, and she has also taught classes at the University of San Diego. Recognition Ohnishi won her first major award at the International Early Music Harpsichord Competition in Japan, and her debut CD A Harpsichord Recital was chosen as an International Special Prized CD by Japanese music magazine Record Gei-jyu-tsu, in 2002. Ohnishi was also chosen to be a visiting artist from 2011 to 2012 at the American Academy in Rome. Repertoire and artistry Ohnishi is a specialist in Baroque chamber music, but she also plays contemporary compositions as well, including ones from Asia. Her playing may use the inside of the harpsichord as much as the keyboard, by rubbing the strings with her palms or plucking them directly with her fingernails. Referring to the Goldberg Variations recording, critic Benjamin Katz writes, Ohnishi performs on a harpsichord built by Marc Ducomet, based on a Ruckers harpsichord that underwent a grand ravalment (a 17th Century instrument rebuilt to suit 18th Century tastes and repertoire). This fine instrument may have been the inspiration for some of Ohnishi's very French-sounding playing. She casts the 13th variation as a sensual French dance, complete with ports de voix (an appoggiatura-like ornament). Her 7th variation is played as a true canarie-gigue, a French dance with a snappy rhythm. Ohnishi's performance is admirably balanced. She communicates a great many of the varied affects in Bach's magnificent and justly popular Goldberg Variations Recordings Her performances has appeared on discs released by Mode and New World Records including her debut on A Harpsichord Recital (2004) . Ohnishi released her own album in 2012 on Bridge Records called Bach:Goldberg Variations.

It is the second film, after I Wish, to star real-life grandmother and granddaughter Kirin Kiki and Kyara Uchida. The film was selected to open the Un Certain Regard section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It was also selected to be screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot The film centres around Sentaro, a middle-aged man who runs a small dorayaki shop in the outskirts of Tokyo. The shop is frequented by locals as well as secondary-school pupils. When he puts up a notice saying that he is looking for a co-worker, he is approached by Tokue, a lady in her mid-seventies, who states that she has always wanted to work in a dorayaki shop. Sentaro initially rejects her application, afraid that the work would prove too much for the old lady who, moreover, has somewhat deformed hands. He is swayed, however, when he tries Tokue's bean paste; its taste and texture are far superior to that of the factory-made bean paste Sentaro has been using. Sentaro asks Tokue to start making bean paste with him, revealing that up until now, he did not actually like his own product. Business begins to thrive, and very soon Tokue also starts serving customers and packaging dorayaki. However, when customers realise that the deformities to Tokue's hand were caused by leprosy, they stop coming, and Sentaro is forced to let her go. Wakana, a school girl whom Sentaro has befriended, eventually suggests that they go and visit Tokue at the sanatorium where she and other patients were forced to stay until the 1996 repeal of the 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law. Sentaro feels guilty that he was not able to protect Tokue against the prejudice of their customers, but she assures him that she is grateful for the time she was allowed to spend at the shop. When Tokue dies of pneumonia a few months later, she leaves Sentaro her own bean paste making equipment, as well as a cassette recording intended for him and Wakana. In it, Tokue stresses that a person's worth lies not in their career, but simply in their being, and also that joy comes from taking in the sensory experiences of the world that surrounds us. Through most of the film, Sentaro had been a man weighed down by his past. When Tokue no longer works for the shop, he sends her a letter, in which he reveals that he once seriously injured a man in a pub brawl, something he is still ashamed of. He was subsequently imprisoned and was ordered to pay a large reparation to the victim. Physically, Sentaro is tied to the dorayaki shop, which is owned by the loan shark that furnished the money for the reparation‚Äîmoney which Sentaro has not yet been able to pay back. Yet at the end of the film, Sentaro is seen selling dorayaki from his own stall in the local park, and it is clear he has learned to live with his circumstances. Cast * Kirin Kiki as Tokue * Masatoshi Nagase as Sentaro * Kyara Uchida as Wakana * Etsuko Ichihara * Miyoko Asada * Miki Mizuno Title For its debut at the Cannes Film Festival, the film was promoted under the title Sweet Red Bean Paste. At other festivals ‚Äî and for the Australian release ‚Äî the original Japanese title An was used. The subsequent international theatrical release title for the film became Sweet Bean. The English translation of the novel on which the film is based is titled Sweet Bean Paste (Oneworld Publications 2017, written by Durian Sukegawa, translated by Alison Watts). Themes The film centres primarily around the themes of freedom and joy, suggesting that by embracing our sensory experiences we may attain richer, more rewarding lives. As Deborah Young writes, \\"The undercurrent that runs through the film is a message to learn from nature and enjoy the wonder of life moment by moment, no matter what hard knocks you're dealt\\". This aspect of the film ties in with the director's earlier work, \\"A consistent underlying concern of [which] has been the unspoken bond between man and his environment\\". Reception The film has grossed in Japan. The film received generally positive notices, with a 60 out of 100 rating from Metacritic across 16 reviews and a score of 88% \\"Fresh\\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes across 41 reviews. The film was a \\"Critic's Pick\\" by The New York Times, with the Times' Glenn Kenny scoring it at 90 out of 100, writing that \\"The movie, beautifully shot and acted, earns its ultimate sense of hope by confronting real heartbreak head-on, and with compassion\\". The Guardian‚Äòs film critic Peter Bradshaw scored the film at 2 out of 5 stars, writing that \\"Despite some touching moments, and earnest performances, I must confess to feeling exasperated by the sentimentality and stereotype being served up\\". The film earned actress Kirin Kiki the Best Performance by an Actress award at the 2015 Asia Pacific Screen Awards.

Casa Ruby opened in 2012; it identifies its mission as \\"to create success life stories among Transgender, Gender Queer, and Gender Non-conforming Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual people.\\" Early life Corado immigrated to America at age sixteen to escape the civil war in El Salvador. She settled in Washington D.C. on her own. As a member of the LGBT community as well as a young immigrant, Corado found it challenging to settle in her newfound community. Her bumpy arrival and settlement also led her to discover how few resources were offered for the LGBT community within Washington D.C. This was one of her first motivators to be a part of creating a welcoming community for transgender people as well as the other people who make up the LGBT community. She came out as a gay man, a label that never felt comfortable for Corado. Eventually, she would come to terms with her identity as a transgender woman. After coming out as gay in her teens, Corado faced bullying from others since she was more feminine male. An incident that occurred was when she was tormented in her school‚Äôs bathroom. Other boys her age followed and attacked her for being a ‚Äúfeminine boy‚Äù. This was just the beginning for Corado. This is part of what sparked the call for action to protect those in a community that was not fully understood. Her home life was not much better than her school life. She was ostracised by her own family. Corado would experience many setbacks because of her identity as a transgender woman and wouldn‚Äôt begin transitioning until the 1990s. Some of these experiences would range from homelessness to being fired from her jobs because of her identity. Several acts of violence would be directed toward her one which would almost cost her life. Such experiences would make her realize that she needed to fight back against the oppression she was facing. In fact, it is these experiences that would provide the foundation for the actions she took in the future. Corado felt it was safe enough to finally live life as a woman full time. She had been living in what she had considered a well-rounded neighborhood. However, this all changed in 1995 with the death of Tyra Hunter, a transgender woman, who died of injuries sustained in a car accident after EMS personnel refused to treat her. With the realization that people weren‚Äôt as accepting, it further fueled her to fight for transgender rights as she recognized people shouldn‚Äôt be living in constant fear for being who they were. She started volunteering at Whitman-Walker Health, a health center focused on HIV/AIDS care for LGBT patients, doing things like distributing condoms. A few years later once she made the transition from male to female, she won a pageant, Miss Gay El Salvador, which came with an expectation of community service. It is also worth noting that there was a point in her life where she worked as a sex worker. Her reasoning behind this didn‚Äôt have to do with survival. Rather it focused on being able to meet up with men without having to tell them that she was a transgender woman. She worked for an agency which would sell each encounter for three-hundred dollars. Although said agency would take most if not all of the profits she earned from her work as an escort. In fact, one of the greatest struggles she endured was overcoming some emotional trauma caused by her now ex-boyfriend who had broke into her house in 2008 beat and raped her. Although this attack on her was reported, the police never did any further investigation nor did the prosecute the culprit. In that same year in 2008, there was also an incident that occurred between Corado and her then boyfriend. There was a fight that had abrupted between the two. This landed them both a night in jail. During this time, she was subjected to be incarcerated with men rather than with women despite her identifying as a woman. She was forced to strip down her articles of clothing in front of the other men in the jail‚Äôs housing unit for men. She even had to endure the embarrassment of having to use the bathroom in front of the men in her cell. These incidences would cause her to leave her day job and spiral downward as she began heavily taking drugs and would become homeless. Overcome with a feeling of helplessness, Ruby would struggle with suicidal thoughts all while trying to continue her career as an activist. Eventually around 2011 she‚Äôd check herself into a mental hospital to seek out the help she needed. What fueled her to go on despite everything she had endured was the knowledge that other people similar to her would need her assistance. Corado has found herself to have overcome a long journey throughout her time in the United States. She had overall endured being a victim of the human sex trafficking industry, endured mistreatment from being transgender, spent time struggling with homelessness, battled to be able to change her gender on her identification card, and was almost killed in a domestic violence dispute. Overall, she has overcome a lot in her years and still continues to fight for others in her community. With even being close to having no money, Corado still put her efforts into creating a safe space for youth who were facing some of the struggle that come with being transgender and the need for another line of support. Having overcome so many horrible obstacles that come with being a transgender person in America, as well having struggled with the lack of support and resources for the LGBT community within Washington D.C., Corado set out to create a space where she could help individuals heal, and hopefully help prevent these hate crimes from happening to other transgender people as well as others within the LGBTQ+ community. With the help of her friends and her community, Corado was able to create and found Casa Ruby, her non-profit organization that helps house, treat, and support mostly LGBTQ youth in 2012. In 2012 the first Casa Ruby center had opened. The first building occupied three floors of a house in Park View on Georgia Avenue NW, the center primarily aimed to serve the Latina-trans community, but plenty of races and gender variants of the LGBTQ community have heavily relied on the Casa Ruby organization. Today there are now multiple establishments with approximately 50 employees and an outreach that affects the lives of over 6,000 people annually. It provides services to a range of marginalized groups who, due to language or immigration status, often don‚Äôt know what resources are available to them. This program does what it cans to locate the available sources for those struggling in the community. The support from Casa Ruby also includes services for violence, poverty, HIV risk and testing, as well as discrimination. A big idea for Casa Ruby is that they do not want to make anyone fear exclusion, discrimination, and discouragement for being who they truly are on the inside and out. Aside from her organization, Casa Ruby, Ruby is also a bilingual motivational speaker, and a nationally acclaimed sensitivity trainer who speaks mostly towards the social justice issues pertaining to transgender people, gender-nonconforming individuals, as well as the rest of the LGBT community. She does her motivational speaking as well as her sensitivity training in both English and Spanish to help spread her message on both ends of her communities, as well as educate those of the LGBTQ+ community within the U.S. who are at a disadvantage in terms of education and history because they do not speak or understand much English. This work coincides well with her activism that also consists to fighting for more rights, tolerance, and greater protection for the LGBTQ community, even more specifically transgender individuals. Advocacy career Corado became widely known after the August 16th, 2003 murder of Bella Evangelista, a 25 year old transgender Latina killed during a month that included the murder of another transgender woman in Washington, DC. Corado helped organize daily vigils and a march to demand an end to the violence and recognition of human rights of transgender people. Corado was part of the Coalition to Clarify the D.C. Human Rights Act (later renamed the D.C. Trans Coalition), which changed the D.C. Human Rights Act to include protections for gender identity or expression, a change that took effect in March 2006. In June 2012, she established Casa Ruby in the Park View neighborhood and in 2018 the organization moved to Shepherd Park. Corado married David Walker in 2014, and was walked down the aisle by D.C. mayor Vincent C. Gray. Creation of Casa Ruby One of Corado‚Äôs main goals with Casa Ruby was to create a movement led by people society deemed disposable. She aimed to make a loving and nurturing environment that showed people acceptance for their identity. This idea of hers was conceived thirty years ago and was founded by Ruby with the help of friends and community. Ruby‚Äôs aim was to provide an environment in which people didn‚Äôt feel the need to hide their true selves. In helping others, she aims to provide the help and services that weren't available to her when she was first adjusting to her life in the United States. More than that, however, Corado wants to show that it is possible to live a successful life as an LGBT person. Another motivation Corado would have for making Casa Ruby was the enormous lack of resources for transgender people within Washington, D.C, more specifically transgender people of color. In making Casa Ruby, Corado was able to ensure a space where people could relate to the experiences of those around them. Casa Ruby is also the only bilingual and multicultural LGBTQ+ center in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The mission statement for Casa Ruby reads as ‚ÄúOur mission is to create success life stories among transgender, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals. Our vision is to create a world where transgender, genderqueer, and gender non- conforming people pursue their dreams and achieve success in their lives without fear of discrimination, harassment, or violence due to their sexual orientation and or gender identity/gender expression.‚Äù As a result, Casa Ruby has been described with descriptive adjectives such as multicultural and bilingual. That is to say, the establishment primarily places its focus on offering services that can allow people to get a grasp of their lives and adapt to life in the United States. Casa Ruby has services that try to aid others in a variety of different methods. Some examples being some services that help those who might be in need of housing, or helping others obtain a job through their connections with local restaurants. Casa Ruby tries to help people adapt to their situation by offering emotional and financial support. Furthermore, it teaches English to those who don't know are unfamiliar with the language. Another unique trait Casa Ruby offers through their numerous programs and resources is outreach and assistance for those of the multicultural LGBTQ+ community who are immigrants and have a criminal record and/or criminal convictions. The organization provides these people with resources, support, and representation to fight their deportation and access within the United States. The community in which Casa Ruby serves typically falls within the annual income range that falls below 10,000 dollars. Their organization also runs career employment services, crisis intervention, and other support groups targeted towards the homeless and immigrant transgender individuals of their community. Another service that they offer a 24 hour drop-in/respite service to those who are either abandoned, homeless, or are in a need of a place to stay, which is a huge testament to Ruby‚Äôs welcoming attitude and focus for her organization. Their housing placement program spans far beyond their 24-hour shelter policy as well. Ruby has organized multiple housing programs that span from 24-hour open housing services that are open during weather emergencies to prevent hypothermia and other weather-related injuries to the homeless community. They also provide short term living placement which offers short term consistent housing services for three to six months at a time. This program is for 18 to 24-year-olds and is created to help people transition into permanent living situations. Casa Ruby‚Äôs last offer within their housing program is their transitional living program. This offers stable housing and support for up to 18 months and is also in place in order to help clients find educational and foundational backing before they pursue independent living. Not only has Ruby created an organization where transgender people and people of the LGBTQ+ community can stay the night, get employment counseling, and housing placement, they also offer numerous other connections for the LGBTQ+ community. These services include preventative health care which is specifically focused on sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and AIDS. There is also another program within Casa Ruby that helps with the emotional and mental trauma that comes with the abuse that can stem from being a member of the LGBTQ+ community, especially being a transgender person. This program is called the ‚ÄúSupport Services for Victims of Violence‚Äù and provides one-on-one counseling and aid to any victims that have suffered from physical, mental, or emotional abuse. Casa Ruby also offers Social Services which can connect people with Social Workers to help them attain government-issued identification and many other legal acquisitions. It is important to note that the motto for CasaRuby is ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs Home‚Äù meaning that is not limited solely for the LGBTQ+ community but rather all people who are in need of its services. This could mean the families of someone within the LGBT community or other members within or involved in this community. Casa Ruby is working to make themselves known over social media through their facebook page. This is done in order to make their community presence more known. To add on to this, this allows for the group to be found through the internet. The page is often updated to keep everyone informed on current issues and events within their group as well as the LGBTQ+ community. Currently, almost 12,000 people are following this page. Another form of social media that they are on is Twitter as well as Instagram. Having a larger online presents makes for their community to be stronger. Corado works tirelessly to make her establishment seem like a home away from home. This is both displayed within the numerous programs she has in place for her clients, as well as the vast amount of support she is able to provide from both herself and those who volunteer within the organization. She tends to refer to residents as sons and daughters to emphasize the idea of a chosen family. She emphasizes the idea of a chosen family to make up for the fact that some families can be extremely unaccepting at times. She has created a community in which everyone tries to help one another as they overcome their struggles. Corado's Current Work Currently, Corado's work has the most presence in regards to the Trump Administration. In particular, she has spoken out against the administrations consideration to define one's gender based on the genitalia that individual was born with. In response, Corado would talk about the issue at hand to the media and generally anyone who would hear her. She would also be a part of a crowd holding signs along the lines of : Enough we will not be erased. She‚Äôs aware of the seriousness of the issue and strives to continue to bring awareness to the issue because it is one that is so important. Despite the hardship she has to overcome, she seems enthusiastic about the work recognizing that it has brought people together and emphasized the support that is present for the transgender community. In this particular case like many others, Corado uses her identity as a transgender woman, as well as her cultural and bilingual background to reassure others that everything will be okay despite the hardships they have to face. She uses herself as an example to highlight that transgender people can live successful lives, as well as dedicating her own life to the betterment of other transgender youths to help them lead their own successful future.

He also worked as editor for the religious newspapers Siionin l√§hetyslehti and Zions missionstidning in 1919‚Äì1945, as well as a member of parliament with the National Coalition Party in 1922‚Äì1929 and 1930‚Äì1933. Jussila's father was Heikki Jussila (1863-1955), a Conservative Laestadian lay preacher and Volksschule teacher.  Education  After graduating Volksschule, Oskari Jussila went to oppikoulu in Kuopio classic lyceum in 1908 and began his theological studies in University of Helsinki, finishing them in 1913. During his studies, Jussila joined a Laestadian community, where he joined Conservative Laestadianism during the 1910 split. At the end of his studies he carried out interviews with Laestadians in the Torne Valley, which provided a robust connection to Laestadianism for him. He also made connections with the Laestadian movement in Calumet, Michigan, especially its local leaders Paul Heideman and his father Arthur Leopold Heideman. In the end of 1920, Jussila visited Michigan and Minnesota for four months, participating in the investigation of the dispersion within Heidemanism, the local Laestadian movement. Oskari Jussila was ordinated a priest in Oulu in 1914. After this he worked temporary parish positions in Tyrn√§v√§, Kiuruvesi, Suomussalmi, S√§r√§isniemi, and Ranua. He held three vicarages during his life: in Ranua 1918‚Äì1920, in Kuivaniemi 1920‚Äì1934, and in Alatornio from 1934 until his death in 1955.  Participation in the Finnish Civil War and Finnish activity in Northern Sweden  Even prior to the 1918 Finnish Civil War, Oskari Jussila supported the Whites. He participated in establishing the Ranua municipality White Guard. At the end of the civil war, Jussila worked as the manager of an ambulance, i.e. a mobile field hospital, provided by the Conservative Laestasianism movement. At the time, Jussila supported the view that the Reds should be severely punished for starting the riot. Starting from 1919, Jussila considered it important to support Fenno-nationalistic activity, with the purpose of \\"educating\\" the Finnish population of Norrbotten in Northern Sweden. He participated in the L√§nsipohjan toimikunta (lit. \\"Norrbotten task force\\"), established for that purpose. Jussila's work with pastoral care in the Finnish speaker populated areas of Northern Sweden in the 1920s attracted ill attention from the Swedish national circles. Their view on the matter was that Finns were using pastoral care as a cover for political agitation.  Rise to influential position within Conservative Laestadianism  In the early 1920s, Oskari Jussila reached a central position as an influential cleric within the Conservative Laestadian movement. In 1919 he was made the editor of newspaper, movement organ Siionin L√§hetyslehti. He worked in this position continuously until 1939, and after a break, in 1942‚Äì1944. His editorship was successful, and the newspaper even turned a profit. Jussila was active in voicing his negative opinions of the other 1920's Laestadian branches such as the New Awakening. His main concern was their \\"law-mindedness\\". In 1920, Jussila visited the Finnish regions in Northern United States, and condemned the local Apostolic Lutheran movement. His newspaper writings of the time tended to sharply counter those who would criticise Conservative Laestadianism in any way. During this time Jussila also actively worked towards creating a folk high school, and in 1923 he established the Ylitornio Christian Folk High School with support from the Conservative Laestadian movement.  Parliament membership  In 1922, Jussila stood for the parliament membership elections with the National Coalition Party in the northern Oulu electoral district, and was elected. The other Laestadian parliament members were with the Agrarian League. At the time, the parliament was working on a freedom of religion bill. Jussila expressed his strict views, supporting to retain the religious education in Volksschule, and to retain the public and legal status of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church. He also supported increasing or at least keeping the Church budget, and was considered one of the so-called \\"helmet- wearing priests\\", who demanded more attention in the national budget toward securing the country's internal and external security. Despite his religious political interests, Jussila's Conservative Laestadian affiliation did not come up in the parliament. Other themes in his work in the parliament was developing Lapland and Per√§pohjola, the home regions of his voters.  Final years and heritage  Up until his death, Oskari Jussila maintained his persuasion to remain faithful to his religious community. Since his death the relationship between the clergy and the Conservative Laestadianism grew more distant. Jussila's writings gained a central position in the Conservative Laedtadian El√§m√§n Sana subgroup. The influence of the El√§m√§n Sana group has dwindled since, and Jussila is better known as a religious composer and poet, with one hymn, \\"K√§yn armonalttarillesi\\" being included in the Finnish Lutheran hymnal with the hymn number #316. In addition, the song collection Siionin laulut, compiled by Jussila since its establishment in 1916 until 1939, has created a lasting impression in the Laestadian movement.

There is a continuous stony ditch, which is doubled on the north-east side, away from the natural slope of the hill. The bank is flattened where it joins fields on the south-east side and no bailey is apparent in that section. Most of the earthworks remain and the keep of the castle was probably timber, as CPAT (Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust) found a piece of daub and the remains of a burnt layer in 1978. The site is a Cadw scheduled monument. History Tomen yr Allt was the caput of the commote of Mechain Uwch Coed in the cantref of Mechain. In 1160, when the Kingdom of Powys was divided, Mechain became part of the principality which later became known as Powys Wenwynwyn. By 1208 the region was controlled by Llywelyn the Great, after his death in 1241 his heir had to come to terms with Henry III of England, as a result Powys Wenwynwyn passed to Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn who was allied to Henry III. From 1255 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the grandson of Llywelyn the Great and the Prince of Gwynedd, began to expand his territory. In May 1257, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was reported to have put the \\"castle of Bodyddon\\" under siege (Tomen yr Allt is less than 1 km east of Bodyddon and overlooks it). The intention was likely to bring the lords of Mechain to submission, and by 1258 they were indeed allied to Llywelyn. Presumably Tomen yr Allt is the \\"castle of Bodyddon\\" to which the reports refer, which was destroyed in 1257. The site overlooks Bodfach Hall approximately 1 km south-east in the hamlet of Bodfach near Llanfyllin. Tomen yr Allt and the wooded area around it, known as Coed yr Allt, is on land which belonged to the historical estate of the hall. The original building on the site of the hall may have been constructed to replace the castle.

The film marked No√©'s fourth directorial venture after a gap of five years. It had its premiere at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and was released in 3D. The film is notable for its unsimulated sex scenes. Plot Murphy is an American cinema school student, living in Paris. He had a French girlfriend, called Electra, whom he dated for two years. One day, Murphy and Electra met and had a no-strings-attached threesome with another woman, a young blonde Danish teenager named Omi, as a way to add some excitement to their love life. But later, Murphy had sex with Omi behind Electra's back, as a result of which Omi became pregnant (the condom broke and she is against abortion). This unplanned pregnancy ended the relationship between Murphy and Electra, and it forced Murphy to live with Omi. On a rainy 1 January morning, Electra's mother, Nora, phones Murphy at the small Paris apartment where he lives with Omi and their 18-month-old son, Gaspar. Nora asks Murphy if he has heard from Electra. Nora has not heard from her for three months; given Electra's suicidal tendencies, Nora is quite worried about her. For the rest of this day, Murphy recalls his relationship with Electra in a series of fragmented, nonlinear flashbacks. Those flashbacks depict their first meeting in Paris; their quick hookup; and their lives over the next two years, which are filled with drug abuse, rough sex and tender moments. Electra's whereabouts and ultimate fate are left unresolved.

No√© met them in a club. He found Karl Glusman for the role of Murphy through a mutual friend. The budget of the film was approximately ‚Ç¨2.6 million. Principal photography took place in Paris. No√© has said that the film's screenplay was seven pages long. In a pre-release interview with Marfa Journal, No√© implied that the film would have an explicitly sexual feel. He asserted that it would \\"give guys a hard-on and make girls cry\\". The film is notable for its unsimulated sex scenes. According to NPR, \\"roughly half of Gaspar Noe's Love consists of raw, unsimulated sex acts ‚Äì presented in 3D, no less\\". In most cases, the sex scenes were also not choreographed. Release The week before its debut at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, the film's U.S. distribution rights were acquired by Alchemy. It was selected to be screened in the Vanguard section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film also screened in The International Film Festival of Kerala, held in Thiruvananthapuram. The film was refused a license to be screened in Russia. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 39% an average rating of 5.01/10, based from 91 reviews. The website's critics consensus states: \\"Love sees writer-director Gaspar No√© delivering some of his warmest and most personal work; unfortunately, it's also among his most undeveloped and least compelling.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

The handheld device is used by a doctor to exfoliate the eyelid at the lash line and remove the inflammatory biofilm that leads to chronic lid disease and discomfort.  History  BlephEx was invented in 2012 by James Rynerson, MD, a board-certified ophthalmologist, as the first patented, in-office procedure that allows eye care professionals to take an active role in removing years of accumulated biofilm, scurf and debris from the eyelids. Since the lid margin is the only place on the body that never gets washed, the bacterial biofilm tends to accumulate over the years, getting worse as we age. Contact lens wearers are also prone to developing biofilms of the lid margin at a much earlier age due to the foreign body nature of the contact lens. BlephEx purportedly removes years of accumulated biofilm, eliminating the source of inflammation which leads to healthier, more comfortable eyelids and an increase in natural tear production. Many patients are able to stop using artificial tears altogether. Two independent studies demonstrate a 60%-66% increase in tear break up time, which is an indicator of improved tear function.  Procedure  To administer the device, a physician glides the BlephEx hand piece along the lash line, applying the spinning surgical-grade micro sponge to the lid margin. The sponge is soaked in a lid scrub solution and removes inflammatory scurf, biofilm and bacterial exotoxins (the main causes of inflammatory lid disease), thereby relieving blepharitis symptoms and improving overall eyelid health. The treatment takes 8‚Äì10 minutes to perform, is well tolerated and it is reported that many patients experience nearly immediate relief. By repeating the procedure every 4 ‚Äì 6 months (like a dental cleaning), a patient can keep the lid margins totally clean and inflammation free. This healthy lid environment helps patients make their own tears, avoiding dry eye syndrome. Cost to Patient and Society The costs of dry eye disease are significant, with some patients spending an average of $800 per year on dry products. The total direct and indirect cost to society has been estimated by the NIH at over $55 billion. This procedure has the potential of saving money while at the same time allowing doctors to take better care of their patients.

Situated in close proximity to Heathrow Airport, it is bordered by the M4 Motorway to the north, the A312 trunk road to the east, and by the towns of Harlington and Cranford to the South West and South East respectively. Although its namesake Cranford is within the London Borough of Hounslow, the park itself is geographically in fact part of the London Borough of Hillingdon, as it straddles the southernmost point of this borough. Despite this, the park is managed under Hounslow's council authority. Although the park is in an urban location, it is vehicle-accessible only by a small road before a motorway entrance slip, and as such it has been described as a 'hidden gem'.http://cranfordparkfriends.org/ The park features in the London Parks & Gardens Trust‚Äôs ‚ÄòInventory of Historic Green Spaces‚Äô and is centrally positioned among the Crane Valley‚Äôs parkland chain.http://cranfordparkfriends.org/ It is fully open to the public from 07:30-21:00 during the summer months, and closes instead at dusk during the autumn, winter and spring.

South Korea exports around US$800 million‚Äì1 billion worth of washing machines to the United States per year. The machines are made in Mexico and South Korea. South Korea was notified by the WTO for consultations with the United States on anti-dumping and countervailing measures on South Korean \\"residential washers\\" by the US Department of Commerce. The case was brought by Whirlpool Corporation, one of the world's biggest appliance makers. Whirlpool produces large residential washers in the United States under the Whirlpool, Maytag, Roper, Estate, Admiral, Amana, and Crosley brands. The antidumping investigation came in response to a petition filed in December 2011 by Whirlpool Corporation, claiming washing machines imported from South Korea and Mexico were being sold at prices below fair market value. Whirlpool filed several complaints against imports from South Korea and Mexico. Dispute and results The U.S International Trade Commission ruled 6-0 in favor of Whirlpool, finding that the U.S washing machine industry was threatened by imports of residential washers from South Korea. Also, the commission stated South Korean producers, Daewoo, LG, and Samsung were dumping washing machines far below their market value. Investigation into the matter led to the finding that LG and Samsung's market sales in the United States were found significantly different and the differences were not taken into account using the average-to-average method. A countervailing duty of over 72 percent was set for Daewoo, while the two other South Korean companies were given much smaller duties of below two percent. LG Electronics Inc. faced a dumping margin of 13.02, while Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. received a 9.29 percent dumping duty rate. Both LG and Samsung have since challenged Commerce's findings in the U.S. Court of International Trade, using the argument that the ITC improperly used the zeroing method to calculate dumping margins. Consultations between South Korea and the United States were requested concerning the anti-dumping and countervailing issues on August 29, 2013. LG and Samsung objected to the analysis, Whirlpool's dumping allegations in the preliminary determination of the case, the Nails test, and also the use of weighting-average net prices in conducting the targeted dumping analysis. LG and Samsung also objected to the gap test used to detect the weighted- average sales in a target and non-target group. The WTO said South Korea has taken issue with the U.S. Department of Commerce's use of zeroing, a controversial method for calculating anti-dumping duties that has been the subject of other WTO cases against the U.S. Zeroing is a way of calculating anti-dumping duties that does not provide offsets for instances of \\"negative dumping\\" ‚Äî that is, when an imported product is sold in the U.S. at prices equal to or higher than in its home country ‚Äî in determining a dumping margin. South Korea claims that the measures identified in its request for consultations are inconsistent with: * Articles 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 5.8, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 11 and 18.4 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement * Articles 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 10, 14 and 19.4 of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement * Articles VI, VI:1, VI:2 and VI:3 of the GATT 1994 * Article XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement In September 2013, China and Japan requested to join the consultations. In December 2013 South Korea requested the creation of a panel ‚Äì this was deferred by the Dispute Settlement Body until January 22, 2014, when a panel that consisted of Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Norway, Thailand, and Turkey was formed. On 10 June 2014, South Korea requested the Director-General to compose the panel. He composed the panel on 20 June 2014. On 15 December 2014, the Chair of the panel informed the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) that the beginning of the panel's work was delayed due to a lack of available experienced lawyers in the Secretariat. The panel expects to issue its final report to the parties by the end of 2015.

Supplementing a number of earlier structures at Fort Camden and Fort Davis, the site was developed between 1904 and 1909 to defend the mouth of Cork Harbour. Used as a coastal artillery position until the 1940s, and as a military training camp until the late 20th century, many of the structures of the 37 acre site were dismantled over time, and part of the complex used as a pitch and putt course. In 2009, Cork County Council added the site to a proposed list of protected structures - though as of 2020 it remains in the ownership of the Department of Defence. History As with other earlier coastal defence fortifications at Fort Camden (Crosshaven) and Fort Carlisle (Whitegate), the batteries at Templebreedy were designed to defend the strategically important entrance to Cork Harbour. By the early 20th century, a number of improvements were proposed to the harbour defences - including the installation of newer Breech-loading 9.2 Inch guns. Rather than installing these guns at Fort Camden, it was decided to build separate batteries slightly south of the existing fort, at Templebreedy, to cover threats outside the harbour approaches in the Celtic Sea. Built between 1904 and 1909, the fortification included concrete gun emplacements for two BL 9.2 inch Mark X guns, underground magazines, searchlights, and a number of machine-gun positions. A practice range was added later for smaller QF 12-pounder guns. A further battery was constructed for BL 6-inch Mark VII guns; however, these were never installed. By the end of construction in 1909, there was accommodation in place for four officers and 81 non-commissioned officers and men. Throughout the First World War (1914-1918), the harbour was used as a naval base to cover the \\"Western Approaches\\", and the battery complemented the defences of Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. During the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), Templebreedy was somewhat isolated, and ambushes by IRA Brigades were not uncommon on supplies to the fort. Following the Anglo- Irish Treaty the harbour defences remained in the control of British Armed Forces, until July 1938 when the Treaty Port installations, including Templebreedy, were relinquished to Irish authorities. The Irish Defence Forces continued to maintain and operate the batteries throughout the Emergency (WWII), until the defences were largely decommissioned in 1946. Though the large 9.2 inch guns remained in place until the 1960s, the buildings and grounds continued to be used into the 1970s and later (including for training camps by Army Reserve (FC√Å) and Naval Reserve (Slua Muir√≠)). As of the early 21st century, though a number of buildings, concrete emplacements, underground magazine stores and other structures still stand, no guns or defensive elements remain, and the site is no longer used for military purposes. Today Haulbowline Naval Base, (B) Fort Mitchel/Westmoreland, (C) Fort Meagher/Camden, (D) Fort Davis/Carlisle, (E) Fort Templebreedy From the original construction of the fortifications at Templebreedy, there was some contention about access rights. This manifest in political debates about rights of way (as early as 1909), suspected unauthorised access resulting in accidental shooting (in 1940),A Defence Forces sentry, who asserted that three figures were approaching the fort, fired a shot, and was himself injured. A Garda report suggested that the sentry had in fact fired towards three pillars, and was injured by a ricochet from his own weapon building of houses off Defence Forces' access roads (1949), and \\"overholding\\" of assigned quarters by Defence Forces' personnel (as late as 2012). Some years after the complex ceased to be used for active defence purposes, some of the site was laid-out as a pitch and putt course. However this was closed - amid some controversy - in 2005. Though Cork County Council added Fort Templebreedy to a list of protected structures in 2009, ostensibly to protect the site and potentially prepare it for development as a heritage and recreation site, as of 2020 it remained in the ownership of the Department of Defence. Public access to the site therefore remains limited.

It is the first landsighting when sailing to the port of Panama. The Reserva Natural Isla San Telmo was established in 1996 as a protection measure for the island; marine turtles are noted on the beaches, endemic birds and animals are found in the premontane forest, and the island waters are a whale breeding area. Geography Archipelago de las Perlas Isla San Telmo is a small island measuring in area. The island is located on the triangle shaped Bay of Panama, facing the Pacific Ocean to its west. The smallest of the many volcanic islands in the Archipelago de las Perlas to the southeast of the main island, it is heavily forested and was once a coastal valley. The bay is full of marine fauna with molluscs and fish. Rio Cacique is approximately to the northwest. There is a reef measuring between Isla San Telmo and Isla del Rey. Isla Galera is approximately nautical miles to the southeast. History Isla San Telmo is named after St. Elmo, also called Saint Erasmus, who was a 4th- century martyr; he is the patron saint of mariners. Spanish marine charts show this island in their maps. Indigenous people lived in the forested area near the shores till the arrival of Spaniards. Shell fish, found in profusion in these islands, were named \\"Perlas\\" by the Europeans. Following overexploitation, the original settlers left, and only the black descendants of slaves inhabit the islands in the present day, engaged in subsistence farming and fishing. Submarine wreck Hull of Sub Marine Explorer wreck in the Panama Canal The wreck of a submarine can be seen off the beach during low tide. The Japanese had examined this submarine and stated that it did not belong to them. However, a subsequent underwater study by German divers reported that it belonged to the Japanese, having wrecked when the Japanese intended to destroy the strategically important Panama Canal in 1942. It was conjectured that the submarine was abandoned by its crew due to technical problems and the crew had taken refuge on the island. Subsequently, Jim Delgado of the Vancouver Maritime Museum investigated the wreck. A local fisherman told Delgado about the wreck that he had observed during the low tide, a rusted and weed covered metal body off the coast of St. Thelmo. Delgado saw this wreck sitting on the coastline of St. Thelmo, but did not believe the fisherman's conjecture that the wreck was of a Japanese submarine that operated in the Panama Canal during World War II. He explored the wreck, recorded its dimensions, but could not link it to any known vessels as it resembled more of a science fantasy vessel. After five years, it was identified as the \\"Sub Marine Explorer\\", an underwater craft designed by Julius H. Kroeh, a German engineer who also reportedly died because of this vessel, that was one of the world's first submarines. It is now established that it was a pioneering vessel, of which a few more examples are also stated to have been preserved, which did underwater explorations during the 19th century. Richard Wills, an American Civil War submarine specialist, confirmed that details about the Sub Marine Explorer were published in a scientific article in 1902. Investigations revealed that there were several technical problems in the vessel which had resulted in several tragedies and the submarine was an \\"iron coffin\\" in the Pacific Ocean bed. As the story of the submarine was widely circulated, Delgado set out to explore the submarine further, in 2002 and 2004.

The territory of Brigantia which now forms Northern England and part of The Midlands covered the majority of the land between the River Tyne and the River Humber forming the largest Brythonic Kingdom in ancient Britain. It was recorded by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD to extend sea to sea, from the Irish sea on the west coast to the North Sea in the east. Etymology It is unclear if the Celtic name Brigantia is derived from the highland topography of the area or from the Goddess Brigantia who was worshiped by the Brigantes themselves. In modern Welsh the word braint means 'privilege, prestige' and comes from the same root *brigantƒ´. Other related forms from the modern Celtic languages are: Welsh brenin 'king' (< *brigantƒ´nos); Welsh/Cornish/Breton bri 'prestige, reputation, honour, dignity', Scottish Gaelic br√¨gh 'pith, power', Irish br√≠ 'energy, significance', Manx bree 'power, energy' (all < *brƒ´g-/brigi-); and Welsh/Cornish/Breton bre 'hill' (< *brigƒÅ). The name Bridget from Old Irish Brigit (Modern Irish Br√≠d) also comes from Brigantƒ´, as does the English river name Brent. This mirrors the debate as to whether settlements named Brigantium (meaning 'settlement of the high ones') is in reference to nobility or the highlands they lived around, such as the Pennines. There are several ancient settlements named Brigantium around Europe, such as Berganza in Alava (Spain), Betanzos and Bergondo in Galicia (Spain), Bragan√ßa in Portugal and Brian√ßon, Brigetio on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, Brigobanne situated on the Breg river and near the Brigach river in south Germany (pre-Roman Vindelicia) and Bregenz in the Alps. From the same origin also stems the name of the Italian sub-region of Brianza. History In the form of a loose confederation, Brigantia existed as the territory of a number of small tribes with the Pennines being described as composing the heart Extending from this, Brigantia was further formed by a number of sub- tribes whose territory is sometimes coined by some researchers as being part of Greater Brigantia as it is often debated as to which tribes formed a sept of Brigantia and which may have been independent. Some of the sub-tribes often included are the Setantii who occupied western and southern Lancashire, Textoverdi in the upper valley of the River South Tyne and the Carvetii who occupied what is now Cumbria. Isurium or Isurium of the Brigantes (Latin: Isurium Brigantum) the historical capital of the kingdom became a Roman fort and town in the province of Britannia at the site of present-day Aldborough, North Yorkshire, England, in the United Kingdom. Its remains‚Äîthe Aldborough Roman Site‚Äîare in the care of English Heritage. Bremetennacum Veteranorum (Ribchester) and Mamucium (Manchester) as well as Coccium (Wigan) were all Roman forts stationed in Brigantia. Around 43 AD when the Brigantes were first recorded, Brigantia consisted of mossland, marshes and forests which they inhabited; such ancient forests include the Forest of Lyme and the Forest of Bowland. At the time they would have been wild with fauna that were hunted, including: eurasian brown bear, wild boar, wolves, deer and eagles.

It was established in 1892 and the headquarters are located in Merrill, Wisconsin. This manufacturer is best known for the Thorogood brand of work boots.  History  The Weinbrenner Shoe Company was founded by Albert H. Weinbrenner, the son of a German immigrant and cobbler. Originally working as an apprentice for his father repairing outsoles, he left at age 27 in 1892 to start his own business with Joseph Pfeifer. The two opened a small cobblery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin called \\"Weinbrenner and Pfeifer\\", specializing in \\"jobbing\\" shoes (referred to today as work boots). After eight years in repair and sale, the pair transitioned into manufacturing. In 1900 they purchased the Knoll Shoe Company for $1,500. The new company they formed was named the Albert H. Weinbrenner Company. The company grew quickly, reaching production of 60 pairs of boots per day by 1902 and 2,500 pairs per day by 1905. In 1909, Weinbrenner moved to a new, larger factory of 158,000 square feet. Its innovate exterior design for the period led to its feature in several national architectural magazines. In the 1910's, the company began to diversify into producing boot styles designed for more particular trades. During the first World War, they were a major contributor of military boots for US Army infantry. In 1918, the Thorogood brand of work boots was introduced and quickly garnered popularity. It remains Weinbrenner's most well-known brand by a significant margin. In 1935, construction began on a new manufacturing plant in Marshfield, Wisconsin in order to raise production capacity to 3-4,000 boots per day. In the following few years, new plants were also built in Merrill, Wisconsin and Antigo, Wisconsin. During the second World War, all production was directed towards the war effort. This led to the development of improved safety technology such as steel safety-toe caps, protective outsoles, and metatarsal guards. In 1943, workers at Weinbrenner unionized under the International Boot and Shoe Workers Union, a first step in a long history of union support in the company (currently, the company is represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union). Production of the \\"Hike 'n Camp\\" boot designed for the Boy Scouts began in 1964. This style (now the \\"814-4201\\") would become Weinbrenner's best selling boot of all time. Its design is widely considered the signature boot for the construction industry. In 2000, workers took ownership of the company in the form of a Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Today Weinbrenner is America's largest manufacturer of \\"Made in USA\\" footwear, selling over 125 styles of domestic footwear. Including imported lines, it produces 250 styles. The Merrill manufacturing plant operates as the current headquarters. In 2019, Jeff Burns was named president of the company. In the same year, it was named Merrill's Business of the Year.

She won the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015, for \\"a grassroots campaign that successfully pressured the world‚Äôs largest dam builder to pull out of the Agua Zarca Dam\\" at the R√≠o Gualcarque. She was assassinated in her home by armed intruders, after years of threats against her life. A former soldier with the US-trained special forces units of the Honduran military asserted that Caceres' name was on their hitlist months before her assassination. As of February 2017, three of the eight arrested people were linked to the US-trained elite military troops: two had been trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA, the former School of the Americas (SOA), renamed WHINSEC, linked to thousands of murders and human rights violations in Latin America by its graduates. In November 2017, a team of international legal experts released a report finding \\"willful negligence by financial institutions.\\" For example, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), the Netherlands Development Finance Institution (FMO) and the Finnfund pursued a strategy with shareholders, executives, managers, and employees of DESA, private security companies working for DESA, public officials and State security agencies \\"to control, neutralize and eliminate any opposition\\". Twelve environmental activists were killed in Honduras in 2014, according to research by Global Witness, making it the most dangerous country in the world, relative to its size, for activists protecting forests and rivers. Berta C√°ceres' murder was followed by those of two more activists within the same month.  Early life  C√°ceres was born into the Lenca people in La Esperanza, Honduras, the predominant indigenous group in southwestern Honduras. C√°ceres grew up in the 1970s during a time of civil unrest and violence in Central America. Her mother Austra Bertha Flores Lopez was a role model of humanitarianism: she was a midwife and social activist who took in and cared for refugees from El Salvador. Austra Flores was elected and served as a two-term mayor of their hometown of La Esperanza, as a congresswoman, and as a governor of the Department of Intibuc√°.\\"Berta Caceres\\", CNN, 2 March 2017. After attending local schools, C√°ceres studied education at a university and graduated with a teaching qualification. She found in Fr. Ismael Moreno, director of Radio Progreso & ERIC-SJ, a close friend and collaborator.  Activism  In 1993, as a student activist, C√°ceres co-founded the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), an organization to support indigenous people's rights in Honduras. She led campaigns on a wide variety of issues, including protesting illegal logging, plantation owners, and the presence of US military bases on Lenca land. She supported feminism, LGBT rights, as well as wider social and indigenous issues. In 2006, a group of indigenous Lenca people from R√≠o Blanco asked C√°ceres to investigate the recent arrival of construction equipment in their area. C√°ceres duly investigated and informed the community that a joint venture project between Chinese company Sinohydro, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and Honduran company Desarrollos Energ√©ticos, S.A. (also known as DESA, see Empresa Nacional de Energ√≠a El√©ctrica) had plans to construct a series of four hydroelectric dams on the Gualcarque River. The developers had breached international law by failing to consult with the local people on the project. The Lenca were concerned that the dams would compromise their access to water, food and materials for medicine, and therefore threaten their traditional way of life. C√°ceres worked together with the community to mount a protest campaign. She organized legal actions and community meetings against the project, and took the case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. From 2013, C√°ceres led COPINH and the local community in a year-long protest at the construction site to prevent the companies from accessing the land. Security officers regularly removed protesters from the site. On 15 July 2013, the Honduran military opened fire on the protesters, killing one member of COPINH and injuring three others. The community reported regular threats and harassment from the company employees, security guards, and the military. In May 2014, members of COPINH were attacked in two separate incidents that resulted in two members dead and three seriously injured. In late 2013, both Sinohydro and the International Finance Corporation withdrew from the project because of COPINH's protests. Desarrollos Energ√©ticos (DESA) continued, however, moving the construction site to another location to avoid the blockade. Other local business leaders supported the project. Officials filed criminal charges against C√°ceres and two other indigenous leaders for \\"usurpation, coercion and continued damages\\" against DESA for their roles in the protest, which was alleged to have incited others to cause damages to the company. In response to the charges, Amnesty International stated that, if the activists were imprisoned, Amnesty International would consider them prisoners of conscience. Dozens of regional and international organizations called upon the Honduran government to stop criminalizing the defense of human rights and to investigate threats against human rights defenders. On 20 February 2016, more than 100 protesters were detained by security while protesting, and threats against their organisation began to increase.Berta C√°ceres, Honduran environment and human rights activist, murdered Published by The Guardian, 3 March 2016 C√°ceres singled out Hillary Clinton for her involvement in legitimizing the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat: > \\"The return of the president, Mel Zelaya, became a secondary issue. There > were going to be elections in Honduras. And here, she, Clinton, recognized > that they didn‚Äôt permit Mel Zelaya‚Äôs return to the presidency. There were > going to be elections. And the international community‚Äîofficials, the > government, the grand majority‚Äîaccepted this, even though we warned this was > going to be very dangerous and that it would permit a barbarity, not only in > Honduras but in the rest of the continent. And we‚Äôve been witnesses to > this.\\" Clinton claimed that her method of handling the situation was better for the Honduran people.  Threats and human rights concerns  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights included \\"Bertha C√°ceres\\" (sic) on its 28 June 2009 list of people under threat during the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat. The following day the IACH issued so-called \\"precautionary measures (MC 196-09)\\" in defense of her and other activists, while acknowledging reports that military forces had surrounded her home. In 2013, C√°ceres told Al Jazeera: > The army has an assassination list of 18 wanted human rights fighters with > my name at the top. I want to live, there are many things I still want to do > in this world but I have never once considered giving up fighting for our > territory, for a life with dignity, because our fight is legitimate. I take > lots of care but in the end, in this country where there is total impunity I > am vulnerable... When they want to kill me, they will do it. During the campaign against the dam, C√°ceres and other organisers were frequently intimidated by the military; on one occasion they were stopped and their vehicle was searched while traveling to Rio Blanco. C√°ceres claimed that during this search, a gun was planted in the vehicle; the organisers were subsequently arrested on weapons charges and detained overnight in jail. The court placed C√°ceres under preventative measures, forcing her to sign in at the court every week and preventing her from leaving the country. The measures were in effect until the case was dismissed in February 2014. Court records from 2014 publicized in May 2016 showed that \\"the government and DESA repeatedly sought to tar Caceres and her colleagues as violent anarchists bent on terrorizing the population through their protests, [...] usurpation, coercion and continued damage and even attempting to undermine the democratic order.\\" One of Berta‚Äôs favorite expressions was \\"They are afraid of us because we are not afraid of them,\\" according to Gustavo Castro Soto.  Honors The boat named after her by Extinction Rebellion in Oxford Circus * In 2012 C√°ceres was awarded the Shalom Award by the Society for Justice and Peace at the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt in 2012. * She was nominated as a finalist for the 2014 Front Line Defenders Prize. * In 2015 she was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize. * In April 2015, the international human rights organization Global Witness highlighted C√°ceres' case as emblematic of the severe risks environmental activists face in Honduras, which had the highest number of killings of environmental and land defenders per capita in the world.Global Witness (April 2015) How Many More? (pdf) * In April 2019 the Extinction Rebellion group fixed a pink boat named Berta C√°ceres in the centre of London's busy intersection of Oxford Street and Regent Street (Oxford Circus) and glued themselves to it, blocking traffic; it was removed by police with angle grinders after five-days. Death C√°ceres was shot dead in her home by armed intruders on the night of 2 March 2016. Mexican environmental activist Gustavo Castro Soto was also wounded, by two gunshots, to the cheek and the hand. Gustavo had arrived in La Esperanza a day prior for a meeting with 80 others \\"to discuss alternatives to the hydro- electric project\\". Berta invited him to stay at her place for the night, \\"as her place had a better internet connection than his accommodation\\". He said: > I was working on a presentation when I heard a loud bang. I thought > something had fallen, but when Berta screamed, ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs there?‚Äô, I knew it was > bad, that it was the end. [...] When the hitman arrived, I covered my face. > He was three metres away. I moved as he fired, and the bullet passed my ear. > He thought he‚Äôd killed me. It‚Äôs a miracle I survived. Under the so-called \\"precautionary measures\\" recommended by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Honduran government was required to protect C√°ceres, but on the day of her death she was not under any protection. The Honduran security minister said that she was not at the place which she had identified as her home. She had recently moved into a new house in La Esperanza. C√°ceres is survived by her four children with former husband and co-leader, Salvador Z√∫niga. \\"Justice for Berta C√°ceres!\\" protest in Washington, D.C. Palma, Spain Reactions Berta Isabel Z√∫niga C√°ceres, the 25-year-old daughter of Berta C√°ceres, said in an interview she holds the company that wanted to build the Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam responsible for her mother's death. She said it is \\"very easy to pay people to commit murders in Honduras, but those who are behind this are other powerful people with money and an apparatus that allows them to commit these crimes\\" and that \\"they had paid assassins on several occasions to kill her.\\"Hija de Berta C√°ceres: Ella era una luchadora firme. La Prensa (Honduras edition), 4 March 2016; retrieved 8 March 2016 C√°ceres' death was widely condemned, with calls for an investigation coming from the Organization of American States (OAS), the U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Honduran president Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez declared the investigation of the murder a priority, and Luis Almagro, the Secretary General of the OAS, reiterated the OAS's previous call for special protection of indigenous human rights defenders in Honduras. Other expressions of support came from American actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, Canadian author and activist Naomi Klein, Amnesty International, singer Ren√© P√©rez of Calle 13, former Colombian senator Piedad C√≥rdoba, Oxfam, the Mayor of Barcelona Ada Colau, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, and Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro. A group of around 100 COPINH members marched to the provincial police station after her death, to demand an independent international investigation into her murder. There was a protest at the Harry S. Truman Building, in Washington, D.C. On 4 March 2016, students at the National Autonomous University of Honduras staged a protest over C√°ceres' death, angry that she was not given more protection during her lifetime, demanding an independent investigation and throwing rocks, while police used tear gas to break up violent clashes during the protest. Protests were also held outside the Embassy of Honduras in Bogot√°, San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Vienna, Berlin, and Barcelona.  Investigation results 2016  On 3 March 2016, the day of her death, government officials performed an autopsy of C√°ceres' body without oversight, even though her family had requested an independent forensics expert,Silvio Carrillo, Remembering Berta C√°ceres, Assassinated Honduras Indigenous & Environmental Leader. Democracy Now, 4 March 2016, retrieved 8 March 2016 an independent investigation by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The same day, the government began its investigation and activated its Violent Crimes Unit (Unidad de Delitos Violentos) on the case, which coordinates its work with the United States. COPINH member Aureliano Molina Villanueva was detained on 3 March as a suspect in the killing. COPINH denounced this action, saying it was an attempt to falsely blame him for the murder. On 5 March, Molina was released for lack of evidence linking him to the crime. Security guard Jos√© Ismael Lemus was also detained and released. Judicial orders required Ismael and Castro, the sole survivor of the attack, to remain in the country as the investigation continued. Attack survivor and sole witness Castro later said he was \\"paraded through ministries and court houses, ordered to tell his story over and over again,[...] prevented from leaving the country for a month and effectively treated as a suspect [...]. After a month, the judge in charge of the case suspended my lawyer. They violated all my rights. I was very scared every day. I thought that something could happen to me at any time. I felt like a scapegoat.\\" In a 5 March press conference, C√°ceres' four children: Olivia, Berta, Laura, and Salvador, expressed their lack of confidence in the Honduran government investigation. Describing their mother's murder as a political act, they called for an international investigation into the homicide. On 6 March 2016, President Hern√°ndez asked UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Zeid bin Ra'ad Al-Hussein to assist in the investigation into C√°ceres' death. In the days following the murder, an Amnesty International (AI) delegation met with the Minister of Human Rights, Justice, Interior and Decentralization and representatives from the Ministry of Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General's Office, the Prosecutor's Office, and civil society, as well as C√°ceres' family members. Amnesty criticized President Hern√°ndez for his refusal to meet with C√°ceres' relatives, human rights defenders, and AI. Amnesty condemned \\"the Honduran government's absolute lack of willingness to protect human rights defenders in the country\\" and noted that the Honduran authorities had failed \\"to follow the most basic lines of investigation, including the fact that Berta had been receiving serious death threats related to her human rights work for a very long time.\\" One month after C√°ceres' death, Honduran authorities announced that on 13 March they had searched DESA‚Äôs offices and taken testimonies from the company‚Äôs employees. On 2 May 2016, the government arrested four men; one is DESA's manager for social and environmental issues, another a former employee of a security company hired by DESA; the other two are an army major and a retired captain. The US ambassador to Honduras applauded the government. In June 2016, a former soldier with the US-trained special forces units of the Honduran military confirmed that Caceres' name was on their hitlist months before her assassination.Nina Lakhani (21 June 2016). \\"Berta C√°ceres's name was on Honduran military hitlist, says former soldier\\", The Guardian.

GAIPE found \\"the participation of executives, managers and employees of DESA, of private security personnel hired by the company, of state agents and parallel structures to State security forces in crimes committed before, during and after March 2, 2016, the day of the assassination.\\" (The Executive Summary in English) 2018 In March 2018, Honduran authorities arrested a former military intelligence officer, accused of masterminding C√°ceres' murder. This new arrest, of the executive president of the company building the dam which C√°ceres campaigned against, was the ninth person arrested for the murder, and the fourth with ties to the Honduran military. In September 2018, Honduras' Supreme Court suspended indefinitely the trial of eight men accused of C√°ceres murder.

It is a manual process carried out by gas welding, usually oxy-acetylene.  Uses  Lead burning is carried out for roofing work in sheet lead, or for the formation of custom-made rainwater goods: gutters, downspouts and decorative hoppers. Decorative leadworking may also use lead burning, particularly where a waterproof joint is required as for planters. Lead burning is thus part of traditional plumber's work, in its original sense of a worker in lead (Latin: plumbum). Although rare and specialised, this work is still carried out today and not just for restoration of historical buildings. Most lead sheet work is formed and sealed by bossing, a mechanical fold or crimp. This is adequate for roofing that sheds water, but is insufficiently watertight when standing water sits upon it and so an impermeable burned joint is needed. Lead burning is not used as part of plumbing work for installed pipework. Lead piping has long been considered obsolete, owing to the health aspects. Even where lead piping, or lead- sheathed cable, still needs to be jointed, this is carried out with a wiped joint, rather than a burned joint. Wiping a lead joint is a soldering process, using plumber's solder (80% lead / 20% tin) and is carried out at low temperature, with a natural-draught propane blowtorch. Today, even wiped joints are rare and where an existing lead pipe must be connected to, a proprietary mechanical joint is more likely to be used. In some rare cases within the chemical industry, lead burning is used for pipework, where acid- resistant tanks and pipes are required to be made of lead rather than steel. Niche uses for lead burning include the manufacture of lead plates for lead- acid batteries and for electro-plating electrodes.  Process  Lead burning is an autogenous welding process. Two sheets of lead are formed mechanically to lie close against each other. They are then heated with the torch flame and flow together. No filler rod is required, the sheets form their own filler (autogenous welding). Neither is a flux used. Soldering, by contrast, uses a solder alloy that is some compatible alloy showing eutectic behaviour. This gives a melting point lower than the base metal, allowing a soldering process rather than welding. A filler rod may be needed for some welds, if there is no convenient way to form sufficient close overlap at a sheet edge. Offcuts of the same lead sheet are used as this filler. Excessive use of a filler, rather than an initial close fit, is considered a sign of poor technique. The torch used for lead burning is a small, hot, gas flame. Oxy-acetylene is most commonly used, as it is easily portable. A small size #0 nozzle is usually used, sometimes with a miniature torch body, but the torch is otherwise the same as that used for steel or copper work. A variety of fuel gases may be used, but to achieve the high temperature needed, an oxygen supply is always used. Fuel gases may be acetylene, natural gas or hydrogen. Oxy-hydrogen is considered to be the best, but is not easily portable. Oxy-natural gas is cheapest and is often used on fixed workbenches. As it is less hot, it cannot be used for some awkward positional (overhead) welding. Oxy-acetylene is the most common, as much leadwork is carried out on site and this is easily portable. A neutral flame is used. A reducing flame (fuel rich) gives trouble with soot deposits in the weld. An oxidising flame burns the lead and creates lead oxide dross, leading to poor welds with low malleability.  History  Lead burning requires a gas torch as autogenous processes require an intense, controllable flame that can be applied to a small area. It was first developed along with the early growth of the bulk chemical industry, as acid manufacture required leakproof lead vessels and flow process plumbing to be made. At the same time, coal gas was increasingly available for domestic lighting. By using a mouth-blown blowpipe, a gas flame could reach temperatures adequate for lead burning. Larger equipment could use mechanical fans. Before this, leadworking used either manual bossing or wiped soldered joints to seal it.  Safety   Fire risk  Lead burning, and lead soldering, are some of the few building processes which still requires the on-site use of a naked flame. This has obvious safety hazards and lead working has been implicated in some fires during restoration work on historical buildings.  Health  Metallic lead is relatively safe to work with, although lead oxide dross formed on the surface of lead is more easily absorbed by the body, thus much more of a hazard. As lead burning is a high temperature process, it creates a significant hazard from such dross. Safety precautions are relatively simple: goggles to protect the eyes from molten metal splash, overalls or dustcoat kept in the lead workshop to stop contamination spreading, and dedicated workbenches equipped with air extraction. Regular lead burners should be screened for accumulated lead exposure. Industrially this is done by weekly checks for blue lines around the gums, a simple indicator for heavy metal poisoning, and by regular urine testing.

It is located in the south-east part of the city, in the valley of the Straconka stream, on the western slopes of the Little Beskids.  History  The village was established around 1550 as a hamlet of Lipnik and was first mentioned in 1564. The first inhabitants were Lutherans from Lipnik, named Hoffman and Protzner. In the 18th century the village began to be catholicized by Jesuits. Upon the First Partition of Poland in 1772, it became part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. In 1854, the village formed a municipality. In 1875, Straconka became a seat of a Catholic parish. In the second half of the 19th century, the village became a resort destination, not only for the nearby Bielsko residents, whereas the local inhabitants most often worked in the textile industry in Bielsko and Bia≈Ça. In 1900, the municipality had 12,92 km¬≤, 1576 inhabitants, the majority of them being Polish-speaking Catholics. After World War I and the fall of Austria-Hungary, it became part of Poland. In 1973, most of the area of the Straconka was absorbed by the town of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça.

They are instead a solid block of metal, typically copper or a copper-zinc brass alloy, although historically any bullet made of a single type of metal can be referred to as a monolithic bullet.http://www.gunsmagazine.com/monolithic- bullets/ Monolithic bullets depart quite dramatically from the better known lead- or jacketed bullet, and offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to the toxicity associated with lead bullets. As a result of increasing environmental concerns over the toxicity levels found in lead-based bullets, some areas in the United States of America have banned the use of lead bullets for hunting purposes.http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/hunting/lead- free/ This increasing awareness of the dangers of lead bullets has led to the development of the modern monolithic bullet, which now provides a viable and accurate alternative to the use of lead for shooting.  Differences between lead and monolithic bullets  Monolithic bullets are less toxic to the environment, humans and animalshttp://www.peregrinebullets.com * Monolithic bullets retain their weight better than lead bullets. However, lead bullets perform better at velocities lower than 1800 feet per second, as at these lower velocities, most monolithic bullets will not expand. At extreme distances (beyond 300 yards) premium lead bullets are more accurate due to a higher ballistic coefficient. * Lead is a much denser material than copper. Lead also tends to mould itself better to the shape of the barrel, whilst monolithic copper bullets tend to retain their shape in the barrel.http://gunsmagazine.com/monolithic-bullets/ Due to the soft nature of the copper in monolithic bullets, copper barrel fouling has been a concern amongst hunters in the past. New generation monolithic bullets, such as those manufactured by Peregrine Bullets in South Africa,Hammer bullets from Montana, are designed in such a way that copper fouling is no longer a concern . * Accuracy achieved when using monolithic bullets is comparable to premium lead hunting bullets at moderate hunting distances,however at longer ranges due to the higher ballistic coefficient premium lead hunting bullets are more accurate. For example, at 500 yards the Barnes TTSX (monolithic) drops 77 inches while the Nozler Partition (lead core) drops 73 inches both bullets .338 225gr muzzle velocity 2800 fps http://gundata.org/ballistic-calculator/ * Monolithic bullets are about the same price as premium lead hunting bullets. For example a box of 50 Barnes TTSX (monolithic) and Nozler Accubonds (bonded lead) is ~$30 USA, http://midwayusa.com  Modern development  Monolithic bullets have been used for hunting big game in the USA for decades. The first popular all-copper bullet was the Barnes X bullet in 1986. https://www.barnesbullets.com/news/x-bullet-30th-anniversary/ Since then, most hunting bullet companies have a monolithic bullet on the market, including Nozler E-tips, Hornady GMX, Barnes TTSX,LRX,VOR-TX, Federal Trophy Copper, Winchester Powercore 95/5, Hammer bullets, Cutting Edge Bullets, etc. Although many attempts have been made throughout the years to develop a successful monolithic bullet, numerous difficulties with the use of copper as the bullet material have hampered progress in this regard. These difficulties included the following: * Increased bullet length to achieve similar weights to lead bullets. * Increased pressure on the chamber and barrel of the rifle (due to longer length bullets). * Decreased barrel life due to copper barrel fouling. * Inflexibility of the monolithic bullet in the barrel of the rifle. As monolithic bullets have developed, their performance in terms of penetration and weight retention versus hydrostatic shock varies. For example, the monolithics Nosler E-Tip and Barnes TSX at 400 yards the expansion range dropped slightly while the monolith Cutting Edge Copper Raptor expanded even at 400 yards http://www.huntingwithnonlead.org/bullets_long_range.html  Applications  By nature, modern monolithic bullets are very effective for hunting particularly larger game. This is due to the fact that these bullets retain their size and shape far better than lead alternatives and therefore often penetrate more deeply. With larger animals, this gives a better chance of penetrating to the vitals and deliver kinetic energy to disrupt them. Not only does this mean that the thicker, tougher skin of larger animals can be more effectively penetrated, it also makes the bullet more adept at breaking bone and delivering a terminal impact. As a result, monolithic bullets are particularly useful when hunting larger game such as moose and bear, or to take on hunting trips to Africa, where very large game, such as elephants, have often successfully been hunted with monolithic bullets. An additional benefit is an exit hole which allows for more efficient blood trailing, important for long-hair game such as bears. As a result of the monolithic bullet's feature to retain their mass so well these bullets have also gained popularity for hunting smaller game and even varmints. As a bullet that retains it shape the monolithic bullet will not break apart and cause meat damage to downed game of any size. This is a big benefit when hunting small targets that generally have little meat. In addition, there is less of a health hazard in terms of human food compared to bonded lead bullets.http://www.huntingwithnonlead.org/scientific_evidenceMore.html Finally,lead-based bullets are typically used for target competitions where accuracy is the goal. From long range bench shooting, to Olympic Biatholon, bonded lead bullets are used.https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor- activities/snow-sports/biathlon.htm  References   External links  Bullets ","title":"Monolithic bullet"},{"id":"46502117","text":"Kairasi Kudumbam () ( 'Lucky Family}}') is a 2015 IndianTamil-language soap opera that aired on Jaya TV.

However when they succeed at their plan, they end up falling for each other but are too proud to tell each how they really feel. Plot summary Moyung Fei (Joyce Tang) is a recent design school graduate searching for work. She and her family meet garage owner and car mechanic Lee Siu-sum (Hacken Lee) in a car accident while on their way to the airport to pick up her older brother and his wife. Both sides have an unpleasant encounter, blaming each other for the car accident. Later Siu-sum and his grandmother become the Moyung family's new neighbor when he purchases the apartment right across from theirs. Both sides end up as unfriendly neighbors due to further unpleasant encounters and neighborly bickering. On Siu-sum's wedding day he finds out that his girlfriend Wing-Kei has left him for Wing-kin, who turns out to be Yung-fei's boyfriend. Fei doesn't realize she has been dumped and swindled out of her and her family's money until Wing-kin has disappeared and changed all his contacts. Feeling wronged and scorned by their exes, Siu-sum and Fei team up to find Wing-Kei and Wing-kin to break them up. However, after they succeed at their plan, he realizes that he might have fallen for Fei but still proceeds to reconcile with Wing-kei. Soon Wing-kei notices that Siu-sum's attention has shifted to Fei and seeing how nice and caring Yung-fei has been to her, she leaves Siu- sum a second time during their wedding day so he can realize his true feelings for Yung-fei. Yung-fei's older sister Moyung Chu (Cutie Mui) is always looking for love and misinterprets every man as being interested in her when they are nice to her. Every time she encounters a guy she thinks is interested in her, he ends up asking for a discount for him and his fiancee at her family's bridal outfit shop. She works as a receptionist at an accounting firm and luck seems to be with her when the handsome new accountant asks her out on a date. After dating her new tall and handsome co-worker, who is as interested in her as she is in him, she thinks she has found the perfect man until he tells her he has no interest in marriage due to already being married once. Her absentminded behavior during her time of heartbreak leads everyone at work to believe she made a costly mistake when it was in fact her sister-in-law Gan Jing-mei's mistake. After being fired from her job, she takes on odd jobs until she finds work as a photographer assistant, working for Siu-sum's friend Hui Man-keung (Joey Leung), who is a laid-back guy, but becomes a demanded boss during work. Fei's older brother Moyung Tak (Louis Yuen) and his wife Kan Ching-mei (Florence Kwok) has just returned from Canada after a failed business venture. Yung-tak is a pushover for his domineering and vain wife who refuses to get pregnant because she is afraid of getting fat and is only interested in the finer things in life. Whenever Ching-mei and her mother-in- law get into an argument she forces Tak to choose sides, when he tries to stay neutral or sides with his mother, Ching-mei threaten's to divorcee him. However things change one day when Tak meets a model working for Man-keung and starts having an affair with her. Ching-mei runs into them at a clothing boutiques and threatens to divorce him which Tak is glad to hear since he had put up with his wife long enough. Surprisingly Tak's family sides with Ching- mei and kicks him out of the family home since they believe what he did was wrong. Besides Siu-sum and Fei, their parents also have a unpleasant relationship due to both of their mothers not getting along. Szeto Wai-kuen and Au-yeung Fung are not only rivals in business but also former rivals in love. Both were former best friends who feel that the other had stolen their boyfriend. Wai-kuen's husband Fat was Fung's former boyfriend, but because Wai-kuen met Yung-fat first she feels Fung stole her boyfriend when Fung and Fat were dating, while Fung feels Wai-kuen stole Yung-fat when they broke up, ending up with Fat marrying Wai-kuen. The two are also rivals in business since Fung owns and manages a modern bridal salon while the Moyung family owns a traditional Chinese kwa bridal business. Things get complicated further when Wai-kuen's brother Szeto Ming arrives and seems to be interested in Fung. As Sure As Fate Synopsis.

Women's nursing roles include both caring for patients and making sure that the wards and equipment are clean. Currently, females make up the majority of the field of nursing. Statistics show that in 2005, \\"women comprised 92.3% of Registered Nurses (RNs). Additionally, registered nurses are projected to create the second largest number of new jobs among all occupations between 2004 and 2014, increasing by 29.4%.\\" Daily tasks throughout history Nurses in the past were required to work long days and care for many patients, for very little pay. In addition, the typical university setting where nurses learned the work of the trade was not in existence back then. Instead, nurses learned the trade while working in the field. Another difference was that nursing students were called probationers. As probationers, they were required to follow the strict rules and regulations that were set forth by the institution. Additionally, probationers were required to follow all physicians‚Äô orders without question and perform various household duties. After learning how to take orders, probationers were then sent to the operating room for a 6-week rotation. During that 6-week period, probationers learned how to inventory sterile bandages, keep operating room meticulously clean and provide sterile water for surgeons during surgery. Upon completion of their training, probationers turned into nurses. February 1918 drawing by Marguerite Martyn of a visiting nurse in St. Louis, Missouri, with medicine and babies As nurses, some of their roles included providing patient education concerning nutrition and child related illnesses when needed. In general, nurses were the ones responsible for bathing patients, inserting catheters, dispensing medications, administering enemas, keeping the ward clean, and making sure that everything was documented correctly. During that time, there were no nurses' aides available to help with the daily care of patients. Thusly, all tasks fell upon the nurse. To add to that long list of tasks, a nurse was also responsible for preparing any holistic medications that were needed at the time to treat the various alignments that patients presented with. In the present time, holistic medications are hardly used, and any medications that are required are generally handled and prepared by a pharmacy. This is with the expectation of some intravenous (IV), antibiotics, and insulin preparations that the nurse will prepare on the floor (after receiving an order from a doctor). Listed below are more duties of nurses in these time periods.  1880s  * Nurses had 50 patients apiece to care for and were in charge of both their nursing notes and keeping the ward clean. Some of their daily tasks are listed below: ** Daily sweep and mop the floors of your ward; dust the patients‚Äô furniture and window sills. ** Maintain an even temperature in your ward by bringing in a scuttle of coal for the day's business. ** Light is important to observe the patient's condition; therefore, each day fill kerosene lamps, clean chimneys, and trim wicks. Wash windows once a week. ** The nurse's notes are important in aiding the physician's work. Make your pens carefully. You may whittle nibs to your individual taste. ** Each nurse on day duty will report every day at 7 a.m. and leave at 8 p.m., except on the Sabbath on which day you will be off from noon to 2 p.m. ** Graduate nurses in good standing with the director of nurses will be given an evening off each week if you go regularly to church. ** Each nurse should lay aside from each payday a goodly sum of her earnings for her benefits during her declining years, so that she will not become a burden. For example, if you earn $30 a month, you should set aside $15. ** Any nurse who smokes, uses liquor in any form, gets her hair done at a beauty shop, or frequents dance halls will give the director of nurse's good reason to suspect her worth, intentions, and integrity. ** The nurse who performs her labors, serves her patients and doctors faithfully and without fault for a period of five years will be given an increase by the hospital administration of 5 cents a day, providing there are no hospital debts that are outstanding.  During the war  * War time saw a demand for nurses. For that demand to be filled, nurses made the transition into the battlefield, leaving their home life behind. On the battlefield, the main duty was to care for the sick and wounded.  After the war  * Completion of the war helped nurses gained a new level of respect from having learned about both anesthesia and psychiatric nursing. Additionally, around this time penicillin was created. This in turn helped to cure many infections and ultimately save many lives.  1950s  * During this generation injections were \\"still prepared with a pestle and mortar. Oxygen tanks were strapped to beds and there was very little equipment that was disposable. Nurses were in charge of sharpening needles and sterilizing catheter units.\\"  1960s  * The 1960s brought about the development of the Intensive Care Units (ICU) where nurses were required to read telemetry monitors and take patient's blood pressure. In addition to the ICU, the ability to be able to specialize in one field of nursing and obtain an advanced nursing degree (i.e. nurse practitioner degree) become available. Another thing that nurses were required to do (no matter what field they are in) was to stand when doctors entered the room. Lastly, female nurses were still wearing the traditional white uniform and hat.  1970s  * This period saw several changes, with one being that new nurses had to generally work the graveyard shift as they worked their way up in the ranks. Generally, nothing came prepared, which left nurses responsible for mixing, calculating and drawing up both antibiotics and IV medications. To add to this nurses were still using paper charts and medication was kept under lock and key in a cabinet. The last main thing about this period was that nurses were still required to stand when doctors entered the room and the traditional white uniform and hat were still in practice in some facilities but with some modifications.  1980-1990s  * Within this time frame, nurses saw an improvement of technology and its introduction into the field of nursing. The improved technology improved efficiency but it also required that nurses had to go to back to training so that they knew how to use it in practice.  2000s  * Nurses in this period today are still responsible for the direct care of patients (i.e. bathing, feeding, toileting, ambulating, positioning), following doctor's orders, taking vital signs, obtaining daily weights, recording both input and output, obtaining various lab samples, administering medications and charting. Additionally, a nurse may delegate some of those tasks to the nursing aide, but only if the delegation is within the person's skill level and if the facility allows the nurse to delegate that specific task. Nurse's uniforms throughout history  19th century  During this time nursing uniforms were very similar to \\"servants‚Äô uniforms, which consisted of a full black or printed gown with a white gathered or banded cap and a white apron.\\" Around 1840, the field of nursing gained more respect and nurses were trained more. With this said the uniforms worn at this time started to change from the servant uniforms to the more classic \\"ladylike gowns with white aprons and caps to indicate that they were nurses.\\" During this time a very influential nurse started their career in the field of nursing; that nurse was Florence Nightingale. She brought many different things to the field. For instance she helped to make the field a more respectable one with the introduction of both better schooling and uniforms. The improvements in uniforms helped us to determine the rank of all the different nurses practicing. This was accomplished by having nurses wear a hat with a different color band depending on their rank. \\"Fresh nurse students would wear ribbon bands of pink, blue, or other pastel colors. Senior nurses and nursing teachers would wear black ribbon bands to indicate seniority.\\"  20th century  Red Cross ward uniform (left) and another nurse wearing a dark blue cape (right) This period brought about the start of change in the uniforms by adding white bibs and pockets to the dresses. In addition, large hats were worn that resembled a nun's hat and veil. These types of uniforms stayed in practice up until the First World War, when it was decided that the uniforms needed to be revamped to make them more practical and improve nurses' efficiency. For instance, the sleeves on the uniforms were changed so that they rolled up, the bulky aprons were removed, and the shirts shortened. All these things helped with convenience and allowed nurses to function better, and were often coupled with shoulder-covering capes, which were usually navy or dark blue in colour on the outside with red lining on the inside. By the 1950s, paper hats and simple folded hats replaced the large, elaborate crown- like caps that were worn by nurses during the First World War. The simple paper hats were more comfortable. The policy to use hats to denote seniority level was abolished, since the morality of nurses was affected by the discrimination. Dresses also evolved, since no one has the time to launder elaborately tailored clothing anymore. Dresses became less form fitting and were easy to wash, iron and wear.\\" By the 1970s with the appearance of males in the field wearing scrubs, the female uniforms once again changed, they \\"became less gendered\\". The hat was lost and uniforms become less formal. In addition, they started to resemble normal clothing. By the 1980s, the cap and the cloth apron was gone. To replace the cloth apron, nurses started to wear disposable ones.  Today  Nurses today continue to wear scrubs with many different colors and patterns available. The scrubs usually consist of drawn string pants and a V-neck top. The formal uniform (i.e. color and patterns allowed) though varies by policy. In some facilities it is required that the different types of employees all wear different color scrubs so that their specific job title can be determined by their scrub color. For example, \\"nurses in one color, techs in another, etc.\\" Additionally \\"some hospitals are even going back to requiring that nurses wear white, though they haven't yet returned to skirts, hats, and stockings.\\" Female nurses in popular culture * Christine Chapel * Carla Espinosa * Audrey March Hardy * \\"Hot Lips\\" Houlihan * Samantha Taggart * Julia_(TV_series) Notable women in nursing See List of nurses. * Florence Nightingale * Kelli Dee Hidalgo * Mary Todd Lincoln * Clara Barton * Mary Eliza Mahoney * Mary Seacole * Mary Breckinridge * florence Guinness Blake * Edith Cavell * Helen Fairchild * Elizabeth Grace Neill * Margaret Sanger * Sophie Mannerheim * Hazel W.

It is an administrative center of the Lityn Raion. Population: Location The town is located near the Zghar River which is a left tributary of the Southern Bug. Lityn is situated 28 kilometers to the North-West from Vinnytsia on the one of the most frequently used for the connection between Ukraine and the EU roads - European route . History The date of the foundation of the town is not known. The oldest mention of it is in the edict of Duke of Podilia Fyodor Koriatovych of 1391. Since 1566 Lityn was a royal city located in the Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship of Poland. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 it was annexed by the Russian Empire. Since 1797 Lityn was a county seat of the Russian Podolia Governorate. Folk hero Ustym Karmaliuk was imprisoned here; the prison where he was detained is now a part of the museum named after Karmaliuk, which is situated in Lityn. In 1897 almost half of population of Lityn was practicing Judaism. Since March 1923, Lityn was a center of the Lityn Raion. On the eve of World War II, there were 1,410 Jews living in the city. Between July 17, 1941 and March 20, 1944 the town was occupied by the Nazi Germany. On August 20, 1941, 56 young Jews were murdered. On December 19, 1941, about 1,800 Jews were shot at the nearby military base. In the middle of April 1942, a limited shooting of skilled workmen took place. The remaining Jews were killed in the fall of 1942. According to different sources, about 3,353-4,000 Jews were murdered in Lityn. The anti-Jewish actions were carried out by German gendarmeria, accompanied by Ukrainian auxiliary police and a special SD commando. Some Jews from Lityn survived the war because they were deported to the Zhmerynka ghetto which remained under Romanian occupation.http://yahadmap.org/#village/lityn- vinnytsia-ukraine.157 Infrastructure The Lityn's biggest taxpayer and employer is Litynskiy Milk Factory, which proceed up to 300 tons of milk and where a few hundreds of citizens are employed. There is a number of other important institutions that include two schools, four libraries, two bazaars, regional hospital, cinema, stadium, one of the biggest in the oblast sport hall, a medium-security prison, and agricultural factories. The factories proceed and produce meat, bread, vegetables, wood etc. Famous Residents * Ustym Karmaliuk was a Ukrainian peasant outlaw who became a folk hero. He is one of the most known Ukrainians who fought against serfage and often referred to as the \\"Ukrainian Robin Hood\\" and \\"the last Haydamak\\". He was born in 1787 in Lityn Region. There is the Ustym Karmeliuk's museum in Lityn. * David Bert'ie was a Professor of Art and famous Soviet musical conductor who was born in Lityn in 1882. * Yakiv Shepel' was a regional leader of the insurrection against bolsheviks in 1919-1921 as a member of the Ukrainian People's Army. * Mykola Bytynskiy was a famous Ukrainian artist, heraldist, vexillologist, and poet. * Sergiy Sobko is a soldier who fought in the War in Donbass and became a Hero of Ukraine was born in Lityn in 1984.

The organization is similar to Memory Hierarchy, where lower-level caches enjoy higher hit rates, but longer hit latencies. The architecture for Hierarchical Value Cache is mainly organized along two approaches: Hierarchical Unified Value Cache (HUVC) and Hierarchical Combinational Value Cache (HCVC). Hierarchical Unified Value Cache This architecture of Value Cache employs all value caches storing full data values, with larger value caches in the lower levels of the hierarchy. This architecture suffers from high area overhead, but reduces the bus switching activity. The cache in HUVC in managed by LRU policy, with each VC storing 32-bit values. For incoming data, it is simultaneously checked with the VC on each level, with the uppermost VC hit getting encoded. Each hit at the ¬°th level of the HUVC incurs i bits switching activity. By switching any bit of 32-bit data bus, we can get (32!)/((32-i)!i!) numbers. That is, we could have (32!)/((32-i)!i!) entries. However, it would require complicated logic to map VC indexes to bus values. For easy VC index encoding, we partition the data bus into i segments and switch one bit in each segment. Thus, the HUVC scheme requires n control signals, where n is the depth of the VC hierarchy. The i-th control signal switched to indicate that the VC of level i hits. For 4-level HUVC, and 32-bit data bus, the total VC size is 22.4KB. The size of the VC is too large to be feasible in practice. Hierarchical Combinational Value Cache In HCVC, level i contains 2^(i-1) VCs that store only partial values, instead of full values as in HUVC. Except the case of first level, all VCs in HCVC store partial data values only. 2^(i-1) segments are generated by partitioning the data values, and each VC stores one data segment. Similar to the HUVC, the incoming data is simultaneously checked with the VC on each level, with the uppermost VC hit getting encoded. The HCVC scheme requires n Control signals, where i is the number of VCs. The i-th control signal is switched to indicate the Formula VC hit. The total VC size of the i-th level is 32/(2^(i-1)) words. For 4-level HCVC with 32-bit data bus, the total VC size is only 240 bytes.

However, retailers may choose to sell products for less than the MRP. MRP differs from systems using a recommended retail price because in those systems the price calculated by the manufacturer is only a recommendation, not enforceable by law. All retail products in India must be marked with MRP. Shops cannot charge customers over the MRP. Some shops may charge slightly below MRP to draw more customers to their stores. In some remote areas, tourist spots, and in situations where a product is difficult to obtain, consumers are often charged illegally over the MRP. In April 2015, it was reported that milk vendors in Mumbai were threatening a boycott after it was discovered they had been charging above MRP and the Maharashtra state government threatened to intervene. Criticism The concept of Maximum Retail Price has been criticised as incompatible with the free market system, because it involves manufacturers deciding what profit retailers will make. It is easy to get around the MRP by charging for 'services' on top of the item price, such as a 'cooling charge' for cold drinks, or by manufacturers setting the MRP at up to ten times the expected sale price. The MRP also hurts consumers in rural areas because if retailers cannot charge a higher price to make up for the higher cost of transportation and distribution to those areas, they may simply not stock many items.

This protein is a member of the family of AAA Proteins (AAA+ ATPase) and is to form the protein complex of Clp protease (Endopeptidase Clp). Structure Protein Structure The knowledge of human ClpX protein are majorly based on the investigations on E. Coli protein. The monomer of ClpX protein in E. Coli contains a N-terminal domain and a AAA+ module which consists of a large and a small AAA+ domain. Complex Assembly During protease Clp complex assembly, the ClpX subunits form a hexameric ring structure. According to the orientation of ClpX subunits within the ring structure, these subunits can be categorized into two classes: \\"loadable\\" subunit (L subunit) and \\"unloadable\\" subunit (U subunit). In L subunit, the large and small AAA+ domain form a cleft for nucleotide ATP or ADP binding. However, the large and small AAA+ domains in U subunit rotate ~ 80¬∞, which prevents nucleotide binding. The L and U subunits form a \\"L-L-U-L- L-U\\" pattern when they assemble into a hexameric ring, which has the maximum capacity to bind four ATP or ADP. Electro-microscopy (EM) studies showed that ClpX ring structures stack coaxially on either one side or both side of ClpP tetradecamer complex to form ClpXP protease complexes. ATP binding can stabilize the association between ClpX and ClpP ring structures.  Function  ClpX is an ATP-dependent chaperone that can recognize protein substrates by binding to protein degradation tags. These tags can be short unstructured peptide sequences (e.g., ssrA-tag in E coli). As an essential component of ClpP protease complex, ClpX recruits degradable substrates and unfolds their tertiary structure, which requires energy provided by ATP hydrolysis. Subsequently, these ClpX Chaperones transfer protein substrates into the proteolytic chamber formed by ClpP tetradecamer. Clinical Significance In mammals, ClpXP protease is a pivotal contributor to mitochondrial protein quality control. A compromised ClpXP function usually leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins and mitochondrial dysfunctions, which believes to be potential causes for neurodegenerative diseases and aging.

He studied at Jones County Junior College and at Mississippi State University from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. Political career Eaton was first elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1996. He held the same seat that his grandfather once did. In November 2015, the election for the 79th district seat resulted in a draw. Both Eaton and his opponent (the Republican Mark Tullos) received exactly 4,589 votes. As per state law, the two candidates drew straws to determine the winner. As Eaton drew the longer straw, he was declared the winner and was therefore re-elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives. His win prevented the Republicans from achieving a three-fifths supermajority in the House. However, Eaton was unhappy with having won the election through a game of chance. In a statement made before the drawing of straws, he said; \\"It's wrong ‚Äì philosophically, morally ... It's archaic, it's medieval, and it's wrong\\". After winning, he said he would accept the result but would attempt to change the law that governs election ties. Although Eaton drew the long straw, Tullos appealed the result to the Republican-controlled House, which decided to seat Tullos instead after deciding that five ballots were invalid because the voters did not file a written change of address with the local registrar. Eaton's lawyer filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the five Smith County voters whose ballots were thrown out, arguing that they were denied their federal constitutional right to vote. That case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves who claimed he didn't have jurisdiction over the matter. The voters then filed an appeal with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments at the 5th Circuit were heard in December 2017. In May 2018, the 5th Circuit ended the dispute by declaring that federal courts lack jurisdiction over a dispute about a state legislative seat leaving Tullos the winner.

The bill allows individuals to discriminate against same sex couples who have \\"deeply held religious beliefs or moral convictions\\" against such unions.

Party to high level decision making on the allied Ming-Joseon side and able to access all Joseon records, Ryu Seong-ryong's Jingbirok has become an invaluable source in the study of the conflict, and Chinese-Korean-Japanese relations. In 1969 the Jingbirok was listed as the 132nd of the National Treasures of South Korea. The writing of the Jingbirok Ryu Seong-ryong Ryu Seong-ryong (1542‚Äì1607) was born in Uiseong, in Gyeongsang province, during the Korean Joseon Dynasty, to a yangban family of the Pungsan Ryu clan. Passing the Samsai level of the Gwageo civil service examination in 1564, and the Mungwa level in 1566, Ryu rose through the ranks of the scholar-official bureaucracy holding various positions including Jwauijeong (Second State Councillor) and Ijo Panseo (Minister of Personnel). At the time of the 1592 Japanese invasion of Korea Ryu held the position of a provincial Dochechalsa. During the war Ryu was appointed Yeonguijeong (First State Councillor), and it was in this capacity that he helped direct the Joseon defences, being responsible for all Joseon military units and leaders, including Yi Sun-sin and Gwon Yul. After the war in 1598, Ryu was ousted from office by factional infighting, although he was later rehabilitated he refused to serve again in high office. The Jingbirok was written and compiled at this time by Ryu in his home village, now preserved in the Hahoe Folk Village, in today's Andong, North Gyeongsang Province. Aim of the Jingbirok Ryu Seong-ryong wrote the Jingbirok in order to prevent such an invasion from happening again, reflecting on the mistakes. In the preface he writes that during the conflict the Joseon state suffered \\"the loss of three capitals, and collapse everywhere\\" (‰∏âÈÉΩÂ§±ÂÆàÔºåÂÖ´ÊñπÁì¶Ëß£) reflecting on his own role in this he wrote that he was \\"not up to the task the nation entrusted, the ills that nation suffered was because of threats not grasped, this cannot be swept away, nor can death atone for this guilt\\" (ÁÑ°‰ººÂèóÂúãÈáç‰ªªÔºåÊñºÊµÅÈõ¢ÊùøËï©‰πãÈöõÔºåÂç±‰∏çÊåÅÔºåÈ°õ‰∏çÊâ∂ÔºåÁΩ™Ê≠ªÁÑ°Ëµ¶). Ryu placed the blame for the disaster suffered by Joseon on his own inadequate emphasis on national security, and was therefore resolved to properly document hard lessons dearly paid for, with the hope that following generations could avoid the mistakes that he had made. Although the Jingbirok includes details of Japanese atrocities, the focus of the Jingbirok is on Joseon failures, and Ryu is harsher in his assessment of his own side than he is of the enemy. Publication history The Jingbirok was written in Hanmun, therefore it was as equally accessible to the classically educated scholars of China, Japan and Vietnam as it was to classically educated Koreans. Structure The early form of the Jingbirok was completed by the time of the 37th year of King Seonjo's reign (1604) and consisted of sixteen scrolls and a coda: *Scrolls One and Two, are written in the form of an annal, being a chronology from 1586 to 1598 of events between the Joseon-Ming allies and the Japanese *Scrolls Three to Five, Roots (ËäπÊõùÈõÜ), background leading up to the invasion *Scrolls Six to Fourteen, Jin-Sa Records (Ëæ∞Â∑≥ÈåÑ), documents, orders and proclamations made by the author as prime ministerJin-Sa Records (Ëæ∞Â∑≥ÈåÑ) is named after the Earthly Branches used to denote years in the Sexagenary cycle, 1592 was Im-Jin (Â£¨Ëæ∞), 1593 Gye-Sa (Áô∏Â∑≥) *Scrolls Fifteen to Sixteen, Military transcripts (ËªçÈñÄË¨ÑÈåÑ), transcripts and the author's correspondence between 1595 and 1598 regarding the conflict *Coda, A Record of the Crisis (‰∫ÇÂæåÈõúË®ò), a record of events during the conflict By 1633 (11th year of King Injo's reign) this had evolved into a widely read two volume format known as the Seoaejip consisting of the Jingibrok and Ryu Seong- ryong's The Anthology of Seoae (). In 1647 the Jingibrok was issued as a single stand alone volume.

Because many first flight covers are essentially made as collectables they can be considered philatelic mail though others consider them to be postal history. Collecting first flight covers With the advent of air travel it wasn't long before airplanes were carrying the mail between distant points about the globe. In the United States and Germany airmail delivery was greeted with the same national enthusiasm and fanfare as was experienced with the first trips to the moon by US astronauts. Consequently, many people sent philatelic mail to themselves or friends that was carried aboard these flights in order to get a souvenir of the historic event. Covers carried aboard these flights are very popular and famous in some cases. The United States Post Office Department recognised the potential in providing first flight cover services to philatelists quite early on and in 1926 The Postal Bulletin carried extensive instructions for postmasters to ensure appropriate circulation took place and proper markings were added. Due to the small loads carried on early first flights are scarce, in demand and expensive. Following the First World War regular and special flights increased significantly to the extent that some modern flight are so commercial that thousands of covers are carried that no pilot could ever possibly sign. Thus collectors may find it difficult to cope with the quantity and diversity of first flight covers available to collect forcing them to specialise though some catalogues exist to help them such as the American Air Mail Catalogue. Early first flights Allahabad cover flown on the world's first aerial post in 1911 The first official postal delivery flight between two towns took place on February 18, 1911, during the United Provinces Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition in India. The young French pilot Henri Pequet carried mail from the exhibition location Allahabad to Naini, which is approx. 8 km away. It took Henri Pequet and his biplane \\"Sommer\\" about 13 minutes for the distance. The carried covers were provided with the large circular bright magenta postmark \\"First Aerial Post, U.P. Exhibition Allahabad 1911\\" and a few cards were autographed by the pilot. Pequet carried about 6,000 cards and letters on his journey. The United Kingdom's first and only official pre-World War I airmail flight took place in 1911 to mark the coronation of King George V flying mail between London (Hendon Aerodrome) and Windsor from September 9-15 carrying 926 pounds of mail. The following year a German Reichspost postal flight took place between Mannheim and Heidelberg on which first flight postcards were carried. An A.C. Roessler cover carried on the first scheduled U.S. Air Mail flight from Washington DC to New York City, May 15, 1918. The first scheduled U.S. Air Mail service began on May 15, 1918, and carried mail from Washington, D.C., to New York City. The type of airplane used was the U.S. Army Curtiss JN-4 \\"Jenny\\" biplanes flown by Army pilots with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia (Bustleton Field). Among those who were on hand for the departure of the first flight from Washington, D.C., were President Woodrow Wilson, U.S. Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Army Lt. George L. Boyle was selected to pilot aircraft #38262 on the first Northbound flight which, unfortunately, turned out to be a somewhat less than successful initial venture.

In addition to this dagger there was also the SS Honour Ring and SS Honour Sword. The awarding ceremony was conducted according to strict rules developed by Heinrich Himmler. Introduction and ceremony This honour weapon was introduced in December 1933, following analogous traditions in the army, air force and navy. The awarding ceremony took place on November 9, during the final introduction of the SS-men in the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde units and SS- Verf√ºgungstruppe (later known as the Waffen-SS) every year. The SS dagger was an official sidearm of the SS-dress uniform used by all full members of the SS. Production of these honour daggers was suspended in 1940. Appearance and design The design of the weapon was based on the 16th century Swiss dagger. The center of the wide and spear-pointed and 33 cm long blade has a very pronounced rib. Along the longer axis of the blade the slogan of the SS \\"Meine Ehre hei√üt Treue\\" (My honour is loyalty) was etched. The cross-guard and pommel were nickel-plated; the handle was black, inlaid with the silver NSDAP eagle and the SS symbol. The metal scabbard was covered in black gloss lacquer with silver-plated chape and mount. The SS dagger was introduced in 1933 and there are three distinctive versions available, depending on the year of manufacturing. * Early production: 1933-1935: Manufacturer's logo, black burnished ebony handle, hilt with Roman numerals (I-Munich, II-Dresden, III- Berlin); * Middle production: 1936-1938: Manufacturer's log with RZM code (double labeling), scabbard burnished or painted black, no Roman numerals on the guard; * Late Production: 1938-1942: Only with RZM code, scabbard painted black, eagle insignia on handle usually made of aluminium. Design for the \\"old fighters\\" On June 21, 1936, another variant of the dagger was introduced, which was awarded only to those SS officers and NCOs who had joined the SS before 1933. This dagger was identical to the 1933 model, but the scabbard was fitted with a chain made of rectangular plaques adorned with skulls and SS runes and an additional silver fitting with swastika motif. High-ranking SS leaders were presented a special dagger bearing the inscription \\"In warm camaraderie, H. Himmler\\". There were numerous variants of this dagger, which were handed to the recipients by Heinrich Himmler. These gift daggers were identical to the general-issue daggers, but were made of top quality materials and had gilded inscriptions. They were and still are considered a rarity due to the low number issued. Carrying method The SS honour daggers were usually worn with black SS uniform. According to Himmler, every SS member was obliged to use the dagger against anyone who had violated the honour of the SS or offended the honour or the family of the SS member. In November 1935, Himmler issued a decree stating that \\"every SS man has the right and duty to defend his honour with the weapon.\\" As of February 15, 1943 all officers of the Waffen-SS were entitled to wear this dagger also with the field-gray dress uniforms. For these occasions, the dagger was fitted with a tassle and sword knot made of aluminium lace, similar to one used by Wehrmacht officers.

He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins from 1969 to 1971, winning a national championship in each of his two seasons of play. He played two seasons professionally in Europe. After helping his high school team win two championships, Booker went to junior college at Long Beach City College. He was an all-conference player for the Vikings, and was later inducted into their Hall of Champions. He transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was a defensive specialist. Booker was a key reserve player in his first year of play. He moved to the guard position and became a starter as a senior, when he won his second national title with the Bruins, part of a run of seven consecutive championships by UCLA coach John Wooden. After college, Booker had a brief stint playing professionally, and also coached for a year in high school. He later became a realtor, and has also been a high school basketball official for over 30 years. Early life Booker grew up in Long Beach, California, and went to high school at Long Beach Polytechnic, where he won two California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) basketball championships. He was named to All-Southern California Board of Basketball all-star team as a center in 1966. He went to Long Beach City College for two years, and changed to playing forward. As a freshman, he broke into the starting lineup in late December, and was named the team's Most Promising Freshman after helping the Vikings to a conference title in 1967. Booker received honorable mention for the All- Metropolitan Conference team that year, before being named to the second team in 1968. He was inducted into the Vikings Hall of Champions in 2006. College career Booker's play earned him a full scholarship to play for Coach John Wooden at UCLA. While he was among the leading scorers on his high school and junior college teams, Booker was a defensive specialist with the Bruins, and helped them win their fourth and fifth out of seven consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles under Wooden. He sat out his initial season with UCLA in 1968‚Äì69, redshirting to preserve his remaining two years of eligibility. In his first year of play in 1969‚Äì70, he came off the bench to curb Geoff Petrie of Princeton and Paul Westphal of USC, who were going off against the Bruins. Petrie had scored 26 points in 28 minutes before Booker entered the game and held him to two free throws in the final 12 minutes. Booker played significant minutes late in the season and was a top reserve. Booker (right) was a defensive specialist for the Bruins As a senior in 1970‚Äì71, Booker was converted from forward to guard to replace the graduated John Vallely in the starting lineup. He was the lone new starter from the 1970 championship team, getting the nod over Andy Hill and Terry Schofield. At and , Booker was the team's best perimeter defender, and was called \\"a fine defensive and team player\\" by Wooden. The Bruins started the season 14‚Äì0 before losing 89‚Äì82 to Notre Dame. Booker began the game defending the Fighting Irish's Austin Carr, who finished the game with 46 points, but Wooden then used Schofield and Larry Hollyfield instead. The coaching staff had instructed Booker to overplay Carr and expect help on defense if Carr drove to the basket. However, Wooden absolved Booker, declaring that he never received the help from the inside that was expected. Though the loss ended a 19-game winning streak, UCLA proceeded to win their next 88 games, an NCAA record. On February 6, 1971, Booker helped key a 64‚Äì60 comeback victory for No. 2 UCLA over No. 1 USC. He had three steals in the final minutes as the Trojans were held to one point in the final 9:35, helping the Bruins rally from a 59‚Äì50 deficit. Booker also scored 14 points in the game, making seven of 10 field goals. For the season, Booker averaged 5.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game, as the Bruins finished 29‚Äì1 and captured their seventh national championship in eight seasons. Professional career After college, Booker was selected in the 14th round of the 1971 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns, as well as in the eighth round of the American Basketball Association draft by the Indiana Pacers. He tried out with Phoenix, surviving multiple cuts before being released in September 1971. In October, Booker was appointed as the head coach of Verbum Dei High School's basketball team, who were the defending CIF Southern Section 4-A Division champions. He coached the school for one season before quitting, leading them to a Del Rey League championship in 1972 as well as their second-straight CIF 4-A title; it was also the school's fourth- straight CIF championship at any level. In 1975 he went to Italy, and played professionally for two years in Europe. In 1988, Booker became a realtor in Long Beach with Coldwell Banker. , he has been a high school basketball official in Southern California for over 30 years. He was named Referee of the Year by the Orange County Sports Association in 2009, and he has officiated high school volleyball matches as well.

Not to be confused with the cancelled Ilyushin Il-106 of the nineties. The aircraft is intended to replace the Antonov An-22 and the Antonov An-124 heavy airlifter in Russia's Air Force service. Development The project was first presented under PAK TA designation with goal to develop a blended wing body, super-heavy transport plane being able to fly at supersonic speed while carrying up to 200 tons of cargo, and partially using renewable electric energy. 80 aircraft were planned to be built by 2024. In 2016, General Director of Ilyushin Company Sergei Velmozhkin reported the project was officially named Il-106, designation previously applied to a cancelled Ilyushin transport plane of the 1990s. In December 2018, Russian Defence Ministry announced the aircraft will actually be a deeply updated version of the cancelled Ilyushin Il-106 transport aircraft. According to Chief Designer of Ilyushin Company Nikolai Talikov, Il-106 is currently deep in development and will be updated with new avionics, engines, and other critical systems. The first flight is scheduled for 2024-2026. In May 2019, Ilyushin has finished R&D; works on the aircraft and contract for further development has been signed. On 5 November 2019, Russia's Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) released pictures of a wind tunnel Il-106 model, showing that, contrarily to what was previously thought, the design of the new cargo plane will not be based on the Il-106 project of the 1990s. On 26 March 2020, TsAGI released new pictures of a wind tunnel model, indicating that the researchers of the Institute had completed the first cycle of aerodynamic testing of the model.http://www.tsagi.ru/pressroom/news/4781/ The obtained results confirmed the calculated characteristics laid down at the stage of preliminary studies. If the PAK VTA design is approved by the Russian authorities, Ilyushin hopes to start the development of the first prototype in 2020, for a serial production before 2027.https://www.meta- defense.fr/2019/09/03/letude-prealable-du-programme-davions-de-transport- lourd-russe-pak-vta-sera-terminee-en-2020/ On 4 August 2020, Izvestia reported that the Russian Ministry of Defence approved the tactical and technical requirements of the PAK VTA. The PAK VTA project should be ready by December 2020, so that experimental design work (R&D;) on the project can begin in 2021.https://iz.ru/1043474/anton-lavrov-roman-kretcul/gruzovik-vysokogo- poleta-rossiia-gotovit-zamenu-124-i-22 Characteristics The Il-106 is expected to be able to lift up to 180 tons of cargo (60 tons more than the An-124). According to the approved requirements, the new military transport aircraft should be able to refuel in the air and carry at least 80 tons of cargo at a distance of 5000 kilometers. The length of the cargo compartment of the aircraft must be at least 27.5 meters, the width must be 8.8 meters, and the height 4.4 metershttps://iz.ru/1043474/anton-lavrov-roman- kretcul/gruzovik-vysokogo-poleta-rossiia-gotovit-zamenu-124-i-22.

It was first broadcast on 23 April 2015 on BBC Two. Written and directed by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, the episode starred Claire Skinner as the obsessive-compulsive and aspirational Angela, who is hosting a party for the 79th birthday of her mother Maggie, played by Elsie Kelly. Angela's husband Jim, played by Pemberton, is keen to play a prank on Pat, Angela's brother-in-law, who is a practical joker. Pat is played by Shearsmith, while Carol, a recovering alcoholic who is Pat's wife and Angela's sister, is played by Lorraine Ashbourne. The episode also features Eve Gordon as Katie, Angela and Jim's teenage daughter, and Christopher Whitlow as a paramedic seen at the beginning and end of the episode. Much of the episode's plot revolves around a practical joke with a fake cake that Jim has set up in an attempt to fool Pat. Moving the cake reveals the head of the person hiding under the table, but, in the meantime, the hidden character can hear conversations taking place nearby, unbeknownst to those who are not in on the joke. The episode plays on viewers' guesses as to what has led to the arrival‚Äîseen at the opening of the episode‚Äîof a paramedic. In particular, the person under the table is at risk of injury if candles burn down or someone puts a knife into the \\"cake\\". \\"Nana's Party\\" was the first episode of Inside No. 9 to be written, but it was shelved when BBC executives instead suggested that it worked as the first episode of a sitcom. Pemberton and Shearsmith revisited and modified the script during the writing process for Inside No. 9 second series. The writers aimed for a feeling of suburban darkness reminiscent of the work of the playwright Alan Ayckbourn, while commentators compared the episode to the work of the playwright and screenwriter Mike Leigh, particularly the play Abigail's Party. The story addresses themes including alcoholism, extramarital affairs, aging and social class. Television critics responded positively to \\"Nana's Party\\", which was praised as a typically-strong instalment of Inside No. 9. Particular praise was directed towards the writing and performances, especially Skinner's performance as Angela, Ashbourne's performance as Carol and Shearsmith's performance as Pat. Production Reece Shearsmith (pictured in 2003) co-wrote, co-directed and starred in the episode with Steve Pemberton. Writing \\"Nana's Party\\" was the first episode of Inside No. 9 to be written by the programme's creators Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 0:45. BBC producers felt the episode worked as the opening episode of a sitcom, but Pemberton and Shearsmith were not happy to develop the idea into its own series, given the events of the plot. As such, the script was shelved, and revisited during planning for Inside No. 9 second series.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 1:10. A number of changes were made from the original script when the concept was revisited. For example, a paramedic was added to the opening scene in order to add a sense of danger and foreboding, and the character Angela's \\"borderline OCD\\" was accentuated.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 4:40. Shearsmith said that the episode's focus on a grandmother's birthday party felt \\"domestic\\" and \\"homely\\". Pemberton, too, called it a \\"domestic\\" story, describing it as playing upon the classic British plot device of a family party going wrong. Shearsmith suggested that the pleasant house did give the episode the feel of a sitcom, but said that the story went somewhere \\"darker\\" than a typical sitcom would. With \\"Nana's Party\\", the writers wanted to produce something \\"dark\\" and \\"suburban\\", with Pemberton citing the playwright Alan Ayckbourn as an influence. Indeed, at the time the episode was written, Shearsmith was starring in an adaptation of Ayckbourn's play Absent Friends.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 2:20. The writers intended to play off the idea of a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie‚Äîon whose birthday the episode would be set‚Äîabsent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that her head was in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 3:00. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake;Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 18:20. they noted that the prop cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 19:20. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers upped the drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing in a way they do not in the final version.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 24:20. Casting and characters Lorraine Ashbourne (pictured in 2013) played Carol, Angela's sister. As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. \\"Nana's Party\\" featured Claire Skinner as Angela, who is hosting a party. Pemberton and Shearsmith lived close to Skinner, but they had not properly met. She was one of several members of the cast of the film Life Is Sweet (others being Alison Steadman and Jane Horrocks) who have starred in Inside No. 9.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 3:40. Skinner enjoyed the \\"funny\\" script and her \\"nice\\" character. Eve Gordon (trained at the Nottingham Television WorkshopPemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 14:15.) starred as Angela's daughter Katie, and Pemberton starred as Angela's husband Jim. Pemberton and Shearsmith suggested that Pemberton's costume made him look like Mr Chow Mein, a Benny Hill character.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 20:20. Elsie Kelly played Angela's mother Maggie, on whose birthday the episode is set. The part was not written with anyone in mind, though Pemberton already knew Kelly well from their time together on the sitcom Benidorm.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 7:20. Lorraine Ashbourne played Angela's sister Carol, and Pat, Carol's husband, was played by Shearsmith. Carol was Pemberton's favourite character in the whole series; Shearsmith worried that an actor may not portray the character as they had hoped, but was very happy with Ashbourne's performance.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 10:40. Ashbourne said she was \\"thrilled\\" to be working with Pemberton and Shearsmith, for whom she had great admiration. She described the character of Carol as \\"hilarious\\", characterising her as \\"sexually frustrated\\" and \\"sad\\". To reflect Carol's alcoholism, Ashbourne swilled whiskey around her mouth before filming.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 16:40. Shearsmith wore a red wig to play Pat, something he had never done before. His skin-tone needed to be changed to match the hair, necessitating a white spray on his face every morning.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 18:30. In order not to give the impression that Pat was a thief or murderer (rather than simply a practical joker), Shearsmith was directed to chuckle while Pat set up his jokes.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 17:30. Christopher Whitlow plays a paramedic seen at the beginning and end of the episode. The scene featuring the paramedic at the end of the episode was longer in the final cut than had been initially intended in order to show more of the character's actions.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 26:30. Filming and direction The second series of Inside No. 9 was filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015. \\"Nana's Party\\" was filmed in January,Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 25:20. and was the final episode of the second series to be filmed.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 11:20. The writers saw a number of houses before selecting the one used in the episode; they wanted an open plan home to allow for easy movement between rooms. The one chosen was close to Twickenham Studios.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 9:30. A \\"deckhouse\\" was added to the house's garden; despite there already being two sheds, neither would have been visible on-screen. A new one was thus added. The executive producer Adam Tandy suggested that deckhouse would be preferable to shed, as the latter term suggested the site of something awful.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 13:40. Scenes in a bedroom used the room mostly as the production team found it. The room featured a number of books not seen on-screen, which reminded Shearsmith of a script (in the end not used for Inside No. 9 second series) of an episode set in a library.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 15:20. The front room had a buffet, including a prawn ring; by the third day of filming, this had begun to smell, and needed to be removed.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 27:40. Pemberton and Shearsmith, in addition to writing and starring in \\"Nana's Party\\", directed the episode. This was the second episode they jointly directed in the second series after \\"Cold Comfort\\", their directorial debut. The pair did not know, while writing for the series, which episodes they would be directing, meaning that their writing was unlikely to be influenced by the knowledge. Pemberton and Shearsmith had always intended to try directing, and the second series of Inside No. 9 offered them the opportunity. David Kerr, who had directed all of the episodes in the first series, was unable to return for the second. Guillem Morales and Dan Zeff each took on directorial duties for two episodes, while Pemberton and Shearsmith decided to direct the remaining two. Shearsmith said in an interview that the pair had considered directing episodes in which they did not appear much, but scheduling concerns left them with \\"Cold Comfort\\" and \\"Nana's Party\\"; both episodes feature the writers quite heavily. \\"Nana's Party\\" represented a directorial challenge insofar as Pemberton and Shearsmith were both on-screen for a relatively large amount of the episode. The pair took turns off-camera; on one day, Shearsmith acted and Pemberton watched, and the next day, the two switched; they were, however, tired, not least because it was the final episode of the series filmed. \\"Nana's Party\\" required more direction than \\"Cold Comfort\\", due in part to the larger number of actors.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 12:00. Pemberton and Shearsmith leaned strongly on Stephan Pehrsson, their cinematographer. While Pemberton and Shearsmith handled staging, Pehrsson handled cinematography.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 12:20. Plot A paramedic is let into a house to the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat‚Äîa practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)‚Äîby hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat‚Äîthe latter wearing a wolf mask‚Äîarrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge‚Äîsomething Jim had asked Angela to prevent‚Äîand secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake‚Äîunder which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated. Katie shows Maggie her tablet as the pair sit in the former's room. A visibly-drunk Carol enters and talks to Katie about the importance of having fun. Katie wants to finish her homework, but assures Carol that she would make a good mother. Downstairs, Jim persuades Angela to take up position under the table as Pat replaces the soap in the toilet. Pat joins Jim next to the table and returns a VHS; it becomes clear that Jim's apparent love for Countdown is actually a cover for his pornography habit, and Jim tries to steer the conversation away from the topic, worried that Angela will hear. Carol enters and puts on music. Pat sees Carol's sunscreen, and prepares her a drink of \\"Adam's ale\\". Carol aggressively flirts with Jim, who does not reciprocate. When Pat hands Carol water, she throws it in his face and he leaves. Carol confronts Jim about promises he made to her, and how this house should be hers, not Angela's. Jim remains terrified that Angela can hear the conversation. Katie and Maggie enter. Maggie talks about Pat's \\"frozen willies\\"‚Äînovelty ice cubes‚Äîas a distressed Jim makes her a drink, and Carol dances with the uninterested Katie. Jim pulls Carol away from Katie, but Carol hits him; when Carol talks to Katie about becoming her stepmother, Jim shouts at her. Pat stops him, and, after Carol storms out, tells Jim that \\"he knows\\". Katie is distressed, and interrogates Jim as Maggie plunges a knife into the cake. Jim panics, believing Angela is still under the table, but Angela enters from the kitchen, and reveals that she left to buy a real cake‚Äîthe story that Jim had told to cover her apparent absence. Katie wants to talk to her mother, but chaos ensues when Maggie chokes on an ice cube, which Pat reveals contains a fake spider. Carol enters, her face blackened by Pat's fake soap, and Pat, reaching for his charging phone to call the emergency services, receives an electric shock, his hands wet from the ice bucket. Angela performs the Heimlich manoeuver on her mother; Carol kneels by Pat and shouts for help. The new cake is pushed into Jim's face by Katie, who then answers the door. The paramedic enters, then begins a striptease for Maggie to the Casualty theme. His performance, it is revealed, was Pat's present to Maggie. Later, Jim talks to an oblivious Maggie. He sees Angela and Katie come down the stairs with bags. In silence, he watches them leave as Maggie tells him the joke from Pat's birthday card. Analysis Plotlines following a birthday party in disarray are common, particularly in plays, and an episode with a similar theme was also included in the first series of Inside No. 9. \\"Nana's Party\\" revolves around the relatively mundane problems of alcoholism, affairs and aging. Class is another theme, with Angela, Jim and Katie representing a typical middle class family, while Maggie, Carol and Pat are more working class. David Chater, writing for The Times, said that \\"Nana's Party\\" was like \\"a more twisted version\\" of Abigail's Party, with several critics likening the episode to a Mike Leigh drama. Critics also saw the influence of Ayckbourn's work. The episode's action revolves around the practical joke involving the cake and, in particular, viewers' attempts to guess what has caused injury, as they know that the paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are \\"ticking time-bomb[s]\\". Angela is the central character, and is similar to a more anxious version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but aspirational, fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as \\"appalling\\", \\"tiresome\\", an \\"irritating tit\\" and \\"an insufferable booby\\". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: \\"Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and caring for a wife whose love for him has long gone.\\" Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 21:30.

As a \\"Middle England suburban\\" comedy, \\"Nana's Party\\" is \\"all about the depths and heartaches lurking beneath apparently happy families\\". As the story progresses, the characters subvert expectations, with the irritating Pat revealed as a caring husband and the alcoholic Carol revealed as recovering from an unsuccessful affair. Pemberton and Shearsmith characterised the episode's ending as \\"downbeat\\" and lacking a twist, noting that \\"Nana's Party\\" is the only episode of the first two series of Inside No. 9 in which no character dies.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 28:10. Reception Critics responded positively to \\"Nana's Party\\", with Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times calling it \\"another cracker\\", Chater characterising it as another \\"bullseye\\", and Julia Raeside and John Dugdale, writing in The Sunday Times, describing it as \\"another perfectly judged high-wire walk: comedy and tragedy balanced evenly and artfully at all times\\". Bennion called it \\"a tightly wound and hugely impressive half hour\\", and the freelance journalist Dan Owen called it \\"another great instalment\\" that \\"really worked\\" on its own terms. The episode's writing was praised. For Bennion, the writers displayed their intellect, but he noted that Skinner got \\"the lion's share of the good lines\\". He felt the ending was \\"as affecting as it is well-earned\\". Raeside, in the course of a review of the whole series for theguardian.com, claimed that one of the writers' strengths is \\"pulling at the loose threads of suburban life to reveal the worst of humanity just under the soft furnishings\\", and that, in \\"Nana's Party\\", despite the viewers' assumption that there would be a \\"gory\\" conclusion, the \\"tragedy was an altogether more gruesome punctuation to the story as Pemberton's face betrayed the total emotional collapse going on within\\". Jack Seale, also writing for theguardian.com, claimed that the script was able to move \\"effortlessly from funny to dark to desperately sad\\". Phoebe-Jane Boyd, in a review of the episode for the entertainment website Den of Geek, wrote that the tension in \\"Nana's Party\\" was \\"cranked up fantastically\\", as the story's genre, and viewer's expectations, shift. Owen felt that the writing and cast were able to save what could have been a predictable episode, picking out Skinner as particularly compelling. Bennion also praised the cast, claiming that Skinner, Ashbourne and Kelly were strong, but that Shearsmith gave the best performance. Dessau, too, called the cast \\"great\\", and felt that Shearsmith played his part \\"to perfection\\".

In the real projective plane a von Staudt conic is a conic section in the usual sense. In more general projective planes this is not always the case. Karl Georg Christian von Staudt introduced this definition in Geometrie der Lage (1847) as part of his attempt to remove all metrical concepts from projective geometry. Polarities A polarity, , of a projective plane, , is an involutory (i.e., of order two) bijection between the points and the lines of that preserves the incidence relation. Thus, a polarity relates a point with a line and, following Gergonne, is called the polar of and the pole of . An absolute point (line) of a polarity is one which is incident with its polar (pole).Coxeter and several other authors use the term self-conjugate instead of absolute. A polarity may or may not have absolute points. A polarity with absolute points is called a hyperbolic polarity and one without absolute points is called an elliptic polarity. In the complex projective plane all polarities are hyperbolic but in the real projective plane only some are. A classification of polarities over arbitrary fields follows from the classification of sesquilinear forms given by Birkhoff and von Neumann. Orthogonal polarities, corresponding to symmetric bilinear forms, are also called ordinary polarities and the locus of absolute points forms a non-degenerate conic (set of points whose coordinates satisfy an irreducible homogeneous quadratic equation) if the field does not have characteristic two. In characteristic two the orthogonal polarities are called pseudopolarities and in a plane the absolute points form a line. Finite projective planes If is a polarity of a finite projective plane (which need not be desarguesian), , of order then the number of its absolute points (or absolute lines), is given by: : , where is a non- negative integer. Since is an integer, if is not a square, and in this case, is called an orthogonal polarity. R. Baer has shown that if is odd, the absolute points of an orthogonal polarity form an oval (that is, points, no three collinear), while if is even, the absolute points lie on a non-absolute line. In summary, von Staudt conics are not ovals in finite projective planes (desarguesian or not) of even order. Relation to other types of conics In a pappian plane (i.e., a projective plane coordinatized by a field), if the field does not have characteristic two, a von Staudt conic is equivalent to a Steiner conic. However, R. Artzy has shown that these two definitions of conics can produce non-isomorphic objects in (infinite) Moufang planes.

The high-profile rock-throwing case received significant media attention. Incident Sharon Budd, 53, a schoolteacher from Uniontown, Ohio, was a passenger in a car being driven east on I-80 in Pennsylvania by her daughter on July 10, 2014, when a rock smashed through the windshield of her car, hitting her directly in the face. Budd suffered catastrophic injuries, including blinding of one eye. Budd's husband, Randy Budd, who was sitting in the back seat while the couple's daughter, Kaylee, drove, testified that when the rock hit the car it sounded like \\"an explosion.\\" Matthew Baker, of Plainville, Massachusetts, who was driving a tractor-trailer truck, told police that a rock thrown from the overpass had hit his truck just before the rock struck the car in which Budd was riding. Keefer McGee (age 17); Tyler Porter (17); and brothers Dylan (17) and Brett (18) Lahr, were reportedly on a \\"troublemaking spree\\" late on July 10, 2014, when they began throwing rocks from an overpass at cars moving along I-80. McGee told police that the group had specifically planned to smash mailboxes with baseball bats and throw rocks at parked cars. They had stolen steaks from a grocery store, driven through a field of corn (damaging the crop), broken the windows of a house with a baseball bat, and stopped at a farm to pick up rocks to throw, before proceeding to the highway overpass. Dylan Lahr was identified as the person who threw the rock that hit the Budds' car. McGee was arraigned on charges of \\"aggravated assault, criminal trespass, propulsion of missiles into an occupied vehicle or onto a roadway, agricultural vandalism and recklessly endangering,\\" on August 5, 2014. All four were charged with \\"aggravated assault, conspiracy, recklessly endangering, propelling missiles into vehicle, agricultural vandalism and possession of instruments of crime.\\" According to McGee, after hitting the car with the rock, the boys cheered. McGee told the court that \\"We were all laughing thinking it was funny. We laughed, tossed out rocks, and drove home.\\" They drove to the Lahrs' house where they began to watch a movie, but got back into the car and returned to the scene of the crime twice that night. On one of those trips, police noted the license plate number. Arraignment and trial Motions in the case were set to be heard April 30, 2015. The three younger boys moved to have their cases moved to juvenile court. On April 30, 2015, Judge Michael Sholley ruled the 3 will be tried as adults, with the possibility of being sentenced for up to 25 years. Tyler Porter, 17 at the time of the incident, pled no contest to a charge of \\"conspiracy to commit aggravated assault.\\" An editorial in the Sunbury, Pennsylvania, newspaper has objected to the decision of Judge Michael Sholley to bar the victim and the public from his courtroom during a pre-trial hearing about permissible evidence scheduled for late April 2015, calling the decision inimical to an \\"open and transparent\\" judicial process. Defense attorneys have challenged the prosecution's claim that the rock was a \\"deadly weapon\\", claiming that it was merely a \\"delinquent act\\" unless the prosecution could demonstrate intent to produce death or serious bodily injury. The 19-year-old Brett Lahr was sentenced to a prison sentence of between 18 months to 24 months. Tyler Porter, Dylan Lahr and Keefer McGee were sentenced to serve 22 months to 10 years, 54 months to 24 years and months to 23 months, respectively. Lahr was sentenced to an additional year in prison for violating his parole. Suicide of Randy Budd On August 6, 2016, Randy Budd died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head as a result of not being able to cope with his wife's disability. After the Interstate 80 rock throwing incident severely injured Sharon Budd, Randy advocated for the Ohio Department of Transportation to install protective fencing on bridge overpasses.

She was the first female law graduate from UADY, the first woman appointed to public office in Yucat√°n. She served as the first Director of the Civil Registry, the first President of the Electoral Institute of the State and the first President of the Judiciary. She was a feminist, writing her dissertation on the legality of denying women the vote and when appointed to run the Civil Registry, she eliminated discriminatory texts from the marriage ceremony. Biography Antonia Georgina Alemania Jim√©nez Trava was born 25 February 1917 to Julio Jim√©nez Rivero and Pastora Trava Castilla in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico. She was affectionately called \\"Toto\\". Her mother was a teacher at the Instituto Literario de Ni√±as (ILN) (Literary Institute for Girls) run by Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez and Jim√©nez studied with one of Cetina's students, Consuelo Zavala at her Colegio de Consuelo Zavala. In 1937, Jim√©nez became the first woman in Yucat√°n to sign as a witness for a civil wedding. In July, 1939, she became the first woman in Yucat√°n to graduate with a law degree from Universidad Aut√≥noma de Yucat√°n. Her thesis was entitled \\"Women and Political and Civil Rights\\" examined inequality in society between genders and argued that the vote could not be denied women because the law did not distinguish between men and women politically. In July 1941 she began working at the Labor Justice Group as Secretary of the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration and by 1964 had become the Board's president, a position she held until 1970. Her appointment in 1941 was the first appointment of a woman to a public office. She was a Professor at the Faculty of Law from 1948-1984, taught at the High School of the University of Yucat√°n from 1965-1971, and gave lectures at the Escuela Normal Rodolfo Men√©ndez de la Pe√±a (Teachers College of Rodolfo Men√©ndez de la Pe√±a) in M√©rida. She was appointed by Governor Agust√≠n Franco Aguilar to serve as Director of the Civil Registry of the State the first state director to serve in the office. She held that position from 1958-1964 having jurisdiction over marriage licensing. As director, Jim√©nez struck from the wording of the marriage ceremony, the Epistle of Melchor Ocampo. She was honored for her attempts to legally recognize gender equality by the magazine \\"La Mujer de Hoy\\" a decade later. Jim√©nez said that she won $1000 pesos from the magazine for submitting the changed wording, which she changed because it made women slaves to men. From 1964-1970 she served as president of the Regional Minimum Wage Commission and was the chair of the State Electoral Commission from 1970 to 1971. She was the first president of the Electoral Institute in the state of Yucat√°n. In January 1972, she became a Judge of the Superior Court of the State of Yucat√°n and served in that capacity until 1976. Simultaneously to being appointed judge, she was named as president of the Superior Court and became first woman in Mexico to serve as the head of a Superior Court. From 1986-1988, she directed the Training Institute of the Judiciary for Yucat√°n. Jim√©nez died 16 March, 2011 in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico. Honors *\\"Master Ignacio I.

R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, strictly a continent on the planet of Arda but widely taken to mean the physical world, and E√§, all of creation, as well as all of his writings about it. Arda was created as a flat world, incorporating a Western continent, Aman, which became the home of the godlike Valar, as well as Middle-earth. At the end of the First Age, the Western part of Middle-earth, Beleriand, was drowned in the War of Wrath. In the Second Age, a large island, N√∫menor, was created in the Great Sea, Belegaer, between Aman and Middle-earth; it was destroyed in a cataclysm at the end of the Second Age, in which Arda was remade as a spherical world, and Aman was removed so that Men could not reach it. In The Lord of the Rings, Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age is described as having free peoples, namely Men, Hobbits and Dwarves, in the West, opposed to peoples under the control of the Dark Lord Sauron in the East. Some commentators have seen this as implying a moral geography of Middle-earth.  Cosmology  The Downfall of N√∫menor and the Changing of the World. The outlines of the continents are purely schematic. Tolkien's Middle-earth was part of his created world of Arda. It was a flat world surrounded by ocean. It included the Undying Lands of Aman and Eress√´a, which were all part of the wider creation, E√§. Aman and Middle-earth were separated from each other by the Great Sea Belegaer, analogous to the Atlantic Ocean. The western continent, Aman, was the home of the Valar, and the Elves called the Eldar.The Silmarillion, p. 31 Initially, the western part of Middle-earth was the subcontinent Beleriand; it was engulfed by the ocean at the end of the First Age. After the destruction of N√∫menor at the end of the Second Age, Arda was remade as a round world, and the Undying Lands were removed from Arda so that Men could not reach them. The Elves could go there only by the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the sphere of the earth. Tolkien then equated Arda, consisting of both Middle-earth's planet and the heavenly Aman, with the Solar System, the Sun and Moon being celestial objects in their own right, no longer orbiting the Earth.  Physical geography  Sketch map of the north-west of Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age The events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings take place in the north-west of the continent of Middle-earth. Both quests begin in The Shire, travel east through the wilds of Eriador to Rivendell and then across the Misty Mountains, involve further travels in the lands of Rhovanion or Wilderland to the east of those mountains, and return home to The Shire. Beleriand, Lindon The extreme west of Middle-earth in the First Age was Beleriand. It was largely destroyed in the cataclysm of the War of Wrath, leaving only a remnant coastal plain, Lindon, just to the west of the Ered Luin (also called Ered Lindon or Blue Mountains). The cataclysm divided Ered Luin and Lindon by the newly-created Gulf of Lune; the northern part was Forlindon, the southern Harlindon. Eriador In the northwest of Middle- earth, Eriador was the region between the Ered Luin and the Misty Mountains. In the Second Age, the northern kingdom of Arnor founded by Elendil occupied much of the region. After its collapse, much of Eriador became wild. In the Third Age, a small part of the region was occupied by hobbits to form the Shire. To the northwest lay Lake Evendim, once called Nenuial by the Elves. A remnant of the ancient forest of Eriador survived throughout the Third Age just to the east of the Shire as the Old Forest, the domain of Tom Bombadil.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 6 \\"The Old Forest\\" Northeast of there is Bree, the only place where hobbits and Men live in the same villages. Further east from there is the hill of Weathertop, the hill with the ancient fortress of Amon Sul, and then Rivendell, the home of Elrond. South from there is the ancient land of Hollin, once the elvish land of Eregion where the Rings of Power were forged. At the Grey Havens (Mithlond), on the Gulf of Lune, Cirdan built the ships in which the Elves departed from Middle- earth to Valinor.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 9 \\"The Grey Havens\\", and Appendix B Misty Mountains The Misty Mountains were thrown up by the Dark Lord Melkor in the First Age to impede Orom√´, one of the Valar who often rode across Middle-earth hunting.The Silmarillion, ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" The Dwarf-realm of Moria was built in the First Age beneath the midpoint of the mountain range. The two major passes across the mountains were the High Pass or Pass of Imladris near Rivendell, with a higher and a lower route,Unfinished Tales, pp. 271, 281The Annotated Hobbit, p. 105 and the all-year Redhorn Pass further south near Moria.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2 ch. 3 Rhovanion East of the Misty Mountains, Anduin or the Great River flows southwards, with the forest of Mirkwood to its east. On its west bank opposite the southern end of Mirkwood is the elvish land of Lothlorien. Further south, backing on to the Misty Mountains, lies the forest of Fangorn, home of the tree-giants, the ents. In a valley at the southern end of the Misty Mountains is Isengard, home to the wizard Saruman. Lands to the South Sketch map of Gondor in the Third Age, bordered by Rohan and Mordor Just to the South of both Fangorn and Isengard is the wide grassy land of the Riders of Rohan, who provide cavalry to its southerly neighbour, Gondor. The River Anduin passes the hills of Emyn Muil and the enormous rock statues of the Argonath, flows through the dangerous rapids of Sarn Gebir, and over the Falls of Rauros into Gondor. Gondor's border with Rohan is the Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains, which run east-west from the sea to a point near the Anduin; at that point is Gondor's capital city, Minas Tirith. Across the river to the East is the land of Mordor. It is bordered to the north by the Ered Lithui, the Ash Mountains; to the west by the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow. Between those two ranges, at Mordor's northwest tip, are the Black Gates of the Morannon. In the angle between the two ranges is the volcanic Plateau of Gorgoroth, with the tall volcano of Orodruin or Mount Doom, where the Dark Lord Sauron forged the One Ring, at its centre. To the mountain's east is Sauron's Dark Tower, Barad- dur. To the south of Gondor and Mordor lie Harad and Khand. Lands to the East To the East of Rhovanion and to the North of Mordor lies the Sea of Rh√ªn, home to the Easterlings. North of that lie the Iron Hills of Dain's dwarves; between those and Mirkwood is Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, once home to Smaug the dragon, and afterwards to Thorin's dwarves. The large lands to the east of Rh√ªn and to the south and east of Harad are not described in the stories, which take place in the North-western part of Middle-earth.  Political geography  Sketch map of the Shire, with political division into four Farthings At the end of the Third Age, much of the northwest of Middle- earth is wild, with traces here and there of ruined cities and fortresses from earlier civilisations among the mountains, rivers, forests, hills, plains and marshes. The major nations that appear in The Lord of the Rings are Rohan and Gondor on the side of the Free Peoples, and Mordor and its ally Harad on the side of the Dark Lord. Gondor, once extremely powerful, is by that time much reduced in its reach, and has lost control of Ithilien (bordering Mordor) and South Gondor (bordering Harad). The Easterlings from the region of Rh√ªn, barely described, contribute a substantial army to Mordor's side. Forgotten by most of the rest of the world is the Shire, a small region in the northwest of Middle-earth inhabited by hobbits amidst the abandoned lands of Eriador.  Moral geography  alt=Tolkien's moral geography of Middle-earth, good in the west, evil in the east, simple in the north, sophisticated in the south. The Shire is in the northwest (simple/good) quadrant, Gondor in the southwest, and Mordor in the southeast. With his \\"Southrons\\" from Harad, Tolkien had ‚Äì in the view of John Magoun, writing in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia ‚Äì constructed a \\"fully expressed moral geography\\", from the hobbits' home in the Northwest, evil in the East, and \\"imperial sophistication and decadence\\" in the South. Magoun explains that Gondor is both virtuous, being West, and has problems, being South; Mordor in the Southeast is hellish, while Harad in the extreme South \\"regresses into hot savagery\\". Other scholars such as Walter Scheps and Isabel G. MacCaffrey have noted Middle-earth's \\"spatial cum moral dimensions\\", though not identically with Magoun's interpretation. In their view, North and West are generally good, South and East evil. That places the Shire and the elves' Grey Havens in the Northwest as certainly good, and Mordor in the Southeast as certainly Evil; Gondor in the Southwest is in their view morally ambivalent, matching the characters of both Boromir and Denethor. They observe further that the Shire's four quadrants or \\"Farthings\\" serve as a \\"microcosm\\" of the moral geography of Middle-earth as a whole: thus, the evil Black Riders appear first in the Eastfarthing, while the once good but corrupted Saruman's men arrive in the Southfarthing. Origins Some features of Middle-earth can be traced to literary sources or real-world places. The Misty Mountains derive from the Poetic Edda, where the protagonist in the Sk√≠rnism√°l notes that his quest will involve misty mountains peopled with orcs and giants, while the character of the mountains were partly inspired by Tolkien's travels in the Swiss Alps in 1911.Letters, #306 Mirkwood is based on Myrkvi√∞r, the romantic vision of the dark forests of the North. N√∫menor echoes the mythical Atlantis described by Plato.Letters, ##131, 154, 156, 227.

Retrieved 2016-12-09. At the 2015 Edgar Awards, while accepting the award for Best Novel for Mr. Mercedes, King announced that the novel's antagonist, Brady Hartsfield, would be making a return in this book. The novel was released on June 7, 2016. Plot Retired detective Bill Hodges, who now with his sidekick Holly runs the private investigation agency Finders Keepers, is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Given only months to live, he finds himself drawn into a recent spree of suicides. All the dead are connected by a common thread: each of them has, in the past, been in contact with mass murderer Brady Hartsfield, the notorious Mr. Mercedes who, six years ago, plotted a follow up mass murder of blowing up a rock concert venue packed with teenagers. Hodges and Holly thwarted Brady's plans and left the killer in a vegetative state from which he never regained consciousness. However, many of the staff in the hospital where Brady now resides believe that he is recovering at an impossible rate, and that he may be faking his injuries to avoid facing charges for his crimes. Meanwhile, all those who have gotten too close to proving this suspicion seem to have committed suicide. After his head injury, Brady found himself gaining new abilities, including the power to move small objects with his mind and the ability to enter the bodies of certain people susceptible to his mental domination. Still confined to his hospital bed, Brady has used his power to finish his murderous work by creating a hypnotic video game app that heightens the user's susceptibility. Once the users are in Brady's control, he uses the app to dominate their minds and persuade them to commit suicide. The targets are the very teenagers who escaped death when Brady's plan to destroy the concert venue failed. Brady's ultimate goal, however, is to lure Hodges into the game and exact revenge. Brady uses the bodies of both a corrupt neurosurgeon and a hospital librarian as puppets and red herrings to do his dirty work and to misdirect the police while he makes his final move to destroy Hodges, all the while unaware that Hodges is already racing the clock against his own death. Reception The book received generally positive reviews.

Instrumentation The work was originally scored for five winds and five strings: flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. In February 1936, Britten revised the score for a small chamber orchestra with two horns and a small string section, which was only performed once during his lifetime.

The movements are headed: # Poco presto ed agitato # Variations, andante lento # Tarantella The first movement is in sonata form.

However, the current government has made no progress on it. Minister for National Heritage and Integration Federal Minister for National Heritage and Integration, Shahzada Jamal Nazir made efforts for promotion of Pakistani literature and welfare of writer's community. Inquiry sent to Federal Investigation Agency to Probe Corruption: Central Board of Film Censors (CBFC) Irregularities with respect to:- i) Files of movie censored are not complete in all respects and important documents are missing. ii) Additional fee of motion pictures which was to be deposited in the national treasury was not deposited as per prescribed rules. iii) Importers were in total control of this regulatory body and Indian Motion Pictures detrimental to the interest of Pakistan like AIK THA TIGER and AGENT VINOD were allowed in the era of the Ex-Chairman for which FIA inquiries in Islamabad and Lahore circles are still underway. Despite two (2) reminders to the parent Ministry by the incumbent administration, a financial audit has not been commenced. It is alleged that certification of Foreign films was done against money under the table and for English films the going rate was at the times of the former chairman CBFC. iv) 164 cards were issued to individuals who were so-called (coordinators) of the CBFC for facilitating their free entry into cinema houses across the country. This was a blatant disregard to rules as no such post exists. v) Members made to CBFC to facilitate approval of films on a fast track basis. Proposed Policy and Achievements for Central Board of Film Censors #Encouraged Local Industry: On the directions of the Minister Mr. Jamal Nazir, Pakistani film producers were directed to be given a level playing field to compete with imported films in an effort to reinvigorate the film industry of Pakistan. #Highest Revenues in 5 years: Over 1 million was deposited in the national treasury in Federal Government receipts during the brief time Shahzada Jamal Nazir was the Minister. It was the highest revenue collection in the past 5 years. #MoFA included in CBFC: An official member of the Censor Board was added from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the CBFC is also responsible for censoring and regulating films of foreign missions located in Pakistan. #Zero Tolerance on Corruption: As per Shahzada Jamal Nazir's directive a stringent policy was adopted by the incumbent Administration for zero tolerance on corruption and strict adherence to the rules. FIA was engaged to investigate complaints of corruption over last five years. Shahzada Jamal Nazir With Saudi Ambassador Cultural Heritage Diorama on Saudi Arabia at Lok Virsa Heritage Museum, Islamabad On the directions of Federal Minister Shahzada Jamal Nazir, the Ministry of National Heritage & Integration was pleased to establish a Cultural Heritage Diorama on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the Lok Virsa museum, Islamabad.

It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715‚Äì1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the coasts of the Maltese Islands. Most of the battery was destroyed over time, but the blockhouse still exists. It is now open to the public as the Tunnara Museum, a museum about tuna fishing. History Westreme Battery was built between 1715 and 1716 as part of the Order of Saint John's first building program of coastal fortifications. The battery was probably named after a knight of the same name. No records with details about its construction are known. The battery was one of two batteries guarding Mellieƒßa Bay, the other one being the now-demolished Fedeau Battery. The area was further defended by Mellieƒßa Redoubt at the centre of the bay, but this no longer exists. Ramon Perellos on the battery The battery consisted of a semi-circular gun platform, with its eastern face having a parapet with five embrasures. There was no parapet around the rest of the platform. This arrangement was similar to the one at the nearby Mistra Battery, but on a larger scale. The battery also had a single blockhouse, placed diagonally along the land front so that its two outer faces functioned as a redan, similar to Saint Mary's Battery. The blockhouse, which was pierced with musketry loopholes, was one of the largest blockhouses in any of the coastal batteries in Malta. These features put together made the battery unique, unlike any other in the Maltese islands. The battery with World War II additions In 1748, Grand Master Pinto inaugurated the tunnara, a traditional Maltese tuna fishing method, at Westreme Battery. Over the years, the battery's military importance was diminished, and it was used as a store for fishing nets and other equipment used in the tunnara. During the French invasion of Malta of 1798, Westreme Battery was the first battery to be overrun by the invading forces. In World War II, the blockhouse was converted into a beach post. Rectangular machine gun portholes were cut into the corners of the building. Another concrete beach post and a searchlight emplacement were also built near the blockhouse. After the war, the blockhouse was again used in the tunnara. Present day Information post at the entrance Today, the semi-circular gun platform and the parapet of the battery no longer exist, although some parts of the rock hewn base can still be seen. The blockhouse is still intact, and is open to the public as the Tunnara Museum. Its exhibits relate mainly to Maltese traditional tuna fishing. The blockhouse was restored in 2007 and 2008. Further restoration works began in 2015. A full renovation project was announced in October 2019, which will take place with a majority of EU funds allocation.

It is a National Natural Landmark. Description Cayler Prairie is dominated by big bluestem grass. Prairie forbs include (in spring) golden alexander and Lambert's crazyweed; (in summer) sawtooth sunflower and prairie rose; and (in fall) Missouri goldenrod, New England aster and dotted gayfeather. The prairie rose that blooms here is the state flower of Iowa. Adjacent wetlands are managed in combination with the prairie, creating a managed land complex of 1,204 acres. Historically, much of the visitation to the prairie has been connected with wetland and upland wildfowl hunting. The prairie was uncovered by botanist Ada Hayden in 1944, who recognized tallgrass plants growing in a hayfield. She recommended that it be preserved as one of the last remaining patches of old-growth tallgrass prairie in Iowa. In 1958, the Cayler family - who had owned the land since frontier settlement - sold the land parcel to the Iowa Conservation Commission. The tallgrass parcel was named as a National Natural Landmark in 1966, and was dedicated as a state nature preserve in 1971. Bufferland was purchased in 1998.

It is a scarab beetle endemic to New Zealand, and is commonly found in manuka trees (Leptospermum scoparium), hence the beetle's name. In some areas it is considered a pasture pest. Description The manuka beetle is bright green with shades of blue and yellow on areas of its back. Its dark longitudinal stripe down the back of its hard wing case is often brown or yellow. It can vary in length between 3 and 25mm in length, but the most common is 9mm. They are a part of the superfamily Scarabaeoidea and are characterized for their modified prothorax and have a large coxae. Their antennae is a lamellate antennal club and has a head with anterior margins which are either semicircular or emerginate mesocoxae, strongly oblique. The manuka beetle is a part of the subfamily Melolonthinaes, which is characterized by its stout body and glossy exterior, and the presence of either labrums or mandibles. These appear as segments either elongated or as oval lobes which can be folded together tightly to form compact and asymmetrical clubs. The elbow clubs have between 8 and 10 segments. They have spindly legs covered in light coloured hairs which are strongly modified for digging with their teeth, spines and/or bristles. Their abdomens have 6 ventrites and the hind wing has a spring mechanism which can fold. As larvae, the grub forms as a C-shape.  Distribution  The manuka beetle is endemic to New Zealand. There is no compelling evidence to suggest that it is found elsewhere in the world. It is, however, closely related to other beetles in the family Scarabaeidae, like chafers, dung-beetles, and grass grubs, which are found throughout other parts of the world. An old journal article at a museum in London records the presence of manuka beetles in sheep's wool imported from New Zealand.  Natural global range  The manuka beetle has a generally widespread range across New Zealand but little information has been found on the effects it has on the land outside of New Zealand. The endemic species found in New Zealand have been closely related to those of Australia, so it can be assumed that they would present there also.  New Zealand range  The manuka beetle is very common, and is found in large numbers throughout New Zealand. It lives in grass and vegetation habitats, which is the majority of the landscape of New Zealand. It is so common that it has become a ‚Äòpasture pest‚Äô to agricultural grasslands. Manuka beetles have been recorded in the North Island of New Zealand, in Egmont National Park, Taranaki. They were found present in pastures close to native bush with manuka trees. A 5 km belt around the park is evidence of the impact of manuka beetle larvae feeding on the roots of plants. Flight activities of the beetles were recorded in traps placed 50m and 20m away from manuka bush. The research showed that they were present away from the traps rather than near the bush itself.  Habitat preferences  Manuka beetles have the widest ecological tolerance for different habitats out of the Melolonthidae subfamily, though they prefer woody vegetation. They tend to occur in tussock and pastures 2 to 3 years through development and been converted from native vegetation or bush regrowth. However, as its common name suggests, it preferably lives in and around the soil of manuka trees (Leptospermum). Adult beetles have been seen swarming over the small white flowers that cover the manuka when it is flowering during the summer. Life cycle/phenology Pyronota festiva larva Otago has been a major region for experimentation on the Pyronota species. In Macraes Flat, Otago, Stewart (1987) found that a species of Pyronota beetle followed roughly a two-year life cycle where they would span across two winters as larvae and eventually mature into adult beetles over the following summer - November through to January. As evident through general observation and their preference in habitat, it is clear that warmer temperatures draw the beetle to a specific area. As a result, this significantly increases populations; Stewart (1987) observed that adults became more active when the sun is shining as opposed to overcast days or during the night. This is interesting considering the amount of sunless days that Otago has, compared to Taranaki. The two-year life cycle includes a three-step larval stage. Eggs were found in January where they \\"‚Ä¶spent their first winter as 1st or 2nd instar larvae and their second winter as 3rd instars.\\" They are given a better chance of enduring their complete life cycle over two years where the conditions meet most of their need. When this isn't the case, they can develop over a shorter time period - sometimes within one year. During the immature larval stage the species is said to be a minor pest. The larvae then hatch and form as pupae, eating the roots of plants which dominate the pasture soils.Pestweb, 2015 As they grow they develop as a C shape. During the third stage they emerge from the tunnels or cracks in the soil during early summer as full-grown beetles to feed on the foliage of manuka plants. This third stage is where the damage caused by the pupae eating the roots of the plants becomes evident over autumn and winter. Adult beetles are present a few weeks during late spring and early summer once a year. They fly in warm conditions during the day. Females lay their eggs in pasture soils at depths of up to 10 cm. Each female can lay up to 30 or 40 eggs at one time. When numbers reach 350/m2 in one period they begin to form significant damage to the pasture, which is noticeable in the form of yellow, dried-out patches of grass. The manuka beetle's life cycle is slightly different from those of its relatives, which include other members of the family Scarabaeidae: chafers, dung-beetles and grass grub beetles. Its eggs are laid in the soil, and after hatching into larvae, they have a reasonably lengthy development underground. The adult beetles die a very short time after mating, and their bodies often form drifts or mounds in and around mud or tree roots. Diet and foraging The larvae feed on the roots of the manuka tree, providing the eggs were laid in the soil around a manuka tree. Larvae not in this situation have also been known to feed on matagouri roots and the roots of sweet briar roses. In 70% of cases, larvae were found feeding in the first 4 cm of soil, directly below the ‚Äòturf mat'. Adult beetles feed on the vegetation of the manuka tree. They also feed on grass roots in agricultural areas, which is the reason they are such a pest to agriculture, as they harm the grass that dairy cows eat. Manuka beetles have been studied and examined a lot in the Taranaki region. However, there are low numbers of adult beetles here because of their preference of food. They are not succeeding as well as possible in the Taranaki region because of their low counts of Leptospermum species existing both in present and past times. When manuka plant species are not in abundance, manuka beetles are being forced to feed on \\"matagouri (Discaria toumatou), sweet briar (Rosa rubiginosa), and Leptospermum spp.\\" Predators, parasites, and diseases The green colouring of the adults, and the fact they are diurnal (active during the day), means they are safe from predators because they blend in with the vegetation on which they live. Predators include mice, gulls and house sparrows. A survey done on Mokoi Island, Lake Rotorua observed house mice, Mus musculus, and what insects they were eating. Pitfall traps proved that Pyronota festiva were present throughout the island and suggested that house mice were relying on manuka beetles as one of their main food sources. Red-billed gulls have also been observed flying over farmland at Opoutere, Coromandel Peninsula from sunset, as the light is fading, and consuming small manuka beetles. This was often seen during autumn and winter, when the beetles are less likely to fly and are more vulnerable to predators as they surface from wet pastures due to an increase in rain levels. House sparrows were mapped to be eating at least three manuka beetles over a period of one to five days, when their chicks are hatching.Department of Conservation, 2001 They are also a trout food. However, the beetles are pests, so there are a number of journal articles devoted to researching how to control them by targeting them with bacteria and fungi parasites, so called ‚Äòbio-control‚Äô methods. Rickettsiella bacteria are being researched as a potential bio-control agent to manage the large numbers of the beetles affecting agricultural areas all over New Zealand. This bacterium is said to produce an ‚Äòintracellular infection‚Äô in the beetles, and many other members of their genus. As well as this bacterium, the fungus Beauveria brongniartii is being tested to help Cape Foulwind dairy farmers attack the pest. It is achieving relatively high rates of mortality in the larvae stage of the beetles. The fungal infection affects only an isolated selection of ‚Äòscarab‚Äô beetles, which means that it might, but is unlikely to spread onto other harmless beetles (depending on what they are). Cultural uses There are several records of the manuka beetle being used by the indigenous Maori tribes all over New Zealand. The piles of dead adult beetle bodies that form in and around shallow water, mud and vegetation, were often collected and eaten by Maori as a delicacy. Another report states that when the Maori tribes settled in New Zealand, manuka beetles were among the insects that they occasionally ate. Other uses by Maori include the beetle's antiseptic qualities and ability to reduce fevers and stomachaches. More fleshy insects like the larvae of the cerambycid beetle, or ‚Äòhuhu grub‚Äô (as well as the adult beetle) were more widely eaten. Manuka beetles (and Puriri moths) were also used for medicinal purposes. New Zealand Fishing (1998) discusses how manuka beetles are more active during hours of daylight in November/December and can be seen lying on the surface of the water as a result of heavy winds. The trout wait in the water for the beetles to land. The presence of manuka beetles in the intestines of trout in Lake Tikitapu provides evidence of their interaction. Fishermen have also created a manuka beetle trout fly, otherwise known as the 'green beetle'. It looks similar to a green manuka beetle and is designed specifically to catch trout during the summer months.New Zealand Fishing, 1998 Interesting facts Apart from the severe damage to the farmland, Pyronota festiva has been associated with major damage in the fruit trees of peaches and nectarines. They have vast effects - with the aid of damage done by other insects - on the leaf and the fruit itself. Research has generally only associated the species with native grass and farmlands, so it is interesting that their scope of damage is actually quite broad. Full-grown beetles feed on manuka plants, which have an oil compound which makes their exterior cases incredibly hard. They also contain chiral material in their hard exterior cases. When placed under a microscope with light, complexities are revealed in these multilayered chiral coatings, creating green, metallic- like reflections. The manuka beetle can be successfully controlled through the idea of 'hoof and tooth'. Heavily stocking a pasture block during winter when the soil is very moist will cause the beetle larvae to be crushed by stock treading. This will cause the beetle's numbers to be reduced dramatically.

The informant then claimed that he had used heroin in the past and that foil was a common packaging method for heroin. The informant also claimed that from February 28 to February 29, he had a conversation with the bartender and that the bartender told him that he would have heroin for sale on March 1. The Aurora Police Department had previous dealings with this informant, whom they considered to be reliable. The judge signed the search warrant, authorizing \\"the following person or place: . . . [T]he Aurora Tap Tavern. . . . Also the person of 'Greg,' the bartender, a male white with blondish hair appx. 25 years.\\" The warrant authorized the police to search for \\"evidence of the offense of possession of a controlled substance,\\" to wit, \\"[h]eroin, contraband, other controlled substances, money, instrumentalities and narcotics, paraphernalia used in the manufacture, processing and distribution of controlled substances.\\" In the late afternoon of that day, 7-8 officers proceeded to the tavern. Upon entering the property, the officers announced to all present that they were going to conduct a \\"cursory search for weapons.\\" One of the officers, Jerome Johnson, conducted a pat-down on all of the 13 customers while the rest of the force focused on extensively searching the property. Later, Johnson came to Ventura Ybarra, the latter standing by a pinball machine. During the first pat-down, the officer felt an object that was described as \\"a cigarette pack with objects in it.\\" Johnson did not bother to remove it, instead moving on to other patrons. Eventually, Johnson came back to Ybarra and searched him a second time. This time, he removed the cigarette packet from Ybarra's pants' pocket. When Johnson opened the package, he found six packets of foil containing a brown powder that was later identified as heroin. Full Ybarra v. Illinois text Trial and Appeals At the arraignment, Ybarra was indicted by a grand jury on the charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Ybarra then filed a motion to suppress against the packets of heroin seized from his person. During the hearing on the motion, the prosecution argued that the search was justified by Section 108-9 of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1975, ch. 38, par. 108-9), which reads, \\"In the execution of the warrant the person executing the same may reasonably detain the search any person in the place at the time: (a) To protect himself from attack, or (b) To prevent the disposal or concealment of any instruments, articles or things particularly described in the warrant.\\" The trial court denied the motion, and Ybarra was convicted of heroin possession in a bench trial. He appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court-Second District, which upheld the conviction. Full People v.Ybarra text Opinion of the Court In a 6-3 majority opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the search of Ybarra was unconstitutional against the Fourth Amendment, along with the Fourteenth Amendment, therefore, his conviction should be overturned. Justice Potter Stewart authored the opinion, arguing that Terry v. Ohio does not apply in the circumstances surrounding the case because the search warrant was only for the tavern property and the bartender, not their customers. This meant that there was no probable cause to justify the search and arrest of Ybarra. Burger's dissent Justice Warren E. Burger filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices William Rehnquist and Harry A. Blackmun, arguing that the Court has violated the rationale of Terry by limiting the scope of to \\"a particularized and individualized suspicion\\" that a person is armed and dangerous and that although, the warrant narrowed the search to the bartender, the search was valid because the tavern's patrons had a reputation for involvement in the narcotics trade, which made the possibility that they are armed reasonable. Furthermore, he stated that the officer's conduct was by-the-books, by not seizing the cigarette package first and making sure that none of the patrons were armed, and going back to Ybarra and confiscating the package. Finally, he argued that the Court was slowing the police down from suppressing the flow of narcotics into their communities. Rehnquist's dissent Justice William Rehnquist wrote his dissent, stating that the Court's reasoning was faulty, and claimed that since one or more of the tavern's customers could potentially be involved in the narcotics trade, the situation can escalate to dangerous levels due to the possibility of firearms. This, he reasoned, justified the search. Furthermore, he argued that Johnson's testimony during the pre-trial hearing that he had \\"felt objects\\" in the cigarette box created reasonable suspicion that heroin was in the container, which, he claimed, was within the boundaries of Terry v. Ohio. Finally, he ended by exclaiming that the search, in this case, was incidental, thus not being subject to the warrant requirement and that the search warrant was authorized by a neutral and detached magistrate, and that the officers conducted their duty pursuant to the warrant in an appropriate fashion.

His work is a prominent example of the Latin American literary movement known as McOndo, in which the magical realism of previous Latin American authors is supplanted by modern realism, often with a technological focus. His work has won several awards. He has lived in the United States since 1991, and has taught literature at Cornell University since 1997.  Career  Some early pieces were published while he was still at high school. However, he started writing seriously at age 19 when he was in Buenos Aires, studying International Relations. He transferred to the University of Alabama in Huntsville, receiving a football scholarship. A year before graduating, his first collection of short stories, Las m√°scaras de la nada, was published in Cochabamba. He has resided in the United States since 1991. He graduated B.A. in political science in 1991. His first novel, D√≠as de papel was a finalist in the 1991 Letras de Oro literary competition for United States works. The novel won the Erich Guttentag Prize, and was published in 1992. He obtained an M.A. in Hispanic Languages and Literatures in 1993, and a Ph.D. in Hispanic Languages and Literatures in 1997, both at University of California, Berkeley. His Ph.D. thesis was on the life and works of Alcides Arguedas; stemming from this research, a biography was published in 2003. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2006. R√≠o fugitivo (1998) is at one and the same time a Bildungsroman, a detective mystery novel, and a historico-political novel about Bolivia. Two of his novels have been translated into English. La materia del deseo (1991) was published in English (2004) as The Matter of Desire, and El delirio de Turing was published in English as Turing's Delirium in 2006. In Turing‚Äôs Delirium, Paz Sold√°n rewrote entire sequences directly in English for the translated edition, and changed the fundamental motivation of one of the characters; a subsequent Spanish version from Argentina incorporated these changes, but the widely circulated edition is the previous edition from Spain. In 2011, he became the first Bolivian to be published by Gallimard. In 2011, he chaired the jury committee for the first Premio de las Am√©ricas for the best work published in Spanish in 2010. Norte, published in 2011, depicts three experiences of Latin American immigration to the US over an 80-year span. Billie Ruth was published in 2012. His first science fiction novel, Iris, published in 2014, was inspired by an article in Rolling Stone magazine about psychopathic soldiers in Afghanistan. The book was originally conceived as the last in a trilogy with Los vivos y los muertos (2009) and continued with Norte (2011); he had not initially intended it to be science fiction. He is cultural and political columnist for several newspapers and magazines: La Tercera, El Pa√≠s, The New York Times, Time and Etiqueta Negra. He has translated some English works to Spanish, including Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare and The Seller of Dreams by Ernesto Qui√±onez, a US author from Ecuador. His own works have been translated into several languages and have appeared in anthologies in Europe and America. He teaches Latin American Literature at Cornell University. Reviewers have identified in his work a prominent example of the Latin American literary movement known as McOndo, which replaces the magical realism of previous Latin American authors with a technological, modernistic realism. According to Mario Vargas Llosa, he is one of the most original among the new generation of Latin American authors.

Ant√£o Martins processed many of the residents of Praia for constructing mills, and not paying him for that service.Francisco Ferreira Drummond (1850) Finally, the ouvidor Vasco Afonso decided (as acting captain in 1487), that Ant√£o Martins should construct four mills, and repair the ones in Agualva. This, thereby, allowing the citizenry to mill at their convenience, without tribute to the King or donatary-captain. But, since this was not accomplished the residents returned to the ouvidor, this time Afonso de Matos, who ordered their construction in three months in 1491. This after Jo√£o Gomes, Jo√£o Correia and Afonso Anes, in addition to other property-owners and gentlemen farmers of that captaincy constructed their own mills. But, even then, the Donatary-Captain did not comply, and it was resolved that the residents could mill in their places for six months (May to October), when there was less water. The monopoly on salt was also waived, which permitted the purchase of salt from ships.

Lithograph by Franz Hanfstaengl, 1832. Moritz, Prince of Dietrichstein (Moritz Joseph Johann; 19 February 1775 ‚Äì 29 August 1864), was a German prince member of the House of Dietrichstein, 10th and last Prince (F√ºrst) of Dietrichstein zu Nikolsburg, Count of Proskau- Leslie, Baron (Freiherr) of Hollenburg, Finkenstein and Thalberg. Born in Vienna, he was the seventh child and fourth (but third surviving) son of Karl Johann Baptist, 7th Prince of Dietrichstein, and Maria Christina Josepha, a daughter of Jan Josef Franti≈°ek Anton√≠n, Count of Thun-Hohenstein. Life Being the third son of his family and in consequence without expectations to inheritance, since 1791 Moritz entered in the Austrian military service. In 1798 was named Adjutant of General Karl Mack von Leiberich in Naples, where he was captured with his master by the French, and after his release he participated the campaign in Ulm (1805). In 1815 Moritz was appointed tutor of the Duke of Reichstadt (Napoleon II) and later was named Director of the Imperial Court Theatre (Burgtheater) and Library (Kaiserlichen Bibliothek), in 1845 was named Oberstk√§mmerer until 1848, when he retired from public offices. Like his older brother, Prince Franz Joseph, he was an opponent of Metternich politics. Beethoven was very encouraged by him. In 1838 Moritz acquired from the Austrian National Library the Mozart's Requiem. Even as a Director of the Coins and Antique Cabinets (M√ºnz- u. Antikenkabinetts) during 1833-1848 he rendered great services, composing songs, dances and minuets. In 1834 he was elected an honorary member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften). After the death of his nephew, Joseph Franz on 10 July 1858, Moritz succeeded him as 10th Prince of Dietrichstein. Moritz died in Vienna aged 89, and was buried at Hietzinger cemetery, grave 06, no. 15. Because his only son died before him and without issue, with Moritz ended the Dietrichstein family in male line. Four years later, in late 1868, Count Alexander of Mensdorff-Pouilly (husband of Moritz' grand-niece), obtained from the Emperor the title of Prince of Dietrichstein- Nikolsburg, thus reviving the title of his wife's family.  Marriage and issue  In Vienna on 22 September 1800, Moritz married with Maria Theresia (16 January 1779 ‚Äì 3 September 1860), a daughter of Johann Christoph Julius, Count of Gilleis and Countess Maria Anna von Spindler.

The battle, fought during a series of Kazakh-Dzungar Wars, was one of the initial turning points in the liberation war of the Kazakhs against the Dzhungar invasion in the 17th century. Background The scattered Oirat tribes, wandering in western Mongolia and Xinjiang united into a single state by the first half of the 17th century, founding the Dzhungarian Khanate. Starting from the middle of the 17th century, the strategic goal of the Dzhungar was to increase their territories for pastures by joining the lands of the neighboring khanates. An aggressive foreign policy towards Zhetysu and Central Asia aggravated Kazakhstan-Dzhungar relations and often led to military conflicts. The struggle with the Dzhungars was headed by the son of Khan Esim - Jangir-Sultan (1629-1680). After 1635, Jangir-Sultan, conducted a series of major battles with Dzhungar troops with varying success. In one of the battles in 1635, Jangir was defeated and captured. Being a Chingissid (a Genghis Khan's heir), Jangir was in a privileged position in the camp of Oirat huntaiji, and according to some sources, even married one of his daughters. After returning from captivity, Jangir again led the fight against the Dzhungars. Dzhungars were a military threat not only for the Kazakhs, but also for the people of Middle and Central Asia. The campaigns of the Dzhungar troops showed the perniciousness of Kazakh tribal feuds and intra-feudal strife in the face of the aggressive threat that grew from year to year. In addition, from a military standpoint, the Dzhungar Khanate represented a serious danger to the Kazakh clans. Unlike some Asian peoples who have mastered the ‚Äúarrowed battle‚Äù, firearms with wicks and artillery appeared in service of the Dzhungar army as early as the end of the 17th century. For the war with the Kazakhs, the Dzhungars bought weapons and cannons from Russian gunsmiths and cast them with the help of Swede Johann Gustav Renat, a captured sergeant of Swedish artillery. The Dzhungar had a large and highly organized army at that time, which reached the number of two hundred thousand cavalry. In 1640, a notorious kurultai took place, where the Kazakh steppes and rich cities of the Bukhara Khanate were chosen as the next target of the Dzungarian campaigns. In the winter of 1643, after short preparation, the expeditionary corps of the Dzhungars, headed by the new huntaiji Erdeni-Batur, his relative Orchita and his brother-in-law Ablai Taisha, moved to the Kazakh steppes. Course of the battle Jangir Khan's 600 soldiers were deeply entrenched in the valley of the river Orbulaq in the southwestern foot slopes of the Dzungarian Alatau and waited in ambush for the arrival of the main forces of the Kazakhs in the way of an unknown number of Dzhungar army (estimated at around fifty thousand men strong) led by Erdeni-Batur.–°–∞—è—Å–∏ —Ç“Ø—Å—ñ–Ω–¥—ñ—Ä–º–µ —Å”©–∑–¥—ñ–∫. ‚Äì –ê–ª–º–∞—Ç—ã, 2007. Half of the warriors organized obstruction in the path and the rest spread out on the cliffs, thereby preparing an ambush on Dzhungars. In this battle, the firearms were massively used by Kazakhs for the first time, and in the first hours of battle Dzhungars lost many marching in avant-garde due to gun fire. Then, the aid troops of the Bukhara Khanate, led by Emir of Samarkand Zhalantos batyr, hit the Dzhungarian arri√®re-garde from the rear. Erdeni-batur was forced to retreat to Dzungaria. Location of the battlefield The battle is known mainly from the notes of G.Ilyin and K. Kucheyev - Russian envoys to the Dzhungar huntaiji. In February 1643, Tobolsk servicemen, G. Ilyin and Kochimberdy Kucheyev, were sent from Tobolsk to Dzhungar Huntaiji Erdeni Batur to the southern Tarbagatai. Since he had already gone to the raid on Zhetysu, envoys waited for the Huntaiji to return for more than four months. From this campaign, he returned at the end of June, driving about 10,000 captured Kyrgyz. It is from these captives that they got all the details of the battle. Their report to Tobolsk governor says that five tumen strong (50 000) Erdeni Batur-led-expedition forces, which set out to Kazakh Zhetysu, suffered major defeat by allied forces of Kazakhs and Bukhara Khanate. Thus, the fact of the battle itself is documented. Unfortunately, Ilyin and Kucheev did not indicate the place of the battle. Kazakh historian Ville Galiev in his book \\"Han Zhangir i Orbulakskaya bitva\\" (Jangir khan and Orbulaq battle), having studied the terrain and existing historical evidences indicated the location of the battle as the Belzhailyau gorge in river Orbulaq valley in Dzhungar Alatau. The Belzhailyau gorge situated in the valley of Orbulaq river is narrow and long. There is a high hill in the middle of it, located across the gorge, which resembles a bulk dam. From the east (Iliy valley) it has a gentle slope, and from the west (Balkhash) it is steep. This is the perfect place to ambush. If you dig trenches along the top of the hill and plant shooters, then the entire western part of the slope and the depression in front of the hill are clearly visible and are perfectly shot through. But many historians doubt that such a major battle could have happened in the Dzungarian Alatau. According to most historians, by the middle of the seventeenth century the territory of Zhetysu was already in the hands of Dzungaria. The penetration of a small detachment of Jangir's warriors deep into enemy territory is theoretically possible, but another 20,000 soldiers of Yalantush (Zhalantos) questions the possibility of battlefield in Belzhailyau. It is highly questionable the huge army of the Emir of Samarkand to overcome about 900 kilometers from the border of the Bukhara Khanate to Belzhailyau. The mystery of the battle between the Dzhungar's Erdeni Batur and the Kazakh's Jangir-Sultan (later becoming Khan) lies in the fact that still no one knows where exactly it occurred. Controversy over the strength of Dzhungar army Many historians have expressed doubts about the size of the Dzungarian army. During this time period, 50,000 soldiers required a considerable amount of human resources. Historians suggest that most probably a mistake was made when calculating and the numbers were greatly overestimated. Even in the well-known documented battles between the Chinese and the Dzhungars, the latter usually deployed no more than 30 thousand soldiers. For the Dzhungar, it was the Chinese front that was the main one and the most bloody battles were going on there. It was there that the question of the life and death of Dzhungaria was decided. Chinese bogdykhans sought to destroy the Khanate, which constantly ravaged its western provinces (in which, eventually, only Qianglong succeeded in 1758). Speaking of the strength of the Dzhungar army in Orbulaq, it can be assumed that this is a misinterpretation of the word ‚Äútumen‚Äù by the Russian envoys. If at the time of Genghis Khan this military unit numbered 10 thousand soldiers, by the time of Orbulaq \\"tumen\\" was simply an independent detachment with 2-3 thousand people at most. During the preparation of Zhetysu campaign, Batur- huntaiji invited his relatives to participate in the raid - his younger brother Chokur's son Ochirta and son-in-law Ablai Taisha, some Koyu-Sultan and Ombo, son of neighboring Altan Khan. Each of them, apparently, participated with personal tumen. Most likely, the Russian envoys, believing that the tumen was 10 thousand, simply multiplied it by five. Moreover, they received this information from the prisoners driven from the raid. The Dzhungars themselves would never revealed exact number of their troops, as that considered a strategic information. Another moment is the interest of the warriors. The more soldiers involved in the campaign, the greater the number of shares. And what to take from the nomadic Kazakhs and Kyrgyzs except rams and horses? What is the point of warriors risking their lives if they do not get decent reward? Why use so many warriors in the usual raid on peaceful settlements? And if each warrior on a campaign had three horses (as Dzhungars and Mongols usually did) - that makes it 150 thousand horses! How to feed them in the desert Balkhash steppe? All these questions raise doubts about the indicated strength of the Dzhungar army. Some historians agree that a more realistic number of warriors is no more than 10-15 thousand people. Significance The plans of the Dzhungar huntaiji to seize Zhetysu had been frustrated. Kazakhs regained control over the region. Kazakhs won time to prepare for the further advance of the Dzhungars into the region. Jangir-Sultan demonstrated the effectiveness of the new combat tactics of salvo firing from guns by foot soldiers. For Central Asia, it was a revolutionary experience in the use of firearms. Also for the first time in the military history m of the Kazakh Khanate, trenches were used. In tactical terms, the battle in Orbulaq demonstrated the ability of the Kazakh clans to join forces in the face of external threats. For the first time, representatives of three Kazakh zhuzes and Uzbek allies successfully fought working in association. Jangir Khan proved to be a good commander and a strong strategist. Jangir was awarded the honorary title \\"Salqam\\" (High). It is believed that Jangir was well-informed about the armament and organization of the Dzhungarian army (in 1635 Jangir-Sultan was captured by the Kalmyk Taiji Hyundulen and stayed captive for several years), this knowledge, together with his leadership talent, helped the Kazakhs to eventually come victorious in the battle of Orbulaq. It is assumed that the battle affected the Dzungarian society as well. The unexpected defeat led to controversy among the Dzhungar feudal lords, weakening the state in the face of the threat of the long-planned Qing offensive, which eventually led to destruction of the khanate and mass genocide of Dzhungars. Legacy There is a granite stone on Belzhailyau hill placed in 1993 in honor of the 350th anniversary of the battle. The names of some batyrs and Jangir Khan who participated in the battle are written there. The heroic feat, happened 375 years ago, during the period of nationwide struggle of the Kazakh people against the Dzhungar invaders is sometimes compared to the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans effectively stalled the overwhelming army of the Persians. It is planned to organize the museum of the Orbulaq battle by 2019. The battle was re-staged on the Taldykorgan hippodrome during the celebration of the 550th anniversary of the formation of the Kazakh Khanate.

Early years Kirwan was born at \\"Jinbah\\", Maryborough, Queensland, to parents Michael Kirwan, who was a sugar worker, and his wife Sarah (n√©e Costello), both of whom had originated from Tipperary, Ireland.Kirwan, Michael Joseph (Mick) (1873‚Äì1941) - Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 24 April 2015. He started his education at the local state school in Yengarie before his family moved to Brisbane and he continued his schooling at Petrie Terrace. He started his working career as an apprentice bootmaker in 1884, and in 1907 he joined the railways as a porter. Due to his strong vocal abilities, Kirwan made a name for himself as a train- caller. As an active member of the Australian Railways Union, Kirwan found himself as one of those at the centre of the 1912 Brisbane general strike, for which he was sacked after the strike came to an end. Political career Kirwan's first attempt at entering Queensland Parliament came at the 1902 state election. As the Labour candidate for the seat of Logan, he was easily defeated by the sitting member, James Stodart of the Ministerialist Party by 565 votes to 239. Ten years later, at the 1912 state election, Kirwan was nominated as the Labor candidate for the seat of Brisbane. He found himself up against the long serving parliamentarian, Edward Barrow Forrest, who had represented the seat since 1899. A close contest ensued, and Kirwan won by 2187 votes to 2150. Kirwan went on to hold the seat for twenty years until he was disendorsed by his party in favour of Australian Workers' Union organizer, Robert Funnell, for the 1932 state election. A vehement anti-conscriptionist, Kirwan was an enthusiastic and dedicated politician and over the years he became a quality speaker and debater. He was appointed chairman of committees in 1920 and in 1924 was one of those elevated to cabinet during the brief and abortive rebellion against Premier Ted Theodore. He wrongly thought this would ruin his political career but on the 14 July 1924 he was promoted to Minister without Office and on 26 February 1925 became Secretary for Public Works, holding this position until his party lost office in 1929. After losing his nomination in 1932, Premier William Forgan Smith appointed Kirwan as an official of the Queensland Tourist Bureau. He joined the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock as a member of the library staff in 1938 and retired later in that year. Personal life Kirwan married Katherine Swift (died 1945) at Tenterfield on 29 September 1912 and together had one son. He was the first president of the Surf Life Saving Australia (Queensland centre) in 1931-41 and was a member and office-bearer of the Queensland Irish Association. Suffering a cerebral haemorrhage, Kirwan died in February 1941. He was accorded a state funeral, to be presided over by Archbishop Duhig at St Stephen's Cathedral and proceeded to the Nudgee Catholic Cemetery.

Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The broadcast is performed live from Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York. This adaptation of the musical combines aspects of both the Broadway play and its 1978 film adaptation. Plot Teenager Dorothy Gale lives with her Aunt Em and dog, Toto, on their farm in Kansas. One day, Dorothy tries to run away, but the three farmhands and Aunt Em stop her while she chases after Toto. Dorothy expresses her displeasure about her current life situations and wishes to go back to her hometown of Omaha. Aunt Em tells Dorothy how much she loves her dearly and hopes they will always be as close as they were when Dorothy was younger (\\"The Feeling We Once Had\\"). When an approaching storm turns out to be a tornado, Aunt Em takes shelter. As the tornado hits the farm, Dorothy and her house are lifted into the air and flown for miles, with the wind represented by dancers (\\"The Tornado\\"). The house finally comes to rest with a bump in the middle of the city. There Dorothy is met by the Munchkins and Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North, who tells her that she is in the Land of Oz. Furthermore, her house has fallen on Evamean, the Wicked Witch of the East, and killed her, freeing the Munchkins from her evil powers. Dorothy, distressed and confused, wants only to return home. With her magic unable to take Dorothy beyond the country boundaries, Addaperle decides Dorothy's best chance for assistance is to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City in the center of Oz, to see the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, or \\"The Wiz\\" for short (\\"He's the Wizard\\"). She gives Dorothy the Witch of the East's silver slippers and tells her not to take them off before she reaches home, for they hold a mysterious, but very powerful charm that will keep her safe. Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road, full of doubt and fear at what lies ahead (\\"Soon As I Get Home\\"). Stopping to rest by a cornfield, she is startled when a scarecrow hanging on a pole is being bothered by a bunch of crows who are trying to bring his mood down (\\"You Can't Win\\"). Dorothy shoos the crows away and helps the Scarecrow down. He tells her of his longing for brains so that he can be like other people, and she invites him to accompany her to see if the Wizard can help him. (\\"Ease On Down the Road #1\\"). The Yellow Brick Road leads them into a great forest where they discover a man made of tin, rusted solid. They oil his joints (\\"Slide Some Oil To Me\\") and he tells them how, to prevent him from marrying Bertha, a servant girl, the Wicked Witch of the East put a spell on him that transformed his entire body into tin. The one thing missing from inside of him was a heart, and the Tin Man has longed for one ever since. Dorothy and the Scarecrow invite him on their journey to see the Wizard with the hope that he may give him one (\\"Ease On Down the Road #2\\"). The trio continues following the Yellow Brick Road deeper into the forest, where they are attacked by a large lion (\\"I'm a Mean Ole Lion\\"). However, he is quickly revealed to be a coward hiding behind bravado as Dorothy stands up for her friends. When he learns where they are going, he apologizes and asks if he may accompany them to ask the Wizard for some courage. They agree and the trio becomes a quartet (\\"Ease On Down the Road #3\\"), but face a new danger when they are attacked by half-tiger, half- bear creatures called Kalidahs (\\"Kalidah Battle\\"). After a great fight and harrowing escape, they stop by the road to rest. The Lion is embarrassed by his cowardice in the battle but is comforted by Dorothy's kind words (\\"Be a Lion\\"). Seeing a green glow in the distance, they continue their journey to the Emerald City, and wander into a field of poppies who blow opium dust on them. Not being made of flesh, the Scarecrow and Tin Man are unaffected, but Dorothy and the Lion begin to become disoriented and drowsy. Dorothy recalls that the Munchkins warned her of the dangerous poppies, and runs from the field as fast as she can with the Scarecrow and Tin Man behind her. The Lion is overcome by the dust and begins to hallucinate (\\"Lion's Dream\\"). However, he overcomes their powerful scent and makes safely across the field with his friends. Marching up to the gates of the Emerald City, they are met by the Gatekeeper. They enter the city and look about in awe at the richly dressed people that inhabit it (\\"Emerald City Ballet\\"). The haughty and condescending people laugh and ridicule this odd party for wanting to see the Wizard until they see that Dorothy is wearing the Witch of the East's silver slippers. They are promptly shown right into his palace. Once in the throne room, they are assaulted by a great show of lights, smoke, and the Wizard appears before them (\\"So You Wanted To See the Wizard\\"). They each plead their case to him, the Tin Man doing so in song (\\"What Would I Do If I Could Feel?\\"). He agrees on one condition: they must kill Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West. With their goals seeming further out of reach than ever before, Dorothy's companions sink to the floor in tears. However, Dorothy encourages them not to give up. (\\"We Got It\\"). Evillene rules over the land of the west, enslaving its people, the Winkies. She is evil, power-hungry, and ruthlessly determined to get her hands on the silver slippers, so that she may increase her power and rule over all of Oz (\\"Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News\\"). Receiving word of Dorothy and her friends approaching, she sends her Winged Monkeys to bring them to her (\\"Funky Monkeys\\"). Catching up to the group in the forest surrounding Evillene's castle, the monkeys take them all to the castle. While searching for a way to get the slippers from Dorothy, Evillene has the Scarecrow and Tin Man chained up and takes delight in torturing the Lion before Dorothy, threatening to have him skinned and roasted unless she hands over the silver slippers. Angered by this, she picks up a bucket of water and throws it over Evillene, who melts. Her spell on the Winkies is lifted, and they show their thanks by restoring the Scarecrow and Tin Man to top condition, and reuniting the group (\\"Everybody Rejoice\\"/\\"Brand New Day\\"). Returning to the Emerald City, they see the Wizard (now a talking head). He reneges on his promise, and the Lion pulls a plug. Behind the large head stands a bewildered woman who claims to be the real Wizard. She tells them that she is really a magician's assistant and balloonist from Omaha who traveled to Oz by accident when her hot air balloon drifted off course. The people of Oz had never seen such a sight and proclaimed her Wizard. Not wanting to disappoint them, she assumed the role and had a great city built. Furious, the group confronts the Wizard on her deceptions, but she points out that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion already have the things they seek as shown in their behavior on the journeys they have made. She proposes that Dorothy can return to Omaha the way she came, and offers to pilot Dorothy in her air balloon. She addresses the citizens of the Emerald City in person for the first time in many years, telling them of her imminent journey, and leaving the Scarecrow in charge (\\"Y'all Got It!\\"). Just as her speech reaches its climax, Dorothy realizes that she does not belong in Omaha and the balloon comes free from its moorings and rises quickly into the air. Just as the group despairs of finding Dorothy a way back home, Addaperle reappears, suggesting that Dorothy asks Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, for assistance. Suddenly, Glinda, a beautiful and gracious sorceress, shows up. She tells Dorothy that the silver slippers have always had the power to take her home, but like her friends, she needed to believe in their magic and in herself before it was possible (\\"If You Believe\\"). Dorothy bids a tearful goodbye to her friends and then she thinks about what she has gained, lost, and learned throughout her journey through Oz (\\"Home\\"). Clicking her heels together three times, she finds herself transported back to Kansas in an instant. As an overjoyed Aunt Em and Toto appear, and Dorothy runs to hug them, she knows that she is back home at last (\\"Finale\\").

Songs from the original Broadway production were featured, with two exceptions: \\"You Can't Win\\", a song cut from the musical and first used in its 1978 feature film adaptation as sung by Michael Jackson, was used in place of the Scarecrow's key number \\"I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday\\", and \\"We Got It\\", a new song composed by Harvey Mason Jr., Stephen Oremus with stars Ne-Yo and Elijah Kelley, was performed as Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion began their journey to find and kill the Wicked Witch of the West. The Wiz Live! was the first live TV program in US history to contain audio description for blind or visually impaired viewers. Marketing The cost of a 30-second commercial during The Wiz ranged between $330,000 to $350,000, marking a drop from the $345,000 to $400,000 cost of ad time during Peter Pan Live!. The decrease in ad cost was attributed to the modest viewership of Peter Pan in comparison to The Sound of Music Live!, which an analyst felt was a result of the reduced novelty of the production in comparison to The Sound of Music. Reddi-wip served as a main sponsor of the presentation; Walmart, which served as a major sponsor of NBC's previous live musicals, declined to participate. NBC produced themed commercials to air throughout the special as part of the brand's \\"Share the Joy\\" campaign; one, which was timed to air after the corresponding scene in the musical, featured \\"A Brand New Day\\" being performed by students of the Excel Academy in Hyattsville, Maryland‚Äîa school which ConAgra Foods had donated money to in support of musical arts. Reception Critical reception The Wiz Live! received positive reviews from critics, who praised the acting and singing abilities of the cast and for being an improvement over the two previous live NBC musicals. On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has a 91% rating, based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's consensus states: \\"The Wiz Live! is several notches above NBC's other musical broadcasts thanks to bold performances and large-scale production pieces.\\" Metacritic reports a weighted average of 73 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Viewership The Wiz Live! was seen by 11.5 million viewers, with a 3.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic. Although higher than Peter Pan Live!, it trailed a Thursday Night Football game on CBS between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, which was seen by around 17 million. Average household viewership was notably higher in markets with a large African-American population, such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Norfolk, Richmond, and Washington, D.C. Nielsen also reported that the special produced the most social network interactions of any live television event in the past four years; there were three times as many Twitter postings related to The Wiz Live! than there were related to Peter Pan Live!. NBC rebroadcast the special on December 19, 2015. The rebroadcast was seen by 1.6 million viewers.

His behind-the-scenes production work includes Indianapolis multimedia artist Stuart Hyatt's Grammy-nominated album The Clouds. Strouth also gained national attention in 2009 when he received a life-saving kidney transplant from a donor who connected with him on Twitter, which is believed to be the first such transplant arranged entirely through social networking.  Early life  Strouth was raised in Fridley, Minnesota. He became interested in art and music at an early age, learning how to experiment with tape recorders at age seven. Strouth has been heavily involved in the Twin Cities arts and music community from a young age. His early work included curating multimedia events incorporating art and electronic music at underground art spaces including Rifle Sport Gallery, Hair Police and Red Eye Collaboration. The day after his high school graduation in 1986, Strouth began volunteering at Rifle Sport on Minneapolis' then-notorious Block E. He quickly became publicity director, and eventually managed the space. At the same time, Strouth was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon's chapter at the University of Minnesota. On the podcast Legacy Matters, he said that even though his art-punk sensibility wasn't an obvious match for a straitlaced organization such as DKE (\\"I had blue hair and a cape when I pledged,\\" he noted), \\"I liked this idea of having a connection greater than myself. At a time when I was absolutely rootless, I needed something that gave me roots, because I didn't have family to connect to. It was really kind of powerful.\\"  Music   As composer/performer  As a performer, Strouth has played in a range of styles including techno, jazz, and punk. He has also worked frequently as an organizer of entire scenes of bands, typified by the electronica collective Future Perfect Sound System, which he founded in 1995. = Future Perfect Sound System = The collective was an important early exponent of electronic music and rave culture in the Midwest, receiving favorable comparisons to Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia events. Future Perfect performed frequently at First Avenue nightclub, the Walker Art Center, Weisman Art Museum, and other galleries, with showcases that sometimes drew more than 30 performers, and released two albums, 1997's Music For Listening and 2001's The Nature of Time. = Paris 1919 = In 2009, Strouth founded another musical collective, Paris 1919, named for the post-World War I artistic renaissance. The project was founded shortly before his diagnosis with kidney disease, and Strouth's compositions for the band often deal with his illness and recovery. For instance, the short piece \\"Blood Mountain,\\" is about Strouth's experience on dialysis, and bases its core rhythms on those of dialysis machines. Paris 1919 began as a solo, studio- bound experiment in sonic collages; Strouth has described the music as sounding \\"weird and chaotic and structureless and purposely off-beat\\" but notes that it is also created from a painstaking process which may involve more than 1,000 edits. It grew into a semi-improvisational live band with a rotating membership, which has performed a series of multimedia shows combining music, theater and dance in immersive environments, often working with choreographer Deborah Jinza Thayer. 2014's \\"Antarctica\\" used the theme of an ice cave to explore Strouth's journey through his kidney ailment and recovery. The same year‚Äôs \\"Safe As Houses\\" placed both performers and audience in a giant dollhouse as a metaphor for the housing crisis and Strouth‚Äôs own loss of his home the year before. Paris 1919 has also recorded four albums. Book Of Job was released in 2011 on Go Johnny Go Records. Antarctica, a companion album to the stage performance, was released in 2017 by UltraModern Records. In 2018, Strouth released Risking Light, a soundtrack album to director Dawn Mikkelson's documentary about forgiveness. Although credited to Paris 1919, the album was written and performed by Strouth as a solo work. The fourth album, Collected Short Fictions, is still unreleased. Strouth has also frequently led Paris 1919 in creating live soundtracks to silent films, including Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog, and the 1930 mystery The Bat Whispers at the 2014 Minneapolis Comic-Con. = Other projects = In 2011, Strouth was a conductor for the four-act opera Czeslaw‚Äôs Loop, performed live on a floating barge on the Mississippi River, which included performers as diverse as classical soprano Maria Jette, techno- pop group Information Society's Paul Robb, and Tom Hazelmyer of the punk band Halo of Flies. In 2018, Paris 1919 performed ...For Now, a project combining symphonic, Eastern European, minimalistic, and Renaissance folk music elements, at the Church of St. Boniface in Minneapolis. Strouth joked to an interviewer for Minnesota Public Radio that ...For Now was his \\"middle-aged symphony to God,\\" referencing Brian Wilson's description of the Beach Boys album Smile as a \\"teenage symphony to God.\\" Other projects include The Snaildartha 6's 2004 jazz and spoken-word holiday album Snaildartha: The Story of Jerry the Christmas Snail, which Strouth composed and produced with saxophonist George Cartwright of the jazz group Curlew and co-writer Matt Fugate. Strouth's early band King Paisley and the Pscho-del-ics performed at Rifle Sport and released a nine-song album in 1986, Death Rockin‚Äô, which was re-released in 2011 on Go Johnny Go.  As producer  Besides composing and performing music, Strouth founded his own label, UltraModern Records, in 1995, and was the director of artists and product at two other influential Minneapolis labels, Twin/Tone Records (1995‚Äì2001) and Innova Recordings (2001‚Äì2004). At Innova, Strouth worked on albums by dozens of artists including Revolutionary Snake Ensemble, Beat Circus, Matthew Burtner, George Cartwright, Victoria Jordanova, Phillip Johnston, and Hyatt's Grammy-nominated album The Clouds. Twin/Tone, already nationally prominent thanks to a roster including alternative-rock pioneers The Replacements, grew to develop an umbrella relationship with a dozen smaller indie labels, including UltraModern. UltraModern focused on neo-psychedelic, indie-pop, and noise/electronic rock, releasing albums by musicians including ex-Wall Of Voodoo leader Stan Ridgway, jazz guitarist Skip Heller, Future Perfect Sound System, Ousia, and Savage Aural Hotbed. UltraModern received wider distribution through partnerships with Twin/Tone, Atomic Theory Records, and New West Records. The label's catalog includes:  Film and television  Strouth's documentary Unconvention: A Mix-Tape from St. Paul, RNC '08, filmed in 2008 and released in 2009, covered the contentious 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. The film edits together a wide variety of film and video shot by dozens of independent journalists and citizen videographers with divergent political viewpoints, compiling a mosaic of perspectives on the four days of the convention. Unconvention was one of eight full-length features chosen to debut as part of the \\"Minnesota Made\\" series at the 2009 Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Film Festival. Strouth and Minneapolis filmmaker Rick Fuller also co-produced a DVD companion to Stan Ridgway's Holiday in Dirt album featuring 14 short films based on Ridgway's songs, which was released in 2005. In 2006, they co-produced the documentary The M-80 Project, which chronicled a 1979 New Wave music festival at the Walker Art Center. From 1994 to 1996, Strouth produced the documentary series What, which covered the Minneapolis pop and rock scene, for Twin Cities public television station KTCA.  Kidney transplant  In 2009, Strouth learned that he would need a kidney transplant due to the effects of IgA nephropathy (which he nicknamed \\"Harold\\" as a way of coping with the disease). He found a matching donor, Scott Pakudaitis, after sharing the news with his followers on Twitter and Facebook, and underwent a successful transplant at the University of Minnesota Medical Center in December 2009. The two men never met in person until the day of the surgery. It is believed to be the first such transplant arranged entirely through social networking. The story received nationwide media attention on ABC News, Readers Digest, MTV, and The Ricki Lake Show. Following his recovery, Strouth has been a board member of the Minnesota chapter of the National Kidney Foundation since 2010.  Writing  Strouth writes and illustrates the column \\"Makes No Sense at All\\" for the Minneapolis alt-weekly City Pages. He has also written for publications such as The Growler and America Online's Digital City.
