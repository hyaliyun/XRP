Well-known German comedian Dieter Hallervorden takes the leading role, Heike Makatsch plays his daughter. Paul Averhoff, a Berlin-based runner legend of the 1950s and marathon winner at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, has to move into a retirement home at an advanced age at the urging of his daughter Birgit and his sick wife Margot, because Margot needs professional care. Until then, the Averhoffs had been running their own house and property, and the dreary life in the nursing home means a major change for Paul. With the kindergarten-like occupational therapy offered by the well-meaning home director, he even fears \\"handicrafting himself to death\\". In order to escape this suddenly dull everyday life, Paul starts with running exercises in the nursing home's park. When other residents ask him why he is doing this, he spontaneously announces that he wants to participate in the Berlin Marathon. Despite some misgivings, Margot becomes his trainer again ---as many decades before. Some residents, but especially the home's management, express resistance because Paul's obstinacy is disrupting the usual procedures. However, when one of the residents remembers his Olympic victory and even finds an old autograph card, the home's residents split into supporters and opponents of the project. A race in the park against the young male nurse Tobias, spontaneously suggested by Paul in an argument, is surprisingly won by Paul after an initial delay, because he is better able to manage his energies. But the resistance on the part of the home management becomes so strong that the Averhoffs decide to move into the city flat of their (protesting) daughter. A few days before the marathon, Margot dies of a brain tumour, after which Paul, brought back to the home after a fierce argument with Birgit, suffers a violent mourning attack. As a result, he is sedated and restrained in his bed. On the day of the marathon, however, Paul is freed by nurse Tobias and one of the residents who was previously his harshest critic, and driven to the start of the marathon. During the run, TV reports about him as \\"the most incredible comeback in sports history\\". Birgit also learns about her father's participation in the race and arrives in the afternoon with her boyfriend and all the nursing home residents in the stands of the Olympiastadion where Paul, albeit with a large gap, crosses the finish line and is celebrated by the audience. An epilogue \\"one year later\\" shows Paul taking part in a family party at his daughter's, cradling his grandchild and looking at a photograph of Margot.

When finished in April 2017, it will be the first purpose-built mosque in the Greek capital since the Greek War of Independence. There are already mosques from Ottoman times in Athens like the Tzistarakis Mosque and the Fethiye Mosque but they function as archaeological monuments nowadays. The project has been repeatedly delayed because of the opposition from the powerful Greek Orthodox Church and - in recent times - civil protests. The first law passed by the Greek Parliament about constructing a ‚Ä≥Turkish mosque‚Ä≥ in the Athens area was in 1890. In 1970, conservative Arab countries offered the funding of a mosque in Athens but neither the law nor the proposal were realized. Increased immigration from Muslim countries in recent decades has made the establishment more urgent‚Äîabout 200,000 Muslims live in the Athens area, many of whom are Pakistani and Albanians‚Äîbut until recently no official mosque building. The first attempt to establish a mosque in Athens dates to Law 2833 in 2000, which envisaged its establishment at Hourmouza in Paiania, and was intended to be financed by Saudi Arabia. Due to the reaction of the Church and the locals, the project stalled. In 2006, the effort was resumed with Law 3512, but with major modifications: it was decided that the construction would be financed solely by the Greek state, which would retain complete control over the mosque and appoint its imam. The project was repeatedly delayed due to judicial actions by various groups, which went all the way to the Council of State, and the fact that four successive public tenders received no interest from contractors. The fifth tender was finally successful, and was given to a consortium comprising four of Greece's biggest construction firms‚ÄîJ&P; ABAX, TERNA, AKTOR, and Intrakat. The contract for the construction was signed on 10 October 2016. The location had to be cleared by the police first, as it was occupied by far-right protesters, but construction began on 4 November.http://www.intrakat.gr/en/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%AE-%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%87%CE%AE-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B1/ The site, with a total surface of 17 stremmata, was handed over by the Hellenic Navy. Existing structures are to be torn down, and a new complex, including parking space and a children's playground, will be built in its place. The mosque itself will cover an area of 1,000 m2 and comprise two areas of worship, one for men with a capacity for 500, and one for women, with a capacity of 50. The mosque will not feature a minaret. Completion of the work is expected at the end of April 2017. The mosque will be financed by the Greek state, without any outside financial support. The budget is 887,000 Euros. In addition to the new mosque, the Greek government has given formal license to three mosques established privately by Muslim communities in Attica and one in Thebes.

Early and family life Robert Latham Owen was born to Dr. William Owen of Lynchburg, Virginia and his wife Jane Latham Owen. His Owen ancestors had emigrated from Wales, and the family had a record of public service as politicians, doctors and teachers. His brother Dr. William Otway Owen Sr. (1820‚Äì92), like their father practiced medicine in Lynchburg, and became Surgeon-in-Chief supervising thirty Confederate hospitals in Lynchburg during the American Civil War.Houck, Peter W. A Prototype of a Confederate Hospital Center in Lynchburg, Virginia. Lynchburg, Warwick House Publishing, 1986. As a young civil engineer, Owen surveyed for various railroads. In Jonesborough, Tennessee, he met schoolteacher Narcissa Clark Chisholm, orphaned daughter of Cherokee chief Thomas Chisholm. A granddaughter of Chief John D. Chisholm who led an expedition along the Arkansas River, she had been born in Arkansas before the Trail of Tears.Kate White, John Chisholm, A Soldier of Fortune, in East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, p. 66 n1 available at http://www.teachtnhistory.org/file/JohnChisholm, A Soldier of Fortune (White).pdf Rev. David Sullins married them. They had two sons: Maj. William Otway Owen M.D. (1854-1924, born in Tennessee and who became a U.S. Army doctor) and Robert Latham Owen Jr. (1856-1947, born after they moved back to Lynchburg, and who became one of the first two U.S. Senators from Oklahoma). The family lived in Lynchburg's best-known mansion, Point of Honor until 1870, and Dr. Owen Sr. operated the Vista Acres plantation in Campbell County. Career During the American Civil War, Robert Latham Owen accepted Confederate rifles to defend the railroad, which were delivered by Gen. Thomas Stonewall Jackson.findagrave #11431925, citing Library of Virginia accession 21381 Owen also criticized the chaotic military demands on his railroad's rolling stock, which was a crucial link to the salt in Saltville, Virginia, as well as Tennessee, among other routes.Angus James Johnston II, Virginia Railroads in the Civil War (North Carolina Press for Virginia Historical Society, 1961) p. 177 His wife Narcissa led about 500 women who sewed uniforms and otherwise assisted the Confederate cause. Union troops never conquered Lynchburg, although the city was threatened in the Battle of Lynchburg. Owen was among the citizens surrendering the short-term Virginia Capitol on April 12, 1865, three days after the surrender at Appomattox Court House. However, the conflict destroyed most of its rolling stock and much track. In late 1867, Robert Latham Owen Sr. resigned his position as President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railway because he opposed a proposed railway consolidation led by the colorful and highly political former Confederate General (and future U.S. Senator, 1881‚Äì87) William Mahone, who replaced him as president. Despite the opposition of Owen and prominent Lynchburg citizens James Garland, John W. Daniel and Col. R. W. Withers, Mahone's Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad acquired most of the stock of the formerly Lynchburg-owned Virginia and Tennessee Railway,W. Asbury Christian, Lynchburg and its people (Lynchburg: J.P. Bell 1900), p. 255. and merged it and the South Side Railroad into the new Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (some quipped that its initials, AM&O; meant \\"All Mine and Otelia's\\", referred to Mahone and his equally colorful wife, Otelia). However, the new railroad soon went bankrupt. Future U.S. Senator Carter Glass, who long opposed Mahone, worked on that reorganization early in his career. Meanwhile, Owen, Franklin Stearns and Gilbert C. Walker became the leading conservative (or True) Republican candidates for Virginia governor as Congressional Reconstruction was ending in 1868, to oppose Radical Republicans led by provisional governor Henry H. Wells.Richard Lowe, Republicans and Reconstruction in Virginia, 1856-1870 (Charlottesville, University of Virginia Press 1991), p. 162 Conservative Democrats had also formed a Committee of Nine to oppose that Constitution, especially its Confederate disenfranchisement provisions. Eventually, Stearns, L.H. Chandler, Edgar Allen, as well as former provost marshall and now Secretary of War John Schofield and the Committee of Nine succeeded in convincing newly elected President Ulysses Grant to separate the ratification votes on the two controversial anti-Confederate clauses from that concerning the proposed new Constitution (which passed by an overwhelming margin even as those two clauses were defeated). In the next election (Virginia's first after readmission) Conservative Republicans united with Conservative Democrats to nominate Gilbert C. Walker for governor, who defeated Wells. In the same election, Robert Latham Owen Sr. ran for (and won) a state senate seat, representing Campbell County and Lynchburg. Owen escaped tragedy by not attending a controversial Virginia Supreme Court hearing concerning Richmond's mayoral election of 1870, overcrowding in which caused a balcony to collapse, which then caused the floor to collapse into the General Assembly chamber below, with many killed and injuries.Kilcup (ed.), A Cherokee Woman's America: Memoirs of Narcissa Owen 1831-1907 (University of Florida Press) p. 100. Afterward, he bought a plantation near Norfolk that had been owned by his fellow surveyor, and moved his family there. His friend Thomas J. Kirkpatrick, Lynchburg's new school superintendent and a Confederate veteran, was elected to succeed Owen in the Virginia Senate on December 6, 1871.

Alexander Lazarev-GruzinskyAlexander Semyonovich Lazarev (1861-1927), who used the pen name Gruzinsky (The Georgian), was Chekhov's friend and prot√©g√© who in 1880s contributed stories and verses to Oskolki, Budilnik, Razvlecheniye and Strekoza. Chekhov edited his stories, advised him on style, but the two books of stories authored by Gruzinsky (in 1891 and 1911) were mediocre and had no success. He is best remembered for his assorted memoirs on Chekhov in which he remembered with great warmth and gratitude his young mentor who‚Äôd put so much effort into a literary talent that failed to develop. ‚Äì in his memoirs quoted Chekhov as once having told him: \\"Apparently, right after my 'Huntsman' had appeared in 'St Petersburg Gazette', Grigorovich visited Suvorin and said: 'Alexey Sergeyevich, please do invite Chekhov to Novoye Vremya.

It has been active since 1843. Its aim, written in its current mission statement, is to support young people in care and need to find their voice, to be healthy, to learn, develop and achieve and to gain an independent and positive place in society. The charity moved from promoting the ragged schools to providing night refuges then providing residential nautical training. It operated many large children's homes, and currently supports adolescents leaving care. At each stage it changed its name to reflect its new role. In 2006 it became Shaftesbury Young People. History The organisation dates back to 1843 when solicitors clerk William Williams, who encountered a group of cold, dirty and rowdy London boys chained together and being transported to Australia. As a personal response to his horror, he opened a ragged school in the St Giles rookery. His school was in a hayloft in Streatham Street, the following year 1844, a group of London ragged schools banded together to form the Ragged School Union. Lord Ashley, who later inherited the title of Lord Shaftesbury became the president- and thus got to know Williams. Ragged school Ragged schools taught the boys Christian beliefs, reading, writing and arithmetic and attempted to teach them a trade. In 1849 Streatham Street taught 314 boys and 18 of the scholar were seen as suitable to be awarded a free passage to Australia. It merged with two neighbouring schools in 1851 forming the St Giles and St George, Bloomsbury Ragged Schools. They also provided a night school and a Sunday school for girls with sewing classes. The next venture was to buy a permanent building on the corner of Broad Street and George Street. The temporary premises they vacated were converted into night refuges for homeless boys. As providing accommodation became more important they renamed themselves as St Giles and St George, Bloomsbury Refuge for Destitute Children Ragged and Industrial Schools. More premises were rented to create a refuge for boys in Arthur Street, while the girls remained for a time at Broad Street. In May 1860, forty girls were moved to Acton- and eventually to a home in Ealing. This house did all the other establishments laundry. The 1870 Education Act reduced the need for ragged schools and to reflect this the society changed its name again; this time to The National Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children and 'Chichester' Training Ship. It closed the last of its ragged schools in 1891. Emigration In June 1848, Lord Ashley made a speech in parliament proposing funds should be made available to assist suitable boys from ragged schools to emigrate to the colonies where they could easily find employment. This suggestion was enthusiastically supported by Williams and the Homes. Twenty two scholars were selected to be in the first group that left for New South Wales. Each was given a new suit of clothes and a Bible. In 1857 ten girls were escorted to Canada- and looked after till they were settled with a job. This led to the society renting a house in Hamilton, Ontario to act as a reception centre for the scholars. The society was involved with accompanied emigration until the 1920s Training Ships Upnor remembers In January 1866, the Pall Mall Gazette revealed the dire conditions suffered by boys in the causal ward of the Lambeth Workhouse. Lord Shaftesbury became patron to the society, and he launched an initiative to take boys off the streets and give them maritime training. They were resident on board the Chichester, a redundant frigate that was moored off Greenhithe which could house 250 boys at a time. This succeeded and by 1874, 1300 boys had graduated. A second frigate was obtained thanks to a ‚Ç§5000 donation from Lady Burdett-Coutts: this was the Arethusa and she was moored alongside the Chichester. In 1919 the society renamed itself as Shaftesbury Homes and Arethusa and the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII became president. The move to Upnor occurred in 1933, when the Arethusa was broken up and replaced a steel-hulled nitrates clipper, the Peking. It was renamed the Arethusa, and was refitted in Chatham Dockyard. The Arethusa II was moored across the river, in Lower Upnor. The figurehead from the wooden warship was preserved and displayed by Arethusa Pier in Upnor. Shore side accommodation and a swimming pool was built, and this continues today (2017) as the Arethusa Venture Centre. An Ocean going steam yacht, the Glen Strathallan was donated to the society in 1955. In 1975, there was less call for seamen, and the training school closed. The Peking was needing much maintenance work and was sold to the South Street Seaport museum. A third smaller ketch was bought in 1971 and renamed the Arethusa. It had a different role and was replaced by another vessel in 1982. Children's Homes The focus of the society changed and it sought to provide refuges outside London for London children. In 1868 the society purchased a farm in Bisley, Surrey. The first building, the Farm school was operational by 1871 and the second, Shaftesbury House, in 1873. The schools merged as a result of the 1918 Education Act. Surrey Education Committee took over the educational aspects in 1921, and the schools status changed from 'Elementary School' to 'Central School' in 1930. From 1944 until its closure in 1958 the school became a 'secondary school'. A further boys home was opened at Fortescue House, Twickenham. A home for girls was opened at Sudbury Hall, Wembley. The society experienced financial pressures during both of the world wars. The Curtis report and the 1948 Children's Act changed the direction of child care: adoption became the preferred option followed by fostering and the large children's homes that the society had been running were deprecated. It was recommended that children's homes should have no more than 12 residents. The larger homes were disposed of and the society moved to providing support for adolescents leaving care. Two adolescent hostels were opened Putney in 1975, and the long-standing premises in Esher House, East Molesley became a teenage mother and baby hostel. A support centre for parents having difficulty with their children was opened in Clapham. In 2006, the charity renamed itself Shaftesbury Young People.

Gateway to the prior's courtyard. The Priory of Saint-Arnoul, named after a legendary fifth-century bishop of Tours, is located in Cr√©py-en-Valois in France. It was founded between 935 and 943 by Count Ralph II of Valois as a chapter of canons regular, then re-founded as a Benedictine abbey by Count Walter II in 1008. In 1076, Count Simon, on a pilgrimage to Rome, offered it to Abbot Hugh of Cluny as a daughter house. Their meeting was itself the work of Pope Gregory VII. Hugh returned to France with Simon and personally stayed at Saint-Arnoul to reform it along Cluniac lines, against the resistance of the monks. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the priory prospered through numerous gifts. The west wall and the Romanesque crypt, both preserved today, were built in the final decades of the eleventh century. The main buildings, in use until the dissolution of the priory, were constructed in the Gothic style in four separate campaigns between 1170 and 1260. Saint-Arnoul was subject to the direct authority of Cluny, and was one of the highest ranking Cluniac priories. Its charter specified that it had twenty-eight members, but in the early fourteenth century this number was exceeded. The priory suffered heavily during the Hundred Years' War (1337‚Äì1453). Its choir was burnt by the English in 1431 and never rebuilt. In the sixteenth century the commendatory priors replaced the furnishings, and in the eighteenth the conventual buildings were renovated. In 1790, the French Revolution formally abolished all religious orders and Saint- Arnoul was suppressed. The prior's house became a private residence, which it remains today. The east wing of the priory became a boarding school, which it remained until 1940. The building still stands. All the other buildings fell into ruin or were destroyed. The medieval ruins are preserved as a monument historique (historic monument) according to a decree of 24 February 1943. Nonetheless, some medieval walls were destroyed in 1964, when the municipal government proceeded with work without the approval of the Service des Monuments Historiques. The gateway to the courtyard of the prior's house, erected in 1759, was also inscribed as a historic monument on 9 March 1979. The Association pour la restauration et l'animation de Saint-Arnoul (Association for the Restoration and Animation of Saint-Arnoul) currently oversees the surviving east wing. Restored areas are open to the public. Of most interest to researchers is the crypt, which is of unusually large size and of a style rare for the region. It was designed after the crypt of the abbey of Saint-Beno√Æt-sur-Loire.

There is some ambiguity about the which officers commanded her and when. At one point Midshipman John F. Devonshire (eventually Admiral Sir John Devenshire) took command on the death of Berbices commander. Devonshire then patrolled the coasts of Puerto Rico where he, with the Spaniards, suppressed the French privateers that not only impeded the island's commerce, but also materially obstructed the resupply of the British army in Martinique.United Service journal, 1840, Part 1, January, p.95.

At the Storchen stop, Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft provides also public transportation towards B√ºrkliplatz and Z√ºrichhorn. Individual transportation usually is prohibited. The area is part of the pedestrian zone in the old town of Z√ºrich, hence, vehicle traffic is limited between lower Limmatquai downstream and the Bellevueplatz square upstream.  History  In 70/75 AD a harbor district rose on the newly acquired lands on the Limmat riverbank at the foot of the former Oppidum Lindenhof at the Schipfe‚ÄìWeinplatz area, and the settlement area of the Gallo-Roman Turicum was extended on the right bank of the Limmat at the present Limmatquai. Public buildings made of stone and paved roads were built. Suggested by the recent archaeological evidence uncovered during construction at M√ºnsterbr√ºcke, the present Weinplatz may have been the site of the civilian harbour of the Celtic-Roman Turicum. At the site of the present Weinplatz towards St. Peterhofstatt the remains of remarkable 2nd to 4th century AD Thermae were excavated. Being part of the ancient Kornhausplatz (Rathhausbr√ºcke) plaza, Weinplatz was used as a grain and vegetable store in medieval times, and became in 1630 the public market for local wines, the present Weinplatz square. Despite the relocation of the market to the M√ºnsterhof plaza in 1647, the name is still the same. Some medieval sources mention the Rother Turm building, meaning the \\"red tower\\" which was used by the House of Rapperswil as its seat in Z√ºrich in the early 13th century; much later it became a 'literature caf√©' and was demolished. Weinplatz now is a popular tourist destination, nearby the M√ºnsterhof plaza, and it is the location of some small shops and caf√©s.  Points of interest   Thermengasse  1st-century AD mosaics at Thermengasse Towards St. Peterhofstatt, the remains of the Roman Thermae were discovered on occasion of archaeological excavations in 1983/84. The site is partially open to the public and illustrated by information boards, as well as replicas of some of the artefacts that were found at the site.  Haus zum Schwert  First mentioned in 1265, the Z√ºrich knight Jakob M√ºlner handed over his residential tower zum Schwert (literally: sword tower) to the Fraum√ºnster Abbey, and returned it as a fief. From the daughters of Gotfried II, in 1406 the complex came to Hans Brunner who set up an inn. Today, the former tower is an accommodation building and houses a shop at its ground floor.  Hotel Zum Storchen  The origin of the name \\"Zum Storchen\\" (literally: To the Stork) is unclear, but a local legend tells that the name comes from several of rare black storks that brooded on its roof long ago. In 1357, the building \\"Hus zum Storchen\\" (literally stork house) was mentioned for the first time in tax records of the city. About 100 years later, it was designated as a hostel, a tradition that lasted for several hundred years. In 1938 the medieval structure was rebuilt to house the present hotel, bar and restaurant. The building also serves as the guild house of the Zunft zur Schiffleuten, a medieval guild of the fishermen and boatmen, whose name is perhaps a reference to the ancient harbour at the Weinplatz square near the hotel.

Life Slee was born at Hillegom on 23 September 1841, the son of Cornelis van Slee and Anna Barbera Geertruida Romeny. He studied Theology at the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam and at Leiden University. In 1868 he married Elisabeth Kenno and was appointed minister at Herwijnen.

Slee retired as a preacher in 1914, and in 1914 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Groningen. In 1917 he organised a major exhibition on Luther in the library at Deventer, to mark the fourth centenary of the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. His wife died in 1920.

Quarrie was born at Ballavair, Kirk Bride, in around 1846, the eighth child of John Quarrie and Mary Hardie.A Bibliographical Account of Works Relating to the Isle of Man, compiled and edited by William Cubbon, London: Humphrey Milford, Vol. II, 1939, pp. 872‚Äì874'George Quarrie (1846‚Äì1926)' on the Manx Notebook website (accessed 19 October 2015) By 1881 he was a General Commission Agent in Barrow-in-Furness, where he was married. It was when in England that Quarrie published The Melliah, initially in 1880 and then in 1883. The poem recalls in Manx dialect the traditional Manx process and celebration of collecting in the harvest. This poem, written of a specific Melliah at the Ballavair farm in the 1850s,'The Melliah: Author's Statement', Manx Sun, 8 October 1898 came to be celebrated as a poem that \\"pulses with reality and humour and a hearty enjoyment of life.\\"'Death of a Manx Poet', Isle of Man Examiner, 6 August 1926 Recording individual characters and occurrences from the Melliah that Quarrie enjoyed in his youth, the poem represents one of the key sources for one of the major festivals in the traditional Manx farming calendar. The vividness and richness of Quarrie's description of the Melliah was the main source behind an important scene in Hall Caine's The Manxman. This apparent plagiarism caused much controversy in the Manx newspapers once Quarrie's detailed explication of the connection between the two works was published in October 1889. Quarrie emigrated to New York City in 1889 where he gained considerable success as a journalist over the subsequent forty years.'Personal and Otherwise', Manxman, 8 October 1898 By September 1898 he was living at 2720 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn,'Old Coaching Days in the Isle of Man', Manx Sun, 3 Sep 1898 where he had a daughter.'Births, Marriages and Deaths', Manx Sun, 26 November 1898 By 1913 Quarrie was signing his poems from 230 W. 116 St., New York,'On Reading the Courier', Ramsey Courier, 5 December 1913 and by April 1918 he was living at 330 East 55th Street.'A War Rubaiyat', Manx Quarterly, No. 19, 1918 Whilst in America, Quarrie continued to write poems about his youth in the north of the Isle of Man, receiving comments in the Manx press such as: \\"Mr Quarrie knew the Isle of Man thoroughly. This was proved in almost every line of his poetry.\\"'A Night with the Poets', Manx Sun 20 January 1900 As well as his literary connection to Hall Caine, Quarrie is recognised as having influenced P.

Since the 1990s, libraries have emerged in the district capitals with international aid. The itinerant libraries set up by the Portuguese Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in 2000 brought books to more communities. In 1994, the library of the National Assembly was established. Its initial collection was based on the former collection of the town hall library. Finally, the public National Library was opened in May 2002, financed by China.

The player follows a cast of characters around a Melbourne back-alley coffeehouse staffed by necromancers, named the 'Terminal'. In the Terminal, the souls of the recently departed are given a final 24 hours to reside in the world alongside the living. The game was released on July 17, 2020 for macOS and iOS via Apple Arcade, and July 22, 2020 for Microsoft Windows. Necrobarista has upcoming ports for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch scheduled to release in 2021. Overview Necrobarista is a visual novel set in a Melbourne coffee shop that serves both the living and dead, and is visited by gangsters, hipsters, and necromancers. Unlike the 2D art typical to the genre, it is presented through cinematic 3D sequences. Development and release The game is developed by the Australian studio Route 59, using the Unity game engine. The visual style of the 3D cinematics was influenced by anime. The game was announced for release in October 2017 for Microsoft Windows and MacOS, but was delayed to July 22, 2020, with a Nintendo Switch version also planned for later release.http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/09/08/pax-west-2017-necrobarista- gives-the-visual-novel-a-caffeinated-kick/271076/ The composer for the project is Kevin Penkin. Reception Pre-release In pre-release coverage, multiple critics praised the game's presentation. Nathan Grayson at Kotaku and Kyle LeClair at Hardcore Gamer both compared it to the Japanese developer Atlus's titles, with Grayson describing it as stylish and like Persona in a coffee shop, and LeClair saying that the anime-like aesthetics, the music and the atmosphere \\"wouldn't seem out of place in a top-level Atlus game\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun Kate Gray said that the game looks \\"so good you just want to eat [it]\\", praising the sunset-like color palette used and comparing it to the visual style of the game Firewatch. Joel Couture of Siliconera called the art style \\"striking\\", with its use of 3D art rather than the traditional animation and static 2D images common to the visual novel genre. Gray, while noting that it was difficult to pinpoint the exact tone intended from just the trailer, also said that she liked the concept of a coffee shop visited by both the dead and the living, and LeClair said that the environment interaction and investigation shown in the trailer felt like they were setting up an interesting mystery.

If activated into federal service, it is gained by Air Mobility Command. Overview The group flies the Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker. Its mission is to train and equip combat ready aircrews and support personnel to perform worldwide air refueling and airlift. Combat ready intelligence technical support is also available for worldwide assignment. The group supports state and local contingencies when directed by the Governor of Alabama. Units The 117th Operations Group consists of the following units: * 106th Air Refueling Squadron * 99th Air Refueling Squadron (attached) The 99th Air Refueling Squadron is an active duty associate unit that supports and flies the group's aircraft. * 117th Operations Support Flight History Background In May 1946, the Army Air Forces redesignated 27 of its combat groups and allotted them to the National Guard. One of these groups was the 354th Fighter Group, which became the 117th Fighter Group. However, in 1956, the Air Force decided to return the 354th Group to the active force. To accomplish this, the 1946 redesignation and allotment was rescinded on 26 September 1956, effective 24 March 1946. The same order constituted the 117th Fighter Group effective on 24 March 1946, severing any relation between the two units.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 235 Initial activation The 117th Fighter Group was extended federal recognition by the National Guard Bureau on 1 October 1947 at Birmingham Municipal Airport, Alabama. As they were organized and received federal recognition, the 153d Fighter Squadron of the Mississippi National Guard, the 157th Fighter Squadron of the South Carolina National Guard and the 160th Fighter Squadron of the Alabama National Guard were assigned. Training was initially supervised by Air Defense Command, but on 1 July 1948, Continental Air Command assumed responsibility for training Guard and Reserve units. Korean War activation RF-80Cs of the 160th Tactical Recon SquadronAircraft in the foreground is Lockheed RF-80C-11-LO Shooting Star serial 45-839. Photo taken at Neubiberg AB in 1952. The 117th was one of the first Guard units to be ordered to active service for the Korean War, entering active service on 22 October 1950. Of the group's squadrons, only the 157th and 160th remained assigned to the group when activated. The group moved to Lawson Air Force Base, Georgia, where it was converted to a reconnaissance unit, becoming the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, adding another federalized squadron, the 112th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. At Lawson, the group trained for overseas deployment. Group Douglas RB-26CAircraft is Douglas A/RB-26C-40-DT Invader serial 44-35599 in a temporary wooden nose \\"hangar\\", January 1953. Notice the temporary Pierced Steel Planking used for the parking apron with the snow and ice. This aircraft was sold to France in September 1956. It was eventually withdrawn from use in May 1967 and scrapped. The group's organization differed from that of regular Air Force units, which had operated under the Wing Base Organization system since 1948. On 30 November 1950, the Air Force activated the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and support units and the group was assigned to the new wing. At Lawson, the 157th and 160th squadrons converted to Lockheed RF-80 Shooting Star daylight photo-reconnaissance jet aircraft, while the 112th, which had been a light bomber unit, retained its Douglas RB-26C Invaders, becoming a night reconnaissance unit. The original plan was to deploy the 117th to France and reinforce the United States Air Forces in Europe at a new base, Toul-Rosi√®res Air Base. However Toul Air Base was still under construction, and delays forced the 117th to temporarily move to Neubiberg Air Base, Germany, along with its 160th Squadron, while the 112th was transferred to Wiesbaden Air Base and the 157th was located at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base. Headquarters and support organizations were located at Toul. The group and 112th Squadron finally moved to Toul, but the two F-80 squadrons remained in Germany while federalized. On 10 July 1952 the 117th was released from active duty and inactivated. The 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was activated in its place and the mission, personnel and equipment of the 117th were transferred to the 10th.See Maurer, Combat Units, p. 51 (activation of the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Group at Toul)Ravenstein, p. 25 (10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing replaced 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing) Return to Alabama Air National Guard and inactivation 106th Squadron RF-84F ThunderflashAircraft is Republic RF-84F-30-RE Thunderflash serial 52-7425. The group was again activated at Birmingham Airport, remaining the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group in state service. Two of its squadrons, the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, located with the group at Birmingham and the 160th at Dannelly Field, were Alabama Air National Guard units, while the 183d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was located at Hawkins Field, Mississippi. The group continued to fly the RB-26C until May 1957 when new Republic RF-84F Thunderflash jet reconnaissance aircraft replaced them.See 106th Air Refueling Squadron Lineage & Honors The group continued to train in tactical reconnaissance missions throughout the 1950s with the Thunderflashes until inactivated in 1959. The 117th Wing had been mobilized during the during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. This mobilization demonstrated that although mobilizing a wing with dispersed flying units was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing individual flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.Cantwell, pp. 189-191 To resolve this, the Air Force determined to reorganize its National Guard wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its squadrons to facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.See Cantwell, p. 156 (similar problem with reserve units) Shortly after the 117th Wing returned to Alabama in July, the group was again activated as this plan was implemented. The 184th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, of the Arkansas Air National Guard was briefly assigned to the group while this reorganization was being implemented. The group remained active until December 1974, when the Air Force inactivated groups located on the same station as the wing to which they were assigned. Reactivation 106th Squadron RF-4C Phantom IIAircraft is McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II serial 64-1047. Taken at Shaikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain during Operation Desert Shield. The camels painted on its intake represent the missions flown. 1047 Flew 172 sorties in Desert Shield. After its retirement in May 1994, the aircraft was flown to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio where today it is on permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. It had more than 7,300 hours of flying time. In 1993, the Air National Guard reorganized under the Air Force's Objective wing concept, which reintroduced groups under operational wings. The group, redesignated the 117th Operations Group, was again activated as an element of the 117th Reconnaissance Wing. After the end of Desert Storm, the phaseout of the McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II, flown by the 117th was accelerated. During 1994, the group's RF-4Cs were sent to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona for retirement. On 1 October, the wing was redesignated the 117th Air Refueling Wing and began to fly Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, the first tanker arriving later that month. After the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the group deployed to MacDill Air Force Base, Florida and began refueling McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft flying combat air patrol missions over major cities in the Southeastern United States as part of Operation Noble Eagle. In 2009, the 99th Air Refueling Squadron, a regular unit assigned to the 6th Operations Group was activated. Its members operate and maintain the group's aircraft alongside the Guardsmen assigned to the 106th Air Refueling Squadron.

The brand originated as a cable television channel and interactive website, both centered around the concepts of imagination, creativity, and education. Since its launch, the brand has expanded to include a mobile streaming app and several defunct programming blocks worldwide. At launch, Noggin was primarily aimed at pre- teens and teenagers, much like Nickelodeon. It included three sectors of shows: the main block of pre-teen and teen programming, an early morning block for younger children, and a nighttime block for \\"adult retro\\" programs. The channel mainly showed reruns from Sesame Workshop's content library. In its first three years, it produced several original shows: the teen reality show A Walk in Your Shoes, the short-form puppetry series Oobi, the game show Sponk!, and the variety series Phred on Your Head Show. In April 2002, the Noggin channel discarded its retro block and extended its preschool and teen blocks to last 12 hours each per day. The preschool block aired from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, and the teen block (now titled \\"The N\\") ran from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. The older-skewing shows that made up Noggin's original tween and teen lineup aired exclusively during The N. Imported series from the Nick Jr. block began to overtake Noggin's daytime lineup as it grew, and most of the Sesame Workshop branding that had defined the network's early years was dropped. Despite this, Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop continued a co-production partnership for Noggin until 2009, when the channel closed. Noggin started out as an experimental brand, and its on-air commercials stressed imagination and thinking through themed short films that were often surreal and abstract. Before the brand was overtaken by Nick Jr., Noggin's marketing team sought out \\"sick and twisted\\" independent animators to make their on-air presence look unique. After Noggin introduced its daytime block for preschoolers, it was rebranded with a more consistent brand identity, with the more experimental material being confined to The N block. The Noggin brand was dormant from 2009 until 2015, when Nickelodeon announced that Noggin would be \\"coming back\\" as a mobile streaming app, which launched on March 5, 2015. Brand elements Logo and branding Noggin's logo spots used a wide range of styles, including live-action, stop motion, puppetry, and traditional animation. Until 2019, Noggin's brand was defined by its versatile character logo: the bottom half of a smiling face. The upper half of the logo featured various icons that represented a certain topic or idea that the head was \\"thinking of\\" (e.g. a beaker to reflect science, flowers to reflect springtime). In the network's early years, hundreds of different \\"toppers\\" were designed for the logo, and they were used throughout Noggin's commercials and website. The face in the logo was allowed to wink, show its teeth, and make expressions based on the theme, making it interactive and showing it as a character of itself. Noggin's artists were given a lot of creative freedom for their designs, with one rule being that the toppers should always complement the Noggin face, not outshine or overpower it. Noggin's logo was featured in a large amount of original shorts and animations that ran between shows on the channel. Noggin's marketing team intentionally looked to hire \\"sick and twisted\\" independent animators to create station ID commercials, hoping that they could each bring their own personal design elements to the logo. The goal was to make the logo, as well as the channel as a whole, \\"look unlike any other network.\\" After Noggin extended its preschool daytime block in 2002, a new set of \\"topper\\" designs were introduced, based on traditional children's art such as crayon drawings and paper crafts. In 2019, Nickelodeon retired the original Noggin face logo along with former hosts Moose and Zee. The logo was replaced with a lowercase noggin wordmark written in purple, while Moose and Zee were replaced with \\"more recognizable\\" characters from Nickelodeon's preschool shows. Television channel The first and most important part of the Noggin brand name was a cable and satellite television channel, which ran from February 2, 1999 until September 28, 2009. During its first few years, Noggin's lineup mainly showed reruns from Sesame Workshop and Nickelodeon's libraries. Noggin ran reruns of classic The Electric Company and 3-2-1 Contact episodes, hoping to attract an audience of teenagers and Generation Xers who had watched the shows growing up. The providers had over 5,000 hours of library material to broadcast. Noggin's first original show for 6-12-year-olds was A Walk In Your Shoes, which was made because Noggin felt that this age group was \\"underserved when it comes to new, quality educational television.\\" A live game show aimed at pre-teens, Sponk!, premiered a year afterwards. This was one of many Noggin shows that featured viewer-submitted content through Noggin's website, along with the animated Phred on Your Head and its spin-off URL with Phred. In 2002, the channel divided itself into two blocks: a daytime block for preschoolers and a nighttime block, The N, for teens. Noggin consistently received ratings that were substantially higher than Nickelodeon's other sister channels. It was viewed by an average of 529,000 households daily in early 2009. At the time of its closure, Noggin reached nearly 70 million households in the United States (as opposed to the 1.5 million subscribers it reached upon being launched). The N Noggin's teen-oriented block, The N, aired nightly at 6 p.m. The N was a nighttime programming block on the Noggin channel, aimed at pre-teens and teenagers. It premiered on April 1, 2002, and aired until December 31, 2007. Promotions advertised the block as \\"The N: The New Name for Nighttime on Noggin.\\" It took several months for Noggin to choose the right name for the block; as reported by Kidscreen in 2002, they needed a name to \\"help distance and distinguish the tween programming from the preschool fare,\\" but the legal department also required the block to maintain a relation to Noggin's main name. The older-targeted shows that previously made up Noggin's tween-focused lineup‚Äîsuch as A Walk in Your Shoes and Sponk!‚Äîaired during The N from 2002 onward. Several new shows were also made for The N block, such as the news program Real Access, the game show Best Friend's Date, the animated comedy O'Grady, and the drama South of Nowhere. The N was also the U.S. broadcast home of Degrassi: The Next Generation, the latest iteration of the eponymous Canadian teen drama franchise. All of The N's original programming was greenlit, owned and produced by Noggin LLC, the same company which produced all of Noggin's original preschool series. The copyright bylines for Noggin's preschool and teen shows both read \\"Copyright Noggin LLC.\\" From 2008 to 2009, The N had its own short-lived 24-hour channel, still operated entirely by Noggin LLC, but the channel was later closed and merged with Nickelodeon's block TEENick to form TeenNick. Websites One of Viacom and Sesame Workshop's goals was to develop Noggin into a \\"cable-computer hybrid.\\" Noggin.com, the channel's website, was launched in 1999 as a portal for exclusive content. Unlike Nick.com and other previous online ventures, the website was integrated into many television shows. Viewers were encouraged to offer suggestions for programs, such as the tween-oriented game show Sponk!, through the site. Throughout 2000, Bill Nye of Bill Nye the Science Guy answered questions asked by Noggin.com users between airings of his show. User-generated content submitted to Noggin.com was the focal point of The URL with Phred Show (whose title is a reference to the Noggin.com URL). In 2001, Noggin launched \\"Chattervision\\", which allowed viewers to comment on the network's programming through the website and see their conversations appear live on TV. In 2001, CRC Press published \\"Interactive Design for Media and the Web\\", which provided an in-depth description of Noggin.com and stated that it included \\"complex and confounding games that kids will enjoy.\\" Noggin.com was also listed in Dierdre Kelly's book \\"1001 Best Websites for Kids,\\" published in the same year. In 2004, the site was the recipient of a Webby Award in the \\"Broadband\\" category. Later that year, it won first place in the \\"Brand Image and Positioning\\" category at the 21st Annual CTAM Mark Awards. 2004 also saw the release of Shell Education's \\"Must See Websites for Parents & Kids\\" book, which featured Noggin.com. Time Magazine included the Noggin site on its \\"50 Best Websites of 2004\\" list. It won a second Webby in the Youth category in 2005. In 2006, John Braheny published \\"The Craft & Business of Songwriting\\", which included a brief entry about Noggin.com's musical content (calling it \\"an innovative and popular site...that presents videos of children's artists\\"). Jean Armour Polly of Common Sense Media gave the site a positive review in 2007, noting that \\"young kids will get a kick out of playing games, coloring printable pages, and singing along to music videos all featuring their favorite TV characters.\\" In 2008, it received a Parents' Choice Award and a nomination for a third Webby. Viacom put $100 million toward online gaming initiatives, such as a subscription-based educational site called MyNoggin, in July 2007. The MyNoggin website was initially scheduled to launch in early September of that year, but was not made available to the public until October. The site's content was curriculum-based and intended for children in preschool through first grade. The games on MyNoggin covered major school subjects and included Noggin characters. In addition to activities, MyNoggin included printable workbooks that expanded upon math and science concepts. Parents were able to monitor their children's growth and activity on the site through daily progress reports. The website was free of advertisements and supported by subscriptions, which were available for online purchase and through prepaid game cards sold throughout 2008. Charter, Insight and Cox Communications customers were given unlimited access to MyNoggin as part of their cable subscriptions. The site also offered a week-long free trial. Mobile apps A mobile streaming app featuring episodes of Noggin shows was announced in January 2015. Most programs on the app were cancelled prior to its development. The application was unveiled in February 2015 and released on March 5 for iOS systems. It is updated monthly and includes full seasons of productions from Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Nelvana. In May 2015, many shows that had previously been available on Amazon Instant Video were moved to the Noggin app as a result of low sales. On November 18, 2015, it was made available for Android, Apple TV, and Kindle. On April 8, 2016, Alcatel Mobile announced that the Noggin app would come pre-loaded on its Alcatel Xess tablet. The app received mixed reviews upon release. Brad Tuttle of Time predicted that paying $6 a month for a streaming app with much less content than Netflix would not be a popular idea with parents. Scott Porch of Wired wrote positively of Viacom's efforts to decrease their dependence on cable subscriptions with the app, but noticed that it was only \\"baby steps toward the no-cable-required model.\\" Amanda Bindel of Common Sense Media commended the user-friendly layout and educational content, but felt that it lacked sufficient parental controls. In fall 2015, the app received a Parents' Choice Award in the Mobile Apps category. Two international apps based on Noggin have been launched. In November 2015, a Spanish streaming app was released under the Noggin title in Latin America. It includes games based on Nick Jr. programs and full episodes of shows unavailable on the English app, such as the Spanish dubs of Roary the Racing Car and Rugrats. The app currently has a Facebook page and a section on the MundoNick website. A Portuguese version was released to Google Play and the Brazilian App Store on November 21, 2015. Programming blocks Noggin was featured as a programming block on Nick Jr. UK from May 2004 until August 2005. It ran for two hours every night and included reruns of syndicated British television series for children. On January 30, 2006, Noggin was launched as a block on TMF in the United Kingdom. The channel was available exclusively to Freeview subscribers at the time. It ran every weekday from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. The main Nickelodeon channel included a Noggin programming block as part of its lineup from 1999 to 2001. The block was originally titled \\"Noggins Up\\" and became \\"Noggin on Nickelodeon\\" during its second year on the air. It showcased one tween-oriented program every weekday, including A Walk In Your Shoes and On the Team. The timeslot proved successful in attracting thousands of visitors to the Noggin.com site. Nickelodeon revived the block for a single day on April 7, 2003 to advertise the restructuring of Noggin's lineup. Commercials for the Noggin channel were also played between each regular program. Following the block's removal, premiere episodes of Noggin series were frequently simulcast on Nickelodeon and Noggin. TV Land also aired a Noggin TV special in 1999. Spanning two hours, the special primarily showcased The Electric Company, along with commercials for Noggin. On-air continuity during the block included guest appearances by former Electric Company stars such as Mel Brooks, Bill Cosby, Morgan Freeman, Rita Moreno, and Joan Rivers. Other media In November 2005, Noggin signed its first merchandising agreement with the online marketplace CafePress. Themed notebooks, cards, mousepads, and clothing were sold on the Noggin website from then until 2009. The shop was created to satisfy parents who had been requesting merchandise since the brand's launch. Angela Leaney, Noggin's senior vice president of brand communications, stated that Noggin had \\"a huge, loyal following and we could not resist the calls from our audience, for Noggin merchandise, any longer.\\" CafePress co-founder Fred Durham added that Noggin attracted strong interest from his company because of its \\"dedicated fan base,\\" and that his goal was to share the products \\"with [Noggin's] millions of fans through quality branded merchandise.\\" Christmas ornaments, which were only sold during the month of December, became the shop's best-selling items of 2005. History Creation On April 28, 1998, Viacom and Sesame Workshop put together an initial investment of $100 million to start the first strictly educational television channel for children. Both organizations wished to combine television and online services to create a \\"kids' thinking channel,\\" which was named Noggin (derived from a slang term for \\"head\\") to reflect its purpose to educate. Noggin's primary goal was to provide informative entertainment for children aged 6‚Äì12. Sesame Workshop initially planned for it to be an advertiser-supported service, but later decided that it should debut as a commercial-free network. To develop ideas for original series, Noggin partnered with schools across the United States to research what would \\"make fun educational\\" for grade schoolers and middle schoolers. In 1999, it provided each school involved up to $7,100 to run focus groups with students and teachers. The students' opinions and reactions to different activities were recorded and used to improve the content shown on Noggin. Early history On February 2, 1999, the Noggin channel launched to over 1.5 million subscribers via national satellite television provider Dish Network. It was marketed as both a satellite television station and a digital network. Sweepstakes were a major part of Noggin's early advertising. In April 1999, it sponsored a contest in which viewers who submitted the correct lyrics of The Electric Company theme song had a chance to have their electric bills paid for a year. In 2000, Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop distributed packages of school supplies (called \\"Noggin's Master of Suspense Kits\\") to 50,000 U.S. teachers as part of a sweepstakes designed to \\"celebrate creative, thoughtful educational instruction.\\" Noggin made an effort to create more interactive programming in 2001, utilizing its website as a way to include viewer participation in many of its shows. It released a tween-oriented game show titled Sponk! in September, which included participation from children online and allowed Noggin.com visitors to chat with the hosts. The URL with Phred Show, which focused on content submitted to Noggin.com from viewers, launched in the same month. Network repositioning In 2001, the Jim Henson Company sold its stake in Noggin to Sesame Workshop along with the rights to Sesame Streets characters. This left Oobi, which began production in 2000, as the only preschool series created while the company and Sesame Workshop both controlled Noggin's programming. In March 2002, Noggin manager Tom Ascheim announced plans to shift Noggin's demographic to preschoolers and create a new block for older children. On April 1, 2002, the channel space was divided into two blocks: Noggin, an extension of the channel's preschool block, and The N, targeted at pre-teens. In August 2002, Sesame Workshop sold its 50% share of Noggin to Viacom. The buyout was partially caused by CTW's need to pay off debt, in addition to its interest in partnering with other broadcasters. While this limited Sesame Workshop's control over the network's daily operations, it did not affect the company's influence on the programming lineup as Viacom entered a multi-year production deal with Sesame Workshop shortly after the split and continued to broadcast co-produced series (such as Play with Me Sesame). As part of the arrangement, Noggin became the U.S. broadcaster of several shows made by the Workshop without Noggin's involvement, such as Tiny Planets and Pinky Dinky Doo. Following the split, creative executives from Noggin toured New York schools in search of ways to improve the channel's programming and continuity. Amy Friedman, senior vice president of development at Noggin, decided to model the channel after a well-run preschool. These ideas took effect in April 2003, when Noggin's slogan was changed to \\"It's Like Preschool on TV.\\" The changes also included revised branding and a new lineup, divided into thematic blocks based on key curricular knowledge. On December 31, 2003, a Nielsen Media Research report confirmed that the redesigned Noggin channel was available in 37.1 million households. Modern history On March 12, 2009, Viacom announced that the Noggin channel would be replaced by a 24-hour channel based on Nickelodeon's long-running Nick Jr. block. The N, on the other hand, would be merged with Nickelodeon's TEENick block to form a standalone channel aimed at teenagers, known as TeenNick. The move, which was intended to make all channels in the Nickelodeon family easily recognizable, took place on September 28, 2009. Although several Noggin shows (along with the Moose and Zee interstitials) were carried over to the Nick Jr. channel, all Noggin continuity was later phased out completely by March 1, 2012. On January 29, 2015, Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman confirmed that the Noggin brand would be relaunched as a set of mobile subscription services. Commercials for the service have aired regularly across all Nickelodeon channels since the apps' release. On May 10, 2019, Viacom held their Q2 2019 earnings conference call, in which they announced that the Noggin app had reached 2.5 million subscribers and that it would receive a major upgrade. The updates were made following Nickelodeon's acquisition of another educational app called Sparkler. In June 2019, Nickelodeon unveiled a new Noggin logo, which was used on the redesigned Noggin website and app. Live events Noggin's float at America's Thanksgiving Parade in 2005. On April 6, 2002, Noggin launched a live version of its Play with Me Sesame series. It featured walk-around characters, interactive skits, and music from the show. Marketed as Noggin's Play with Me Sesame Mall Tour, the live show was presented in nine cities. It became a finalist in the 2003 Beacon Awards and received national coverage on CBS's news program The Early Show. In May 2002, the Jillian's restaurant chain signed on as Noggin's first corporate marketing partner. Fifteen restaurants provided in-store branding based on Noggin series from then until 2004. Jillian's offered \\"Noggin Play Days\\" each Wednesday afternoon. At these events, attendees could watch a live feed of Noggin with themed activities and meals. In March 2004, Noggin partnered with General Growth Property shopping malls to host a free educational program called Club Noggin. It debuted at five test malls in April of the same year. Attendance at the first several events exceeded expectations, leading General Growth to bring Club Noggin to over 100 malls across the United States. The monthly events were hosted by trained YMCA leaders, who distributed Noggin posters and merchandise to attendees. Each meeting was themed around a different Noggin character and encouraged visitors to create art projects based on the character. Television actors hosted Club Noggin events on occasion. The WB's Lori Moiti√© and RJ Johnson hosted sessions throughout 2005. Donovan Patton of Blue's Clues made appearances at Club Noggin in July 2006 to promote his show's tenth anniversary. Although Club Noggin was free, attendees were required to pre-register through the Noggin website. In 2005, Club Noggin received a Silver Community Relations Award in the International Council of Shopping Centers' MAXI Competition. In August 2005, Noggin and Highland Capital Partners produced \\"Jamarama Live\\", a music festival that toured the United States. It began in October and continued until late 2006. Laurie Berkner, a musician on Jack's Big Music Show, performed at many Jamarama venues on the East Coast. The festival also included meet-and-greet opportunities with a mascot costume of Moose A. Moose. The characters hosted karaoke, face-painting, and storytelling sessions during intermissions. Reviewers for Time Magazine compared Jamarama to a family-friendly version of Lollapalooza. Jamarama proved more popular than other children's stage shows running at the time, such as those featuring Mickey Mouse. Noggin executives considered on-air advertisements a major contributor to the event's success. After the tour ended, a DVD set including Jamarama performances was released. A Noggin float appeared at the 79th annual America's Thanksgiving Parade, held on November 24, 2005. In August 2007, Noggin partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and sponsored 14,000 of the organization's national Trike-A-Thon events. The network promoted the events through a series of four commercials that ran until summer 2008. At each Trike-A-Thon, attendees received workbooks featuring Noggin characters and certificates from Noggin's \\"Gold Star Club.\\" Additionally, every school that hosted a Trike-A- Thon was thanked by Noggin on-air.

Origin Seierstad explains in the epilogue that Tina Brown commissioned her to get anything on \\"that man\\" for publication in Newsweek. Instead she wrote about the reaction in Norway then left for Libya. When Breivik's trial was set to begin, Brown tried again. Seierstad returned to Norway and sat in the courtroom for all 10 weeks of the trial. In Seierstad's words she was \\"drip-fed the details of the planning and execution of the act of terrorism... these were drops of stories... that were tailored for the purpose of the trial.\\" She wanted to know what really happened (the stream of events not just the drops) so she embarked on the project that became One of Us. She read the police reports, the confidential psychiatric reports, the 22 July commission report, and Breivik's own writing. She interviewed families, friends, and politicians. In her author's note Seierstad reports that all facts told in the narrative come from these sources. Title Seierstad writes about the origins of the title in the epilogue. > One of Us is a book about belonging, a book about community... > geographically, politically, and with families. Bano's... greatest > aspiration was to be become one of us. There were no shortcuts. This is also > a book about looking for a way to belong and not finding it. The perpetrator > ultimately opted-out of the community and chose to strike at it in the most > brutal of ways... It is also a story about contemporary Norway. It is a > story about us. Publication One of Us was published in Norway in November 2013 by Kagge (532pp). The subtitle -- en fortelling om Norge (A Tale of Norway) -- was expanded for the English market when Sarah Death translated Seierstad for English publication in 2015. The Hachette Book Group published One of Us: The Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway in the UK under its Virago Imprint in March 2015. Publishing rights for the Canadian and American markets were purchased -- followed by an April 2015 release -- by Farrar, Straus and Giroux (FSG). Hachette retained the rights for Australia where the UK edition is sold. Rights in New Zealand are 'open' so both US and UK editions are sold side-by-side. Death's translation was used in all English-language markets concurrently.

He sees an attractive young woman \\"down by the banks of the sweet primroses\\". He asks her where she is going and why she is distressed. He tells her he will make her \\"as happy as any lady\\" if she will grant him \\"one small relief\\". She tells him to go further away and says he is false and deceitful. She says he is responsible for making her \\"poor heart to wander\\" and that it is pointless to comfort her. She says she will go to a desolate valley where no one will be able to find her.

Discussion Steve Roud writes that this song was so popular with traditional singers at the beginning of the 20th century that some collectors did not bother to note down every example. He also comments that the story seems incomplete and mysterious, in that we don't know what the narrator had done to so distress a young woman he doesn't appear to know, or why the ending is so upbeat.Roud, Steve; The New Penguin Book of English Folk Songs p405; London; 2012 Ralph Vaughan Williams and A. L. Lloyd make the observation that \\"Tune and text have shown remarkable constancy\\" through many collected versions, and conclude that \\"Clearly, singers have found the song unusually memorable and satisfactory, for the process of oral transmission seems to have worked little change on it\\".The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs.

It protects an area of the caatinga biome that includes interesting geological formations and prehistoric cave paintings. There have been extended delays in physically implementing the park, and an attempt was made in 2011 to cancel it. Location The Morro do Chap√©u State Park is in the municipality of Morro do Chap√©u, Bahia. It has an area of . The park is in a part of the Chapada Diamantina which has great scenic beauty and potential for tourism. The park contains sub-basins of the Salitre, Jacar√©, Utinga and Jacu√≠pe rivers. These in turn feed the Paragua√ßu and S√£o Francisco rivers. 543 important springs have been catalogued, and the site has potential to function as a geopark. It also contains archaeological sites with cave paintings. The paintings in the Brej√µes, Boa Esperan√ßa, Igrejinha and Cristal caves demand special protection. History The Morro do Chap√©u State Park was created by decree 23.682 of 12 December 1973, but no action was taken to implement the park. An event on conservation of nature sponsored by the municipality of Morro do Chap√©u and the state planning department was held in 1985 and called for measures to implement the park. The Geological Service of Brazil (CPRM) presented a report in December 1995 that included plans for infrastructure and tourist sites, and gave environmental information, risk factors and speleological and archaeological studies. Based on this, the state's department of forest development reopened the question of the park's area, and commissioned a study on alternatives for the location of the park. The Morro do Chap√©u State Park was recreated by state decree 7.413 of 17 August 1998. The objectives are to protect species of rare and endangered animals, to protect vegetation in the ecotone where the cerrado and caatinga meet, and to protect archaeological sites. In 2008, at the request of the state secretariat of the environment, a team from the State University of Feira de Santana concluded a study for a new polygon to define the area of the park. As of 2011 problems had been caused by opening a road inside the park, hunting, deforestation, logging and complete lack of surveillance, particularly in the west of the park. Land owners had still not been compensated. Decree 12.744 of 12 April 2011 extinguished the park. The state prosecutor's office quickly issued a recommendation detailing legal reasons why the park should be preserved. On 3 May 2011 Governor Jaques Wagner signed decree 12.810, which cancelled decree 12.744 and gave the Environmental Secretariat (Sema) 90 days to prepare technical environmental studies, land surveys and a proposal to regularize land ownership. As of 2016 land ownership had yet to be fully regularized. Environment The vegetation is mainly from the caatinga biome, notably orchids, bromeliads and cacti. Areas with shrubs and herbaceous vegetation form natural gardens on rocky outcrops. There are also areas of dunes. The presence of big cats shows the high degree of conservation. Threats include deforestation, burning, sand mining, predatory hunting and squatters. In 2012 environmentalists expressed concern about the impact of construction of wind turbines in the vicinity. The area is ideal for wind farms, with consistent strong winds channelled by the hills. However, construction of roads and tracks, and explosions to build the foundations might drive out the population of cougars. The counter-arguments advanced by the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (Abee√≥lica) are that there is proof that wild animals return and with modern methods that vegetation recovers fast, and the increased surveillance of the park will deter hunting, illegal logging and sand mining.

Early life He was born 21 August 1880, in Mszana Dolna. From 1892 to 1900 was a pupil at a small seminary in Krak√≥w. During this time he studied at Jan III Sobieski High School and Bart≈Çomiej Nowodworski High School. In 1900, he passed his maturity. He then studied at the Seminary of the Archdiocese of Krak√≥w and in the Faculty of Theology at the Jagiellonian University. He was ordained as a priest on 26 July 1904 in Krak√≥w by Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko. In 1903, he continued his studies at the Gregorian University in Rome, from which he graduated in 1907, obtaining a doctorate in theology.

An appointed head of a local branch of Caritas Internationalis, he supported the development of Catholic actions and supported the Catholic House in Przemy≈õl. Before the Invasion of Poland, starting World War II, he did not participate in political activities. At the end of the 1930s, however, he worked to reassure the radical mood of rural communities and youth organizations. During the German occupation, he kept an unbending attitude. In the post-war Polish People's Republic, the communist authorities considered him a dangerous opponent of the regime and the Soviet Union. At the Polish Episcopal Conference, he was a member of the Committee for Social Affairs and the Foundation and Environmental Protection, and after World War II, he was a member of the Commission Headquarters. He participated in the Second Vatican Council.

The term text neck was first coined by Dr. Dean L. Fishman, a US chiropractor. Much bending forward has always caused the problems of a hunched upper back and neck pain, for example in dentists, surgeons, and hairdressers. What has changed in the last decade is the amount, especially in a younger generation who have grown up bending over laptops, tablets and smartphones ‚Äì hence the term 'iHunch'. Because the problem arises specifically from much bending forward, logical treatment will counter each component of this. The iHunch: (1) Overworked muscles down the back of the neck strengthen, strain, scar and shorten; (2) middle and lower back support muscles weaken; (3) hunching upper back joints eventually freeze like that; (4) muscles at the front of the neck work less and weaken, so chin pokes out. Results: Upper back pain, neck pain, headache; often referred pain down arms. Overview  Indications are that the prevalence of upper back and neck pain has increased dramatically in the decade leading up to 2016.Hoy DG, Protani M, De R, Buchbinder R. epidemiology of neck pain., Best Practice & Research: Clinical rheumatology., 2010 Dec;24(6):783-92Amy Cuddy, Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges, Little, Brown and Company, December 2015: 226‚Äì8. This increase has been attributed to the corresponding widespread adoption of laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other small portable digital devices. Because their screens do not separate from their keyboards these small devices cannot be set up ergonomically correctly (unless an extra screen or extra keyboard is added). They are unlike personal desk top computers (PCs) in this respect. Most commonly, the user hunches to operate them, often for many hours a day.generation facing a lifetime of back pain., Simply Health., 2 October 2013, Retrieved 13 March 2017 Hunching increases the effective load on the neck up to several times more than does erect posture, due to increasing moment arm.KK Hansraj, of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head.\\",Surgery Technology International., Nov 25, 2014:277‚Äì9 Local pain, cervicogenic headache and referred pain extending down the arms can arise from the sustained muscle strain, cervical facet joint (or apophyseal, or zygapophyseal joint) compression and diminution of the cervical foraminal nerve exits. A hunched posture also sends out a body language message of submission and lower self- confidence, with some research indicating it can actually promote these in the person holding it. A comprehensive view of the research and concepts is found in Amy Cuddy's book Presence (2015). Treatment may include analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medications, regular breaks while using the small devices, muscle strengthening and stretching, massage, spinal manipulation and mobilisation, posture instruction and spinal fulcrums. Biomechanical analysis suggests a combination of approaches is best and gives more lasting results.  Signs and symptoms  In a neck with perfect posture (as seen for instance in young children) the head is balanced above the shoulders. In this position the load on each vertebra of the cervical spine is spread evenly between the two facet (apophyseal) joints at the back and the intervertebral disc and vertebral body at the front. The iHunch is characterised by a posture with vagi at the head sitting somewhat forward of the shoulders (i.e., the ear lobe is anterior to a vertical line through the point of the shoulder (acromion process)). This can be very marked, with the back of the skull positioned anterior to the breastbone (sternum). The chin is poked forward. When the patient is asked to look up at the ceiling, the hunched-forward upper thoracic curve does not change as viewed from the side. Rather, the lower cervical spine 'hinges' backward at C5/6/7, a movement pattern known as 'swan- necking'.\\"Swan Neck Deformity of the Cervical Spine\\",eOrthopod, Retrieved 24 January 2017 This indicates that the upper back vertebrae have frozen in their habitual flexed positions, with the surrounding collagen of the ligaments, joint capsules and fascia shortening to reinforce this hypomobility. (This is the dowager's hump of the elderly of earlier generations, now observable in modern (2016) late teenagers.) Symptoms include overuse muscle pain and fatigue along the back of the neck and reaching down to the mid-back, often starting with the upper trapezius muscle bellies between the shoulders and neck. Cervicogenic headache from the joints and muscle attachments at the top of the neck is common.Bogduk N, Govind J.\\"Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment.\\",Lancet Neurol., 2009Phil Page \\"Cervicogenic Headaches: An Evidence-led Approach to Clinical Management\\",International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy., Volume 6(3); Sept 2011:254‚Äì266 The compressive load on the cervical facet joints predisposes to acute joint locking episodes, with pain and movement loss.Jonas Vangindertael ed. \\"Facet Joint Syndrome\\",Physiopedia, June 2012 In older patients with already diminished cervical foramina spaces and/or osteophytes, nerve root irritation and impingement can trigger referred pain down the arm(s).Ruth Jackson Classic: The Cervical Syndrome\\", Clinical Orthopeadics and Related Research, v.468(7); 2010 Jul: 1739‚Äì1745  Causes  The human spine is well suited to erect upright posture, with the increased heart rate from movement shunting a good blood supply to the muscles. This is clearly not the case for vast numbers of sedentary humans spending many hours daily bent over laptops, tablets, smartphones and similar. A biomechanical assessment of thoracic hunching shows the abnormal spinal loading and other effects which plausibly account for the recent steep rise in thoracic and cervical pain in step with the ubiquitous adoption of the small IT devices. The gravity of stress on the spine dramatically increases with thoracic hunching, roughly 10 pounds of weight are added to the cervical spine in weight for every inch of forward head posture by looking down at a small IT device. As a consequence there is growing medical concern specifically with children as their head size is larger in relation to their body and thus pose an increased risk group for being affected by musculoskeletal and neurological issues in the neck caused by thoracic hunching. Hunching has always caused problems, for instance in occupational groups like dentists,\\"Trapezius myalgia: making dentistry a pain in the neck ‚Äî or head, \\"Dental Economics, vol 98, issue 8; 2008 surgeons,Soueid A1, Oudit D, Thiagarajah S, Laitung G. \\"The pain of surgery: pain experienced by surgeons while operating.\\", International Journal of Surgery, 2009.11.08: ):118‚Äì20 hairdressers,Mussi G1, Gouveia N \\"Prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in Brazilian hairdressers.\\",Occupational medicine, 2008 Aug;58(5):367-9 nurses,J Smedley, H Inskip, F Trevelyan, P Buckle, C Cooper, D Coggon.factors for incident neck and shoulder pain in hospital nurses\\",Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2003;60:864‚Äì869 chefs,Haukka, E., Leino-Arjas, P., Solovieva, S. et al. of musculoskeletal pain among female kitchen workers\\",International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, November 2006, Volume 80:141‚Äì148 teachers,Patience N Erick and Derek R Smith 10.1186/1471-2474-12-260/, ‚ÄúA systematic review of musculoskeletal disorders among school teachers\\",BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, 17 November 2011 computer workers and students.Niemi SM, Levoska S, Rekola KE, Kein√§nen-Kiukaanniemi SM. and shoulder symptoms of high school students and associated psychosocial factors.\\",The Journal of adolescent health, 1997 Mar;20(3):238-42. Some rheumatoid conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease, and connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome cause characteristic excessive thoracic kyphosis. What has changed is the amount of hunching in society generally, and especially with the technologically adept young.

This is reflected in the recent rise in the number of popular articles, news items and media discussions about the problem.addiction creating generation of teenage hunchbacks‚Äù,New Zealand Herald, Sunday Oct 18, 2015Alyssa Navarro Your iPhone For Ruining Your Posture And Your Mood‚Äù,TECHTIMES, 15 December 2015Stephen August August: the iHunch‚Äù,Saturday Morning: Radio New Zealand, 16 November 2013  Pathogenesis  The iHunch is a multi-factorial problem.‚ÄúThe iHunch analysed‚Äù, Retrieved 24 January 2017 * Thoracic hunching requires flexing of the thoracic facet joints. After sufficient time and load, they can freeze and lock in this position. The collagen of the surrounding ligaments, fascia and joint capsules will shorten down around the immobile joints, reinforcing the hunched hypomobile section of spine. * The middle back support muscles (erector spinae, rhomboids, middle and lower trapezius fibres, etc.) become stretched out and weak. * The cantilevered (poked forward) head position loads the spine up to several times more than erect posture, because of the increased moment arm.Hansraj KK. of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head‚Äù,Surgical Technology International, 2014 Nov;25::277-9 So the posterior neck muscles (especially the upper fibres of trapezius) holding the head in its forward position, often sustained for many hours, can strain, producing individual myofibril and cell damage. Repair of this microtrauma involves the laying down of adhesive fibrosis, as a normal part of the inflammatory response. Adhesive fibrosis is relatively non-elastic, so after sufficient repeated microtrauma from muscle strain, the posterior neck muscles become strained, shortened and less elastic. * In this same cantilevered head position, the longus colli muscles and other deep neck flexors around the front of the neck are hardly being used, so they become weak, allowing the chin to poke out. * The combined effect of all the above in the cantilevered head position, with the chin poked out, is to compress every facet joint in the cervical spine. This predisposes to acute locking episodes. At the top of the cervical spine, this often manifests as cervicogenic headache, with pain referring over the head from the C0/1, C1/2, and/or C2/3 joints, and from the insertion of the upper trapezius fibres onto the nuchal line of the occiput.Bogduk N, Govind J.headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment.‚Äù, The Lancet. Neurology, 2009 Oct;8(10):959-68 In older patients, especially with osteophytes and/or where the intervertebral foramina are already diminished, this compression and further reduction of the foraminal spaces can result in irritation and impingement of the nerve roots, referring pain some distance down the arm(s).  Treatment  Neck pain generally has been treated with a profusion of approaches and modalities, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; pain relief medications (analgesics) such as acetaminophen; low dose tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline for chronic problems; physical therapy (a.k.a. physiotherapy in British-derived cultures) which utilises a wide range of techniques and modalities; spinal manipulation from osteopaths, manipulating physiotherapists and doctors; massage; muscle strengthening programmes including gyms and Pilates; postural approaches such as the Alexander Technique; stretching approaches such as yoga; ergonomic approaches including setting up desktop computers correctly and frequent breaks; and surgery for severe structural problems such as osteophytic impingement on the cervical nerve roots and cervical disc herniation. A biomechanical analysis of the iHunch indicates its standard, logical development from much flexed activity and its multi-factorial character. (See Pathogenesis above.) A composite approach which covers each component of the problem is therefore likely to be most successful and lasting. Most of the general treatment approaches to neck pain cover only one aspect. A logical response should include as a minimum: * Strengthening, especially of (1) the middle and lower back support muscles and scapula retractors, and (2) the longus colli and the deep neck flexor muscles.\\"Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain\\" , Healing Arts Continuing Education, 2010 * Stretching muscles that cause neck protrusion, especially of the upper fibres of the trapezius muscle.\\"Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain', Healing Arts Continuing Education, 2010 **Lower cervical flexors: sternocleidomastoid, anterior and middle scalene muscles. **Upper cervical (capital) extensors: semispinalis capitis, longissimus capitis, splenius capitis, suboccipital muscles Strengthening muscles that cause neck retraction: **Lower cervical extensors: splenius cervicis, semispinalis cervicis, longissimus cervicis **Upper cervical (capital) flexors: longus capitis, Rectus capitis anterior, Suprahyoid muscles * Massage, to loosen adhesive fibrotic tethering of the posterior neck and upper trapezius muscles. * Unlocking of the hypomobile (frozen) facet joints of the thoracic spine and stretching of the shortened collagen reinforcing the excessive kyphosis (hunch). A sufficiently tight patch of thoracic spine cannot be freed up solely by patient exercises, stretches or movements. This is due to leverage ‚Äì with any general exercise, the segments of the spine that are moving well will tend to move more, reducing the leverage on the hypomobile segments. A sufficiently localised external force is then necessary, such as specific hands-on spinal mobilisation or manipulation. A randomized clinical trial by Cleland et al showed manipulation of the thoracic spine reduced neck pain immediately.Cleland JA, Childs JD, McRae M, Palmer JA, Stowell T. effects of thoracic manipulation in patients with neck pain: a randomized clinical trial.‚Äù, Manual Therapy, 2005 May;10(2):127-35 * However unless the surrounding shortened collagen also receives sufficient stretching, collagen rebound will tend to freeze up the facet joint again rapidly. Collagen is stronger by weight than steel wire and is best stretched by a sufficiently long, strong, localised, passive stretch.Matthew A Fisher Explained Collagen‚Äù, Chemistry Encyclopedia, Retrieved 24 January 2017 In practical terms this may be achieved by the hunched patient lying back on a spinal fulcrum device, which uses the upper body weight to provide the external force, localised over the fulcrum.

He was a blacksmith by trade. As one of the strongest and bravest in Osat, he was chosen to lead the Serb villagers in the region against Janissary attacks. With the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising (1804), archimandrite and rebel leader Had≈æi Melentije Stevanoviƒá called on him and his fellows to support the rebels against the Dahije in the first fights on the Drina. He led rebels alongside Had≈æi Melentije, Mateja Nenadoviƒá and Jakov Nenadoviƒá. After his heroic deeds had been heard, supreme commander Karaƒëorƒëe summoned him and gave him the nickname \\"Kara-Marko\\". Karaƒëorƒëe lent Kara-Marko an army and vojvoda (general) Lazar Mutap to liberate Osat and Srebrenica from the Ottomans. Kara-Marko and Mutap liberated most of Osat until the Ottoman Army attacked and the rebels retreated across the Drina. His wife was killed during the retreat. After the Peƒáani Assembly (17 April 1805), Kara-Marko participated in the liberation of U≈æice. In 1806 he returned to Podrinje with Had≈æi-Melentije with whom he led fights against the Turks on the Sikiriƒá ferry on the Drina. With Had≈æi-Melentije, Milan Obrenoviƒá, Mateja Nenadoviƒá and Sima Birƒçanin he led the Serb rebel army against the Turks on Luƒçindan 1808 in Oklenac, Vranjkovina in Osat, and Pribiƒáevac near Srebrenica. In this skirmish he led the army in an assault from Skelani to Srebrenica and Osmaƒçe, then a battle was fought in Pribiƒáevac. Luka Lazareviƒá mentioned him in his memoirs, regarding fights in Osat and Srebrenica in 1809: \\"Karamarko expels the Turks, and rises the [Orthodox] Christians against them\\". After Had≈æi-Melentije left for the Russian Empire in 1810, Karaƒëorƒëe appointed Kara-Marko the vojvoda of the Sokol nahija (district) and a military senior (stare≈°ina) in Raƒça. At this time, his clerk was Niƒáifor Ninkoviƒá, and his buljuba≈°e (captains) were Petar and Janko. After an intrigue, Karaƒëorƒëe had him removed on 7 April 1813, after which he was for a short period with Mateja Nenadoviƒá in Valjevo. In May 1813 he gathered an army and crossed into Osat to defend it from the Ottomans. He was one of few that did not flee to the Habsburg Monarchy after the suppression of the uprising. He settled a village near Topola and became a hajduk (brigand). Due to his loyalty to Karaƒëorƒëe, the new Serbian leader Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá ordered his murder and had his severed head given to the Vizier of Belgrade.

History The Ferret was launched in May 2015. With the support of members, it aims to produce independent investigations that can be sold to outlets in the mainstream media. The cooperative structure was chosen to allow readers to be more than passive recipients of their stories. The Ferret was the first publication in Scotland to join press regulator IMPRESS, and adopt an editorial policy compliant with the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry. A crowdfunding appeal was chosen to launch their first investigation into aspects of the fracking industry and unconventional gas. They hit their target within a week. By the close of the appeal, they had raised more that double their target and so they decided to look at the treatment of asylum seekers too. They organised a conference with Strathclyde University held in April 2016. In November 2016 The Ferret was shortlisted in the \\"Digital Innovation\\" category of the 2016 British Journalism Awards. In April 2017, the co- operative launched a fact checking service. In 2018, Ferret co-founding Director Billy Briggs and photographer Angela Catlin were awarded Outstanding Digital Journalist of the Year at the Scottish Press Awards. The award recognised Billy Briggs and Angela Catlin's reporting from Iraq the previous year, which was published by The Ferret. The organisation also won Online/Digital Award at the 2018 Scottish Refugee Media Awards for a story by Ferret Director Karin Goodwin and Angela Catlin highlighting the increasing numbers of children being made destitute in Scotland.

President Ulysses S. Grant appointed her United States agent for paying pensions in Chicago, the first position as disbursing officer ever given to a woman by the US government. She established a strict system of civil service reform, which made her unpopular with politicians. In addition to being the founder of the ambulance system for the Chicago police, she found time to do philanthropic work, and to labor for governmental reforms. She also served as literary editor of the Chicago Tribune. Early years and education Ada Celeste Sweet was born in Stockbridge, Wisconsin, 23 February 1853. Her father was Benjamin J. Sweet, a successful lawyer and later, a Wisconsin State senator. Her mother, n√©e Lovisa L. Denslow, was a daughter of Elihu Denslow, and from the same place in New York as the Sweet family. There were several siblings including in 1854, Lawrence Wheelock; in 1858, Minnie; in 1865, Martha Winfred; and Benjamin Jeffrey, in 1871. When the American Civil War began, her father entered the Union Army as Major of the 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Afterwards, as Colonel of the 21st Infantry Regiment, he was wounded at Battle of Perryville. Later, he took command of Camp Douglas in Chicago as Colonel of the Eighth United States Veteran Reserve Corps. Sweet spent her summers in Wisconsin and her winters in a convent school in Chicago. After the war, General Sweet settled on a farm 20 miles from Chicago and opened a law office in the city. Sweet, the oldest of the children, aided her father in his business. She was carefully educated and soon developed marked business talents. Career In 1868, General Sweet received from President Grant the appointment as pension agent in Chicago. Ada entered the office, learned the details of the business, and carried on the work for years. In 1872, General Sweet was made first deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and moved to Washington, D.C. Ada accompanied him as his private secretary. He died on New Year's Day, 1874, leaving an estate too small to provide for his family. President Grant then appointed Ada Sweet as US agent for paying pensions in Chicago, the first position as disbursing officer ever given to a woman by the government of the US. The Chicago agency contained 6,000 names of northern Illinois pensioners on its roll, and the disbursements amounted to over US$1,000,000 yearly. She made the office independent of politics and appointed women as assistants. In 1877, President Hayes made all Illinois pensions payable in Chicago, and her office disbursed over $6,000,000 yearly. She chose her own clerks and trained them for her work. She did so well that, in spite of pressure brought to secure the appointment of a man, she was reappointed in 1878 by President Rutherford B. Hayes, and in 1882 by President Chester A. Arthur. In 1885, the Democratic commissioner of pensions asked her to resign, but she appealed to President Grover Cleveland, and he left her in the office until September, 1885, when she resigned, to take a business position in New York City. In 1886, she visited Europe. Returning to Chicago, she became the literary editor of the Chicago Tribune. In 1888, she opened a United States claims office in Chicago, and did a large business in securing pensions for soldiers or their families, retiring in 1905. In 1892, Sweet was appointed to the Chicago Board of Education. From 1911 to 1913, she managed The Equitable Life Assurance Society's woman's department. Personal life Sweet lived in Chicago with her brother. She was interested in all the work of women, and served as a member of the Chicago Woman's Club, where she worked on the club committee for compulsory education. She was also a Trustee of the Civic Federation. In May 1894, Sweet became president of the Chicago Woman's Club. She was the founder and first President of the Municipal Order League of Chicago, a society formed to improve the sanitary condition, and thereby the healthfulness, of the city. In October, 1890, she gave the first police ambulance to the city, having raised money among her friends to build and equip it, and thus originated the present system in Chicago of caring for those who are injured or fall ill in public places. On 17 September 1928, Sweet died at the home of her sister, another important figure in the history of women's rights, Winifred Bonfils in San Francisco, California.Georgia L.

Jussim (born December 2, 1955) is an American social psychologist.http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/life.html Early life and education At age 5, Jussim's family moved into a Brooklyn-area public housing where they lived until he was 12. When he was 13, his family moved to Levittown, Long Island and his mother died of cancer. Jussim dropped out of college before he met Lisa Baum whom he would later marry in 1975. They have three children together. Jussim enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1979, where he majored in psychology. His early work in social psychology began as a doctoral student at the University of Michigan where he collaborated with Lerita Coleman (assistant professor). He focused his dissertation on the well-researched area of teacher expectancies and was encouraged to conduct observations in the real world instead of the laboratory. He graduated with a doctorate in social psychology in 1987 and assumed a teaching position at Rutgers University that same year. Career and research Jussim runs the Social Perception Lab at Rutgers University, Livingston Campus. The lab studies how people perceive, think about, and judge others. He is a researcher in the fields of person perception, stereotype accuracy and bias and has been integral in the initiative for viewpoint diversity which advocates to correct the inaccuracies in the field of social psychology research.http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/papers.html In support of the latter, he helped found the Heterodox Academy, a collection of academics concerned with what they see as narrowing of political viewpoints on college campuses, itself having ties to conservative think tank The Koch Foundation. Dr. Jussim also runs Rabble Rouser, a blog that identifies errors in social psychology research and practice, suggests ways to improve it and discusses societal implications. He has published and spoken extensively on scientific integrity and distortions in science motivated by politics, stereotype accuracy, prejudice, bias, self-fulfilling prophecy, and social constructionism. His works have won professional wards: his 2012 book Social Perception and Social Reality: Why Accuracy Dominates Bias and Self-Fulfilling Prophecy won an American Association of Publishers' Prize for best book in psychology, and his 1991 book Social Belief and Social Reality: A Reflection- Construction Model received the Gordon Allport Prize for Research in Intergroup Relations.Gordon Allport Prize for Research in Intergroup Relations During his recent 2013‚Äì2014 sabbatical, he worked with colleagues at Stanford University‚Äôs Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in the Behavioral Sciences and co-founded Stanford‚Äôs Best Practices in Science group.

It was built by Henry Bissell, from a locally prominent family with extensive landholdings in the Bantam area. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Henry Bissell House stands in a rural- residential area of northwestern Litchfield, north of the borough of Bantam on the east side of Maple Street. It is a 2-1/2 story gable-roofed stone structure, with a rear wood-frame ell. It is built from locally quarried granite, with lighter stones chosen for corner quoining and window sills and lintels. Darker stones were used mainly as narrow horizontal elements, giving the house a distinctive appearance. The main entrance is in the rightmost bay, framed by sidelight and transom windows, and topped by a peaked lintel stone. The mortar in the walls appears to be original. The interior of the house follows a typical side-hall plan, and retains much original woodwork, which is typically Greek Revival or vernacular. The house was built in 1850 for Henry B. Bissell. The Bissell had been a major landowner in northwestern Litchfield since the 1720s, and this house was built using stone from a family-owned quarry. The Bissells were mainly farmers, but also owned a local gristmill in Bantam village in addition to the stone quarry. The house remained in the family until 1985.

Usually only one greenish yellow and red flower, long and wide is borne on a stalk tall. The petals are downswept and relatively short whilst the lateral sepals are relatively wide near the base but narrow to a thread-like end covered with reddish glandular hairs. The labellum is greenish-yellow with red markings, a red tip and smooth edges. There is a dense, narrow band of short, red-tipped calli along the centre line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to October. This species is similar to the short sepalled spider orchid C. brevisura and the puppet orchid C. incrassata but is distinguished from them by its longer sepals and narrower band of calli. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia doutchiae was first formally described by Oswald Sargent in 1921 from a specimen collected by Leila Doutch, the headmistress of the small school at Datatine in the Shire of Dumbleyung, who collected the type specimen near the school. The description was published in Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. The specific epithet (doutchiae) honours the collector of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat The purple-veined spider orchid occurs between Geraldton and Ravensthorpe growing in woodland, shrubland and heath in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Yalgoo biogeographic regions.

Built from 1887 to 1888 out of wrought iron, it is one of the state's three surviving examples of this bridge type, and along with Lover's Leap Bridge, one of two in New Milford. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The bridge was closed to vehicles in 1984 and to pedestrians in 1985; however, the Town of New Milford is seeking to restore it and reopen it to pedestrian traffic. Description Old Boardman Bridge is located in central western New Milford, northeast of the junction of United States Route 7 and Boardman Road. It spans the Housatonic River a few feet north (upriver) of the current Boardman Bridge that carries Boardman Road over the water. There are small public parks at each end of the bridge, which is closed to all access. It is a lenticular truss structure built out of wrought iron, and is long, with a roadway width of . It passes about over the typical water level of the river. The trusses are set on abutments of rough-cut stone, with box girder columns supporting the ends of the trusses. Truss joints are pinned together. and there are numerous diagonal and cross-bracing elements of narrower gauge than the main chords. The deck is supported by I-bars descending from the trusses at 12 points, originally consisting of corrugated metal sheets laid on I-beams. History A wooden toll bridge, built in 1840, had been swept away in the flood of 1854. The iron bridge was rebuilt in 1887-1888 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company, during a period when iron was supplanting wood as a preferred bridge-building material, but had not yet itself been replaced by steel. It carried pedestrians, horses and buggies, and vehicles over the Housatonic River for almost a century before a new two-lane steel bridge, also called Boardman Bridge, replaced it in 1984. The Old Boardman Bridge was closed to vehicles, but was still open to foot traffic for another year before the deck was deemed to be unsafe, and the bridge was permanently closed with a chain- link fence. Efforts were made to restore the bridge in the early 2000s; however, the funds went to restoring the other lenticular truss bridge in town at Lovers Leap State Park. Future and Possible Restoration On July 26, 2017, with the suggestion of Mayor David R. Gronbach, the New Milford Town Council voted to establish the Old Boardman Bridge Committee to determine how to best rehabilitate and reopen the bridge to foot and bicycle traffic. As the current Boardman Bridge does not have sidewalks or shoulders, this would allow for safe pedestrian crossing between Route 7 and the Sega Meadows Trail and future New Milford River Trail. Plans for reopening the bridge will include removing the vegetation that is growing on and around it, masonry repair of the abutments and wing walls, replacing the unsafe deck with a timber decking, repairing and replacing the structural components, and repainting it.

He ruled parts of present-day Gujarat from his capital at Anahilapataka (modern Patan). He ruled for a short period before dying heirless or being dethroned, after which the Vaghelas assumed control of the kingdom.  Early life  Tribhuvanapala succeeded Bhima II as the Chaulukya king. He is known from a 1242-43 CE Kadi inscription, some pattavalis, and the prologue of a drama. The chronicles about the dynasty do not mention him. Tribhuvanapala's relationship to Bhima is not certain, although the various records suggest that he was the legal heir to the throne. His inscription states that he meditated at the feet of Bhima (a conventional way to describe a rightful heir). The inscriber of his inscription was Somasimha, and its drafter (dutaka) was Vayajaladeva: both these persons also worked on the grant inscriptions of Bhima. Tribhuvanapala's inscription records a grant to Vedagarbharashi, who had been appointed as a trustee of a Shaivite monastery by Bhima. Thus, Tribhuvanapala appears to have been a legitimate successor.  Reign  The prologue of Subhata's Sanskrit play Dutangada states that the play was composed by the order of the parishad (council) of Maharajadhiraja Tribhuvanapala. The occasion was a spring festival procession of Kumarapaleshvara (\\"Lord of Kumarapala\\") at Devapattana (modern Prabhas Patan or Somnath). The festival was probably held to celebrate the restoration of a Shiva temple commissioned by the earlier king Kumarapala. According to one record, a ruler called Tribhuvana-Ranaka killed Bala, a general of the Guhila ruler Jaitrasimha, who was trying to recapture Kottadaka (modern Kotada). This Tribhuvana-Ranaka is identified with Tribhuvanapala. The Chaulukya dynasty ended with Tribhuvanapala. The Vaghela generals Lavanaprasada and Viradhavala had become powerful during the reign of his predecessor Bhima II. Viradhavala's son Visaladeva became the next king after Tribhuvanapala's death. One theory is that the Vaghelas forcibly dethroned Tribhuvanapala. However, it is also possible that Tribhuvanapala died heirless, because of which the Vaghelas assumed the control of the kingdom.

A pussyhat is a pink, crafted hat, created in large numbers by thousands of participants involved with the United States 2017 Women's March. They are the result of the Pussyhat Project, a nationwide effort initiated by Krista Suh and Jayna Zweiman, a screenwriter and architect located in Los Angeles, to create pink hats to be worn at the march. In response to this call, crafters all over the United States began making these hats using patterns provided on the project Web site for use with either a knitting method, crocheting and even sewing with fabrics. The project's goal was to have one million hats handed out at the Washington March. The hats are made using pink yarns or fabrics and were originally designed to be a positive form of protest for Trump's inauguration by Krista Suh. Suh, from Los Angeles, wanted a hat for the cooler climate in Washington, D.C. and made a hat for herself to wear at the Women's March, realizing the potential: \\"We could all wear them, make a unified statement\\". One of the project founders, Jayna Zweiman, stated \\"I think it's resonating a lot because we're really saying that no matter who you are or where you are, you can be politically active.\\" Suh and Zwieman worked with Kat Coyle, the owner of a local knitting supply shop called The Little Knittery, to come up with the original design. The project launched in November 2016 and quickly became popular on social media with over 100,000 downloads of the pattern to make the hat. Name The creators state that the name refers to the resemblance of the top corners of the hats to cat ears while also attempting to reclaim the term \\"pussy\\", a play on Trump's widely reported 2005 remarks that women would let him \\"grab them by the pussy.\\"\\"'Pussyhat' knitters join long tradition of crafty activism\\" BBC News. January 19, 2017. Many of the hats worn by marchers in Washington, D.C., were created by crafters who were unable to attend and wished them to be worn by those who could, to represent their presence. Those hats optionally contained notes from the crafters to the wearers, expressing support. They were distributed by the crafters, by yarn stores at the points of origin, carried to the event by marchers, and also distributed at the destination. The production of the hats caused reported shortages of pink knitting yarn across the United States.Ravani, Sarah (January 17, 2017). \\"'Pussyhat Project for Women's March causes run on pink yarn\\" , San Francisco Chronicle. Retrieved January 18, 2017.Brodeur, Nicole (January 10, 2017). \\"Pussyhat production causes run on pink yarn\\" , \\"Seattle Times\\".WWMT Staff (January 13, 2017). \\"Craft stores struggling to keep pink yarn in stock ahead of Washington Women's March\\" , \\"WWMT West Michigan\\".DeNardo, Mike (January 7, 2017). \\"Women to Don Knitted Pink \\"Pussyhats\\" During Inauguration Weekend\\" , \\"CBS Philly.\\" On the day of the march, NPR compared the hats to the \\"Make America Great Again\\" hats worn by Trump supporters, in that both represented groups that had at one point been politically marginalized; both sent \\"simultaneously unifying and antagonistic\\" messages; and both were simple in their messages. Racism and transphobia charges Critics have stated that the pink color of the pussyhats does not represent transgender women, or women of color whose \\"genitals are more likely to be brown than pink\\". The creators claim that the color pink actually represents the strong association of pink with femininity, as well as \\"caring, compassion, and love\\", not a representation of anatomy. Although Suh says that the hat was never intended to reflect the idea that \\"women's issues are predicated on the possession of the pussy,\\" critics argue that it is exclusionary. Suh admitted, \\"I think 'pussy' refers to the female anatomical part.\\" However, Suh also noted that 'pussy' is \\"a word that's used to shame people who are feminine ... whether they are men, women [or] genderqueer. And I think what it comes down to is that femininity is really disrespected in our society.\\" Suh believes the Pussyhat Project knitters were frustrated that the word for the most intimate part of their bodies is the same as the shortened version of pusillanimous, and is often used as a catchword for weakness, and that they \\"want[ed] to reclaim that word.\\" Professor C√°el Keegan, who teaches Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, said the hat's reference to pink [vulvas] is suspect: \\"We know that any time feminism starts centering people based on anatomy, that gets kind of dangerous for trans people.\\" He also pointed out that both cisgender women and transgender women are fighting for autonomy over their own bodies. The hat's allusion to the [vulva] also ignores the fact that some transgender women opt against undergoing gender-affirmation surgery. Keegan said that the pussyhat can promote the unconscious suggestion that only cisgender women are raped, which is untrue. In fact, he explained, \\"A lot of the reasons [transgender women] are attacked is because they do not possess that piece of anatomy.\\" Elle Hearns, a black transgender activist and a former organizing director of Black Lives Matter, criticized the hat for dividing people on the basis of sex and gender, maintaining, \\"Anything that is not elevating the conversation around the many identities of people in this country is not one that services the equality or the liberation or the freedom that people are pursuing.\\" In popular culture Pussyhats were featured months after the 2017 march on the Missoni fashion runway. Models were outfitted with pink hats combined with zigzag-striped ribbing as they walked the runway, and at the end of the show, Angela Missoni and celebrities wore the hats as well. She called the collection \\"pink is the new black\\" and donated some of the proceeds from the collection to the American Civil Liberties Union and the UN Refugee Agency. The hats appeared on the covers of Time magazine and The New Yorker. The New Yorker had a painting of an African-American woman wearing a knit pussyhat, flexing her bared arm on its February 6, 2017 cover, in the style of the woman on the 1943 We Can Do It! poster (often mistakenly referred to as Rosie the Riveter). The painting, named \\"The March\\", was created by Abigail Gray Swartz, who marched in Augusta, Maine. The image was subsequently made available for sale on prints, mugs, t-shirts and other items. Saturday Night Live had several skits in which pussyhats appeared. Its January 21, 2017 episode showed a distressed Russian woman putting on a hat and tiptoeing behind Vladimir Putin as he talked about Russia's recent \\"purchase\\" of the United States via the election. Another episode, hosted by Jessica Chastain, showed Aidy Bryant in the audience wearing a pussyhat.

He is known to history through the writings of Augustine of Hippo Regius.  Biography  Felicianus was a member of the Donatists, an excommunicated movement which was critical of the Roman Catholic Church following the effects of the edict of Milan, when Christianity was becoming closely aligned with the Roman government. Felicianus joined and became a leader within a breakaway group of Donatists called the Maximianists, who took a more puritanic line than the Donatists. According to some Catholic sources, the Donatists tried unsuccessfully to remove Felicianus from his see, and then used the imperial law courts to compel him to return. Whether this is true or Felicianus was just uncomfortable with the extremism of Maximianist theology is unknown, but Felicianus and another Maximianist leader, Praetextatus of Assur, did return to the Donatist party with their respective congregations. None were re- baptised, which was claimed by their opponents as hypocrisy. Re-baptism of the lapsed was a core belief of the Donatists. Augustine wrote a strenuous condemnation of Felicianus of Musti in one of his letters (Letter 86). and singled out Felicianus as an example of inconsistency in the Donatist movement. (Letter 108). The return of Felicianus was a pivotal moment in the demise of the Maximianist movement and the return of many congregations to the Donatists. It was also one of three components to Augustine's attack on the Donatists.

Origin and education  Von Althann was the youngest son of Imperial Count Michael Wenzel von Althann (1630‚Äì1686), Landeshauptmann of the County of Kladsko, and the Countess Anna Maria Elisabeth von Aspremont-Lynden (1646‚Äì1723). He attended the Jesuit College in Glatz and studied theology in Olomouc, Wroc≈Çaw, and the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum in Rome. He was ordained a priest in 1709, and in 1710 he earned his theological doctorate, and a few years later, another doctorate. After the death of his mother, he inherited the allodial rule of Stronie ≈ölƒÖskie.  Clerical offices  Von Althann held numerous spiritual offices. Before his priestly ordination, he became a canon of Olomouc. He also enjoyed other benefits in Prague, Breslau, Brand√Ωs nad Labem-Star√° Boleslav and Tapolca in Hungary. In 1714, he became an Austrian auditor of the Roman Rota, where he was also rector of the German priesthood, Collegio Teutonico. In 1718, he was appointed bishop of V√°c in Hungary, and a year later he received the cardinal dignity with the Roman titular church Santa Sabina at Aventine Hill.  Political offices  Von Althann was, from 1720 to 1722, the Imperial Austrian ambassador to the Holy See. In this position, he had the full confidence of the imperial court. He sought to improve the relations between the Roman Curia and the imperial court in Vienna and carried out a complete reorganization of the imperial embassy offices. The rise of the archdiocese of Vienna in 1722 as an archbishopric can be traced back to his negotiating abilities. In 1722, Emperor Charles VI. appointed him to be the viceroy of Naples and Sicily, who had come to the Austrian Habsburgs in the Treaty of Utrecht as a result of the Spanish War of Succession. As a representative of the Emperor, he deposed of fealty. He was able to consolidate his authority in this office through a clever personnel policy. He encouraged the arts, theatre, music and science. Soon he had realized, before his resignation, that he could not eliminate the political intrigues and the corruption of the elite. His dual function as a member of the Cardinal's Collegium and representatives of the imperial interests also led to several tensions with the imperial court, which were partly due to the anticlerical policies of Charles VI. From these conflicts of loyalty, his reign ended in 1728, and he returned disappointingly to the Diocese of V√°c.  V√°c  Immediately after his appointment as Bishop of V√°c, von Althann initiated the reconstruction of his diocese, which had been greatly affected by the Ottoman wars in Europe and whose administration had largely collapsed. He had a new land register created and began the diocese's visitation. He promoted the establishment of ecclesiastical orders and promoted new settlers, who had to be Catholic and came mainly from the German linguistic area, for his largely deserted and depopulated diocese. Even after his return from Naples in 1728, he devoted himself with all his power to his diocese. In modest means, he built the episcopal residence and the priest's seminary in V√°c and donated a hospital. However, by several struggles resulting from the struggle for political power in the construction of the diocese, he remained one of the sharpest critics of the imperial court, whose theocratic ambitions he rejected. For this reason, his Hungarian estates were confiscated in 1732. He died in 1734 and was buried in the cathedral of V√°c. His nephew, , became his successor as bishop.

It consists of nine mounds grouped in a rough ellipse and a few additional mounds in close proximity. Early Euro-American settlers assumed the enclosure was built as a fort, hence the name, but it was more likely religious in nature. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for having state-level significance in the theme of archaeology. It was nominated for its information potential as a unique site in a region whose numerous mound and village sites indicate a long span of indigenous occupation. Description The Fort Flatmouth Mounds consist of eight linear mounds and one circular mound arrayed in a rough ellipse. They occupy a flat terrace a short distance from the Pine River. At the time of their first thorough survey in 1896, the mounds all stood high. The longest embankment measures long and wide, running east to west along the upper edge of the enclosure. After a gap a embankment extends to the west, though skewing slightly north. South of that and running southeast is a embankment. The south side of the enclosure is defined by four closely spaced mounds laid end to end for a distance of . The east side is open but for a linear mound and a small conical mound. There is a mound in the middle of the group, and two more linear mounds along the crest of a bluff to the southeast. The layout of the Fort Flatmouth site contrasts with two other mound groups in the area: the Gordon‚ÄìSchaust Site, whose mounds lie end to end, and the Upper Hay Lake Mounds, which lie in parallel rows. Archaeological history The Fort Flatmouth Mounds were named in honor of Esh-ke-bug-e-coshe (\\"Bill like a new leaf\\", known to English speakers as Flatmouth), the leader of the Pillager Band of Ojibwe in the area in the mid-19th century. He shared the location of this mound group and many others with William Whipple Warren, a biracial historian who collected Ojibwe oral tradition for a book. An early logging road was blazed through the mound group, which early Euro-American settlers took to be a defensive fortification. Warren followed suit and referred to the site as a fort, as did settler George B. Wright, who recorded a description of it in 1867. The mounds were mapped by Jacob V. Brower in 1896 as part of his extensive survey of archaeological sites in Minnesota. The mounds were resurveyed in 1972 by the Minnesota Historical Society, which found that they were still in mostly excellent condition. Modern researchers have largely disregarded the theory that the mounds were created for defense.

The site is located in the Amity Valley, which itself is part of Round Valley (not to be confused with the Census Designated Place in Arizona of the same name); the Little Colorado River runs along the one side of the district. Most of the buildings date from between 1904 and 1930, the period during which Fred Colter resided on the residence. Description Location of the Colter Ranch Historic District Area plan for the Historic District Colter Ranch is situated in the portion of Round Valley known as Amity Valley, the valley's name being derived from the Mormon ward which was located here in the 1800s. Eagar and Springerville are the nearest towns. The area is mostly farmland, made possible by irrigation water from the Little Colorado River. The boundaries of the historic district are the Little Colorado River to the north, 4th Street to the south, and School Bus Road to the west. The boundary on the east is less distinct, lying along a section line on a USGS map (T8N, R29E). The Milligan Ditch, bringing irrigation water from the Little Colorado to the historic ranch bisects the district, running east to west. Most of the buildings in the district lie on the southern bank of the ditch, towards the western end of the district. These include three sheds (two wooden, and one corrugated metal); a stuccoed log bunkhouse; a log cabin; a corrugated metal shed; a larger wood storage building, which at one point served as the ranch's commissary; and a wooden machine shop. On the northern side of the ditch can be found a barn, a granary, and a work shed (which is also known as the \\"little barn\\"). The oldest structure still standing is the log cabin, built ca. 1890. It is a ten by fifteen foot rectangle, the exterior of the building is covered with finished planks, fitted at the corners. The single entrance faces south, away from the Milligan ditch. Its wood-shingled roof is side-gabled with a medium pitch. There is a fireplace on its east side, with a small window on the corresponding west end of the building. Blacksmith shop, bunkhouse, log cabin, shed, and commissary The next oldest buildings are the barn, the bunkhouse, the smaller of the wooden sheds, and the storage building (commissary), all of which were constructed circa 1910. The barn is the largest building in the district, measuring 60 feet long by 35 feet wide. Two stories tall, the walls are covered with board-and-batt siding, and has a corrugated metal roof of medium pitch. It has two single-story additions. The northern addition is 60 feet long with a shed roof, while the eastern addition runs the length of the original structure, widening the footprint of the barn by 15 feet. It has a lean-to structure. The entire barn complex is enclosed by a corral, which has a split rail fence approximately 5 feet high. Also within the corral is a 15 by 15 foot granary. Built circa 1940, it is constructed with the same materials as the barn, and has a shed roof. The bunkhouse has an eastern entrance, and was originally constructed of exposed logs, in the hall-and- parlor style. Two additions were made in the 1930s, giving it its current irregular appearance. The first addition was made to the east side, and consists of a stucco-on-wood frame construction, while the second was made of concrete to the western side. To the west of the bunkhouse, and the most westernmost of all the structures, is the smallest of the sheds. Approximately 10 feet by 10 feet, it is a single story with an outside surface is covered in vertical wood planking, and it has a corrugated metal roof, with a low-slope. The commissary measures about 30 feet by 16 feet, and has wood board-and- batten siding. The front of the building has a door centered on the building, flanked by two square windows. The other exterior walls have no openings to the outside. It has a corrugated metal gable roof. There is a false commercial \\"boomtown roof\\" on the south side, which hides the corrugated roof from view. The next buildings were all built in the 1940s. These include the other two sheds. The wooden shed is about ten by fifteen feet, with a gable roof of medium pitch, sheathed in corrugated metal. Its exterior walls are covered in shiplap wood siding. Its single entrance is off centered on the southern side, and has two small windows. Next to this wooden shed is a small corrugated metal shed. Its walls and roof are of corrugated metal, with the roof being shed-style sloping towards the ditch. The machine shop is a wooden structure with an exterior board-and-batt siding. Approximately 35 by 25 feet, it has a gable roof, facing south, with a corrugated metal surface. The south facing front features a pair of large wooden doors. Across the ditch, on the north side is the \\"little barn\\", a small work shed measuring 18 feet by 12 feet. It has a shed roof of corrugated metal, and its walls are unfinished board-and- batt. There are also two modern homes within the district, built in the 1980s, which do not contribute to the historicity of the site. History Log cabin and shed In 1881, Micajah Harris Phelps settled a 160-acre parcel of land straddling the just completed Milligan Ditch. His cattle operation was one of the first large herding operations in Round Valley. When the Amity Ward of the LDS church was created in 1882, Phelps' homestead was located therein. On his death in 1892, his property (which included other ranches in Texas and New Mexico) was split between his three children: Bill Phelps, Sarah Dugan Phelps (known as Duge) and Elizabeth Phelps. Duge maintained the family home in Amity Valley, running a large portion of her father's original herd of 350 cattle. Bill Phelps enlarged his holdings, and his herd, which had grown to over 1000 head of cattle by the time of his death in 1903. When he died at the age of 51, his one-third share of the Amity Valley property was left to Duge, who then controlled two-thirds of the original homestead. In addition, in order to settle the values of the property distribution of their brothers will, Elizabeth, who had received more valuable property in New Mexico, gave the remaining third of the Amity homestead to Duge. Duge was considered very accomplished and liberated for a woman of that time. She has successfully run her own cattle operation for over ten years by the time she re-consolidated her father's entire homestead. On November 11, 1904, the 40 year-old Duge married the 25 year-old Fred Colter, who had been Bill Phelps' straw boss on Phelps' Apache County operation. Colter, by the time he was 21 had created his own brand, the \\"Cross Bar\\". With his marriage to Duge in 1904, the homestead became known as the Colter Ranch. He brought an unknown number of his own cattle to the ranch, in addition to taking control of the 1100 head which were in Duge's herd, as well as over 800 he also managed for Elizabeth. By 1906 he had increased the herd to over 12,000 animals. Two years later, he had developed four reservoirs in the area: Colter, Mexican Hay Lake, Pool Corral, and Hog Wallow. He had also purchased another 3,500 acres extending the homestead's range, as well as up on the mesa to grow alfalfa feed. It was during this timeframe that he built the large barn on the property, to store approximately 40 tons of alfalfa to use as feed for his livestock during the winter. He also built a bunkhouse for his growing number of ranch hands, as well as a commissary where they could purchase any necessities. The commissary was also open for any residents of the nearby ranches. In May 1913, Colter applied for and was granted a post office to be run out of his homestead, which would serve also the local ranches. Named the Colter Post Office, Duge became its first only postmistress, and remained open until 1922. By the end of the 1910s, the ranch operation had reached its peak, containing over 43,000 acres of deeded land, and leased acreage surpassing 200,000. It was one of the largest cattle operations in northern Arizona, and it was the largest combined cattle operation and irrigated farming venture in the state. After the end of World War I, grain and beef prices fell precipitously. In order to stave off creditors, Colter formed the Northern Arizona Land Company, which issued $450,000 in bonds, using all of the deeded acres as collateral. However, this proved to be only a stopgap measure, and by 1924 creditors began to foreclose on different parcels of property to satisfy the notes. By the early 1930s every piece of land had been foreclosed on. In 1935 the ranch was sold to William A. Spence. The new owner moved the commissary from what is now the intersection of 4th Street and School Bus Road, to its current position. With the wave of mechanized farming taking hold, Spence also constructed the machine shed. Spence sold 1430 acres of the ranch in 1951 to two partners, Victor L. Udall and Gunnar Thude, which included the Colter Ranch. When Udall died later that year, Thude retained about 900 acres, with Udall's heirs taking the other 500, which included the Colter Ranch District. Thude eventually sold his acreage to Louis Johnson and John Wayne, who added additional territory and created the 26 Bar Hereford Ranch. Johnson and Wayne sold the ranch to Tom Chauncey, who currently owns the property. Sam Udall, Victor's son, continues to own the 500 acres which include the historic district.

It encompasses disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic widespread pain, temporomandibular disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, lower back pain, tension headache, atypical face pain, non-cardiac chest pain, insomnia, palpitation, dyspepsia and dizziness. General overlap exists between this term, somatization and somatoform. The currently identified class of functional somatic syndromes present as a complex enigma within the medical community; they are highly prevalent, but little is known about the etiology of these conditions. A majority of patients presenting with persistent, widespread somatic complaints have no identifiable organic cause. Biological markers for the FSS diagnoses are non-existent, making the categorization difficult; there is currently much debate regarding whether the FSS diagnoses represent separate conditions or one overarching diagnosis. A large overlap of symptoms exist between the FSS diagnoses, causing high rates of comorbidity between them; the prevalence of comorbid FSS diagnoses ranges from 20% to 70%, while comorbid affective disorders with a fibromyalgia diagnosis ranges from 20% to 80%. While FSS diagnoses are relatively common within the general community, they are significantly more common among patients presenting with comorbid psychopathology; more than half of patients presenting with a FM diagnosis also meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Similarly, rates of PTSD are roughly 9.5‚Äì43.5% higher in people seeking treatment for a functional somatic syndrome as opposed to the general population. Aside from the physiological symptoms of FSS such as sleep disturbances, chronic pain and general fatigue, certain psychological symptoms are also associated with most FSSs, such as anxiety, depression and panic disorder. Signs and symptoms Functional somatic syndromes are characterized by ambiguous, non-specific symptoms that appear in otherwise-healthy people. Overlap in symptomology exists across diagnoses, including gastrointestinal issues, pain, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and sleep difficulties. Some have proposed to group symptoms into clusters or into one general functional somatic disorder given the finding of correlations between symptoms and underlying etiologies. Potential causes  Biological factors  One commonly cited hypothesis in the literature implicates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and cortisol secretion in the manifestation of somatic symptoms following trauma. The HPA axis plays a major role in moderating the body‚Äôs stress response to both emotional and physical pain, relating to both the experience of psychological symptoms prevalent following trauma as well as the physiological symptoms prevalent in FSS conditions. When an individual experiences a traumatic event, the HPA-axis causes the increased release of cortisol, activating the sympathetic nervous pathway and causing negative feedback to be sent to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. In people who have experienced significant trauma, this reaction can become dysfunctional and can cause a chronic decrease in cortisol production, though the rates of this decrease in cortisol levels varies across different types and frequencies of trauma. For example, fibromyalgia is characterized as a stress response disorder; similar to trauma, patients with fibromyalgia demonstrate a susceptibility to neuroendocrine dysfunctions. Fibromyalgia patients statistically exhibit atypical patterns of daily cortisol secretion, as well as significantly low urine cortisol levels.  Psychological factors  Patients with somatic syndromes such as fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome have significantly higher rates of both physical and sexual abuse prior to the onset of their physiological symptoms, as well as higher rates of previous emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect compared to the general population. Further, childhood trauma such as sexual abuse or maltreatment can indicate an increased propensity for later somatic syndrome onset. Current theories propose an ‚Äúattentional bias‚Äù as the psychological mechanism by which trauma and somatic symptoms are tied. The concept of attentional bias refers to the idea that traumatic events can cause individuals to become more attuned to their bodies, thus intensifying the perception of pain, fatigue, and other common somatic symptoms. The initial traumatic event is interpreted as a threat to the body, and therefore the stress-response of the body takes on a new, heightened awareness to any potential subsequent threats. This attentional bias leads to a ‚Äúhealth anxiety,‚Äù where the patient becomes increasingly concerned that common somatic symptoms are related to a physical disease or injury, and therefore, another potential bodily threat. An initial perception of lost control can further lead to this attentional bias; sense of control is negatively associated with symptom reporting, suggesting that somatic symptoms are more closely monitored when psychologically recovering from an incident of lost control. Functional Somatic Syndromes are thought to be a result of conditioned hyperarousal following a trauma; victims are conditioned to respond more sensitively to the somatic symptoms following a trauma by their attention to and reinforcement of the symptom existence. This feedback loop is similar to that of panic disorder, in which fear of a subsequent panic attack causes an increased hyper-vigilance towards, and exacerbation of, certain physiological symptoms, such as heart palpitations, dizziness, and breathlessness. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a FSS is usually conducted in a \\"rule-out\\" method, where physicians rule out other rheumatology disorders with existing biomarkers prior to arriving at a FSS diagnosis. Treatment Due to the underlying psychological component of functional somatic syndromes, therapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are common treatments. Multiple antidepressants have also shown to be effective for FSS diagnoses that include chronic pain.

Summary Symons discusses aggressive play in the rhesus macaque, arguing that as a \\"structured and coherent activity, aggressive play has a design.\\" Symons provides information about sex differences in play, and behaviors that he refers to as \\"playchasing\\" and \\"playfighting\\". He suggests that \\"the adaptive function of aggressive play is to practice, or rehearse, and thereby to perfect behaviors used in high- intensity intraspecific aggression and in predator avoidance.\\" He critically evaluates objections to the hypothesis that specific skills are practiced in play, discusses the nature and adaptive significance of skill, reviews the history of attempts to characterize and define play, and critically discusses the idea that the function of play is to produce novel behavior. Additionally, Symons compares human play to that of non-human animals, attempted to explain differences in play between male and female rhesus macaques in terms of reproductive strategies, and argues that human warfare and animal fighting, as well as the developmental processes upon which they are based, are not homologous. Reception Play and Aggression received a positive review from Susan C. Wilson in Aggressive Behavior and a mixed review from John D. Baldwin in American Anthropologist. The book was also reviewed by James Loy in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. Wilson wrote that the book could be read for pleasure and that Symons convincingly argued that the \\"play-fighting of young rhesus monkeys is designed as practice for certain skills used by adults during fights.\\" However, she criticized Symons for making claims about play in general based only on the example of play in the rhesus macaque. Baldwin credited Symons with providing a \\"detailed description of play in rhesus monkeys\\", and suggested that \\"many readers will find Symons‚Äô description of rhesus play in a seminatural environment to be very useful\\", but added that many might conclude that Symons \\"overemphasizes the practice- for-violence hypothesis\\" and is \\"too eager to reject the other functions of play, such as general learning, practice for other activities, and innovation.\\" In 1980, the psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson wrote in The Sciences that Symons' \\"well-received\\" monograph is the work he is best known for.

History  African Jazz in a recording studio in 1961 Beginning in June 1961, the popular Congolese band African Jazz ‚Äîled by Joseph Kabasele‚Äî made a series of recordings in Brussels, Belgium. One of their new songs was \\"African Jazz Mokili Mobimba\\" (meaning \\"African Jazz all over the world\\"), written by guitarist Mwamba \\"D√©chaud\\" Mongala in the Congolese rumba style. It was released later that year. It was a pastiche of two Latin American songs. The lyrics caution against excessive travel abroad. The song also references all of the performing musicians as well as several Congolese cities and African countries (a common way of expressing praise at the time). At just over five minutes in length, it was one of the first African recordings to make use of the larger 45 rpm records then only recently available in the continent. African Jazz Mokili Mobimba went on to become a hit of the early 1960s. It became particularly popular in Kenyan dance clubs in 1965. It is often considered to be one of African Jazz's most memorable songs, though by the early 2000s it was commonly referred to as simply \\"Africa Mokili Mobimba\\".  Cover versions  In 1994 the song was covered by ex-OK Jazz musician Sam Mangwana and the Fania All-Stars for the former's album, entitled Rumba Music. African Jazz vocalist Tabu Ley Rochereau later recorded \\"African Jazz Mokili Mobimba\\" as a solo artist to be the leading track on his 1996 live album Africa Worldwide. Ex-OK Jazz guitarist Papa Noel Nedule frequently featured Mangwana and Rochereau in his covers of the song.

Originally opened as a narrow gauge under the control of the Lehigh Valley, it was converted to standard gauge in 1903, several years after the Lehigh Valley acquired complete control of the railroad. It was abandoned in 1976 when the Lehigh Valley was merged into Conrail. Montrose Railroad The branch was originally chartered in April 1869 as the Montrose Railroad by residents of Montrose, Pennsylvania, who sought to connect with the Pennsylvania and New York Canal & Railroad Company, a Lehigh Valley subsidiary, at Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania. They were unable to raise funds for its construction on their own, and in 1872, the Lehigh Valley bought about 55% of the company's stock and built of narrow gauge line from Tunkhannock to Hunter's. It was extended about the following year, but restrictions on the company's borrowing it delayed the completion of the line to Montrose, further, until 1876. James Blakslee, a Lehigh Valley official, served as president of the railroad, which, however, operated independently. Around 1895, the first or so out of Tunkhannock were dual-gauged to allow standard gauge trains to operate over that portion of the line. The Lehigh Valley took over operations on January 10, 1898. Montrose Branch Narrow-gauge operations continued until November 1903, when the Lehigh Valley converted the branch to standard gauge. It was foreclosed on September 2, 1905 and reorganized as the Montrose Railroad on October 26, 1905. In the process, Lehigh Valley gained control of all the capital stock of the new corporation, which was leased to the Lehigh Valley on 1 November 1905. The Montrose Railroad existed as a paper corporation until December 31, 1949, when it was merged into the Lehigh Valley. The line to Montrose continued to operate as a Lehigh Valley branch until June 1972, when it was damaged by flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes. It was formally abandoned when the Lehigh Valley was incorporated into Conrail in 1976.

She was reported missing by her aunt and uncle in the early morning hours of May 12, when they found the guest room in which she was staying empty, its window apparently broken from inside. Mays' bloodied nightgown was found behind the family's home on Guntersville Lake, as was an empty canoe, also covered with blood, floating in the lake. The unusual details surrounding Mays' disappearance led her case to receive national attention, and it was profiled on the series Unsolved Mysteries twice beginning in 1987. With no leads, however, her disappearance became a cold case. In 2008, twenty-two years after her disappearance, it was confirmed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia that formerly unidentified skeletal remains discovered in 2003 were those of Mays. Her death was officially ruled accidental. Early life Wanda Jean Mays was born in 1959 to Jim and Dorothy (Dot) Mays in Panama, where her father had been stationed in the military. Mays grew up in Arkansas, Alabama and Texas. She attended Arab High school in Arab, Alabama, and graduated from Wallace State College. At the time of Mays' disappearance, she was working as a secretary at Redstone Arsenal, a United States Army post. Disappearance After meeting her parents for dinner on the evening of May 11, 1986, Mays stopped by the home of her aunt and uncle, Tyrus and Betty Dorman Sr., located on Georgia Mountain in Marshall County, Alabama, near Guntersville Lake. According to her father, Mays had reportedly been exhibiting signs of emotional distress at the time from a \\"chemical imbalance\\" that had been attributed to dieting. Mays decided to spend the night at her aunt and uncle's home rather than drive back to her apartment that evening, and went to bed at approximately 10:30pm. This was the last time she was seen alive. The following morning at 5am, May 12, the Dormans, while attempting to wake Wanda for her job, found the guest bedroom Mays had stayed in was locked. After accessing the room, the Dormans found the double-paned Venetian glass bedroom window had been broken from inside the house, and discovered blood on the window; however, no one in the house reported hearing the window break during the night. The bed had appeared to not have been slept in, and Mays' personal belongings were on the nightstand. On a boat dock on the lake, Mays' torn nightgown was discovered with bloodstains on it. Alleged sightings On the morning of May 12, 1986, a local resident reported seeing a young woman matching Mays' description walking along Alabama State Route 62 near Guntersville, wearing oversized jeans. The witness stated that the woman's hair was wet, as if she'd been swimming. This report is now known to be false. The following day, May 13, approximately away in Huntsville, Alabama, a female witness claimed to have seen a woman matching Mays' description sitting in the back seat of a car with two unidentified men at a convenience store; according to the witness, the woman appeared to be afraid. When the witness exited the convenience store, she saw the woman again, this time talking on a payphone beside one of the unidentified men.This report is also now known to be false. Investigation Initially believing Mays had drowned in the lake, Marshall County rescuers sent search divers to look for a potential body. Additionally, the lake was dragged, but no sign of Mays was found. During the search, an empty canoe was discovered drifting on the water; upon inspection, blood was discovered in the canoe. Upon lab testing, the blood discovered in the canoe was confirmed to match Mays' blood type. A homicide investigator, Edward Teal, was subsequently brought in to examine the case, and deemed it the \\"most mysterious case\\" he had ever worked on. A year after her disappearance, Mays' case was featured on the network series Unsolved Mysteries with host Karl Malden. Discovery In October 2003, a hiker searching for ginseng plants discovered human bones at the foot of a cliff approximately from the Dormans' home in Guntersville. The remains were unidentified until 2008, when they were sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's DNA lab in Quantico, Virginia for testing; the FBI confirmed in January 2008 that the remains matched Mays. Ruling In an official statement made by Marshall County Police Sheriff Scott Walls, Mays' death was ruled as accidental, with claims that no foul play was suspected; investigators believed Mays had unintentionally fallen from the cliff where she was discovered. In an official statement, Walls said: \\"We have found no evidence whatsoever of any foul play. Wanda Jean Mays' death was accidental. We have concluded that Miss Mays, who was suffering at the time from a known chemical imbalance, left the home on her own accord.\\" One of Mays' brothers, John, made a public statement after the discovery, agreeing with the police's determination, citing his sister's frequent and unprovoked panic attacks as a probable cause for her death: \\"You know the window was broken from the inside that she went out of. She had an attack and it was something that scared her. She would just get terrified when she had these attacks. She would just be terrified of everything.\\" See also *List of formerly unidentified decedents *List of solved missing persons cases References External links *Wanda Jean Mays at Find a Grave 1959 births 1986 deaths 1980s missing person cases Accidental deaths in Alabama Accidental deaths from falls Deaths by person in the United States Formerly missing people found dead Formerly unidentified decedents Missing person cases in Alabama People from Panama City People from Arab, Alabama Wallace State Community College alumni ","title":"Wanda Jean Mays"},{"id":"52946951","text":"Kandirpar is situated on Comilla, Bangladesh.

It is named after surveyor and explorer Len Beadell, builder of the Gunbarrel Highway. The location is very remote being west of Jackie Junction and east of Carnegie Station, the western terminus of the original Gunbarrel Highway. History During survey work for the Gunbarrel Highway in May 1958, Beadell found the mountain which was to bear his name. He was always on the lookout for high points in the landscape, necessary for accurate surveys. Bill Johnson, who had known Beadell since their time in the army together, recommended that the feature be named in Beadell's honour. The Surveyor General of Western Australia formally approved the name in August 1958. An official survey mark and beacon was erected on the feature in May 1959. On 12 May 1996, exactly one year after the death of Beadell, a memorial was erected on top of the mountain consisting of a replica theodolite and plaque. The ceremony was attended by about 170 people.

It also aims to provide art community service, art related youth development, and social development opportunities for college students in the Philippines. It is composed not only of young aspirant artists but also of national art professionals, environmentalists, students and out-of-school youths. established in 1982. The Indigenous games or Laro ng Lahi was coined and popularized by this group with the help of National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA). The only organization who uses a unique officer structure for their chapters. Grand Artist is the equivalent of the President, Auxiliary Grand artist as Committee chair or as Vice President, Master Artist as Junior Adviser and Grand Master Artist as Adviser. It is also broadly consists of three main recognized level groups; 1) College Student level group, 2) Alumni/Municipal/Professional Level and 3) Mixed Probationary level group. History Established by a mere student organization in Central Luzon State University (CLSU) known as CLSU Artist Club which was founded on February 12, 1982. Starting by the Constancio Padilla National High School (CPNHS Young Artist Club) to be the first high school chapter founded on September 7, 1994. Then on September 5, 1995, the Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology (NEUST Artist Club) in Cabanatuan City became the first College/University chapter. Founded also in that same year were the Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College (ISPSC Artist Club) and Tarlac College of Agriculture (TCA Artist Club). In 1998 the Samahang Makasining (Artist Club) was officially registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a non-profit organization. The group has been also recognized and affiliated to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) on the same year (1998). After the SEC registration, the Pantabangan Municipal Chapter was founded and established on November 20, 1999, being the first Municipal/Professional level of the group. The organization has extended and opened the horizon to all interested artists. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) Chapter became the first national agency professional level members founded on November 7, 2003. On November 29, 2008, that was 11 years passed, the University of Southern Mindanao (USM Artist Club) was founded and became the first University chapter in Mindanao area. There are now 42 chapters nationwide as of 2014.  The members  The members often use brother or sister for their members. The others called the members as Makasining (Filipoino term for pro-artist) or sometimes the members within the club use the word Kasining (Filipino term co-artist).  Ritual and symbolism  The candle is a symbolic object for the group. It is a symbol of new born artist for the organization, while the candle light symbolizes the artist's life, knowledge and education.

Research in conscious cities explores how architecture and urban design can better consider and respond to human needs through data analysis, artificial intelligence, and the application of cognitive sciences in design. While a smart city focuses on improving efficiency of services, a conscious city applies new technology and behavioral insight into improving an experience and its mental and physiological effects. It is believed that conscious cities could alleviate ailments such as stress, anxiety and boredom by being sensitive to the pervading moods and personalities of people in different parts of the city. The term was coined by architect Itai Palti and neuroscientist Moshe Bar in their Manifesto for Conscious Cities, published in The Guardian in 2015. Palti went on to establish the conscious cities movement, stating, \\"The challenge is twofold and symbiotic: to empower and facilitate designers to use [conscious design], and to convince policy-makers, and through them, also market-players that a new set of priorities is essential.\\" The movement launched the Conscious Cities journal in November 2016. The first conscious cities conference, called \\"Conscious Cities - Architecture and Neuroscience\\", was held in 2016.  History  Throughout history, environments were designed to affect people's mood, but the practice was never systematic. Henri Lefebvre, who pioneered the \\"right to the city\\", argued in The Production of Space (1974) that space was a social product, a complex social construction based on values and the social production of meanings, which affected spatial practices and perceptions.Stanek, Lukasz, Henri Lefebvre on Space: Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory, University of Minnesota Press, 2011, p. ix. Championing Lefebvre's ideas, David Harvey said: \\"The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city.\\" Amos Rapoport examined meaning in the built environment, arguing that a place had not only physical features, but also meanings perceived and decoded by people on the basis of their own expectations, roles, experiences and motivations. The 21st century brought big data and crowdsourcing, which provide much deeper insights into the relations between cities and their inhabitants.  Characteristics and practice  Architecture, interior design, and urban planning can affect human behaviors and mental processes, causing psychological, biophysical, and cognitive changes in people, often without them noticing. Analyzing how people perceive public spaces with their senses makes it possible to analyze people's place-making practices. For example, visual elements of mystery and complexity may encourage exploration and feelings of pleasure, especially in familiar situations. On the other hand, visual concealments may increase people's fear of crime in public settings. A simple example of a conscious city element is a pair of giant self-inflating artificial flowers in Jerusalem, which bloom to create shade from the sun or cover from rain when sensing approaching pedestrians. Regarding wayfinding, a conscious city would be one that facilitates memorable mental maps through carefully designing all its elements by focusing on both the physical and the emotional needs of its users. As the average European is getting older, more attention is being paid to making cities \\"age-friendly,\\" especially in relation to dementia, where conscious- city strategies include \\"reminiscence promenades,\\" active ground floor frontage, and walkable mixed-use areas. The mass collection of human data required by conscious cities has raised questions of ethics and privacy. Moreover, a conscious city can react negatively to certain groups by using \\"hostile architecture,\\" such as sloped public benches to deter homeless people or high-frequency emitters to keep children away.  Research  Initiatives like the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health, the Urban Realities Laboratory, the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, or the Center for Advanced Design Research and Evaluation, have been examining the effects of urban planning and policymaking on human psychology and mental health. The Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture promotes and advances the application of neuroscience to human responses to the built environment. The Centric Lab was established in London in 2016 as the first group researching Conscious Design, \\"that which has an awareness of, and responsibility towards its users.\\" EEG brain scanning has been researched to emotionally map human reactions to environments in terms of excitement, frustration and engagement, particularly in response to stimuli such as sound, air pollution and light. The architecture firm Perkins and Will has a Human Experience Lab that tests out design concepts and measures human responses through electroencephalography devices, eye tracking, galvanic skin response, motion detectors, and accelerometers. The lab also uses virtual reality headsets and immersive cave automatic virtual environments to test out visual and auditory simulations of planned designs. CHORA Conscious City, an architecture research facility, started a conscious city project for Gela in 2015 to give the Sicilian town \\"an avant-garde role in the perspective of a new development model in the Mediterranean, turning it into a portal of transit between two continents, Europe and Africa.\\" References Organizational theory Sustainable urban planning Urban studies and planning terminology Information society Types of cities ","title":"Conscious city"},{"id":"52947208","text":"After 1991 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, a mob belonging to Communist Party of India attacked Gopal Patra a leader of Indian National Congress.

Family Arthur Gore was one of eight children ‚Äì four sons and four daughters ‚Äì of Richard Gore, who was curator of the Colonial Museum in Wellington, Government Meteorological Observer and Statistician, and Secretary to the Geological Survey Department, the New Zealand Institute and the Wellington Philosophical Society. Arthur's younger brothers Charles and Ross were, like him, first-class cricketers. Ross and Arthur's other brother Henry were also, like Arthur, prominent tennis players in New Zealand. Arthur married a widow, Rachel (Mrs Ulick Burke), in Wellington on 30 June 1891. She had been widowed in 1886 with young children. Cricket career For Wellington A leg-spin bowler and hard-hitting batsman, Arthur Gore played for the Wellington club in the Wellington senior cricket competition. In November 1888, playing against Stars, he took 6 for 10 to dismiss them for 17. Playing interprovincial cricket for the Wellington representative team against Hawke's Bay in 1886-87, he opened the bowling and took 7 for 53 and, bowling unchanged throughout the second innings, 6 for 38, as well as scoring 33 opening the batting, in an innings victory for Wellington. In another innings victory for Wellington two seasons later he took 4 for 25 (bowling unchanged throughout the innings) and 4 for 16 against Nelson. For Hawke's Bay When Gore moved to Napier he played for the County club. In 1891-92, in his first match for Hawke's Bay, Gore took 2 for 21 and 6 for 26 (unchanged through the innings again) against Taranaki, as well as hitting the top score of 33 in a low-scoring match that Hawke's Bay won by 10 wickets. In 1893-94 he captained Hawke's Bay on their three-match southern tour, when they played first-class matches against Otago (when he took four wickets), Canterbury (eight wickets) and Wellington (six wickets) in late March and early April 1894. In an otherwise unsuccessful tour for Hawke's Bay, he took 18 wickets at an average of 14.77. He helped Hawke's Bay to an innings victory in their first match of 1900-01 when, after not bowling in the first innings, he took 6 for 44 against Auckland, bowling three batsmen around their legs. Later in the season he took 6 for 55 in the second innings in a close draw against Wellington. Work career Gore moved to Napier in 1889 to be the local representative of the Australian Mutual Provident Society. In early 1897 he left AMP and returned to Wellington, where, like his father, he worked at the Colonial Museum.

Pratap rushes to receive his friend Avinash (Ravindra Mankani), a police officer, at the railway station and briefs him about strange things happening in Gahota. Some days back a bank manager slit his wrists, a woman murdered her husband and an ex-army officer killed his family and himself for no apparent reason. Avinash thinks that Pratap is overreacting. He confronts local Police Inspector Vanshi who denies that any such incidents happened at all. Avinash enquires the kin of victims and they all say that the victims are fine and alive. Avinash is convinced that Pratap has gone crazy but Pratap insists that everyone is lying.  Episode 2  Ratan asks Sheela out to dinner. Sheela accepts and books a trunk call to Gahota. Still trying to convince Avinash, Pratap tells him that he has taken pictures of the incidents. Pratap takes Avinash to Regent Photo Studio whose owner Balram is his friend. Balram hands over the developed photos to Pratap but they are not the ones Pratap had handed over to him four days back. Furious, Pratap dashes into the dark room where he is restrained and roughed up by Avinash who is frustrated with him. Later at Pratap's home, Avinash goes through the photos and discovers that they were taken on that day and not four days back. Avinash visits the photo studio in a taxi and asks the driver to wait for him. Balram's assistant confesses that he switched them as directed by Balram. A black car (Hindustan Contessa) is seen moving through Gahota mysteriously at night with the devil's symbol. It bumps the taxi and engraves the symbol on it. The taxi driver becomes possessed and cuts the fuel line. Avinash returns and a scuffle ensues between him and the taxi driver. A match is thrown from inside the black car which ignites the fuel trail. The taxi driver is seen laughing hysterically as Avinash kills him. The taxi then blows up killing Avinash. Inspector Vanshi orders the locals to remove the evidence and book a return ticket for Avinash from Gahota. Pratap watches all this and flees from Gahota in his car with Inspector Vanshi pursuing him. Pratap's car runs out of fuel and he stops at a petrol pump. He calls his daughter Sheela, informing her that he is coming to meet her in Mumbai and cautions her not to come to Gahohta ever, even for his funeral were he to die.  Episode 3  Malini is returning from office at night. She stops at a red light. She starts day dreaming about a man (Pratap), surrounded by policemen, facing a black car with headlights on, pleading to let him go.

It's part of the Bow Range, which is a sub-range of the Canadian Rockies. The nearest higher peak is Mount Temple, to the northeast. History The first ascent was made in 1901 by Charles S. Thompson and G.M. Weed, with Hans Kaufmann as guide. The peak was named in 1908 by Arthur O. Wheeler on account of its great height; its name is an allusion to the Eiffel Tower. The mountain's name was made official in 1952 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Eiffel Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

The vessel was launched by the California Shipbuilding Company on April 29, 1944, and completed on June 19, 1944. The ship's US Maritime Commission designation was VC2-S-AP3, hull number 14 (V-14). The Sapulpa served in the Pacific Theater during World War II and was operated by the Alcoa SS Company. The 10,500-ton Victory ships were designed to replace the earlier Liberty ships. While Liberty ships were designed to be used only during World War II, Victory ships were designed to last longer and serve the US Navy both during and after the war. Victory ships differed from Liberty ships in that they were faster, longer, wider, taller, had a thinner stack set further toward the superstructure and had a long raised forecastle.National Parks, Reading 2: Victory Ships SS Sapulpa Victory was christened and launched at the yards of the California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island in Los Angeles.

On January 21, 1945, she steamed into Ulithi atoll, a repair and re- supply base used by the US Pacific Fleet. The ship was delivering supplies for the 6th Special Naval Construction Battalion, also known as the Seabees.The 6th Special Naval Construction Battalion, page 7S The 6th Special Seabees were a combat stevedore battalion, trained to load and unload ships in safe harbors and under hostile fire during amphibious assaults. Seabees moved cargo including fuel, ammunition, bombs, rations, vehicles, and building materials. As a result of their role as supply vessels, the SS Sapulpa Victory and other cargo ships were targets for Japanese bombers, artillery, and Kamikaze attack planes.6th Special SeabeesU.S. Navy Seabee Museum, 6th Special Naval Construction Battalion Interbellum On February 12, 1946, the Sapulpa Victory came to the assistance of the SS Augustus S.

He zealously propagated Tibetan Buddhism among the Khalkha Mongols and founded the Buddhist monastery of Erdene Zuu in 1585. Abtai was born in 1554 to the Khalkha Mongol prince Onokhui √ºizen Noyan (b. 1534). He was the eldest among Onokhui √ºizen Noyan's five sons which include Abugho, Tarni, Tumengken, and Barai. He was the great-grandson of Batu Mongke Dayan Khan (1464-1517 / 1543) and grandson of Gersenji (1513‚Äì1549). Blood smeared on his fingers at birth presaged a great warrior and from 1567 to 1580 Abtai led several campaigns against western Oirat Mongol tribes, finally defeating the Oirats‚Äô Khoshut tribe at K√∂bk√∂r Keriye in the mid-1580s. Abtai then placed his son Shubuudai on the Oirat throne. His ferociousness in battle earned him the moniker The Mad Hero or the Mad Taiji of North Khalkha. Around 1580, Abtai learned that his uncle Atlan Khan (1507‚Äì1583) of the Tumeds had converted to Gelupga (Yellow Hat) Tibetan Buddhism. Abtai invited the lama Shireget√º G√º√ºshi Chorjiwa from Altan's Inner Mongolian city Guihua (present day Hohhot) to teach him the basic tenets of Tibetan Buddhism. Abtai then ordered construction of the Erdene Zuu monastery in 1585. Stones from the nearby ruins of the ancient Mongol capital of Karakorum were used in its construction and the monastery was populated with images and relics Abtai had received from the Dalai Lama. In 1587, Abtai traveled to Guihua to meet with Sonam Gyatso, the 3rd Dalai Lama, who had traveled there from Lhasa to offer prayers for Altan Khan, who had died in 1583. Upon Abtai's return, he banned shamanism and declared Tibetan Buddhism to be the state religion of Khalkha Mongols. Stupas surrounding Erdene Zuu monastery Abtai died a year later in 1588. His remains were interred at Erdene Zuu. Shortly thereafter his son Shubuudai was killed by Oirat chieftains. Abtai's descendants would continue to reign over the house of the T√ºsheet Khan. Abtai's great-grandson Zanabazar (born Eshidorji) was recognized by the 5th Dalai Lama as the first Jebtsundamba Khutuktu and Bogd Gegeen or spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism in Khalkha Mongolia in the 1640s. In pre-revolutionary Mongolia a special cult devoted to Abtai Khan flourished. He was celebrated as the last ruler who tried to unite Mongolia after the collapse of the Yuan Empire and who introduced Buddhism to Mongolia.

The observatory is the northernmost of 31 global stations in an international network coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) under its Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program to study the long-term effects of pollution on the atmospheric environment. Among these 31 stations, Alert is one of three greenhouse gas \\"intercomparison supersites\\", along with Mauna Loa in Hawaii and Cape Grim in Australia, which, due to their locations far from industrial activity, provide the international scientific community with a baseline record of atmospheric chemistry.  Geography  The observatory is located on a plateau about south of Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert, which is itself located on the shore of the Lincoln Sea, from the mouth of the Nares Strait. The region is characterized by recent glacial activity, with still extant glaciers visible among the peaks of the United States Range approximately to the west. The landscape immediately surrounding the observatory is undulating, marked by cliffs and crevasses and a number of small rivers which can become impassable during freshet. To the south, the Winchester Hills are the dominant visible feature. A number of small freshwater lakes provide CFS Alert (and by extension, the observatory) with drinking water. Due to its high latitude, the observatory experiences 24-hour daylight from the beginning of April to early September, and the sun remains below the horizon from mid-October to late February and both civil polar night and nautical polar night will occur. The intermediate periods are marked by a slight diurnal cycle. The dark season is responsible for much of the unique atmospheric chemistry that occurs during polar sunrise. The lack of sunlight to act as a catalyst causes a buildup of pollution from industrial areas down south, and the polar vortex amplifies this effect by containing pollution within the high Arctic. During sunrise, this pollution is responsible for a phenomenon known as Arctic haze.  Climate  Windrose produced with data from the observatory's anemometers, 1987-2015 Alert's climate is very dry, seeing very little annual precipitation. (It is, in fact, considered a desert.) What rain does fall generally comes in the form of mist or drizzle during the four months, June to September. Heavy snowfalls are typically confined to the period from September through November, but can occur again after polar sunrise. Fog is common due to proximity to the ocean, particularly in the summer and fall. When temperatures drop below freezing in September and October, the damp air also causes accumulations of hoar frost. Though conditions in Alert are cold, with only two months of the year seeing average temperatures above the freezing point (like most places in the Arctic snow is possible in any month of the year), they are not as cold as other locations further south, such as Eureka, because proximity to the Arctic Ocean has as a moderating effect. It is more accurate to characterize conditions in Alert as consistently cold, rather than extremely cold. Prevailing winds at the observatory are from the southwest, which usually bring clear skies and warmer temperatures. North winds off the ocean are typically accompanied by fog and sudden drops in temperature. (North winds are also unwelcome at the observatory, as they bring exhaust from the station's diesel generators.) Conditions are typically calm through the dark winter months, once the polar vortex has set up for the season. Three out of five days have wind speeds below at this time of year. (However, when windy conditions arise in the winter, they tend to be extreme. Storms can last for days at a time.) These conditions continue through polar sunrise, but reverse dramatically with the onset of freshet, which brings high, gusting winds.  History  Official opening of the BAPMoN Observatory, August 29, 1986. Assistant Deputy Minister Howard Ferguson, left, stands at the entrance to the observatory with the Project Commander from 1 CEU, Winnipeg and Dr. Neil Trivett. The establishment of the Joint Arctic Weather Station (JAWS) on April 9, 1950 marked the beginning of continuous meteorological measurements in Alert. The weather station frequently provided support for scientific research in Alert, including the collection of weekly flask samples for the measurement of carbon dioxide, the first of which was taken on July 8, 1975. Increasing interest in studies of phenomena such as Arctic haze led to a conference in 1977 in Lillestr√∏m, Norway with participation from scientists of seven different countries. Following this conference, the Arctic Air-Sampling Network (AASN) was created to share data between scientific organizations in each member nation. To fulfill Canadian obligations to this program, the Canadian Arctic Aerosol Sampling Network (CAASN) was created, eventually consisting of three stations: Mould Bay (April 1979), Igloolik (November 1979), and Alert (July 1980). In 1984, the program was condensed and refocused. The sampling programs in Igloolik and Mould Bay were discontinued, and the program in Alert became part of the core mandate of the newly reformed Canadian Arctic Aerosol Chemistry Program (CAACP). The gradually increasing amount of experimental research being done in Alert made the construction of a permanent observatory a viable option. In 1985, the Canadian Baseline Program was founded, and on August 29 the following year the Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) Observatory was officially opened. In 1989, the WMO's BAPMoN program was merged with the Global Ozone Observing System (GO3OS) to form the Global Atmosphere Watch Program. In 1992, the original observatory building was expanded to roughly three times its size, including the addition of a tall walk-up tower. Following the death of Dr. Neil Trivett in 2002 (an Environment Canada researcher who was largely responsible for the construction of the observatory), it was officially renamed in July 2006 as the Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory.  Measurements and research  The observatory in August 2003 In addition to the ongoing flask sample programs, the observatory maintains a core group of continuous measurement programs which include monitoring of aerosols, mercury, greenhouse gases, ozone (both ground level and stratospheric), broadband solar irradiance and albedo, permafrost temperatures, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and ground level meteorological conditions. The observatory also supports experimental testing of new monitoring equipment, and short-term, intensive research programs, e.g., NETCARE (Network on Climate and Aerosols: Addressing Key Uncertainties in Remote Canadian Environments). Much of the research and data collection at the observatory is collaborative, including long-standing partnerships with, e.g., National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Heidelberg University, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, CSIRO, Natural Resources Canada, and Health Canada.  Depletion events  While it had been known since 1988 that ground level ozone underwent periodic rapid depletions during March‚ÄìJune each year, it was not discovered until 1995 that atmospheric mercury behaved in a nearly identical manner. (The first continuous monitoring instruments for atmospheric mercury were installed at the observatory that year.) Until that time, it was generally agreed that elemental mercury persisted in the atmosphere for 6‚Äì12 months, which allowed it to reach remote locations such as the Arctic, far from emission sources. In the springtime, elemental mercury undergoes photochemically initiated oxidation reactions and converts to a more reactive and less stable form of mercury in the atmosphere. This was a means by which mercury could be removed from the atmosphere and deposit to the ground that was not previously known. These events were later termed atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs), and the underlying chemistry that connects them with the simultaneous ozone depletions has been and continues to be thoroughly researched.

Owston's Buildings, also known as Ouston's building, is a heritage listed building located at 9-23 High Street on the corner with Mouat Street in the Fremantle West End Heritage area. It was one of many buildings constructed in Fremantle during the gold boom period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Built on the site of the old Sandover building, the building was designed by the architect Frederick William Burwell and was built by Richard Rennie. The building was completed in 1903 and comprised eight shops on the ground floor and six flats on the first floor; a two storey verandah originally existed on two sides. The building is made from rendered brick and has zero setback from the footpath. The building is separated into eight sections by pilasters on the fa√ßade giving an ashlar effect. There is a roof parapet over the moulded cornice with low balastruding and two pediments. The centre pediment has \\"Owston's Buildings\\" and \\"1903\\" featured in the stucco. The first floor has arched windows with stucco architraves. Burwell's plans were completed in February 1903 and tenders were called for during that month asking for the erection of a building with eight shops, warehouses, and residences. It was named for William Owston, who commissioned the construction of the building. Owston was ship's captain and a trader who had arrived in Fremantle in 1849. The property was valued at ¬£10,000 when Owston died in 1903. The Western Australian Bank had a branch office in the building in 1903 when its own building was being refitted across the street. The Roma or Villa Roma restaurant was established in the building during the 1940s and remained there until 2005. The University of Notre Dame currently have offices in the building with the remainder leased by various small businesses.

There are accusations that it is staged extra-judicial killing. In March 2010, the then director general of the elite law enforcement agency of Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) said that since it was started in 2004 RAB had killed 622 people. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based NGO, has described RAB as a Bangladeshi government death squad. Odhikar, a Dhaka-based human rights organization, reported at least 1,169 people lost their lives in extrajudicial killings between January 2009 and May 2016 in Bangladesh. According to Odhikar, in June 2016, extrajudicial killings in the country took at least 24 lives. According to another rights group, Ain O Salish Kendra, 79 people were killed in so-called shootouts while in police custody in Bangladesh in the first six months of 2016. The police were involved in 37 of these deaths. Of them, seven had been in killed in crossfire with Detective Branch (DB) officials. Bangladesh police forces shot dead 130 people in a Philippines- style drugs crackdown in three weeks starting from May 2018.  Nature  Bangladesh Government claims that incidents of crossfire deaths are the result of law enforcement officers acting in self-defence. The narrative of the Government comes in either of the following 2 forms: (1) the deceased was caught in crossfire that erupted after miscreants had started shooting at the police, (2) after being challenged by a patrolling police team, few suspected armed persons on motor bikes opened fire; deceased died in the gunfight and few others fled. However, rights group have been refusing to believe the police version of the crossfire incidents. They have long accused Bangladesh's security forces, especially the elite law enforcement agency Rapid Action Battalion, of arbitrarily picking up people, torturing them, and then killing them in custody. When suspects are shown to journalists, they often wear a bulletproof vest. But, while taking them to raids to arrest their accomplices, the criminals are routinely without any such vest. Media usually reports these incidents as crossfire within quotation marks.  Events  * Mukul Rana: According to Detective Branch of Bangladesh Police, on Jun 2016, after being challenged by a patrolling police team, three suspected militants on motor bikes opened fire; Shariful died in the gunfight and two militants fled. Father of the deceased claimed he is Mukul Rana and had disappeared after being picked up by plainclothes police in February same year. * Golam Faizullah Fahim: Aged 19, accused of critically injuring a Hindu teacher in a machete attack, was killed in a gunfight on June 18, 2016. According to police, some militants fired upon them from a hideout, while he was accompanying police on a raid. * Zafar Alam, Jahangir Alam, and Dhalu Hossain: According to Bangladeshi police, these are three notorious human traffickers who had been killed on May 8, 2015 during a gunfight with officers. However, there are accusation that one or two days prior to each of the incidents, the police picked up the men from their homes or from local markets. * Lutfar and Khairul Khalashi: were arrested by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), on November 13, 2009. The following day family members organized a press briefing in which they urged the authorities to ensure that the brothers would not be killed because of RAB's long record of killing people in custody. But on November 16, 2009, RAB announced that both had been killed in crossfire, with a RAB patrol team early the same morning. When the High Court of Bangladesh issued a ruling the next day directing the authorities to explain the deaths, the law officer at RAB headquarters denied that any shoot-out had occurred at all, contradicting its previous announcement. * Rasal Ahmed Bhutto: He was picked up by RAB personnel in plainclothes on March 3, 2011, while minding a friend's shop in Dhaka. On March 10, Bhutto was brought to the area where he lived, in a RAB vehicle. He was shot inside the park. Later RAB summoned journalists to show the body of an alleged criminal killed in crossfire. * Akramul Haque: Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) claimed it had killed 46 years old Akramul Haque in a gunfight between drug dealers and the elite force in Teknaf around 1:00am on 27 May 2018. It accused him of being a drug dealer and claimed to have found two guns and thousands of methamphetamine pills on his body. However, few days later, Akram's family distributed four recorded mobile phone conversations between Akram and his daughter and wife before he died from bullet wound. The recorded audio also captured sounds of gunfire and groans of the dying man.  Crossfire threats  Detective Branch of Bangladesh has been accused of threatening abducted or captured people with cross fire to get confessional statement from them to magistrates.

His mother belonged to the Banu Husayn of Medina. Opposition to Hasan ibn Qatadah When his younger brother Hasan assumed the Emirate in 1220 Rajih was residing among the Bedouin outside of Mecca. He opposed his brother's rule and that year intercepted the Iraqi Hajj caravan, which was led by Aqbash, a mamluk of the Abbasid Caliph al-Nasir. Aqbash had with him a khil'ah (robe of honor) for the Emir of Mecca, and Rajih entreated Aqbash to invest him instead of his brother. Reports differ on whether or not Aqbash agreed to support Rajih but, regardless, Hasan's troops killed Aqbash and Rajih fled to Yemen. He sought the assistance of al-Malik al-Mas'ud Yusuf, the Ayyubid Emir of Yemen, son of al-Malik al-Kamil of Egypt. In 1222 Al-Mas'ud captured Mecca and deposed Hasan. He appointed Nur al-Din Umar ibn Ali ibn Rasul as Emir of Mecca, and Rajih as Emir over Halya, al-Sirrayn, and half of al-Mikhlaf. Emir of Mecca for al-Malik al-Mansur of Yemen Mecca remained in Ayyubid hands until Rabi II 629 (January/February 1232), when Nur al-Din Umar ‚Äì then al-Malik al-Mansur of Yemen ‚Äì sent an army to capture Mecca accompanied by Sharif Rajih. The Ayyubid Emir fled to Yanbu and Rajih assumed the Emirate. When al-Kamil received news of the loss of Mecca, he sent out a large force from Egypt led by Fakhr al-Din ibn al-Shaykh and ordered Sharif Abu Sa'd al- Hasan, Emir of Yanbu, and Sharif Shihah, Emir of Medina, to assist in recapturing Mecca. In Ramadan 629 AH (June/July 1232) Rajih was defeated and Mecca once again fell under Ayyubid rule. In Muharram or Safar 630 AH (October‚ÄìDecember 1232) Rajih captured Mecca again with the assistance of Yemeni troops. In Shawwal, al-Kamil prepared an army to retake Mecca. When the Hajj season arrived Rajih left Mecca, and the Egyptian troops entered the city without resistance. The Hajj that year was under the Egyptian Emir al-Zahid, who left Mecca under the Emir Ibn al-Mujalli in the beginning of 631 AH (October 1233). In 631 AH (1233/1234) after receiving reinforcements from al- Mansur, Rajih captured Mecca from Ibn al-Mujalli. When the Hajj season arrived Rajih left Mecca, having heard that al-Kamil was coming. After the departure of al-Kamil, Rajih returned to Mecca. In 632 AH (1234/1235) Mecca was recaptured by an Egyptian force under the command of the Emir Asad al-Din Jughril. In 632 AH (1234/1235) and 633 AH (1235/1236) Rajih took part in two failed Rasulid expeditions to recapture Mecca. In 635 AH (1237/1238) al-Mansur set out with a force of 1000 cavalry to retake Mecca. Rajih joined him with 300 more horsemen. They entered Mecca in Rajab (February/March 1238) after the Egyptian army fled. In that year al-Kamil of Egypt died. In 637 AH (1239/1240) Sharif Shihah ibn Hashim, Emir of Medina, captured Mecca with a force of 1000 cavalry provided by al-Salih Ayyub of Egypt, son of al-Kamil. When al-Mansur sent an army with Rajih to recapture the city, Shihah fled. In 638 AH (1240/1241) Sharif Shihah recaptured Mecca. In 639 AH (1241/1242) al-Mansur sent a large army with Rajih to capture Mecca. When Rajih learned that the Egyptians had been reinforced he encamped at al-Sirrayn and wrote to al- Mansur, who marched on Mecca himself. The Egyptians fled, and al-Mansur entered Mecca in Ramadan (March 1242). Dahlan writes that al-Mansur appointed Rajih as Emir of Mecca when he captured Mecca, but other historians mention a succession of other Rasulid emirs during this period: Ibn Fayruz (1242), Fakhr al-Din al-Shallah (1242‚Äì1248), and Ibn al-Musayyib (1248‚Äì1250). Opposition to Abu Sa'd al-Hasan When his nephew Abu Sa'd al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Qatadah captured Mecca from Ibn al-Musayyib in 1250, Rajih fled to Yemen and stayed at al-Sirrayn. During Abu Sa'd's reign Rajih attempted to capture Mecca with assistance from the Banu Husayn of Medina, his maternal relatives. He set out from Medina with a force of 700 horsemen, but was defeated by Muhammad Abu Numayy, son of Abu Sa'd. Return to the Emirate On the last day of 651 AH () Rajih took the Emirate from his nephew Jammaz ibn Hasan without fighting. He was deposed by his son Ghanim in Rabi I 652 AH (April/May 1254) without fighting. He died in 654 AH (sometime ‚Äì ).

His mother was an Abyssinian slave. In 1232 al-Kamil of Egypt ordered Abu Sa'd, then Emir of Yanbu, to assist in recapturing Mecca from Rajih ibn Qatadah, who was supported by al-Mansur of Yemen. In 1242 when al-Mansur captured Mecca he won over the allegiance of Abu Sa'd. The Sultan bought the fortress of Yanbu from Abu Sa'd and ordered for it to be destroyed, so as to not be utilized by the Egyptians, and assigned him to Wadi Marr to support the Yemeni army at Mecca. In 1250 Abu Sa'd received support from leaders of the Zubayd tribe to wrest Mecca from the oppressive rule of Ibn al- Musayyib, the Yemeni emir. Abu Sa'd's Bedouin troops entered Mecca from two directions, and he took control of the city. According to al-Muyurqi, Ibn al- Musayyib was captured on Friday, 7 Dhu al-Qi'dah 647 AH (11 February 1250), while according to Ibn al-Mahfuz it was at the end of Shawwal (late January / early February). Abu Sa'd gathered the notables of Mecca in the Grand Mosque, where he expressed to them his continued loyalty to the Sultan, and explained that Ibn al-Musayyib had been planning to take the wealth he had stolen and flee to Iraq. Abu Sa'd's rule was strengthened after al-Mansur's death, news of which arrived a few days later. Abu Sa'd was deposed and killed by his cousin Jammaz ibn Hasan in 651 AH. According to various reports it was either on 5 Shawwal (), in the beginning of Ramadan (late October 1253), or on 3 Sha'ban ().

He had been a Jesuit for a period of time before he was forced to withdraw from the order due to a series of complications. Migliavacca founded the Suore di Maria Santissima Consolatrice in 1892 alongside a small group of women who desired to become nuns, but slanderous accusations made against him forced him to abandon it and pursue the Franciscan charism instead; he dealt with these humiliations in private but once a Franciscan became a preacher and confessor and aided the tertiaries of the Third Order of Saint Francis in Bergamo. The cause for beatification for the late friar began under Pope John Paul II on 13 November 1997 while the confirmation of his model life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis in 2016 to name him as Venerable. The same pope approved a miracle attributed to his intercession and thus confirmed his beatification which took place on 7 October 2017 in the Milan Cathedral. Life Giuseppe Antonio Migliavacca was born in Cremona on 13 June 1849 as the fifth of twelve males to the innkeepers Glicerio Migliavacca and Annunziata Strumia. He was a cheerful and pious child who often visited the Madonna delle Grazie chapel in Cremona so it came as no surprise when he decided to enter the priesthood. He received his Confirmation on 8 September 1858 and then received his First Communion in 1860. In 1862 he began his studies for the priesthood in Cremona and was a student of Geremia Bonomelli. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 21 March 1874 from Bonomelli himself who became a friend. He served first as the coadjutor in the parishes of Paderno Ponchielli from 18 April to 15 December 1874 and then at Cassano d'Adda from 4 January 1875 until he decided to pursue the religious life. Bonomelli had noted Migliavacca's excellence during a pastoral visit and entertained the strong notion of making the simple priest the official parish priest but could not do this when his friend expressed his desire to join the Jesuits. Migliavacca was admitted into the Jesuits on 25 November 1875. This vocational desire was an intense one for he identified with the teachings of Ignatius of Loyola and often underwent the Spiritual Exercises such as in 1886. He began his period of novitiate on 14 December 1875 in France and on 25 December assumed the habit prior to his initial profession on 25 December 1877. He resumed his studies after this but this was again interrupted due to ill health which prompted him to move to Cremona to the Vida College where he served as the prefect from 1879 until 1883. In 1882 he succeeded in passing his examination in philosophical studies and in 1884 resumed his studies in Croatia where he passed his examination in his moral theological studies. But he failed to pass the difficult \\"ad gradum\\" exam that would have seen him admitted into the order as a professed member so he instead was made a spiritual coadjutor. From 1885 until 1886 he was stationed at Soresina and then at Wien from 1886 until 1887 for further Jesuit probation. He was also sent to Mantua in 1887 and then to Venice before heading to Brescia and then being sent again to Venice and all this occurred from 1887 until 1891. He made his final vows as a Jesuit in Venice on 5 August 1888. He preached the Lenten retreats in Venice as well as the Spiritual Exercises. In 1892 the Archbishop of Turin Davide Riccardi asked him to guide a group of aspiring nuns who wanted to embrace the religious life and it strengthened his relationship with Giuseppina Fumagalli who had known him since his time at Cassano d'Adda. But Fumagalli was an expelled aspirant from a French congregation and aroused the suspicion of the Jesuits in March 1891 when she requested to see him in Venice though he was not there ‚Äì the Jesuits were suspicious of her intentions. He was also sent to Trent on 4 March 1891 and then to Piacenza that September where he was a spiritual director for seminarians under the care of the bishop Giovanni Battista Scalabrini who became a close friend. But complications soon arose among those in power in the Jesuits and he was asked to leave the order on 24 March 1892; he bowed to this request in August 1892 which caused him considerable pain. Additional reasons included his frail health and his average studies coupled with his relationship with Fumagalli and Bishop Scalabrini. Fumagalli invited him to do the Spiritual Exercises with her group in Turin on 25 April 1892. On 25 December 1892 he founded the Suore di Maria Santissima Consolatrice for female religious and received diocesan approval from the Turin archbishop on June 20, 1895. In 1898 he moved the operations of the order to Milan though he was forced out of his order in 1902 after two nuns and a novice spread slanderous accusations against him; the cardinal Andrea Carlo Ferrari advised him that given the circumstances it would be best to leave and attempt something different. He decided to pursue the Franciscan charism and this solidified after interior reflection a week of the Spiritual Exercises in Milan. In 1902 he was admitted into the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and was vested in the brown habit on 21 June 1902 in Lovere, which allowed him to begin the novitiate. He made his initial profession on 25 June 1903 and later assumed the religious name of \\"Arsenio da Trigolo\\". He moved after his initial profession in 1903 to the Bergamo convent of Borgo Palazzo and dedicated himself to preaching, hearing confessions, and aiding the tertiaries of the Third Order of Saint Francis. He later professed solemn vows on 25 June 1906. He participated in the Spiritual Exercises held in Brescia in June 1903 that was intended for the tertiaries since he ran that particular session. Migliavacca's health began to decline over a prolonged period of time (including a fight with arteriosclerosis) and on 19 November 1909 he sent a letter to the nun Maddalena stating that his one eye was paralyzed for a month and he was undergoing treatment for it. On 10 December 1909 he was found dead in his cell from a brain aneurysm, at the Bergamo convent. On 11 December 1909 the Bishop of Bergamo Giacomo Radini-Tedeschi sent a letter to the order to express his sorrow at learning of the friar's death. In 1940 his remains were exhumed and relocated to Cepino Imagna, and again to the order's motherhouse in Milan on 13 October 1953 in Via Melchiorre Gioia. His order received the decree of praise from Pope Benedict XV on 20 May 1915 while Pope Pius XII issued full approval on 22 February 1943. It operates in countries such as Burkina Faso and Ecuador and in 2008 there were 397 religious in a total of 56 houses. Beatification The beatification process began under Pope John Paul II on 13 November 1997 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God; Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini oversaw the diocesan process in Milan from 3 April 1998 until 29 May 1999 while the C.C.S. later validated this process in Rome on 7 April 2000. The postulation sent the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in two parts in 2011 and in 2012 while historians gathered in between that period on 27 September 2011 to deem that no historical obstacles existed. The congress of six theologians voiced their unanimous approval (9 out of 9 votes) to the cause on 15 January 2015 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. did the same on 19 January 2016. Migliavacca was titled as Venerable after Pope Francis confirmed his model life of heroic virtue on 21 January 2016. One miracle ‚Äì a healing that science cannot explain ‚Äì was needed for him to be beatified. The miracle in question was the cure of the nun Ausilia Ferrario (from the late priest's order) who suffered from tuberculosis in her Verghera convent on 17 October 1946. Ferrario was taken to the convent's chapel to be near the exposed Eucharist and after adoration and a priest's blessing stood up and was healed. Martini oversaw the diocesan process of investigation from January 2000 until 4 April 2000 while the C.C.S. validated this on 18 May 2007. A medical board of seven experts approved this on 25 February 2016 while theologians followed suit on 29 October 2016 as did the C.C.S. on 17 January 2017. Pope Francis approved this miracle on 20 January 2017 and this confirmed that Migliavacca would be beatified with the date for the beatification being determined on the following 1 March and being communicated to the Milan archdiocese for preparations to begin. The beatification took place on 7 October 2017 in the Milan Cathedral with Cardinal Angelo Amato presiding over the celebration on the pope's behalf. The Milanese archbishop Mario Enrico Delpini concelebrated the Mass with Cardinal Amato. The current postulator for this cause is the Capuchin priest Carlo Calloni.

A biharmonic submanifold refers to an embedding or immersion into a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold which is a biharmonic map when the domain is equipped with its induced metric. The problem of understanding biharmonic maps was posed by James Eells and Luc Lemaire in 1983. The study of harmonic maps, of which the study of biharmonic maps is an outgrowth (any harmonic map is also a biharmonic map), had been (and remains) an active field of study for the previous twenty years. A simple case of biharmonic maps is given by biharmonic functions. Definition Given Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and , a map from to which is differentiable at least four times is called a biharmonic map if :\\\\Delta\\\\Delta f+\\\\sum_{i=1}^m R^h\\\\big(\\\\Delta f,df(e_i),df(e_i)\\\\big)=0; given any point of , each side of this equation is an element of the tangent space to at . In other words, the above equation is an equality of sections of the vector bundle . In the equation, is an arbitrary -orthonormal basis of the tangent space to and is the Riemann curvature tensor, following the convention . The quantity is the \\"tension field\\" or \\"Laplacian\\" of , as was introduced by Eells and Sampson in the study of harmonic maps. In terms of the trace, interior product, and pullback operations, the biharmonic map equation can be written as :\\\\Delta\\\\Delta f+\\\\operatorname{tr}_g\\\\Big(f^\\\\ast\\\\big(\\\\iota_{\\\\Delta f}R^h\\\\big)\\\\Big)=0. In terms of local coordinates for and local coordinates for , the biharmonic map equation is written as :g^{ij}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial(\\\\Delta f)^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial x^j}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial x^j}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}^\\\\alpha(\\\\Delta f)^\\\\gamma\\\\right)-\\\\Gamma_{ij}^k\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial(\\\\Delta f)^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial x^k}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial x^k}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}^\\\\alpha(\\\\Delta f)^\\\\gamma\\\\right)+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\delta}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\delta\\\\epsilon}^\\\\alpha\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial(\\\\Delta f)^\\\\epsilon}{\\\\partial x^j}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial x^j}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}^\\\\epsilon(\\\\Delta f)^\\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\right)+g^{ij}R_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma\\\\delta}^\\\\alpha(\\\\Delta f)^\\\\beta\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\gamma}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\delta}{\\\\partial x^j}=0, in which the Einstein summation convention is used with the following definitions of the Christoffel symbols, Riemann curvature tensor, and tension field: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Gamma_{ij}^k&=\\\\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{jl}}{\\\\partial x^i}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{il}}{\\\\partial x^j}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial x^l}\\\\Big)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}^\\\\alpha&=\\\\frac{1}{2}h^{\\\\alpha\\\\delta}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\partial h_{\\\\gamma\\\\delta}}{\\\\partial y^\\\\beta}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial h_{\\\\beta\\\\delta}}{\\\\partial y^\\\\gamma}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial h_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial y^\\\\delta}\\\\Big)\\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma\\\\delta}^\\\\alpha&=\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Gamma_{\\\\gamma\\\\delta}^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial y^\\\\beta}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\delta}^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial y^\\\\gamma}+\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\rho}^\\\\alpha\\\\Gamma_{\\\\gamma\\\\delta}^\\\\rho-\\\\Gamma_{\\\\gamma\\\\rho}^\\\\alpha\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\delta}^\\\\rho\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\Delta f)^\\\\alpha&=g^{ij}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2f^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}-\\\\Gamma_{ij}^k\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial x^k}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}^\\\\alpha\\\\frac{\\\\partial f^\\\\gamma}{\\\\partial x^j}\\\\Big). \\\\end{align} It is clear from any of these presentations of the equation that any harmonic map is automatically biharmonic. For this reason, a proper biharmonic map refers to a biharmonic map which is not harmonic. In the special setting where is a (pseudo-)Riemannian immersion, meaning that it is an immersion and that is equal to the induced metric , one says that one has a biharmonic submanifold instead of a biharmonic map. Since the mean curvature vector of is equal to the laplacian of , one knows that an immersion is minimal if and only if it is harmonic. In particular, any minimal immersion is automatically a biharmonic submanifold. A proper biharmonic submanifold refers to a biharmonic submanifold which is not minimal. The motivation for the biharmonic map equation is from the bienergy functional : E_2(f) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\int_M \\\\Delta f_h^2\\\\, dv_g, in the setting where is closed and and are both Riemannian; denotes the volume measure on M induced by . Eells & Lemaire, in 1983, suggested the study of critical points of this functional. Guo Ying Jiang, in 1986, calculated its first variation formula, thereby finding the above biharmonic map equation as the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation. Harmonic maps correspond to critical points for which the bienergy functional takes on its minimal possible value of zero. Examples and classification A number of examples of biharmonic maps, such as inverses of stereographic projections in the special case of four dimensions, and inversions of punctured Euclidean space, are known. There are many examples of biharmonic submanifolds, such as (for any ) the generalized Clifford torus :\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n+2}:x_1^2+\\\\cdots+x_{k+1}^2=x_{k+2}^2+\\\\cdots+x_{n+2}^2=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Big\\\\\\\\}, as a submanifold of the -sphere. It is minimal if and only if is even and equal to . The biharmonic curves in three-dimensional space forms can be studied via the Frenet equations. It follows easily that every constant-speed biharmonic curve in a three-dimensional space form of nonpositive curvature must be geodesic. Any constant-speed biharmonic curves in the round three- dimensional sphere can be viewed as the solution of a certain constant- coefficient fourth-order linear ordinary differential equation for a -valued function. As such the situation can be completely analyzed, with the result that any such curve is, up to an isometry of the sphere: * a constant-speed parametrization of the intersection of with the two-dimensional linear subspace } * a constant-speed parametrization of the intersection of with the two-dimensional affine subspace }, for any choice of which is on the circle of radius around the origin in * a constant-speed reparametrization of ::t\\\\mapsto \\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\cos at}{\\\\sqrt{2}},\\\\frac{\\\\sin at}{\\\\sqrt{2}},\\\\frac{\\\\cos bt}{\\\\sqrt{2}},\\\\frac{\\\\sin bt}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\Big) :for any on the circle of radius around the origin in . In particular, every constant-speed biharmonic curve in has constant geodesic curvature. As a consequence of the purely local study of the Gauss-Codazzi equations and the biharmonic map equation, any connected biharmonic surface in must have constant mean curvature. If it is nonzero (so that the surface is not minimal) then the second fundamental form must have constant length equal to , as follows from the biharmonic map equation. Surfaces with such strong geometric conditions can be completely classified, with the result that any connected biharmonic surface in must be either locally (up to isometry) part of the hypersphere :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\Big((w,x,y,\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\Big):w^2+x^2+y^2=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, or minimal. In a similar way, any biharmonic hypersurface of Euclidean space which has constant mean curvature must be minimal. Guo Ying Jiang showed that if and are Riemannian, and if is closed and has nonpositive sectional curvature, then a map from to is biharmonic if and only if it is harmonic. The proof is to show that, due to the sectional curvature assumption, the Laplacian of is nonnegative, at which point the maximum principle applies. This result and proof can be compared to Eells & Sampson's vanishing theorem, which says that if additionally the Ricci curvature of is nonnegative, then a map from to is harmonic if and only if it is totally geodesic. As a special case of Jiang's result, a closed submanifold of a Riemannian manifold of nonpositive sectional curvature is biharmonic if and only if it is minimal. Partly based on these results, it was conjectured that every biharmonic submanifold of a Riemannian manifold of nonpositive sectional curvature must be minimal. This, however, is now known to be false. The special case of submanifolds of Euclidean space is an older conjecture of Bang-Yen Chen. Chen's conjecture has been proven in a number of geometrically special cases.

In the 1950s she contributed to the people-to-people diplomacy that was hurt by the World War II, aimed at restoring human relations and understanding among Asian people, including Chinese, the Filipino, Indian and other Asian countries. She was the founder for the Social Studies Institute at the International Christian University (ICU) in Tokyo, Takeda Kiyoko was a professor emerita at ICU with a PhD in Literature from the University of Tokyo in 1961. Biography Takeda Kiyoko was born in Hyogo Prefecture, and after graduating from the Department of English Studies at the Kobe College, she went to the United States in 1939 and studied at Olivet College as an exchange student. When she finished Olivet, she extended her study abroad at Columbia University for two years, transferred to Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York Graduate School. Takeda's chance to move from Olivet University in Michigan to New York was that her teaching adviser M. Holmes Hartshorne, a scholar and translator for works by Kierkegaard and Immanuel Kant. Hartshorne introduced her to his own mentor Reinhold Niebuhr, and Takeda was invited to New York. Niebuhr and his wife Ursula took care of her as guardians when Japan and the United States opened up the war so that she could stay in the United States for further studies. Takeda was one of those students who were deported to Japan on a Swedish vessel on personnel exchange treaty. Coming back to Japan During World War II in Japan, Takeda tried to lay out before military officers in charge of a factory where she was employed facts about how those Japanese high school and college students volunteer at the facilities were malnourished. She backed her argument with a chart showing their weight She was nicknamed \\"Urashima Tar≈ç\\" by students, meaning she struck them as a person completely lost coming back from abroad. While pretending to obey the military official and national propaganda that Japan would win the War, Takeda was relieved to learn that those students disbelieved the propaganda or they whispered among them the signs of defeat. Post-war activities It was during the Christian Youth Convention in Amsterdam in 1939 which she joined as an undergraduate at the Kobe College, and she started her thought about Japan and her relationship to other countries with lasting impact that she was unwelcome as a young woman coming from Japan. As she tried to acquaint with a Chinese woman student who lead the student protest activities in China, that person replied Takeda needed to persuade the Japanese forces to leave her nation before becoming a friend of hers.

Shis≈ç no kagaku was among numerous magazines popped up post-war period, when common people wanted to express themselves. It was unique as it accepted essays from anybody with no discrimination on the authors' academic or sociological background, not limited to politically active students, and printed them on their pages pieces written by nurses, teachers, or social workers for poor factory areas in Tokyo. Takeda appreciates the trend in the late 1940s to early 1950s in Japanese philosophy that people sought to find their own policy, or defined it as \\"common men's philosophy \\" (hitobito no tetsugaku). To realize world peace after World War II, Takeda started to analyze politics and international relations from the viewpoint of ideological history, and on the other hand, she showed an example of or emphasized people-to-people trust among Asian including Japanese and Chinese, the Filipino, Indian and others. She confirmed with herself at the 3rd World Conference of Christian Youth held in India in December 1952.Takeda had an interview with Prime Minister Neal of India in Tokyo through Christian connections.

It was signed by Milo≈° Zeman and V√°clav Klaus on 8 July 1998. The agreement was signed as a result of problematic coalition talks after the 1998 legislative election. It was criticised by many journalists and politicians who blamed it for a rise in corruption. Many commentators also considered it to be a de facto coalition agreement. On the other hand, supporters say that it helped to stabilise the political situation in the country.  Background  V√°clav Klaus's second government collapsed due to an internal crisis within ODS, the largest coalition party, related to unclear financing of the party, and the subsequent withdrawal of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and KDU-ƒåSL from the coalition. A snap election was scheduled on 19 and 20 June 1998. Some members of ODS left the party and formed the Freedom Union, while the rest remained loyal to Klaus. The event was named the \\"Sarajevo assassination\\" by supporters of Klaus, as Klaus was in Sarajevo at the time of the attempted takeover. The 1998 legislative election ended with a narrow victory for ƒåSSD. The coalition negotiations were unsuccessful, as the Freedom Union refused to enter a coalition with ƒåSSD, while ODS refused to enter a coalition with the Freedom Union, due to their \\"betrayal\\". Instead, the leaders of ODS and ƒåSSD (Klaus and Milo≈° Zeman) decided to make a deal.  The Agreement  The \\"Treaty on creating a stable political environment in Czech Republic\\" (), more commonly known as \\"the opposition agreement\\" () established a set of rules for the winning party and the second party. Both parties pledged to: * Respect the winning party's right to form a government and formalize a process for realization of this respect (by leaving the Chamber of deputies during confidence votes, allowing the governing party to win confidence votes without actually having majority). * Respect the right of a defeated party to be in opposition to the government. * Respect the opposition party's right to hold the chair of both houses of parliament. * Respect the opposition party's right to control the leading control bodies, specified in the treaty. * Not to propose a motion of no confidence and not supporting such a motion in the event another party proposes it. * Propose changes to strengthen the importance of results of competition of political parties for the Constitution and related laws. * Consult the solution for foreign and domestic affairs before the readings in the parliament. With preferential consideration of stability, prosperity and position of the Czech Republic in the world. * To take no part in deals with third parties, which would lead to weakening the position of the opposition agreement.  Attempt to change the electoral system  The two parties also reached an agreement on changing the electoral system to benefit parties with the most votes ‚Äî themselves at the time ‚Äî by making constituencies smaller and changing the allocation formula. The new law would have almost destroyed the opposition and given the two parties nearly all the seats in the Chamber of Deputies, but it was struck down by the constitutional court, as Article 18 of the Czech Constitution explicitly states that elections to the Chamber of Deputies must be held \\"according to the principle of proportional representation\\".

Biography Annibale Ruccello was born in Castellammare di Stabia, on the outskirts of Naples, Italy. His father was Ermanno Ruccello and his mother was Giuseppina de Nonno. In 1977 he graduated in philosophy from the University of Naples Federico II. As a student, he wrote a thesis on Andrea Perruci's (1698). His paper examined Perruci's religious piece through cultural anthropology. Ruccello was later a member of a group of researchers who studied the popular traditions and language of Campania, led by , a Neapolitan composer and musicologist.  Career  Ruccello began acting in Torre del Greco, Italy, as Gennaro Vitiello formed Teatro del Garage. This group included other artists like Mario Martone and Enzo Moscato. In 1978 Ruccello created his own theatre company called Il carro. With the help of Lello Guida, he began writing and staging his first plays, largely inspired by popular culture. Their repertoire included Il Rione (1973) and L'osteria del melograno. His other works include directing Rottami (Famed director Ionesco, was originally supposed to direct this work), I gioielli indiscreti (1980) by Denis Diderot, and L'asino d'oro, renamed later Ipata in 1981. (This work was based upon Asinus aureus by Lucio Apuleio.) In 1980 he debuted a solo play named Le cinque rose di Jennifer. In 1982, his group, Il carro, merged with another theatre company named Teatro Nuovo, and became Teatro Nuovo-Il Carro, based in Naples, Italy. In 1983 Ruccello wrote Weekend (which won the Under 35 Award from the Istituto di Dramma Italiano) and Notturno di donna con ospiti. He won further awards in 1988 following the premiere of his comedy, Ferdinando, in February 1986 (San Severo, Teatro Verdi). This piece won two IDI awards: the first in 1985 as a dramatic work and the second in 1986 for the best staging. The original production had design by Franco Autiero, with Isa Danieli (who happened to inspire the character in the first place) in the leading role. Later on, Ferdinando was performed in Paris in 2000 at Th√©atre du Rond-Point, dubbed by Adriana Asti in French. This production continued on to Liegi at the Th√©atre Le Moderne and, in Bruxelles at Union Dramatique in 2008. In 1985 Ruccello also directed a theatrical adaptation of the novel La ciociara by Alberto Moravia, which was also staged in 2010 by the director and stage designer Roberta Torre. Ruccello's work as playwright ended with Anna Cappelli and Mamma: piccole tragedie minimali, in competition for the Primo Premio Gennaro Vitiello in May 1986. On 12 September 1986, while returning from a trip to Rome, Ruccello died in a car accident on the Roma-Napoli motorway. The driver of the car, Stefano Tosi, an actor, was also killed. Ruccello is buried in Castellammare di Stabia. During the years following his death, Ruccello's body of work has found further recognition. He is considered one of the most original voices in Italian theatre of the late twentieth century.  Published Works  Il sole e la maschera.

It is commonly known as the variegated oil beetle. Adult beetles feed on leaves and can be pests of crops, while the larvae are parasitic on solitary bees. Description It is flightless, with short elytra overlapping at the front. Its exposed abdominal segments are brightly coloured on the upper side. Like all member of the genus Meloe, it releases a smelly, oily fluid when alarmed. Habitat It is active between April and July in grassy places, chewing the leaves of various plants. They are considered pests of sugar beet, cabbage, and winter rye. Life cycle The larvae primarily parasitise the nests of solitary bees, although they have been recorded in a colony of social bees in Poland. After fertilized eggs have been laid, the first instar larvae hatch after 24 hours. The larvae climb to the top of a nearby blade of grass or a flower and remain immobile until they are able to attach to a passing bee with their mouthparts. The larvae puncture the bee's intersegmental membrances to feed on the haemolymph. Up to 15 larvae have been observed on one individual bee. Later stages of larvae growth of M. variegatus are not parasitic ‚Äì they feed on the food stores gathered by the bees. The larvae pupate in the nest of solitary bees, but are rarely able to do so in larger colonies as they are removed by the worker bees. Distribution M. variegatus is classified as 'regionally extinct' in the United Kingdom. It can still be found in central Europe and the Iberian peninsula. Use in traditional medicine In the early 19th century, this species was used in Germany as a fanciful cure for rabies (referred to as \\"hydrophobia\\" by William Elford Leach). The beetles were also hung up by the neck until dry, so that the oily secretion they gave off could be collected and administered. It was also considered to be a diuretic.

It features a combat system emphasizing hand-to-hand combat, loosely based on historical techniques such as feints, redirection, and alternative use of weapons. Other features include ranged weapons, siege engines and mounted combat. The game was released on April 29, 2019 on Steam. The game was partially financed through a Kickstarter campaign in 2017, raising nearly $300,000.  Gameplay  In Mordhau, players engage in hand-to-hand combat with medieval weapons such as swords, spears, shields, hammers, bows, siege weapons and more. When in close-quarters combat, players can defeat their opponents by utilizing techniques like directional strikes, stabbing, kicking, dodging, blocking, and parrying while watching their health and stamina bars. Players may also ride horses in battle. The game can be played in either first person perspective or third person perspective.  Customization  Outside of gameplay, the player can edit and create mercenaries for most game modes. When creating or editing, the player can change their mercenary's body type, face, and voice for cosmetic purposes. Editing things like armor, weapons, and perks cost in-game points. Depending on what type of armor the player has it can affect the movement speed of the player like how wearing heavier armor will make the player move slower and cost more points, while there are only three levels of armor there are also cosmetic variations for armor. All weapons point values are roughly determined by the size of weapon as a light dagger would not be as costly as a heavy hammer. The perk system will grant the mercenary various passive abilities at the cost of points, which scale based on how ideally useful the perks are.  Game modes   Frontline  In this game mode, up to 48 players will form into two teams. Each team starts with 1000 points, and competes with the other team to earn more points by fighting each other, capturing opposing territory and completing the team's objectives. For every enemy defeated, the other team loses a point. Capturing central or enemy territory will reduce the opposing team's points. However, completing the team's objective will instantly end the game in favor of whichever team completed their objective.  Invasion  In this game mode, up to 48 players will form into two teams, with one team acting as attackers and the other as defenders. The defenders must protect key objectives while the attackers must complete them to advance further. Once objectives are captured, the defenders must fall back to defend the next objective. The game is on a timer, which increases when the attackers secure an objective. The defenders win if the timer runs down to zero, while the attackers win if all objectives are completed within that time.  Battle Royale  In this game mode, 64 players will compete against each other in a free-for-all match. When a player is defeated, they will lose the game and not spawn again. The last player standing will be the winner. At the start of the game, all players will spawn without weapons or armor. They must seek out chests containing equipment in order to increase their chance of survival. To avoid stalemates, a ring surrounds the entire map, and will slowly shrink to bring the players closer to each other.  Horde  In this game mode, a small team of players will be pitted against waves of computer-controlled enemies that will get increasingly harder each wave. Players will start with no weapons or armor, and their health will not regenerate normally. To regenerate health and earn weapons, the player must defeat the enemies and survive the round. Defeating an enemy will award the player a quarter of their health and currency. Completing a wave will refill the players health and award currency. Currency is used to purchase weapons and armor. All purchasable equipment is scattered all over the map, needing the player to have extensive knowledge of places like item locations.  Skirmish  This game is in the form of a team deathmatch; however, when a player is defeated, they will not spawn for the rest of the round. The last team standing will win the round. and play will continue until one team has won 7 rounds.  Deathmatch  This game mode has everyone fight against each other with no teams or in a free-for-all. The first player to score the target amount of kills will win the game. Many Deathmatch servers are duel-only servers, where two players must emote at each other to initiate a duel, the emote used most often is the Flourish emote which is a basic sword twirl.  Team Deathmatch  This game mode is similar to deathmatch, except that the player will form two even teams and will compete for the most kills of players on the other team. Development The game was built using Unreal Engine 4. Marko Grguroviƒç, a Slovene PhD student of computer science at the University of Primorska, began development of Mordhau alone. With no experience in game development, Grguroviƒç had begun building a prototype in Unity called Project Slasher. After working on Project Slasher with another person for two years, the team decided to remake the entire project, as it was not up to their standards. During the next three years, Grguroviƒç was joined by other programmers, graphic designers, and animators from all over the world, many of whom enjoyed playing video games like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare and wanted to make something similar. This led to them founding the company Triternion, and producing first versions. In this time period, the development team switched from using Unity to Unreal Engine, and renamed the project to Mordhau. In March 2017, the company launched the Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for development, which achieved its basic goal in less than 24 hours. The game was finally released on 29 April 2019.  Reception   Sales  Mordhau became an immediate success, selling 200,000 copies in less than a week, then exceeding 500,000 copies sold by 7 May. It reached the top of the Steam sales charts. Triternion apologized after its servers could not sustain the massive influx of players. About a month after its release, Mordhau had sold 1 million copies; to celebrate, the developers released a new map alongside new weapons and cosmetics.  Critical reception  Mordhau has a score of 81 on Metacritic based on 21 critic reviews. Prior to official release, Mordhau received praise from early reviewers for its fighting system, the chaotic but fun gameplay, and its graphics. Reviewers enjoyed the game's intricate fighting system. James Swinbanks of GameSpot called it a \\"strategic, punishing and ultimately satisfying\\" video game. Destructoid Patrick Hancock found it \\"exciting to find efficient and unique combos\\" that led to players developing their own unique play style. IGN Samuel Horti enjoyed the \\"feeling of constant skill progression\\" as he gradually learnt the game's mechanics through experience and video tutorials. Javy Gwaltney of Game Informer shared this feeling, saying that \\"every increment of improvement is rewarded with spectacular displays of violence\\". However, GameSpot and IGN also shared the belief that the game's in-game tutorial could have done a better job of explaining the game's mechanics to new players. Swinbanks wrote that Mordhau did not provide adequate feedback to strikes, which made the game feel like a \\"slow, merciless grind of death after death\\" as you learned how to play. Horti wished that the game's tutorial would help him \\"learn by playing instead of turning to YouTube guides\\". T.J. Hafer from PC Gamer worried that the game's complexity might alienate players who wanted to play a supporting role in battle, stating that Mordhau \\"doesn‚Äôt support that playstyle especially well\\".  Controversy  In a July 2019, article in PC Gamer, Samuel Horti described Mordhaus player base as having toxicity problems, claiming that many players who use homophobic, racist or sexist language in the game or on Mordhaus forums were not adequately punished by Triternion. He criticized Triternion's hands-off approach to word filtering and player banning in order to avoid claims of censorship. Horti also criticized Triternion's proposed approach to handling female and non-Caucasian characters in upcoming expansions. He quoted a Triternion artist who, when asked about character diversity, stated that the developers would \\"give [the players] the option to enable and disable different things\\". When prompted by PC Gamer for clarification, a Mordhau developer confirmed the stance, saying \\"it depends how [the Mordhau] community is in the future\\". A Mordhau moderator's post on Mordhaus Steam community forums dated April 2019 stated that the developers \\"might add a simple client- side toggle\\" for players concerned about character realism. Subsequently, Triternion released a statement on Twitter, denying that they had considered adding the option for players to disable characters based on their ethnicity. On July 3, the company reaffirmed via a post on their own forums that they were not going to add those options, saying that \\"our official stance is that these toggle options are out of the question\\". Triternion elaborated that the idea was briefly discussed and ultimately discarded, but that the employees that PC Gamer interviewed were not aware of the final decision. The controversy was picked up by many major gaming sites.

Fifi and Byron were aware it was Calum but Fev was completely left in the dark. At the end of the performance Fev was in complete shock of how talented the tradie was only to discover it was Calum Scott himself. In November 2018, Brendan Fevola's fourth daughter was born. Fifi, Byron and guest host Matt Preston crossed to Fev live on radio just after the birth where Fev revealed the baby had been named Brenda.

It comprises 15 articles and was enacted in Addis Ababa on September 10, 1969 and entered into forced on June 20, 1974. It builds on the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol and it has influenced the 1984 Cartagena Declaration and the 2009 Kampala Convention. The 1969 Refugee Convention's historical context is the era of decolonization, Apartheid, as well as internal political and military uprisings.http://www.fmreview.org/faith/okello.html It was signed by 41 states or governments and has currently been ratified by 45 of the 54 member states of the African Union. It is the only binding, regional legal instrument on refugee issues in the developing world and a regional complement of the 1951 Refugee Convention. Legal innovations The 1969 Refugee Convention has made some significant advances from the 1951 Refugee Convention. * Discrimination against refugees is prohibited on the additional grounds of membership of a particular social group, nationality, or political opinion. These grounds were absent in the 1951 Refugee Convention. * Any refugee who has ‚Äúcommitted a serious non-political crime outside his country of refuge after his admission to that country as a refugee‚Äù or who \\"acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the OAU\\" will be excluded from the definition.http://www.achpr.org/instruments/refugee-convention/ It also contains a prohibition for refugees and asylum seekers to engage in any subversive activities against any member states. * It contains suggestions for burden- and responsibility sharing, solidarity and cooperation between the member states, such as regional resettlement and financial support. * It de- politicized the concept of asylum, a peaceful and humanitarian act, and declared that it shall no longer be perceived by member states as an unfriendly act and it urges the member states to grant asylum to those individuals who fall within the refugee definition. Whereas it advances here from the 1951 Refugee Convention it does still not grant an individual the right to asylum (it remains the state's discretion to grant this right). * It introduced the \\"absolute\\" prohibition of refoulement, whereas the 1951 Refugee Convention allowed return or expulsion of refugees if the national security of the state would be at risk. However, if asylum seekers commit certain serious crimes, they will be excluded from the refugee definition and could still be returned or expelled. Refoulement is thus only limited but not absolutely prohibited. * The principle of voluntary repatriation was first codified. However, the situation in the country of origin to which the refugee would return, was not defined and thus a fundamental change in circumstances and human rights standards in that country is not needed. Expansion of the definition of the term refugee The 1969 Refugee Convention expanded the 1951 definition of who is a refugee: * A second paragraph is added to the definition of the term \\"refugee\\", which includes \\"external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order\\" as reasons for flight.http://www.achpr.org/instruments/refugee-convention/ This includes accidental situations that are not based on deliberate state action, i.e. the source of danger does not need to be the state or its agents. This includes those fleeing environmental catastrophes such as drought and famine. And that means that the fear of danger is no longer only linked to the individual's personal subjective reaction but also to the causal element of refugee situations. This change in the definition has paved the way for \\"prima facie\\" group refugee status determination. * Whereas the 1951 Refugee Convention uses \\"country of his nationality\\" as geographical unit that a refugee must have fled from, the second paragraph of the definition in the 1969 Refugee Convention uses \\"his place of habitual residence\\" as geographical frame of reference.

The house remained the property of the Picton family until the end of the First World War. Used subsequently as council housing, it has been empty since the 1950s, and is now a derelict shell. The house is Grade II listed. History The house was constructed for Sir William Mansel in 1772. The design is attributed to Anthony Keck, in part because Keck is known to have worked for the Mansel family elsewhere. Following Mansel's death in 1804, the unfinished shell, and surrounding estate, was bought by General Sir Thomas Picton in 1812. Picton soon regretted the purchase and made plans to sell the house, which were curtailed by his death at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The house remained the home of the Pictons until the early twentieth century. After a period as council-run housing, the building was abandoned after 1945 and was described at the time of listing in 1982 as a \\"roofless shell.\\" Coflein states that renovation work was to begin at that time, but planning applications for redevelopment were being made in the early twenty-first century.

The scene depicts numerous people‚Äîmainly elegantly-dressed women of various social classes‚Äîon outings at Ry≈çgoku Bridge over the Sumida River in Edo (modern Tokyo). At about , the assembled set is the earliest known ukiyo-e picture of such an extravagant size. Background Ukiyo-e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects courtesans, kabuki actors, and others associated with the \\"floating world\\" lifestyle of the pleasure districts. Alongside paintings, mass-produced woodblock prints were a major form of the genre. In the mid-18th century full-colour ' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. A prominent genre was ' (\\"pictures of beauties\\"), which depicted most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts. Kitagawa Utamaro (‚Äì1806) made his name in the 1790s with his bijin ≈çkubi-e (\\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm. The Sumida River flowed through eastern Edo (modern Tokyo). Ry≈çgoku Bridge was the largest bridge over the river in this heavily-populated and thriving urban centre. Its name translates as \\"bridge of the two provinces\\", as it was built to connect the provinces of Musashi Province, in which Edo lay, and Shim≈çsa. Publication The prints bear no title, and different titles are given in different sources in both Japanese and English. The set was published in by , whose seal () appears on each print. Each bears the signature Utamaro hitsu (, \\"The brush of Utamaro\\"). Copies of the set or members of it are in the collections of the British Museum, the Guimet Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Tokyo National Museum. Description The picture is made up of six prints arranged in two tiers of three. Each is a vertical, multicoloured nishiki-e \\"brocade print\\" in ≈çban size‚Äîabout per print. There is no known earlier example of such an extravagantly large print. The prints were designed so that each could also stand alone. The print features a large number of people on outings by the busy Ry≈çgoku Bridge over the Sumida River. Nearly all the figures are women. The view faces downstream, and boathouses line the river in the background. Nine elegantly-dressed tall women stand or lean on the bridge, watching the river flow beneath. Some hold hand fans or parasols, suggesting a hot summer scene. The women come from different social rankings. From details such as the hairstyles some of the women are recognizable as geishas. The women in the upper left are women-in- waiting from a feudal lord's palace, and are wearing age-b≈çshi head-dresses, which were popular during Japan's Edo period. A woman holding a child stands at the centre, and to the right is a group of entertainers. Behind the woman furthest to the right holding a round hand fan can be seen a water-seller's equipment; fresh water was scarce in the area, as it was made from reclaimed land by the ocean. Such merchants sold slightly sweetened water from distant springs. Below the bridge various parties enjoy boating. A group appear to be having a drinking party on a canopied boat in the centre and right foreground. A geisha wearing a kimono adorned with her family crest is crossing onto this boat from another at the far right. A pair of geisha in a small choki-bune punt at the far left appear to be about to be called to join this party as well; they shade themselves with an open parasol. Amongst the women are two handsome young men, one guiding the choki-bune to the left with a pole, and another lazing atop the covered boat to the right, pipe in hand.

Rameshwari Photocopy Services and Others). Albeit with an initial denial by the University of Delhi, the ultimate picture which emerged was that the professors imparting teaching in the Delhi School of Economics had authorized preparation of course packs and Rameshwari Photocopy Services was entrusted with the task of photocopying the pages from the books published by the plaintiffs, and after binding the same, to supply them to the students charging 50 paisa per page. Rameshwari Photocopy shop background Rameshwari Photocopy shop was established in 1998 and is owned by Mr. Dharampal. Impleadment Association of Students for Equitable Access to Knowledge (ASEAK) and Society for Promoting Educational Access and Knowledge (SPEAK) sought and allowed for impleadment. See Point 11 and Point 12. Case of the plaintiffs The case of the plaintiffs that the inclusion of specific pages of its publications by Rameshwari Photocopy Services, under the authority of the Delhi School of Economics, amounts to institutional sanction for infringement of its copyright. It is the further case of the plaintiffs that the professors of the Delhi School of Economics, through its Library, issued the books published by the plaintiffs to Rameshwari Photocopy Services for preparing course packs. It is the case of the plaintiffs that the course packs, which contain no additional material apart from photocopies of its copyrighted publications, were being used like textbooks and therefore, the compilations prepared were competing with the publications of the plaintiffs. According to the plaintiffs, Rameshwari Photocopy Services was operating commercially as was evident from the rate charged by it for selling the course pack is 40/50 paisa per page, as distinct from the market rate of 20/25 paisa per page being charged by other photocopiers from the students while photocopying material given by the students to be photocopied. Anticipating that the defence would be predicated under Section 52(1)(i) of the Copyright Act, 1957, the plaintiffs have pleaded that Section 52(1)(i) was not applicable since reproduction by Rameshwari Photocopy Services, with the assistance of Delhi School of Economics, could not be classified as reproduction by a teacher or a pupil in the course of instruction. Additionally/alternatively the reproduction in the manner carried out by Rameshwari Photocopy Services if held falling within the ambit of Section 52(1)(i) would render Section 52(1)(h) superfluous was the contention. Meaning thereby, the plaintiffs had required the two sub-Sections to be harmonized. The plaintiffs have further pleaded that Section 52(1)(i) only covered reproduction in the course of instruction‚Äò and not in the course of preparation for instruction‚Äò as was evident from the replacement of the expression in the course of preparation for instruction‚Äò in the Bill which was tabled before the Legislature with the expression in the course of instruction‚Äò in the Act as finally promulgated upon the Bill being adopted; with modifications by the Legislature. According to the plaintiffs, reproduction by Rameshwari Photocopy Services fell within the ambit of Section 52(1)(h) and would have to be limited to two passages from works by the same author published by the same publisher during any period of five years as provided under the sub- Section.lobis.nic.in/ddir/dhc/PNJ/judgement/09-12-2016/PNJ09122016RFAOS812016.pdf Defence Rameshwari Photocopy Services contested the copyright of the plaintiffs in the books from which the course packs were prepared. Rameshwari Photocopy Services pleaded that the preparation of course packs by it amounts to fair use within the meaning of Sections 52(1)(a) and (h) of the Copyright Act, 1957. Rameshwari Photocopy Services pleaded that its activity does not affect the market for the plaintiffs‚Äô books since it charges a nominal rate for its services as fixed by the License Deed executed between the Delhi School of Economics and Rameshwari Photocopy Services. As per it, the students cannot afford to buy all the books, extracts of which were mentioned in the syllabi prepared by the Delhi School of Economics. Apart from adopting the stand taken by Rameshwari Photocopy Services, in its written statement, the University of Delhi pleaded that Section 52(1)(i) of the Copyright Act, 1957 permits students and educational institutions to copy portions from any work for research and educational purpose. The University pleaded that Rameshwari Photocopy Services has been licensed by it to operate a photocopy shop within its premises in order to facilitate photocopying by students for educational and research purpose. Denying issuing books to Rameshwari Photocopy Services for the purposes of preparation of course packs, the University pleaded that no limitation on the quantum of reproduction under Section 52(1)(i) has been provided under the Copyright Act, 1957 and because Section 52(1)(i) covers reproduction for educational purposes, unlimited photocopying would be permitted. For which argumentative pleadings reference to the limitation of two passages provided under Section 52(1)(h) was highlighted. The argument was that wherever the legislature had deemed fit, it had limited the extent of the copying which was permissible. It was argued, by way of pleading, that the term ‚Äòreproduction‚Äò used in Section 52(1)(i) was distinct from the term ‚Äòpublication‚Äò used in Section 52(1)(h), with Section 3 of the Act defining publication‚Äò as making a work available to the public‚Äò, with the term ‚Äòpublic‚Äò having a wider connotation than the term students‚Äò and therefore, Section 52(1)(h) would not be applicable to preparation of course packs to be used by students for an educational purpose. University of Delhi pleaded that the expression \\"course of instruction\\" must be interpreted expansively. Highlights of Delhi Highcourt judgement on 9 December 2016 * Judgements Point No.31:\\"...unless the legislative intent expressly excludes fair use, and especially when a person‚Äôs result of labour is being utilized by somebody else, fair use must be read into the statute...\\" * Judgements Point No.33 & 35: \\"..In the context of teaching and use of copyrighted material, the fairness in the use can be determined on the touchstone of ‚Äòextent justified by the purpose‚Äô....\\" * \\"...that the four factors on which fair use is determined in jurisdictions abroad would guide fair use of copyrighted material during course of instruction. The qualitative and quantitative test which is one of the four tests would not apply to clause (i)..\\" * Judgements Point No. 57 clarifies difference between reproduction‚Äò and ‚Äòpublication‚Äò according to this ruling, \\"...Publication need not be for the benefit of or available to or meant for reading by all the members of the community. A targeted audience would also be a public as rightly urged by learned counsel for the appellants. But, a publication would have the element of profit, which would be missing in the case of reproduction of a work by a teacher to be used in the course of instruction while imparting education to the pupils. That apart, if reproduction includes the plural, it cannot be held that making of multiple copies would be impermissible. It happens in law that footprints of one concept fall in the territory of other but that does not mean that the former should be restricted..\\" Announcement of withdrawing the suit On 9 March 2017, news papers including Hindustan Times reported that, the three publisher announced to withdraw suit against Rameshwari Photocopy service shop and not to pursue photocopy shop case further in the courts. According to news report of The Hindu, the publishers had told the division Bench that they had decided to withdraw the suit against Rameshwari Photocopy shop as they did not want to engage in a legal battle with their stakeholders ‚Äî the educational institutions. Despite main plaintifs withdrew the case, Indian Reprographic Rights Organisation (IRRO), made an attempt to move a petition in Supreme Court challenging the judgment passed by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court on 9 December 2016. Given that the original suit filed before the Delhi high court had been withdrawn by the publisher plaintiffs (OUP etc.) and the IRRO was merely an intervenor in the lower court proceedings, Supreme Court decided to not to interfere in the Highcourt order. On 3 June 2017, The Financial Times also covered an extensive story on the case illustrating data from Nielsen that despite lack of public numbers, the publishers still made considerable profitable growth in India.

It has colonised the eastern Mediterranean by Lessepsian migration through the Suez Canal. The flesh of this crab, like many other species in the family Xanthidae, is toxic. Description Atergatis roseus has a wide, smooth, oval carapace with convex almost entire, with no indication of regions and with bluntly crested anterolateral margins. The pereiopods are laterally compressed with distal crests on the upper and lower margins. The carapace is reddish brown and the legs have black tips, younger specimens are paler, more reddish orange, with a white margins to the carapace. They grow to 6 cm, measuring the carapace length from the head to the posterior. Distribution Atergatis roseus has wide Indo-Pacific distribution being found from the Red Sea and eastern Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal east along the coasts if the Indian Ocean into the Pacific as far as Fiji. In the eastern Mediterranean, A. roseus was first recorded from Israel in 1961,then from Lebanon and the southern coasts of Turkey and Syria. It reached the Aegean Sea in 2005 and had got as far as Rhodes by 2009. Biology Atergatis roseus inhabits coral reefs and rocky substrata, from the low tide mark to a depth of 30 metres. It prefers shallow reef rich areas with an abundance of places to hide, it is mainly nocturnal, slow moving and so prefers to ne near the security of a hiding place ro which it can retreat when threatened. It is omnivorous but a large part of its diet is made up of plant material, although specimens have been recorded feeding on fish. Toxicity The meat of Atergatis roseus, like that of many other crabs from the family Xanthidae is toxic. The toxins are synthesised by bacteria of the genus Vibrio which live in symbiosis with the crab and the poisons are one similar to those found in puffer fish, i.e. tetrodotoxin, and also paralytic shellfish poison.

The Elizabethan mansion was built in 1450, rebuilt in 1852 and refurbished around 1900. Throughout its history it has been a stately home and more recently a pub. The building had fallen into disrepair. New plans were brought up and a local businessman has taken over the renovation and repair work. The building has now been renovated and completed in 2019. History Llanrumney Hall in 1891 The area of Llanrumney was given to the monks at Keynsham Abbey, in Somerset, England, after the Norman conquest of England. They built a small chapel on the site of what is now Llanrumney Hall. The Elizabethan Llanrumney Hall and its estate was originally built in 1450 and is thought that it passed to the Kemys family of Cefn Mably in the mid-1500s after the dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. William Kemys left the estate to his daughter, who was married to Thomas Morgan. Llanrumney Hall has since been occupied by five generations of the Morgan family, whose ancestral home was Tredegar House in Newport. Morgan Morgan was the last in the male line and the hall and estate passed by marriage onto the Lewis family in 1726. In the mid 19th century, the hall was occupied by Edward Augustus Freeman, the Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford. It was purchased by Charles Crofts Williams of Roath Court in 1859, who was the hall's last recorded Lord of the Manor. Around 1900 the hall was refurbished. His family lived at the hall until the development of the surrounding housing estate, when it was occupied by Llewellyn Williams. In 1952 the hall was compulsorily purchased by Cardiff Council and it became a remand centre. By 1956 it became a pub, but the hall fell into disrepair by the late 1980s. A plan has been developed by Cardiff Council and CMB Engineering to redevelop the hall into an education and sporting facility at a cost of about ¬£1 million. The Llanrumney Hall Community Trust Limited was established in January 2015 in the development of the building. Listing status Many sources list Llanrumney Hall either as a Grade I or Grade II listed building. However the official listing by Cardiff Council shows Llanrumney Hall PH (Public House) as Grade II*, and that it was first listed on 19 May 1975. Myths and legends Legend has it that the hall is haunted and many children will not go near it. It is also believed that the hall contains a masonry block with the decapitated body of Llewellyn the Last. Stories also tell of how he was beheaded at the hall and chopped into small pieces and scattered around his house. A common local belief is that Sir Henry Morgan, after whom Captain Morgan rum is named, was born in the hall in 1635, but there is little evidence to substantiate this.Harry Morgan's Way: The Biography of Sir Henry Morgan, 1635‚Äì84, Dudley Pope, Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd, (1977) Morgan was born in Rhymney, near Tredegar, in the South Wales Valleys.

Nyborg is a financial economist. Since 2009, he has been a Chaired Professor of Finance at the University of Zurich, Department of Banking and Finance, where he is currently also Vice Director. In addition, he is a Senior Chair of the Swiss Finance Institute (SFI), a Research Fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Nyborg is the President of the European Finance Association for 2017 as well as a former Director and Vice President. He has worked on a broad range of topics. The focus in his more recent work is on the role of money, liquidity, and collateral in Financial markets. He has also written extensively on financial auctions and Corporate Finance. His book Collateral Frameworks: The Open Secret of Central Banks on Cambridge University Press (2017) lays bare the \\"hidden\\" workings and practices of central banks. In the book he argues that more focus should be placed on central bank collateral policy as an important and integral component of monetary policy.  Career  Nyborg holds a Ph.D., with a specialization in Finance, from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and an S.B. in Mathematics with General Honors (and Sigma Xi) from the University of Chicago. His past positions include Assistant and Associate Professor of Finance at the London Business School, visiting Associate Professor of Finance at UCLA Anderson School of Management, and visiting economist at the European Central Bank. Prior to coming to the University of Zurich, he held the DnB NOR Chair of Finance at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH). Professor Nyborg has served on the Executive Committee of the European Finance Association (EFA) since January 2013, first as a Director and, in 2016, as Vice President. He is the President of the EFA for 2017 and served as the Program Chair of the EFA‚Äôs 43rd Annual Meeting (Oslo, 2016). Nyborg has previously also held a part-time position as Academic Director of the Global Finance Academy at University College Dublin and is currently part-time Visiting Scholar in the Norwegian Central Bank (Norges Bank) and part-time Visiting Professor at BI Norwegian Business School.For the full biography see www.nyborg.ch.  Collateral Frameworks  Nyborg's latest research focuses on the role of money in financial markets and on central bank collateral frameworks which lie at the foundation of modern monetary and financial systems. He argues that \\"money matters\\" and quoting Walter Bagehot \\"money is economical power\\"Bagehot, W (1873), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, Homewood, IL: Richard D. Irwin, Inc. (reprinted in 1962 from the Scribner, Armstrong & Co. edition). states that \\"[t]he money at the core of modern economies is central bank money, what bankers call ‚Äòliquidity‚Äô. Central banks inject money into the economy, using banks as intermediaries, against collateral. So, if money is economic power and money is issued against collateral, it is important to understand the nature of this collateral, and the terms of the exchange.\\"VOX article from 24.01.2017 \\"Collateral frameworks: The open secret of central banks\\" http://voxeu.org/article/how-central-bank- collateral-frameworks-distort-economy He shows that central banks' size and importance increased substantially in the last decade and if one wants to understand how financial systems work one has to look closely into what central banks are doing. Nyborg's broader agenda is to investigate the role of money in finance. Modern macroeconomics and finance often ignore money, it is rarely modeled explicitly in the theory of banking and finance. However, Nyborg argues that money and its architecture matter and are critical for understanding financial markets and the broader economy. Taking the Eurozone as an example, Nyborg shows that the Eurosystem's collateral framework promotes illiquid and risky collateral and that it impairs market forces and discipline. In their place, we find rating agencies, government guarantees, and political forces. He argues that \\"[w]ell-functioning monetary and financial systems are important to the efficient flow of resources and private and social welfare. ... Widespread financial market interventions by central banks have made it difficult to gauge ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù market prices... This undermines the efficient allocation of resources in the economy. Improving our understanding of the workings of the monetary and financial system is therefore of central, and also urgent, importance. ... Transparency is also important vis-√†-vis the public at large.\\" ...Nyborg, K G (2017), Collateral Frameworks: The Open Secret of Central Banks, Cambridge University Press. Nyborg's work on collateral frameworks has opened up the workings of central banks and how they manage and control capital markets and the economy through their collateral policies.

Often simply known as Myreside, Watsonians RFC have used this venue on the east side of Myreside Road as their home ground for rugby union matches since 1933. Edinburgh Rugby used it for some home matches 1996‚Äì2002 an again in 2017 and 2018; this included Pro12, later Pro14 and European Rugby Challenge Cup matches. A main stand is positioned along the west side of the grass pitch, with floodlights around the ground. Ahead of the Edinburgh Rugby team's return to play home matches at the stadium, temporary stands were installed to increase seating capacity to 5,500. History One of the Myreside turnstile gates in 2007 The ground originally used by Watsonians RFC was called Myreside, which took its name from a local farm. On 4 March 1933, Watsonians played their first match at New Myreside, against Royal High School FP Rugby Club. A West stand was constructed. The Watsonian Cricket Club play at the adjacent Myreside Cricket Ground. When rugby turned professional, Edinburgh Rugby used the stadium for their home matches 1996 to 1998. That team was succeeded by the Edinburgh Reivers which played at Myreside from 1999‚Äì2002. In May 2016, Edinbugh Rugby announced a partnership with the owners of the ground, George Watson's College. The partnership allowed a trial period starting in January 2017 for Edinburgh to return to Myreside for six months, downsizing from Murrayfield Stadium. The pitch has floodlights but the facilities at the ground are ageing. The plans involved increasing the stadium capacity by erecting temporary stands at the North and South ends. Edinburgh City Council approved plans to erect temporary stands in December 2016. The temporary stands were erected as close as possible to the dead-ball lines. The capacity was increased to just above 5,500 seats in time for Edinburgh to play their first game in January 2017. In July 2017, Edinburgh set out plans that involved playing a minimum of nine home matches at Myreside for the next three seasons, subject to planning permission. Some of their fixtures, including the annual 1872 Cup clash, would be played at Murrayfield. In February 2018 Edinburgh announced that the remainder of the season's matches would be played at Murrayfield. Within a couple of weeks, the club had confirmed that Myreside would no longer be used as their home venue. Transport The ground is near several routes operated by Lothian Buses. Myreside is a 2-minute cycle from the Canal National Cycle Route 754 which runs through the West of the city.http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-754 References Rugby union stadiums in Scotland Sports venues in Edinburgh Rugby union in Edinburgh Edinburgh Rugby ","title":"Myreside Stadium"},{"id":"52949798","title":"Simone Berriau"},{"id":"52949799","title":"Wonderland (EP)"},{"id":"52949801","text":"Ewald Follmann (28 January 1926 ‚Äì 20 June 1990) was a German footballer who played for FC Nancy, Borussia Neunkirchen and the Saarland national team as a forward.

In 1983, Vivares joined Barrio S√©samo as principal puppeteer, performing the full-bodied Espinete, the most identifiable Muppet on the series.

Biography  Pasquale Verrusio was born in the Garbatella district in Rome from a small bourgeois family of employees. After abandoning his studies at the Technical Institute for Surveyors, he devoted himself to painting as a self-taught artist. In 1957, he studied figure and nude drawing at the French Academy at Villa Medici. In the same year, he met and became a student of Renato Guttuso. In 1959, his work is noted at the VIII Quadrennial Exhibition in Rome, where his works were selected by the jury and praised by the national press. In 1960 he founded the group \\"Libert√†-Realt√†\\" (Freedom-Reality) with the painters Confetti, Ganna, Guccione, Gino Guida, Quattrucci, Reggiani and Turchiaro. They proposed a new figuration which opposed the notion of abstract art as 'the only valid expression of modern artistic creation. Their only exhibition was in 1961 at the Galleria Stagni in Rome. It was a great national success, and it attracted the attention of the critic Lionello Venturi. In the same year, he was invited by the Florentine group Corrente 2 to hold his first solo exhibition. He received several awards including the \\"Premio Gennazzano\\", \\"Premio Citt√† di Marsala\\", \\"Golfo di La Spezia\\", and \\"XI Premio Biennale Italia-Austria\\" from the Republic of San Marino. In 1962, he exhibited at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, and, in the following year, having won a scholarship from the French government, he moved to Paris. Here he attended the studio of the engraver Hayter and displayed his work at the Salon de la Jeune Peinture. That same year, he had his first solo exhibition at the Galleria Don Chisciotte in Rome, presented by Dario Micacchi. On his return from Paris, he helped to introduce artists such as Arrojo, Aillaud, Tisserand and Biras in Italy. In 1963, he also participated in the completion of the copies of the Acacus rock paintings commissioned by the Pigorini Museum in Rome. In 1967, with Attardi, Caruso, Gianquinto, Guccione, Manzo, Laura Mazza and Alberto Mondadori, he founded the Galleria Il Gabbiano in Rome. In 1971, he joined the group of the Galleria Il Fante di Spade, directed by Netta Vespignani, who was representative of the Nuova Scuola Romana. In 1973, after moving to Milan at the invitation of the art dealer Mario Roncaglia, he had a period of intense critical debate and artistic exchange with Gianfranco Ferroni and Perez. Between 1965 and 1978, Verrusio exhibited frequently, both in solo and group shows. Of note are the collective exhibition at the Galleria La Nuova Pesa in Rome, and the solo exhibition of graphic arts at the Libreria Internazionale Terzo Mondo; the 16√©me and 18√®me Salon de la Jeune Peinture Paris in 1965 and 1967 respectively. Also, the exhibitions at The Macquarie Galleries in Sydney and the Roman Gallery in Chicago in 1966, the solo exhibition at the Galleria Il Gabbiano in Rome in 1968 and the Galleria la Mutina in Modena in 1969 and 1972, the XXVIII Biennale Nazionale d'Arte Citt√† di Milano in 1973‚Äì1974, the Days of Italian Culture in the U.R.S.S. in Moscow and Leningrad, and at the Galleria Margutta in Pescara in 1978. In 1983 and 1986, he had his solo exhibitions in Cairo and Stockholm respectively ‚Äì both sponsored by the Italian Cultural Institute. From 1985 to 1993, he was professor of Visual Representation Technique at the European Institute of Design in Rome. He exhibited at the Galleria La Vetrata in Rome in 1989 and 1990. In 1991 he won the 'Premio Sulmona' and in 1992 he moved to Abruzzo, where, in 1994 he founded the 'European Art Centre 'Le Morge with the painter √âteras, whom he married in 2009. In 1996, he displayed his works at the exhibition \\"La Pittura Colta in Italia\\" in Rodengo Saiano, curated by Floriano De Santi. In 2000, he was invited with √àteras to exhibit at the University of Grand Junction in Colorado, where for three months they both taught Italian fresco. In 2003, his work was commissioned for the exhibition \\"Una Storia Verosimile ‚Äì 25 Anni di Collaborazione tra Artisti Italiani e Sandro Gindro\\", organised in Rome at the Teatro Vascello. Between 2005 and 2009, he founded alongside √âteras, his artist's studio and school in Stuttgart. In 2008, he exhibited in Reggio Emilia at the \\"La Collezione Zavattini ‚Äì Unicit√† e Fantasia del Piccolo Formato\\". He died in Torino di Sangro in February 2012 after a long illness.  Style and technique  Verrusio's stylistic research follows a well-defined path: from a production focused on the lesson from Guttuso since 1957, to his own 'poetic light' where the details of reality are sublimated into a clearly articulated conceptual framework since the mid-60s. The Parisian experience led him to analyze the 'human condition' under a psychological profile. He had already started on this theme some years before, and it would accompany him throughout his artistic production. In the first half of the '60s he also experiments with different painting techniques, including materic textured painting that recall Rembrandt and Francis Bacon ‚Äì as in L'Uscita dal Metr√≤ e Composizione of 1963. In the same year, he undertook his fundamental research for a new figuration where the image is created from light; a modus operandi that characterized his entire career and of which he was a pioneer through an attentive and careful study of works by Piero della Francesca and Caravaggio. From the mid-1960s, his attention focused on the representation of mechanical objects and the waste of the consumer society; such as tubular and fences, immersed in a monotone light where the line between dignity and degradation is blurred and a sense of loneliness and anxiety pervades all. This sense of claustrophobia of the everyday is also found in the production of the first years of the 1970s. In the series of the Bocciatori and Interni , the use of cold light has a fundamental role in creating an uneasiness in the everyday situations and gestures represented, as well as in the play between solid and void. References to Vermeer's paintings have been made in relation to Verrusio's interpretation of rural life and still lifes. Here the light undergoes a tonal change to warmer colours, and normality becomes a solemn moment. Representative of these themes are the 'Still Lives with Figs and Lemons' and the portrait of Natuccio and Giovannina of 1975. The most abstract form of this poetic and pictorial approach is found in the series of the Sassi, which began almost a decade earlier during a visit to the Island of Elba. In this regard, Renzo Vespignani wrote: The lens is even smaller, and the search for an 'everything in focus' both cruel and unmoved together, burns every remaining twilight; the lens is focused and restricted as much as the conscience of the painter expands, and the object fills the canvas with no evidence of any effort. The world could be said to be reduced to a still life, but a still life ‚Äì this still life ‚Äì is elevated to the rank of absolute and pivotal phenomenon. It is a fatal mechanism that Verrusio realizes aggregating, overlapping, locking, around the same subject, the results of a more widespread observation: the pebble, smoothed by the wind from the sea, is found in every position possible, under every possible light, and is reborn countless times, totally possessed, in a succession of surfaces, curves, volumes, always the same and always different. In the 1980s, the focus shifted on the relation between the pebbles and the movement and the transparency of the water, as well as with the introduction of figures in the marine landscape. In the 1990s, a new interpretation of the coloristic and use of light by Caravaggio leads to a thematic renewal: in the Foro Romano cycle, the light becomes twilight and cites the tradition of the Scuola Romana. The representation of Vestal and monuments has metaphysical and allegorical connotations. In the early 2000s, the predominant theme is the marine and American landscape. Verrusio's latest production maintains the use of twilight, and thematically focuses on self, where he continues his careful conceptual analysis of the 'symbiosis of objective and subjective' through the exploration of the self and his illness.

The site is the largest within the Saugeen Complex, and is representative of typical habitation and mortuary practices of the Woodland period before the European discovery of the Americas, from about 200 BCE until 700 CE. It suggests that Bruce County and Huron County have been inhabited by Algonquian speakers for millennia. The Donaldson site was used primarily as a \\"seasonal harvesting station\\", mainly for fishing. Archaeology The site, discovered on the farm of Elmer Donaldson, was first documented by a collector in 1947. Four significant excavations were conducted at the site, by Thomas Lee in the 1940s and again in the 1950s, by James V. Wright in 1960, and by William Finlayson in 1971. Wright and Anderson identified a hillside midden in 1960, which was excavated by Finlayson in 1971. Among the findings by Wright of the site were 13 skeletons, grave artefacts, pottery, and the outlines of two house structures. The study team would return a \\"representative collection\\" of the objects discovered to the Bruce County Museum in 1961. The two house outlines were rectanguloid, about . Radiocarbon dating suggests the site was used from about 200 BCE to 700 CE, with primary occupation occurring early in this period. Artefacts indicate that the Middle Woodland culture at this site used bear bones. At one of the burial mounds, a child's necklace was discovered having two \\"ground and perforated bear canines\\". Pottery The pottery uncovered at the Donaldson Site, as well as that at the Thede side, displays the \\"most outstanding trend\\" of Saugeen pottery, exhibiting significant stylistic diversity. The diversity was greater than pottery assemblages in the Point Peninsula tradition, according to Wright and Anderson perhaps partly owing to the generally careless application of decorative tools rather than use of a broader set of patterns. Fishing Fish remains discovered at the site from the Middle Woodland period include bass, channel catfish, freshwater drum, lake sturgeon, pickerel, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch. The most important of these was lake sturgeon. It is likely that spearfishing was the primary means of catching fish, as eight harpoon heads (two bone and six toggle-head) were found at the site, and there was a \\"near absence\\" of sinkers (two end-notched sinkers, one side-notched sinker, and one copper gorge, a type of primitive fishing hook) indicating that fishing nets were not commonly used. Sinkers and copper hooks were found at the Inverhuron-Lucas site, about south. According to Finlayson, this suggests that there was spring spearfishing in the Saugeen rapids during spawning season, and in the summer small groups would fish with nets and hooks at shore sites. In particular, it was used in early spring to harvest northern pike, pickerel, and white sucker; in the late spring to harvest smallmouth bass and stone cat; in July to harvest freshwater drum, and possibly as late as November to harvest lake whitefish and lake trout, though the latter interpretation \\"should be considered tentative\\". Angling was probably not an important fishing technique at the Donaldson Site. Description The site is located on the north shore of the Saugeen River in the valley northeast of Southampton in Bruce County. It is at the \\"first major rapids upstream\\" from Lake Huron, on three fluvial terraces, approximately from the lake. It was a settlement occupied by multiple bands of indigenous peoples, who arrived in the spring to catch the fish that had come to spawn in the river. The corpses of band members who had died elsewhere during the previous year were brought to this site for burial. In addition to the burial mounds, the site contains the remains of middens, post holes, hearth pits, and \\"identifiable rectangular structures\\". The hearth pits were located on the upper and middle terraces. The middens contained a significant number of ceramic, stone, metal, and bone artefacts. National Historic Site The archaeological site was designated a federal National Historic Site on 12 June 1982, and was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places on 27 March 2013.

This lordship is considered a feudal barony, making Robert the first baron of Belvoir. Besides the lands around Belvoir, Robert also received lands in Yorkshire and Leicestershire. These lands had been held prior to the Conquest by Thorgautr Lagr, and others. Robert's son Berengar was given Thorgautr's lands in Oxfordshire and Nottinghamshire, which he may have held from his father.Fleming Kings & Lords p. 167 and footnote120 Robert also had lands in Northamptonshire, located south of Rockingham.

The custom is observed in the Oriental Orthodox (Jacobite and Indian Orthodox) and Eastern Catholic (Syro-Malabar and Syro Malankara Catholic) churches in Kerala. Believers participate in fasting and praying for the eight days. During this time churches celebrate the feast in remembrance of the birth of St. Mary (Nativity of Mary) and the eight days of lent is rigorously observed from the 1st day to 8th day of September with charitable activities, evangelical conventions and special prayers to honor St. Mary. Praying the rosary in groups is an important custom during these days. The eight days of lent is not a canonical one for the Church but is observed by the Syrian Christians of India and also in Arabian countries.  Origin stories  It appears that this practice originated in connection with the Islamic invasion and the subsequent fall of Kodungallur, a Christian centre in Kerala.Fasting and abstinence in the Malankara Orthodox Syrian tradition, The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church There are different versions about the origin of the lent. The narration by Bar Ebroyo In the seventh century, there was a town called Heera near Basra, which was predominantly a Christian township. The Caliph of Baghdad captured this town and appointed a fanatic Muslim governor, who implemented the caliph's every dictum with fervor. The caliph was known to be cruel and had a weakness for beautiful women. He was enamored by the beauty and charm of the women of Heera and decided to reach there in three days. The chastity and modesty of the women of Heera were at stake. They sought refuge in the church of St. Mary. The priest declared an uncompromising lent for three days invoking the intercession of mother Mary. On the 3rd day, in the middle of the Holy Qurbana, a golden beam of light flashed down from above, then spread to illuminate the whole church. It is said that the priest had a vision of Mother Mary and also heard her saying, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid; peace be to you ‚Äì Rejoice. The Caliph is no more. Tribulations are over‚Äù. The priest then turned to the people and they could see an aura around the priests face as he relayed the message. The whole congregation praised the Lord and thanked Mary for her intercessory prayers.Karippayil, Joseph. \\"History Behind the Beginning of the 8-day Lent (Ettunombu) in September\\", Vision, 2004 The women then decided to observe a lent for eight days (i.e. from the 1st to the 8th of September in commemoration of this event). They believed that Mother Mary helped safeguard their chastity, modesty and dignity. Establishment at Kerala By the 3rd century St. David (an Episcoppa) came to India from Basra and evangelized people. This was followed by the Knanaya Migration from ≈ûanlƒ±urfa in the 4th century. Iraqi migrants of the 8th century further spread this tradition. As it is not a canonical event of the Church calendar its popularity is somewhat limited. St. Mary's Cathedral, Manarcaud, under the jurisdiction of the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church, is believed to be the first church to have reestablished the lent in a wide manner. It remains the largest church where the 8-Day lent is a popular tradition. The stone inscriptions found at the church reveal that the church was built more than a thousand years ago. Archeologists have found out that these stone inscriptions were memorial stones set up at the tombs in 910 A.D. and 920 A.D. The writing on them are in Malayalam and Tamil scripts prevalent 600 years ago. St. Mary's Church, Meenangadi is the first church to adopt the 8 day lent in the Malabar region. Many churches in the name of St. Mary have subsequently begun recognition of the 8 day lent. The Holy Girdle is taken out for the public at the eighth day.

Life and career Singer was born in Munich and studied medicine at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU Munich) from 1965 onwards (as a scholarship holder of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation) and 1965/66 two semesters at the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1968, he received his Ph.D. from Ludwig Maximilian University with his doctoral thesis on \\"The role of telencephalic commissures in bilateral EEG-synchrony.\\" His doctoral supervisor was Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt of the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry. During his advanced training in neurophysiology, he spent a year at the University of Sussex in England. In 1970 he received his medical licence as a physician while working as a doctor at the University Hospital Munich. In 1975, he habilitated in Physiology at the Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Munich. In 1981, he was appointed a member of the Max Planck Society and Director of the Department of Neurophysiology at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main. Here, together with Walter Greiner and Horst St√∂cker, he founded the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS) as well as the Brain Imaging Center (BIC) in 2004 and the Ernst Str√ºngmann Science Forum and the Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute (ESI). He is an honorary professor of physiology at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Since 2011 he has the status of an emeritus and as such continues to operate the \\"Singer-Emeritus-Department\\" at MPI Frankfurt.Curriculum Vitae MPI Brain Research. Wolf Singer is the father of brain researcher and cognitive scientist Tania Singer. Work The aim of the work of his neurophysiological department is to elucidate the neuronal processes in the case of so-called higher cognitive performance, such as in the case of visual perception, in memory, or in other ways of cognition. In his institute, among other things, the emergence of visual disorder amblyopia is also being studied. In the neurophysiological research community, Singer is internationally known for his research and reflections on the physiological basis of attention and identification procedures. The institute, with its technically elaborate experiments, is primarily concerned with the binding problem, where the question is at the center of how different sensory aspects of an object - form, color, hardness, weight, smell, etc. - can be combined into a single object experience. The theory is based, among others, on the works by Christoph von der Malsburg. It attaches great importance to the temporal synchronicity of neuronal activity in the cortex. Corresponding oscillator frequencies of the nerve cells would then refer to the same object, while other frequencies would mark other objects. Singer represents a naturalistic interpretation of neurophysiological data and strives to make the results of brain research known to the public. Singer is a board member of the Mind & Life Institute. Free will and guilt Singer, like Gerhard Roth, became the focus of public discussions in Germany through interviews, lectures and popular science essays regarding the consequences of neurological research to political and juridical, psychological and developmental psychology, pedagogical or anthropological, as well as architectural or urban questions and even to historical and philosophical views. His thesis on the free will was particularly controversial. Singer declined to speak of a free will. This he expressed publicly in an article published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in 2004, whose subtitling he made in the slightly modified formulation ‚ÄûBrain structures determine us: We should stop talking about free will‚Äú as the main title of the reprinting of an extensive scientific contribution to the discussion \\"Brain as a Subject? (Part I)\\" in the German Journal of Philosophy. Singer argues that the natural scientific causal model, according to which the world is to be viewed as a closed deterministic whole, excludes freedom. Proponents of the concept of freedom as Peter Bieri argue, however, that the notion of freedom of will is only under certain conditions contrary to determinism and that these assumptions need not to be accepted. Singer also demands that the lack of free will must have consequences for our conceptions of guilt and punishment: if no one can decide freely from a scientific point of view, it is not useful to make people responsible for their actions. Socially intolerable persons would have to be \\"locked away\\" and \\"subjected to specific educational programs\\". Wolf Singer and biologist Gerhard Roth were co-authors of The Manifesto, a declaration of eleven leading neuroscientists on the present and future of brain research, published in the magazine Gehirn & Geist. Honors and awards Singer received many honors for his scientific work, including the Ernst Jung Prize for Science and Research, the Neuronal Plasticity Prize, the Z√ºlch Prize, the Max Planck Prize for Public Relations, the Hessian Cultural Prize, the Communicator Prize of the Stifterverband f√ºr die Deutsche Wissenschaft, honorary doctorates of the Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg and the Rutgers University, New Jersey, the K√∂rber European Science Prize and the Medaille de la Ville de Paris.

He was also honored in France becoming a knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honour (Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur).

It is situated in the city of Novocherkassk, Rostov Oblast, Russia.  History  In 1805, after the foundation of Assumption Cathedral in Novocherkassk, a place in the city was consecrated by the Bishop of Voronezh and Cherkasy Arseny for construction of the new Alexander Nevsky's Church. Over time, the place for the construction of the temple was changed and consecrated again by priest Vasily Rubashkin. Initially the church was built of wood on architect Lavopier project. On June 29, 1810 Aarchpriest Alexey Oridovsky sanctified this wooden church in the name of St. Alexander Nevsky. In 1822, to the church was attached a chapel in the name of St. Great Martyr Paraskeva, consecrated on October 26 of the same year by archpriest Jacob Merhalev. In 1827 ataman D.E. Kuteynikov proposed to build in Novocherkassk a stone church instead of the wooden church of Alexander Nevsky. This proposal was approved by clergy, and the plan and cost estimate were drawn. they were also approved in 1829 by Emperor Nicholas I, who ordered to start the construction of stone Alexander Nevsky's Church. The bell tower was constructed in 1834. In 1835 the church itself was rebuilt: the stone foundations were laid and an altar was also established. In 1866, the wooden roof of the church was replaced with that is of iron. Yet the start of construction works of brand new stone church was delayed. In 1889, the new project of the church was drafted. It was approved by the cossack ataman Prince Nikolay Svyatopolk-Mirsky. The project also received the blessing of Archbishop Makarios. Works on the construction of the new church had been carried out since 1891. In 1893, the church was constructed in the rough. In the summer of 1894 a cross was installed on the main dome. Churchwarden Abramov ordered in Moscow a marble iconostasis at his own expense, for the price 22 thousand Rubles. In the summer of 1896 the iconostasis was installed. Right aisle of the church was consecrated in honor of St. Great Martyr Paraskeva with the blessing of Archbishop Athanasius. In 1899 the church was painted in oil and covered with wall paintings. Alexander Nevsky's Church was built in neo-Byzantine style. It could accommodate up to 1,500 people. After the Civil War Alexander Nevsky Church was closed. During the German occupation of the city in World War II the temple had been opened, but then closed again in 1960. In the mid 1970s in the building of the church started \\"restoration works\\" to create a planetarium in it. In the 1990s the church was opened again. On 12 March 1995 a new bell was installed there.  Sources  * ¬´–î–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è –°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞¬ª, –≤—ã–ø. 2-–π, 1909 –≥., —Å—Ç—Ä. 31.

Background Following Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr.'s comeback win against Dominik Britsch in December 2016, he claimed he was back and ready to fight Golovkin at 168 pounds and √Ålvarez at a 164 catchweight. Negotiations began soon after for a potential HBO PPV fight to take place between Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and Canelo √Ålvarez in 2017 on the Cinco de Mayo weekend, as there was interest from both sides that a fight take place. Golden Boy president Eric Gomez confirmed a catchweight of 165 lbs was agreed between both sides. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman was on board and said it was a \\"very attractive fight.\\" and would likely get his organization involved in the fight. Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Sr. spoke on December 18 about the ongoing negotiations saying Golden Boy were offering his son a small amount for the potential big ppv fight. He went on to claim his son was offered a $5m purse with no mention he would get a cut of the ppv revenue, a counter offer was submitted. A rematch clause was also discussed, which Chavez Jr. and his team had no problem with. Ch√°vez Sr. went on to admit that he was fully aware √Ålvarez is the A-side in the fight, and would settle for no less than 30-35% of the full revenue. On December 24, √Ålvarez and his team gave Chavez a week to accept the terms, which included a purse of $7m, or he would consider other options. On January 12, 2017 De La Hoya and √Ålvarez called for the contract to be signed, which was supposedly sent to Al Haymon, who advises Chavez Jr. and urged him to sign it. A day later, Chavez Jr. claimed he had agreed all the demands set by √Ålvarez and was said that he would sign the contract. According to Chavez Jr. the new demands included a weight limit set at 164.5 pounds and a $6 million base purse plus PPV revenue percentages. On January 13, √Ålvarez officially confirmed the fight to take place on May 6, 2017. A rematch clause was also put in place if Chavez Jr. wins the fight and another clause for every pound Chavez Jr. weighs over the limit, he would be fined $1 million.  Fight  In front of a sold-out crowd of 20,510, √Ålvarez won the fight by a shutout unanimous decision in dominating fashion. All three judges scored it 120-108 for √Ålvarez. Ch√°vez was very cautious throughout the fight. At times, he came forward and also had √Ålvarez against the ropes, but failed to throw any punches. This led to jeers from the crowd in the later rounds due to lack of action.  Post fight  √Ålvarez spoke to HBO's Max Kellerman in the post fight interview, speaking of his fighting style, \\"Tonight, I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things. I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn't do it. I've shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings, I've shown I can showcase myself.\\" CompuBox Stats showed that √Ålvarez landed 228 of 604 his punches thrown (38%) and Ch√°vez landed 71 of 302 (24%). By the end of round 5, √Ålvarez landed 102 punches compared to Ch√°vez's 25 landed. Early figures revealed that the fight generated at least 1 million buys. A replay was shown on regular HBO a week later and drew an average of 769,000 viewers. This was the first boxing match to generate over 1 million PPV buys that didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya since 2002, which saw Lennox Lewis retain his heavyweight world titles against Mike Tyson. Later sources confirmed the fight did close to 1.2 million buys, which means it would have generated around $80 million.

It was the first and only member of SNCF's first class of 4-6-4 or Hudson type of locomotives.  Origins  The locomotive was ordered by on 9 March 1936 by the Chemins de fer du Nord in an attempt to improve on the power output and fuel consumption of the conventional steam locomotive. The project involved three of the French big- four locomotive manufacturers: Soci√©t√© alsacienne de constructions m√©chaniques (SACM); Fives-Lille; and Schneider et Cie. It also received assistance from the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) of Winterthur.  Description  It was decided to fit the locomotive with a high-pressure boiler and multiple small steam motors to drive each axle The boiler was in two parts: the main, rear part, was a water tube boiler pressed to (a conventional boiler was limited to ). The forward part was a conventional fire-tube boiler pressed to and served as a feed-water heater. There were six, three-cylinder, steam motors, which were attached, two per axle, to the driving axles by gearing. They had a maximum rotational speed of 1000 rpm, which would give the locomotive a theoretical maximum speed of . The small motors were less bulky, had a higher power-weight ratio and were more efficient. Their use eliminated the need for a crank axle, and enable the use of small diameter driving wheels of , and shortened the length of the locomotive The Direction du Mat√©riel et de la Traction (service MT) (Rolling Stock and Traction Department) believed that the small motors could easily be disconnected and would not immobilise the locomotive. Due to the absence of connecting rods, the locomotive had outside frames and an integral fairing.  Service history  The locomotive left the Graffenstaden works of SACM in the early days of 1939 and testing started immediately. However, the outbreak of World War II quickly interrupted these tests; the locomotive was sent to workshops at Oullins where it went into storage. The tests resumed in 1943, and after a presentation at the Oullins Workshops in 1946 and a series of measurements taken on the Vitry-sur- Seine test plant in 1947, the locomotive went back into store. Placed awaiting authorisation for retirement in 1948, it was finally withdrawn in 1949.  Conclusion  The design had to answer the desire to increase the efficiency or reduce the consumption for the same power. However, the delay caused by the World War II, the fact that the boiler was more complex, and the difficulty of maintaining the main boiler at very high pressure made the gains obtained, viz., fuel economy in the order of 30%, meant that the design had no impact on future steam locomotives.  Tender  The tender which was attached to the locomotive was one of the bogie tenders of type 36.B which held of water and of coal (in this case 36.B.9).

In 1961, construction began on what was then known as The Post Office Tower, with Bedford as Chief Architect and G R Yeats, senior architect in charge. Completed in 1961, with a height of 177 metres (581 ft), it became London's tallest building. Born in Yorkshire, and trained as an architect in the Midlands, Bedford joined the Ministry of Public Building and Works in 1936. In 1951, he was appointed the Ministry's youngest ever Chief Architect. Shortly after, Bedford had an important role in the design of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, for which he was subsequently made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. Bedford retired in 1970 and lived abroad for some years before dying in 2001. As the architect responsible for one of London's most iconic buildings, Bedford achieved surprisingly little recognition in his lifetime, or afterwards, his obituary in The New York Times describing him as; \\"the British government's anonymous chief architect, whose works were visible to millions but whose name was scarcely known\\". Life Bedford was born on 29 August 1909 near Halifax in Yorkshire. He was educated at Thornton Grammar School and then undertook an architectural apprenticeship in Leicester. In 1934 he won a RIBA medal for his design for a railway terminal. Two years later, he joined the Ministry of Public Building and Works and, after the Second World War, was appointed its youngest ever Chief Architect. At the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, Bedford had responsibility for significant elements of the overall design, including the Coronation Arches. Given its importance to government communications, the BT Tower was designed to withstand nuclear attack, and in 1971 it was relatively undamaged by an bomb placed in the tower's revolving restaurant by the Angry Brigade. Bedford's comment was recorded as; \\"I made it to last, bombers or not\\". In addition to the tower, Bedford oversaw or undertook a number of other important governmental commissions; both within the UK, including the departmental buildings on Marsham Street, Westminster and offices for MPs within the Palace of Westminster; and overseas including embassy buildings in Warsaw, Washington, D.C. and Jakarta. After retiring to France to be near his daughter, he returned to England following the death of his wife in 1977. He lived for many years in the village of Hanley Swan near Malvern, Worcestershire.

History Mudaliyar Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena photographed 22 December 1919 The building was constructed by a local landowner and philanthropist, Padikara Mudali Nanayakkara Rajawasala Appuhamilage Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena (12 November 1889 - 8 July 1947). Srirwardena studied in Britain and on completion of his studies he was bestowed the position of Mudaliyar by the King, returning to Ceylon to take up the position. The mansion was built based on a similar plan of a castle in India, which was owned by Srirwardena's schoolmates, Raja Rajeswara Sethupathi, the Raja of Ramnad. Sriwardena had requested a copy of the building plans from the Sethupathi, but was refused with the advice the Ceylonese were not capable of undertaking such a large construction project. This inspired Sriwardena to visit the Raja with two local architects, who secretly drew plans of the castle. Richmond Castle is a two-storey building with sixteen rooms, 99 doors and 34 windows. All essential supplies for the building were sourced from abroad, including floor titles from Italy, teak from Burma (used to construct the main staircase), window panes, decorated with glass depicting grape vines, from Scotland, and an iron stair and bathroom fittings from England. Srirwardena moved into Richmond Castle upon his marriage to Clarice Matilda Maude Suriyabandara in 1910. The marriage took place in St. Mary's Church, Kalamulla. The couple spent 32 years together however they were unable to have children. Srirwenda bequeathed his properties to the Public Trustee, with the request that the castle was converted to a children's home. Srirwardena died on 8 July 1947 and from 1956 the Richmond Castle has been taken care by the Public Trustee Department of Sri Lanka.

History All Saints‚Äô Church was adopted as the village church after the dissolution of the monasteries. It was formerly Bradbourne Priory. By 1627 the church at Bradbourne was in need of serious repairs, with a greatly decayed roof and decaying timbers, lead, windows and bells, all estimated as costing around ¬£46 () to repair or replace (almost 3 years' average craftsman's wages). On 10 February 1629, Thomas Buxton and Vincent Sexton, churchwardens of Bradbourne, took a suit to the Chancery against William Cokayne, Valentine Jackson and four others living at the nearby village of Atlow, declaring it an ancient custom for all the parishioners of Atlow to pay for the repair of the parish church at Bradbourne, but that they had not been paying it. The following year the court decided that the inhabitants of Atlow were to pay annually 5s. 6d. per oxgang (15 acres) to Bradbourne for repairs; but they were not to be charged for any previous arrears. In the restoration of 1876‚Äì77 the nave wall on the north side was in danger of falling outwards and it was repaired largely with Bath stone. A new organ chamber was built out. The chancel was re-fitted and furnished with a stone reredos, inlaid with encaustic slabs with scriptural scenes. The chancel floor was re-laid with Minton tiles. Jones and Willis of Birmingham supplied the lectern, lamp-standards and altar cloths. The alterations were overseen by the architect, Robinson of Derby. The church was restored in 1906‚Äì09. The south aisle, chancel and parts of the tower were underpinned. the aisle walls and gable of the porch was rebuilt. A new oak roof covered with lead was placed on the south aisle, and a new roof on the porch was covered with slates. A new pulpit was presented, and the sanctuary was paved with Hopton stone and Derbyshire marble from the Ashford Dale Quarry which was opened especially for this work. The cost of the restoration amounted to ¬£1,100 () and was supervised by the architects Naylor and Sale of Derby.

In 1877 this organ was moved into a new organ chamber. This Rushworth instrument was replaced by an organ installed by Albert Keates of Sheffield at a cost of ¬£300 () in 1893.

The following is a list of characters introduced in 2017, by order of first appearance. All characters are introduced by series producer Kate Oates. The first notable character that appeared was the stillborn son of Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), Ruairi, in January. Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles) first appeared in February as a love interest for Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and left the series in May. She was followed by Trina Robson (Kerry Bennett), a drug dealer, who appeared in four episodes. The final character to join in February was Oliver Battersby, Steve and Leanne Battersby's (Jane Danson) baby son. Neil Clifton (Ben Cartwright) arrived in March as an acquaintance of Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) who became involved in Bethany Platt's (Lucy Fallon) grooming and sexual exploitation storyline. Sally Metcalfe's (Sally Dynevor) online stalker, Leah Buckley (Molly McGlynn), arrived in April, which tied in with the return of Sally's sister, Gina Seddon (Connie Hyde). Pat Phelan's (Connor McIntyre) biological daughter Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp) arrived in June, alongside Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman), who is taken in by Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) and Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank). Moira Pollock (Louiza Patikas), the manager of the Medical Centre and Liz McDonald's (Beverley Callard) new boss, arrived in July. Mary Taylor's (Patti Clare) long-lost son Jude Appleton (Paddy Wallace) moved to Weatherfield in August, bringing his wife, Angie (Victoria Ekanoye), and their baby son, George (Romeo Cheetham-Karcz). In September, Colin Callen (Jim Moir) made his first appearance. In October, Seb's drug-addicted mother, Abi, played by former Shameless actress Sally Carman, first appeared. November introduced Rana Nazir's (Bhavna Limbachia) brother Imran Habeeb (Charlie de Melo), as well as Henry Newton (George Banks), a new love interest for Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell). Ruairi McDonald Ruairi McDonald is the son of Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Ruairi is born prematurely at 23 weeks and dies when he is born. Steve and Michelle are further devastated that Ruairi will not be given a birth or death certificate, as he was born before 24 weeks. Michelle and Steve's marriage is strained and Michelle kicks Steve out when she thinks he does not care about his dead son. However, Michelle allows him back after talking to Steve's mother Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard), who also lost a premature child, Katie, 25 years before. Steve blames himself for Ruairi's death, thinking it is punishment for getting Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) pregnant six months earlier. Michelle contemplates suicide, unable to cope with life without Ruairi, but is talked out of it by Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). In December 2016, it was announced that the show would tackle the subject of late miscarriage and Michelle and Steve would lose their unborn child. Marsh, who lost her own child at a similar stage in her pregnancy, said \\"I thought long and hard before agreeing to take on the challenge of this storyline. It is obviously a cause very close to my heart having lost my beautiful Archie at 21 weeks and 5 days. I discussed it with my family and friends, all of who were very supportive. In the end I felt it was an important story to tell in order to raise awareness of something which affects thousands of women every year. I have had to go to some very dark places in my mind whilst filming these heartbreaking scenes but my family, friends and colleagues have been incredible.\\" She added that revisiting feelings in character was \\"challenging\\". Producer Kate Oates added ‚ÄúThe subject of miscarriage will always be sensitive; but telling this story with Simon and Kym at the centre would always have an extra poignancy\\" and hoped they \\"are able to encourage discussion, understanding and compassion for those viewers affected by the loss of a baby. The cast were in safe hands with our amazing and empathetic director Tony Prescott, and it has been humbling to see all the actors involved being so selfless and generous in their performances\\". Chloe Tipton Chloe Tipton, played by Jo-Anne Knowles, made her first on- screen appearance on 1 February 2017, before departing on 15 May 2017. Chloe is a glamorous woman who orders a taxi from Street Cars and finds herself being driven by Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), who has just fallen out with his girlfriend Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor). Chloe witnesses Peter and Toyah arguing outside the cab office and when they arrive at her hotel, Chloe asks Peter if he is going back to reconcile with Toyah. Chloe is clearly attracted to Peter and asks to join her for a drink in the hotel. They talk in the bar, where she tells him that she is impulsive and he seems interesting to her. Telling her that he has a family conference to go back to, Peter makes his excuses to leave. Chloe asks him to stay with her, but he refuses and she gives him a generous tip, making it clear that she is unhappy to see him go. A week later, Chloe calls into the cab office and specially requests Peter as her driver to collect her from a dinnertime drinks appointment with a friend, telling him that she would pay him for his extra time and that her divorce would shortly be coming through. Chloe later deliberately bumps into Peter crying, and tells him that her ex-boyfriend has been following her. He takes her home, where there is obvious sexual tension, however Peter leaves, forgetting his mobile phone. He then returns to Chloe's house to return it, where they kiss, however Peter leaves immediately after. It is then revealed that Chloe has downloaded a tracking app on Peter's phone so she can observe his every move. After previously telling her that he is interested in purchasing the local pub The Rovers Return Inn, Chloe unexpectedly arrives and fakes showing an interest in buying the pub, where Peter is unnerved that Toyah may see her. Peter then threatens Chloe in the ginnel, ordering her to leave him and Toyah alone. However, they have been spotted by Peter's father Ken Barlow (William Roache), who takes Chloe inside and she lies to him that she and Peter are having an affair, so Ken informs Toyah of this, leading to her temporarily moving out. The following night, Peter is close to turning back to alcohol after battling alcoholism previously and declares that Ken is at the heart of all his problems. Later that night, Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant, with Peter and other members of his family being listed as suspects. After Peter's son Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) finds a voice message on his phone of Peter apologising and sounding frantic on the night that Ken was pushed down the stairs, everybody automatically assumes that he is behind Ken's attack. However, Peter tells Simon, Toyah and the rest of his family that he was visiting Chloe at the time that Ken was attacked, however her obsessive behaviour became violent and he pushed her away in self- defence, but she fell and cut her face, and threatened to lie to the police that he punched her. Peter then visits Chloe and pleads that she tell the police the truth, but instead she informs DS MacKinnon (Sandra Huggett) that Peter assaulted her in her own home as a result of their affair, and that this took place the day before Ken's attack, making him prime suspect in the investigation. Peter is later arrested and charged with assaulting Chloe and placed further in the frame for Ken's attack, which adds pressure to his relationship with Toyah.

Leanne subsequently pays Chloe a visit, threatening her to drop the charges, however Toyah later turns up to achieve the same purpose. Chloe is exceptionally rude towards Leanne and Toyah, and initially refuses to drop the charges against Peter, however Toyah and Leanne threaten to tell the police that Chloe attacked Toyah by throwing her to the floor, with Leanne offering to provide Toyah with bruises to reinforce their case. Chloe reluctantly agrees to drop the charges, however she states that Peter could still easily have returned to Weatherfield and pushed Ken down the stairs, which stuns Leanne and Toyah.

This technology is applicable to a wide range of video processing problems such as video optimization, real-time motion video compression, subjective quality monitoring, and format conversion.  Decorrelated transform space Pixel distributions are well-modeled as stochastic process, and an alteration to their ideal decorrelated representation is accomplished by the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve transform (KLT) defined by the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve theorem. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is often used as a technologically apt alteration that closely estimates KLT for video data due to the strong correlation in pixel space similar to video frames. As the connection in time is just as high as that of the space, a three-dimensional DCT may be used to decorrelate motion video  Human visual model A Human Visual Model may be formulated based on the contrast sensitivity of the visual perception system. A time-varying Contrast Sensitivity model may be specified, and is applicable to the three-dimensional Discrete cosine transform (DCT). A three-dimensional Contrast Sensitivity model is used to generate quantizers for each of the three-dimensional basis vectors, resulting in a near-optimal visually lossless removal of imperceptible motion video artifacts  Perceptual strength in visibels The perceptual strength of the guman visual model quantizer generation process is calibrated in visiBels (vB), a logarithmic scale roughly corresponding to clarity of the visual as measured in screen heights. As the eye moves further from the screen, it becomes less able to perceive details in the image. The ZPEG model also includes a temporal component, and thus is not fully described by viewing distance. In terms of viewing distance, the visiBel strength increases by six as the screen distance halves. The standard viewing distance for Standard Definition television (about 7 screen heights) is defined as 0vB. The normal viewing distance for High-definition video, about 4 screen heights, would be defined as about ‚àí6 vB (3.5 screen heights).  Video optimization The ZPEG pre-processor optimizes motion video sequences for compression by existing motion estimation-based video compressors, such as Advanced Video Coding (AVC) (H.264) and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) (H.265). The human visual acuity model is converted into quantizers for direct application to a three-dimensional transformed block of the motion video sequence, followed by an inverse quantization (signal processing) step by the same quantizers. The motion video sequence returned from this process is then used as input to the existing compressor.  Compression boost strength The application of Human Visual System-generated quantizers to a block-based Discrete Cosine Transform results in increased compressability of a motion video stream by removing imperceptible content from the stream. The result is a curated stream that has removed detailed spatial and temporal details that the compressor would otherwise be required to reproduce. The stream also produces better matches for motion estimation algorithms. The quantizers are generated to be imperceptible at a specified viewing distance, specified in visiBels. Typical pre-processing viewing conditions in common use are: * Standard Definition video is processed at ‚àí6 vB * High-definition video is processed at ‚àí12 vB * Ultra-High Definition video (UHD, 4K) is processed at ‚àí12 vB * Immersive Ultra-High Definition video (Virtual Reality) is processed at ‚àí18 vB Average compression savings for 6Mbs HD video using the x.264 codec when processed at ‚àí12vB is 21.88%. Average compression savings for 16Mbs Netflix 4K test suite video using the x.264 codec processed at ‚àí12 vB is 29.81%. The same Netflix test suite when compressed for immersive viewing (‚àí18vB) generates a 25.72% savings. These results are reproducible through use of a publicly-accessible test bed  Deblocking While the effects of ZPEG pre-processing are negligible to the average viewer at the specified viewing distance, edge effects introduced by block-based transform processing still affect the performance advantage of the video optimization process. While existing deblocking filters may be applied to improve this performance, optimal results are obtained through use of a multi-plane deblocking algorithm. Each plane is offset by one-half the block size in each of four directions, such that the offset of the plane is one of (0,0), (0,4), (4, 0), and (4,4) in the case of 8x8 blocks and four planes. Pixels values are then chosen according to their distance to the block edge, with interior pixel values being preferred to boundary pixel values. The resulting deblocked video generates substantially better optimization over a wide range of pre- processing strengths.  Real-time video compression Conventional motion compression solutions are based on motion estimation technology. While some transform-domain video codec technologies exist, ZPEG is based on the three- dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), where the three dimensions are pixel within line, line within frame, and temporal sequence of frames. The extraction of redundant visual data is performed by the computationally- efficient process of quantization of the transform-domain representation of the video, rather than the far more computationally expensive process of searching for object matches between blocks. Quantizer values are derived by applying a Human Visual Model to the basis set of DCT coefficients at a pre- determined perceptual processing strength. All perceptually redundant information is thereby removed from the transform domain representation of the video. Compression is then performed by an entropy removal process.  Quantization Once the viewing conditions has been chosen under which the compressed content is to be viewed, a Human Visual Model generates quantizers for application to the three-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). These quantizers are tuned to remove all imperceptible content from the motion video stream, greatly reducing the entropy of the representation. The viewing conditions expressed in visiBels and the correlation of pixels before transformation are generated for reference by the entropy encoding.  Context-driven entropy coding While quantized DCT coefficients have traditionally be modeled as Laplace distributions, more recent work has suggested the Cauchy distribution better models the quantized coefficient distributions. The ZPEG entropy encoder encodes quantized three-dimensional DCT values according to a distribution that is completely characterized by the quantization matrix and the pixel correlations. This side-band information carried in the compressed stream enables the decoder to synchronize its internal state to the encoder  Subband decomposition Each DCT band is separately entropy coded to all other bands. These coefficients are transmitted in band-wise order, starting with the DC component, followed by the successive bands in order of low resolution to high, similar to Wavelet packet decomposition. Following this convention assures that the receiver will always receive the maximum possible resolution for any bandpass pipe, enabling a no-buffering transmission protocol.  Subjective quality metrics The gold measure of perceived quality difference between a reference video and its degraded representation is defined in ITU-R recommendation BT-500. The double- stimulus continuous quality-scale (DSCQS) method rates the perceived difference between the reference and distorted videos to create an overall difference score derived from individual scores ranging from ‚àí3 to 3: * -3: impaired video is much worse * -2: impaired video is worse * -1: impaired video is slightly worse * 0: Videos are the same * 1: impaired video is slightly better * 2: impaired video is better * 3: impaired video is much better In an analogy to the single-stimulus continuous quality-scale (SSCQS) normalized metric Mean Opinion Score (MOS), the overall DSCQS score is normalized to the range (‚àí100, 100) and is termed the Differential Mean Opinion Score (DMOS), a measure of subjective video quality. An ideal objective measure will correlate strongly to the DMOS score when applied to a reference/impaired video pair. A survey of existing techniques and their overall merits may be found on the Netflix blog. ZPEG extends the list of available techniques by providing a subjective quality metric generated by comparing the Mean Squared Error metric of the difference between the reference and impaired videos after pre-processing at various perceptual strengths (in visiBels). The effective viewing distance at which the impairment difference is no longer perceivable is reported as the impairment metric.  Format conversion Statistically ideal format conversion is done by interpolation of video content in Discrete Cosine Transform space. The conversion process, particularly in the case of up-sampling, must consider the ringing artifacts that occur when abrupt continuities take place in a sequence of pixels being re-sampled. The resulting algorithm can down-sample or up- sample video formats by changing the frame dimensions, pixel aspect ratio, and frame rate.
